			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Germany Since the Bundesbank looks likely to overshoot its money supply target for the third time in a row in 1993, it will doubtless take care to ensure that next year's target - to be announced on Thursday - is one it can actually achieve. That argues for at most a marginal tightening of the existing 4.5 to 6.5 per cent range, even though inflation has slowed and a fall in investment has limited the economy's productive potential. The Bundesbank has some room to juggle the numbers which go into the target. It is unlikely to deviate from its medium-term inflation target of 2 per cent, but enjoys discretion in the extent to which it allows for a slowdown in velocity. Bonds might rally but the equity market would almost certainly react badly if the bank decided to shave more than half a point off the target range. A cut of up to that amount would do little to alter the pace of interest rate cuts. At least the bank should find it easier to control M3 next year. There should be no repeat of this year's ERM crises, while lower short-term interest rates should encourage investors to move further out along the yield curve. But being within the target may not in itself mean much. There have been seven years since 1985 in which the aggregate overshot. In four of them, the bank cut official rates just the same.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani has stressed the continued  support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the oppressed people  of Afghanistan. He said: The only way to salvage and  reconstruct Afghanistan is to revive the spirit of selflessness  and sacrifice, and to encourage the jehadi groups to unite  around the axis of Islam.    Addressing the participants in today's session of the third  assembly of poetry on Islamic revolution in Afghanistan, the  president referred to 14 years of jehad and struggle by the  Afghan people against the occupiers, and their eventual victory  over one of the world's largest powers. He considered this  victory as a glorious historical chapter and a glittering  episode in the life of the people of Afghanistan. He said that  this was the result of the nation's sacrifices, and the presence  of the spirit of cooperation and unity among them.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed concern over the present  situation in Afghanistan where increasingly more damage is being  caused as a result of the spread of war and bloodshed in that  country. He said: Given the Islamic homogeneity of the Afghan  nation, and the presence of the ethos of faith and hard work  among them, the present situation in that country has in effect  marred the shining record of the Islamic struggles of the  nation, and will no doubt leave negative and undesirable traits  in the history of that country.    The president added: If the foundation for all action is  built on the use of force and military might, then the process  of bloodshed and destruction will intensify, and discord and  hostility among different groups will spread. Afghanistan,  however, cannot endure any more damage.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then said that the spiritual power  and  influence of our late imam [Khomeyni], both before and after the  Islamic revolution, had acted like a guiding light for the  Muslim nation of Iran. The safeguarding of this guiding light,  he added, is a role that is being fulfilled by the eminent  leader [Khamene'i] at present. He said: The leaders of jehadi  groups must consciously obey a single leader chosen from their  midst. In this way they will be able to safeguard the  achievements of the Islamic revolution of Afghanistan, and find  the opportunity to repair the damage and reconstruct their  country.

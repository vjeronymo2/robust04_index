			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Corp hit by Y80bn provision Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan's largest trading group, yesterday cut its profits forecast for the current year, saying that a restructuring announced last year would cost much more than had been expected. The recession in Japan has also affected trading The group, the core of the diversified Mitsubishi group, warned that it expected net income to fall to a mere Y3bn (Dollars 28m) for the year to March, from Y15.3bn in 1993. It had been forecasting only a small decline in net income to Y15bn this year, its third annual profit decline. The main reason is the Y80bn Mitsubishi provision plans to make for selling or closing unprofitable businesses, in a review launched late last year of its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates. This compares with Y66bn of provisions in the year to March 1993, and will enable the group to start this year with a clean balance sheet, Mitsubishi said. Mitsubishi Corporation, which embraces oil and fuels, heavy industrial goods, metals, textiles and goods among other sectors, is one of several of Japan's keiretsus, or families of companies linked by equity cross-holdings, to have been forced to reassess their alliances in the light of the recession. The Mitsubishi move was prompted by the poor performance of some of the several hundred businesses it acquired or invested in during the economic upturn of the late 1980s. Those investments were themselves the consequence of a previous strategic rethink, in 1986, when the group responded to the coming upturn of the time by expanding its activities. Capital gains on the sale of securities will cover some of the restructuring charges, said Mitsubishi. It expects turnover to be unchanged at Y14,000bn and plans to maintain the annual dividend at Y8 per share.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Heron bondholders warned over 'significant' loss HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and finance company, warned its bondholders they 'would suffer a significant loss' if their opposition to the group's debt rescheduling pushed the group into liquidation, writes Bronwen Maddox. 'In the event of a liquidation it is estimated that the group's liabilities would exceed assets' the group said in a memorandum to bondholders, which asked them not to 'take any hasty action'. The memorandum also shows that in the year to March 31 1992 Heron suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 217m after exceptional items of Pounds 93m. The previous year there was a restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 59m, after reclassifying extraordinary losses as exceptional. Following the slump in US and European property values, Heron is seeking to reschedule about Pounds 1bn of its Pounds 1.45bn debt, including Pounds 448m in Eurobonds. Quotation of the eleven outstanding bond issues was suspended three weeks ago on European exchanges, and winning the support of the bondholders is now one of the main hurdles for the proposals. About Pounds 400m of the debt is not affected by the rescheduling, being held directly by UK, European and some US subsidiaries, and in a liquidation would be likely to be repaid in full, according to the memorandum. As a result the Heron management believes bondholders would not be repaid in full in a liquidation. The group proposed the rescheduling when it recognised that net asset writedowns of Pounds 115m at March 31, against Pounds 585m a year earlier, would breach bank covenants. The group's proposals are to split debt into A and B categories where the first receives interest but the second has interest deferred. It also plans a Pounds 1.4bn disposal programme stretched over seven years.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Eve of Destruction: Photographers Patrick Nagatani and Andree Tracey once again  collaborate on a series of elaborately faked Polaroid still-lifes about nuclear  destruction. Intrinsic to the proceedings is a weird kind of gallows humor.  </P> <P> The artifice of staged setups puts a patina of frivolity on horror but,  increasingly, laughter seems to be choked off. There is a tension and  earnestness in this work that is new to the pair.  </P> <P> Nagatani's New Mexico missile sites haunted by dancing Kachinas still have the  unreality of a myth materialized in broad daylight. Conflict between symbolic  forces has the edge of a real battle of the Titans.  </P> <P> Tracey's photo collage, mixed-media paintings are no-holds-barred attacks on  the exploitation of the environment. Blunt to the point of being overly  didactic, they still pack a punch.  </P> <P> Also on view are richly colored painted towns by Christopher Warner. Standing  in the middle of nowhere, they both love and hate the human presence under the  big Western sky. Loving the purity of the land, they nonetheless dote on the  trash, wheel ruts and power boxes that mark human habitation, pushing them  forward like a bulldozer scoops garbage. Through it all, the color is succulent  and the trash and sky compete in vivid silence, giving the paintings the eerie  stillness of a battleground.

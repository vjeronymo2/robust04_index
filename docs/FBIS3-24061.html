			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report, under the rubric "The Authorities and the </F> Opposition," on interview with Viktor Arkadyevich Tyulkin, first  secretary of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, conducted by  V. Snisarenko; date and place not given; also excerpts from  Tyulkin's statements first published in VECHERNIY LENINGRAD]    [Text] Although central Russian newspapers wrote not  a line about this, the first secretary of the Russian Communist  Workers' Party (RKRP), V. Tyulkin, made a short working visit to  Tyumen during these last few days.    Possibly it is because the number of RKRP members is  now equal to the number of subscribers to TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA,  but all the same it was to the editorial office of TYUMENSKAYA  PRAVDA that Viktor Arkadyevich made a visit in the first hours  after his arrival in the Tyumen region, and he answered the  questions of the newspaper's political commentator, V.  Snisarenko, openly and completely frankly.    Anticipating the above-mentioned conversation, TP  [TYUMENKSAYA PRAVDA] offers readers excerpts from recent  statements by V. Tyulkin, the texts of which were published on  the pages of the January issues of the newspaper VECHERNIY  LENINGRAD.    On the work of the current State Duma: "The opposition  represented by the party called the RF Communist Party, the  Agrarian Party, and others will not play a fundamental role for  two reasons: a) because the inefficiency of the Duma is laid in  its very mechanism (not one decision will be adopted without the  president's approval); and b) because in themselves the  opposition parties are essentially unable to fight for the  fundamental interests of working people and are at best focused  on passive defense."    From the statement of the organizational bureau of the RKRP  Central Committee, signed by V. Tyulkin: "In violation of the  Law `On the RF Referendum' and generally accepted norms of  civilized states, Boris Yeltsin conducted a kind of population  poll. Defending the people's right to independently decide their  fate and relying on current legislation, the RKRP cannot  recognize the diktat of the minority which has seized power in  the country and is appealing the results of the poll to the  Supreme Court of Russia (in accordance with Article 35 of the  Law `On the Referendum')."    On the predictions for a radiant future: "... We should  expect maximum reinforcement of all components of the repressive  apparatus: the police, the procurator's office, the courts, the  political police, political investigation, and censorship... I  very much regret having to predict the appearance of something  like political terrorism in 1994. The regime has overstepped the  line of legality too far, and too many people no longer believe  in any possibility of civilized, reasonable talk, accusing the  communists and the patriots of speech making, naivete, and  constraining the energy of the masses. Unfortunately, these  forces of resistance may appear."    And here is what we were able to learn on a number of other  questions during our in-person talk with him.    On the lack of unity between the RKRP and the RF Communist  Party: In the opinion of V. Tyulkin, the leadership of the  present RF Communist Party consists of those people whom "Boris  Nikolayevich classifies as sensible communists, people with whom  he is prepared to sit down and has already sat down at the  negotiations table." In practice only the RF CP leadership, in  V. Tyulkin's opinion, has to a certain extent betrayed the  ideals of the communist movement, in fact redirecting it onto  the opportunistic footing of social democracy. And we should not  talk about disagreements between the concepts and views of the  situation among ordinary members based on their related parties.  Ultimately this internal unity will still make itself known.    On immediate plans: To actively participate in the local  election campaign for the organs of representative power. The  final goal is the Councils of Working People (although V.  Tyulkin even acknowledged that "Yeltsin's people managed to make  great progress along the path of totally destroying the `labor  unity' which even yesterday was powerful. To work toward  increasing the number of local party members.    Let us assume that tomorrow the RKRP wins the elections and  takes power in the RF into its hands. What will the first steps  of its authority be?: To immediately suspend present-day  privatization. Present-day millionaires and billionaires will  have to report on the legitimacy of their wealth. To take the  present structure of commercial banks under strict control,  restoring the controlling monopoly of the Central Bank of the  Russian Federation in this sphere. In addition, to immediately  take steps to fight corruption and crime.    In light of this, V. Tyulkin explained that abandoning the  privatization now being conducted by the present regime does not  mean taking any repressive steps against those who are honestly  engaged in business on the level of private property or joint  stock forms of commodity production.    To summarize the RKRP position overall, it may be defined as  total opposition to the present authorities and to the course of  economic reforms they are conducting.    V. Tyulkin said the purpose of his present trip through the  regions of Russia is to familiarize himself with the situation  locally and with the sentiments in labor collectives, as well as  to make the activity of the basic organizations of the RKRP more  concrete. He confirmed that in protecting the interests of the  working masses, the party stands and will continue to stand on  the cornerstone principles of the Leninist RSDRP [Russian Social  Democratic Workers' Party]. That is what he said.</p>

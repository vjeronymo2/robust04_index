			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RED IVY, GREEN EARTH MOTHER BY AI BEI TRANSLATED FROM THE  CHINESE BY HOWARD GOLDBLATT(GIBBS-SMITH: $10.95)  </P> <P> The four stories in "Red Ivy, Green Earth Mother," Ai Bei's first work to be  translated into English, paint a harsh, unflinching picture of women's lives  and roles in China that is very different from the tales of vague, unhappy  marriages and urban anomie in contemporary American fiction. In "Green Earth  Mother," a young bride finds herself engaged in a power struggle for her  husband's affections with her smothering mother-in-law. Setting "Red Ivy" in a  women's prison enables Bei to describe the social injustice, corruption and  vice that flourish beneath the veneer of party rhetoric and ostensibly  democratic institutions, in a rare vision of people caught in the clash between  feudalistic traditions and governmental efforts to move a society into the  modern era.  </P></p>

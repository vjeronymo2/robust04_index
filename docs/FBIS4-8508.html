			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb forces seized 17 UN  peacekeepers Thursday guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk, 19  kilometres (12 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, UN Protection Force  spokesman Rob Annink said.    The peacekeepers -- 14 Canadian peacekeeping troops and  three  UN military observers of unspecified nationality -- were taken  by the Serbs to a barracks at Ilijas, Annink said.    Cifluk lies just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone  around Sarajevo ordered by the United Nations in February.    A French UN soldier was wounded Thursday morning by Serb  sniper fire, UN spokesman for Sarajevo Lieutenant-Colonel  Richard Pernod said.    He said the soldier was hit while manning an anti-sniper  post  near Vrbanja bridge on the front line not far from central  Sarajevo. He was rushed to hospital for surgery but the  spokesman had no details on his condition.    Nineteen French UN troops have been killed so far in  ex-Yugoslavia while more than 250 have been injured, the  spokesman said.    The incidents came amid heightened tension in the capital  and  other points in Bosnia after NATO air strikes against Serb  attackers besieging the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a  UN-declared safe area.    Sarajevo was rocked Wednesday by two series of explosions  that marred a two-month old ceasefire, as Bosnian Serb strongman  said he had "cancelled" all accords with the United Nations  after the air strikes, saying he could no longer trust the world  body.    Earlier Wednesday, Radio Sarajevo said Serb forces continued  an offensive against Gorazde, despite an announcement Wednesday  by Russian envoy Valeriy Churkin that he had brokered a  ceasefire around the enclave.</p>

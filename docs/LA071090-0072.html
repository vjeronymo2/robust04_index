			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIL BUSH DEFENDS ACTIONS AT S&amp;L  </P> <P> An angry, embattled Neil Bush on Monday defended his conduct as a director of a  failed Denver savings and loan as well as his acceptance of what he conceded  was "an incredibly sweet deal" in the form of a $100,000 loan from a Denver  investor that he did not have to repay.  </P> <P> President Bush's 35-year-old son, who faces a disciplinary hearing this fall  before federal thrift regulators, decided this weekend to launch a one-man  public relations campaign in connection with his role as a director of the  defunct Silverado Savings &amp; Loan, whose collapse is expected to cost  taxpayers about $1 billion. He issued a combative eight-page response to the  charges against him and began inviting reporters to his spartan office here to  hear his version of the events that have made him a figure in the largest  financial scandal in U.S. history.  </P> <P> Chewing gum and digging through stacks of papers on the office floor, Bush  acknowledged in an interview Monday that he got "an incredibly sweet deal" in  1984 when Denver investor Kenneth Good lent him $100,000 and then forgave the  debt. Bush also revealed that he has decided to report that 6-year-old payment  as income on his 1990 tax return.  </P> <P> But that loan, Bush insisted, was "totally unrelated" to his work as a director  of Silverado.  </P> <P> Other charges against him, Bush complained, stem from political "opportunism"  and "press sensationalism."  </P> <P> In January, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision proposed a decree banning  Neil Bush from the banking business because of his actions as a director of the  bankrupt thrift. He refused to accede, despite pressure from White House aides  urging him to put a quick end to the embarrassing case. He is now battling a  reduced charge brought by the same agency.  </P> <P> Describing himself as "stubborn," Bush said Monday that "it would have been  much easier to sign it (the decree), move on in terms of just the quality of my  life." Since then, he said, "This negative publicity has just, you know, taken  over, dominated my life for six months." In addition, Bush noted, his position  in the S&amp;L investigation may help Democrats turn the scandal to their  political advantage.  </P> <P> Still, Bush said he decided to fight "because I know I haven't done anything  wrong." The regulators have scheduled a public hearing for September, alleging  that Bush violated conflict-of-interest rules by voting to approve Silverado  loans to individuals with whom he had a business relationship.  </P> <P> After keeping his own counsel for months, he has now decided to take his case  to the public. "I've been kind of like a little caged-in animal in an  unsanitary zoo," the President's son said. "Now my cage is open and I'm telling  people . . . what my side of the story is. And I feel good about it.  </P> <P> "I know I'm a better person for it," the slender, sandy-haired Bush went on. "I  am stronger. . . . I'm eating better, drinking fruit juice. I feel like I'm  warming for a fight."  </P> <P> The eight-page document that Bush issued argues that the current disciplinary  proceeding against him "is unprecedented." In the document, he noted that  thrift regulators have not previously pursued such charges against a person who  is no longer involved in banking. Bush quit the Silverado board in the summer  of 1988.  </P> <P> Bush's response also challenges the regulators' contention that he violated  regulations by voting to approve Silverado loans to Bill Walters, a Denver  developer who had invested in Bush's oil company. Bush said there was no  conflict of interest in his votes because other bank officials knew of his ties  to Walters.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there was a disclosure made . . . that was looked at by legal  counsel," Bush said. However, he did not mention his business connection with  Walters on required conflict-of-interest forms, records show.  </P> <P> Bush's long response also discusses dealings between Silverado and Good, the  investor who had forgiven a $100,000 loan to Bush a year before he joined the  bank board. "Bush abstained from voting on this matter and all transactions  relating to Ken Good," according to the written response.  </P> <P> Bank records show that Bush did not vote when Silverado's board approved loans  to Good. But thrift regulators charge that Bush personally proposed to his  fellow board members that they grant Good a $900,000 line of credit, which they  did.  </P> <P> In another instance, regulators charge, Bush failed to tell the other directors  that Good agreed to invest up to $3 million in Bush's oil company -- even while  Good told Silverado that he lacked the money to pay back his loans from the  thrift.  </P> <P> Bush on Monday offered further explanation of the $100,000 payment he received  from Good in 1984. Under the arrangement, Bush was not expected to repay the  loan unless the invested money returned a profit. Bush said that Good offered  such loans to several Denver business people to pay for commodity speculation.  The investment "went bad," Bush said, so Good forgave the loans to all  investors.  </P> <P> Another local businessman received a $350,000 payment from Good under the same  circumstances, Bush noted. "But, of course, that won't be of any kind of  interest," he added caustically, "because his name doesn't relate to somebody  famous."  </P></p>

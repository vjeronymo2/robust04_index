			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A majority of the  countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  favor an early resumption of China's GATT membership and make it  a founding member of a world trade organization to be set up  early next year.    At the four-day 16th meeting of GATT's working party on  China  ending today in Geneva, most representatives hoped for an early  conclusion of the deliberation on the issue.    The Chinese delegation, led by Deputy Minister of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Gu Yongjiang, gave the meeting  detailed reports on China's reforms in its economic and trade  systems.    The delegation also exchanged views with other  representatives in informal bilateral consultations outside the  sessions of the working party's meeting.    It is reported that the European Union has outlined a draft  protocol on China's reentry into GATT, welcomed by the Chinese  delegation as a "positive move," which marked the start of  substantive talks despite some differences between the two sides.    Gu said at the end of the meeting that eight years had  passed  since China first asked in 1986 for the resumption of its GATT  contracting status, an unprecedented length of time in the  record of application for GATT membership.    Still ready to continue its efforts, he said, China will  submit to the GATT secretariat in the near future systematic  reports on its management of import and export, foreign  exchange, price and tariff and non-tariff measures to show a  full and clear picture of China's economic and trade structures.    The meeting did not decide when the working party will meet  again.</p>

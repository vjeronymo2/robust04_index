			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Telma Luzzani] </F>   [Text] Bluntly saying "Russia does not want the Black Sea  fleet to be split," Russian Federation Council President  Vladimir Shumeyko summarized the Russian stance on its current  dispute with Ukraine, the most serious between the two nuclear  powers after the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.    Visiting Argentina within the framework of a Latin American  tour that also includes Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador,  Shumeyko ruled out the possibility of any armed confrontation  between Russia and Ukraine despite last week's crisis in Crimea.    Asked during a news conference in Buenos Aires about the  Kremlin's possible reaction to an armed effort by Kiev to quench  Crimea's efforts to achieve independence, Shumeyko responded:  "I do not believe Ukraine will use force."    [CLARIN] Why?    [Shumeyko] Because it is impossible.    It is simply impossible, the senator emphasized. He made it  clear he is making this tour as a representative of the Russian  state and not as a representative of the Senate alone.    [CLARIN] Should Crimea be Russian?    [Shumeyko] Neither Russian nor Ukrainian. I believe it is  necessary to focus on the basics of the problem. Nowadays,  Russia is economically better off than Ukraine. For Crimea to  become Russian territory is tantamount to becoming subordinate  to a stronger currency, earning higher wages, and enjoying other  benefits. We respect Ukraine's sovereignty and the Ukrainian  people's desire to organize their own lives. Nowadays, Russian  support for Crimean authorities is economic. The rest depends  on Ukraine's stance.    [CLARIN] The true issue under discussion involves the  Sebastopol base and the Black Sea fleet, but the negotiations on  splitting are bogged down. What is likely to happen?    [Shumeyko] Russia does not want the fleet to be split. The  politicians now are playing this card, but they are aware of the  fact that the problem does not involve the fleet's command but  its existence. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is able to separately  maintain such a powerful fleet.    [CLARIN] Concerning Russian domestic politics, the unending  disputes between groups struggling for and against the reforms  frequently jeopardize Russia's frail democratic stability. What  is the current situation?    [Shumeyko] I would say now there are no sharp disputes at  the domestic political level. I believe rather that both the  conservatives and the reformists have changed to such an extent  that now it is difficult to clearly distinguish who is who. For  example, the communists accept private property and religion.  In today's Russia, we might say there is not a single true  communist, but there is not a single true democrat either.  Except for the extremists, everyone agrees that the reforms  must be carried out.    [CLARIN] And Zhirinovskiy?    [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy too. Of course, with his own  interpretation. We require stability in order to implement the  reforms. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin proposed signing a  national consensus agreement to strengthen the Russian state.</p>

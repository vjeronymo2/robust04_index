			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pinault in offer to Printemps shareholders PINAULT, the acquisitive French retailing group, has offered to buy out the minority shareholders in Au Printemps, the department store chain for which it mounted a controversial partial bid last year. The offer of FFr780 (Dollars 154) a share is significantly less than the FFr1,105 originally offered. The first bid, which transformed Pinault from an industrial company dominated by timber interests into one of France's foremost retail concerns, ran into controversy when Au Printemps' minority shareholders complained at being excluded from the deal between Pinault and the Maus-Nordmann family that controlled Au Printemps. The new offer, which is worth just over 70 per cent of the original bid, seems to confirm the minority investors' concern. Pinault yesterday claimed it was impossible to compare the price of the two transactions, given that the first offer involved buying a 66.6 per cent controlling holding in Au Printemps. Pinault also said the new price reflected the current market value of Au Printemps shares, which were suspended yesterday morning at FFr650 pending the announcement. Pinault's shares were suspended, too. The shares of both companies will resume trading today. Meanwhile, Pinault is trying to complete the sale of its old industrial interests to reduce the debt incurred by the Au Printemps deal and other acquisitions, including that of the Conforama chain of furniture shops. Pinault last month sold Isoroy, one of its original timber businesses, to Glunz, the German timber products group. Casino, the French supermarkets group which recently took over by Rallye, one of its main competitors, returned to the black in the first half of 1992 with net profits of FFr23.4m against a net loss of FFr8.3m in the interim period last year.</p>

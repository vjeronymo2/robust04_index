"During the convention it will be proved that the virus has  no dormant period," said epidemiologist Dr. A. Khatzakis  yesterday.    Dermatologist Ioannis Stratigos said doctors had thought the  disease had an incubation period because "HIV positive people  maintain relatively good health for six to 10 years."    But while the medical community has been struggling to  understand the virus, residents of a Piraievs suburb are showing  less compassion over a hostel for the HIV-positive.    "We fear for our children's health," said one hostel  neighbour, while another said the AIDS victims should be moved  out of the city.    "We just want to live with dignity and find a job," said  AIDS-affected Andonis. But not all neighbours are negative.  "These kids are my friends," said Nikolaos Roumeliotis who  lives right next door.</p>

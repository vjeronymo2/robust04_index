			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Non-resident EU citizens 'should get tax equality' European Union citizens working beyond the borders of their home country should be granted the same tax benefits as residents from 1995, the European Commission said yesterday. The Commission is calling on member states to end discrimination against 200,000 to 300,000 of the Union's most mobile workers, currently unable to claim benefits, such as family tax allowances, at home or abroad. The Commission asked governments to bring their national legislation and bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, then a formal directive could be proposed. The recommendation marks a new approach to EU tax legislation by the Commission. By not proposing formal legislation, which requires member states' unanimous approval, the Commission hopes to speed up tax harmonisation in other fields. The Commission is recommending that citizens who receive at least 75 per cent of their income in a member state other than their home country should be eligible for the same treatment as residents in the state where they work. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, tax commissioner, said the plan would particularly benefit EU citizens who live on one side of a border and work on the other, and others who want to take advantage of the single market to work away from home. The Commission said businessmen and women, lawyers, architects, doctors, journalists, sports people and actors could benefit. But the recommendation would also stop cross-border workers claiming benefits in two member states. According to the Commission, under the current system a 'non-resident' family with two children, earning BFr2m (Dollars 56,000) in Belgium, pays tax of BFr936,000 annually. If the Commission's recommendations are adopted, the same family would pay only BFr750,000 because it would benefit from family and married couple tax allowances. Applied in Germany to a married couple earning DM80,000 (Dollars 47,000), the recommendation would result in a tax saving of DM6,253 a year. Formal tax measures are often blocked for years by governments which fear losing revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation could be used to speed up harmonised tax treatment for small and medium-sized companies. Senior Commission officials said Brussels would continue to pursue individual governments through the European Court of Justice, using the recommendation as a basis for complaints that countries have broken EU treaty rules on discrimination. A similar proposal on non-resident taxation was first proposed by the Commission in 1979 but held up by member states until it was abandoned last year.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A decision is expected early this week on adding a third date to the Rolling  Stones concerts in Los Angeles in October. Fans bought up tickets for the  band's Oct. 21 "Steel Wheels" show at the Coliseum in just over an hour  Saturday, and a second performance (on Oct. 22) sold out nearly as fast. A  source close to the tour said Sunday that a third date is under consideration.  Capacity is figured at 72,000 per show. Tickets, costing $36 each, were limited  to eight per person. This is the first Stones tour in more than eight years.  The concerts also feature Guns N' Roses and Living Colour. Los Angeles wasn't  the only place where Rolling Stones tickets were gathering no moss Saturday. In  Philadelphia, some 100,000 tickets for Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 "Steel Wheels" shows  went on sale there at 10 a.m. and were gone by 12:45 p.m. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

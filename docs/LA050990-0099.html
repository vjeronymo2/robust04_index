			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY BEGIN PLANS FOR COURT BOND ISSUE  </P> <P> Orange County supervisors voted Tuesday to direct the county staff to proceed  with plans for a November referendum on a $390-million bond for court  construction.  </P> <P> The measure, which would require a two-thirds vote of approval, is one of  several potential tax proposals that supporters would like to see on the  November ballot. Transportation improvements, jail construction and open-space  acquisition have also been discussed, though for now, jails appear to have been  ruled out.  </P> <P> County voters have a long record of rejecting general obligation bonds; not  since 1957 have they approved one.  </P> <P> The board has until Aug. 10 to place the measure on November's ballot.

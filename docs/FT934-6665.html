			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Sheffield puzzled but proud Sheffield is in two minds about its position as the most successful local education authority in the government's A-level league table. The Labour-controlled city council disapproves of the tables but is nevertheless proud of the city's achievement. Sheffield's success came in spite of it being ranked 68th in the country for GCSEs, and being one of the 40 most deprived authorities in England. Mr Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, said parental attitudes were crucial. Sheffield was an artisans' city so parents encouraged children to acquire skills. Mr Mike Bower, leader of the council, sees it as a triumph of planning. In 1988 Sheffield decided to 'go comprehensive' in educating the 16-plus age group. Many schools had small, unviable sixth forms. An economy of scale was needed to use resources better and offer more choice. The city's six further education colleges pooled resources and started joint marketing. Students could opt for the subjects they wanted, even if it meant splitting their courses between different colleges. The 'comprehensive' approach meant vocational qualifications were also offered. Mr Bower said: 'Our research showed many teenagers left school at 16 because the sixth forms treated them as children. The further education colleges saw them as adults. This made a big difference to attitudes.' Only one thing prevented the system becoming truly comprehensive: after local protests the government insisted that sixth forms be retained at seven secondary schools in middle-class suburbs and two Roman Catholic ones. The scheme went ahead without them, although they continued to produce A-level results ahead of national average. Last year the six colleges became one - the Sheffield College, with 4,000 full-time students. Its A-level scores are lower than those of Sheffield's remaining sixth forms, but the combined results are better than elsewhere. Now 53 per cent of Sheffield teenagers stay on after 16, compared with 30 per cent in 1987, and 83 per cent at Sheffield College doing BTec or City and Guilds courses got diplomas.</p>

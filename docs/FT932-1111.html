			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Businessmen braced for troubles ahead WITH relations between Nigeria and the west under strain after General Ibrahim Babangida's annulment of the presidential election, the country's long-suffering business community is bracing itself for difficult times. Western threats to cut off aid and 'review relations' with the military regime are being treated with caution and scepticism. Many believe western leverage is limited. Cutting off aid, as Washington has threatened, will have little impact, unlike in Kenya where aid inflows are substantial and proved an important lever for western governments seeking political and economic reform. 'It's not as if we had great hopes for the civilian government anyway,' said one businessman. 'If anything we were preparing for continuing drift and mismanagement.' The country has experienced half a dozen coups since independence, endured a civil war over Biafra's secession, and seen the oil-boom years of the 1970s give way to austerity in the 1980s and 1990s. Businessmen and other observers acknowledge, however, that Nigeria's predicament has seldom looked so bleak. Yet for all the difficulties, they argue, it is not a market that can be ignored. With a gross domestic product of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) and population approaching 90m it is the largest market in black Africa. Guinness, for example, sells 100m litres of stout a year in Nigeria, making it the third largest market after Ireland and the UK. Trading conditions have long been difficult. Access to export credit facilities, for instance, are already very limited - hardly surprising given the level of arrears, more than Dollars 600m owed to Britain alone. The strain in relations with key trading partners does not help, but businessmen say it will not prompt any fundamental reappraisal of their own strategy. Those already operating in Nigeria will stay, accepting that the book value of their assets is nominal; those contemplating a new or additional investment would probably have waited until the new civilian government had established a track record. In theory, Nigeria is most vulnerable to pressure not over trade and investment, but over its external debt of around Dollars 30bn. Servicing the debt should consume 40 per cent of export earnings. In practice, Nigeria sets aside around 25 per cent and allows arrears to mount, rising from Dollars 2.2bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 3.4bn at the end of last year. Without rescheduling, the debt burden becomes increasingly unmanageable, but rescheduling depends on renewing an International Monetary Fund agreement, which lapsed more than 18 months ago. Western governments may now warn Gen Babangida that debt relief is conditional both on economic reform and on an early handover to a civilian government. However, Gen Babangida could respond by turning it into a populist issue, and trying to divert attention by calling attention to what he would argue is the unfair treatment Nigeria has received from its creditors, notwithstanding deepening austerity. As the economic pressure increases the president may contemplate declaring a moratorium on debt, putting the blame on the traditional scapegoat for African and other leaders - 'outside forces'.</p>

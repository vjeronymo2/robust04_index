			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise as two-year auction draws healthy demand US bonds posted moderate gains yesterday afternoon after a Treasury auction of new two-year notes drew encouraging demand. The gains were struck despite news of a surge in consumer confidence this month. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 ahead at at 89 7/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.106 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 7/32 , to yield 5.538 per cent. Bonds opened on solid footing, as the optimism which spread through the market the previous afternoon carried over into yesterday's opening. Over the past week, fixed-rate investors have become increasingly confident that economic growth in the first three months of the year was more moderate than they had feared just a month ago. As a result, bond prices have improved markedly with the approach of Thursday's preliminary estimates of first-quarter gross national product. Estimates centre on a 3 per cent increase, compared with 7 per cent in the final 1993 quarter. Expectations of slower growth have reinforced conviction among traders that the Federal Reserve will lift short-term interest rates only one more time this year, probably near the May 17 meeting of its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. With the Fed apparently moving to the sidelines, bonds, especially at the long end of yield curve, have become more resilient to unfavourable news. Yesterday was a good example. The Conference Board, an industry trade group, said its April consumer confidence index jumped to 91.7, from 86.7 the previous month. Although analysts were expecting only a slight increase, the long bond slipped, rather than plunged, and then regained its poise near midday. When the Treasury sale of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes went off smoothly in the afternoon, bonds across the board extended their gains. A sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities is scheduled for Thursday. Trading in the cash and future markets is suspended today as the country observes a national day of mourning for former President Richard Nixon. German government bonds ended a volatile day more than half a point higher, regaining some of the ground lost on Monday. This was in spite of another poor money supply figure. German economic data provided the main talking point in the bund market yesterday morning. March M3 money supply expanded at a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 15.2 per cent, down from 17.5 per cent for February. However, perversely, even though the M3 figure was well above the Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target corridor, traders said the market stayed firm, helped by short-covering. Yesterday also saw the release of inflation figures from the west German state of Hesse, where consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-April, and by 3.2 per cent against a year earlier. Bond analysts said the monthly rise was disappointing. Yesterday morning, Germany's six leading economic institutes forecast that the Bundesbank would continue to ease short-term interest rates and predicted that pan-German gross domestic product would rise by 1.5 per cent in 1994. The forecast matches the institutes' previous forecast for 1994, issued six months ago, and is at the upper end of the German government's own forecast of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent. The main focus for the market today will be the repo announcement. Many market participants are expecting the Bundesbank to slice a further eight to 10 basis points off the rate. The lowest accepted rate at last week's repo was 5.58 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.05 and reached a high of 94.52 before following the US Treasury market down in the afternoon, to a low of 93.88. The contract settled at 94.26, up 0.61 from the previous close. UK government bonds opened firm and edged higher initially, following the German market and helped by the release of the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey late in the morning. However, the market dropped back at lunchtime, then bounced back to end up half a point on the previous close. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the CBI survey should help to revive hopes of a base rate cut. 'The fall in business confidence reminds us that after a week of strong data not everything is hunky-dory. The survey is good for the gilt market: rate cuts cannot be ruled out later in the year and price pressures are very subdued.' The Liffe long gilt futures contract opened at 106.23 and fell from its high of 107.11 to a low of 106.01, settling at 106.21. Market participants expect today's auction of the 6 per cent stock due 1999 to go well, given the demand for this particular five-year issue, and because the Bank of England's auction is relatively small at Pounds 2bn.</p>

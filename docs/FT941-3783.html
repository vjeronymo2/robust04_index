			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Housing market 'growing rapidly' The housing market enjoyed substantial growth last month, says a survey of more than 100 estate agents published today. The increase bodes well for a rise in house sales during the peak spring buying season according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey. Its findings were not uniform, and some agents said interest from prospective buyers slackened during the latter part of last month. This may have been due to severe weather keeping people indoors or to buyers becoming discouraged by the prospect of tax increases due next month. More than 85 per cent of agents questioned in England and Wales by the institution said purchases, visits and reservations by prospective buyers rose during the three months to the end of February compared with the previous three months. Only 13 per cent said activity had remained constant or had fallen. Fourteen per cent of agents said prices had risen during the period compared with 6.4 per cent who said they had fallen. The rest said prices were unchanged. The institution said the housing market traditionally recovers after the New Year with sales expected to reach a peak during spring before subsiding as the school summer holidays approach. The signs were that sales this spring may be the best for several years, it added. Persimmon call, Page 30</p>

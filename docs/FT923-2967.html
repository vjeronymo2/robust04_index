			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Observer: German fiesta Still dancing on the deck of the Titanic are the heads of Italy's state-owned companies. Although many may be heading for extinction under the government's privatisation plans, the signs are they are enjoying themselves as they go under. Earlier this year, UK merchant banks and advisers were selling their services to a large group of Italian public-sector bosses by hosting a one-day jamboree on the royal yacht, Britannia. Last week, it was the turn of the Germans. Deutsche Bank showed its determination to jump onto Italy's privatisation bandwagon by sending almost a quarter of its managing board to Rome. It was a two-pronged attack. While the higher echelons - like the chairmen of the biggest state-owned companies - were wined and dined at a dinner at the German embassy, the triumvirate of John Craven, Ronaldo Schmitz and Ulrich Weiss, Deutsche's board members responsible for mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance and Italy respectively, hosted a lavish meal for other executives and the heads of major subsidiaries on the roof terrace of the Hassler hotel. With the Vatican illuminated in the background and the Spanish Steps just a stone's throw away, the atmosphere was hardly conducive to discussing deals. But as far as banking diplomacy went, it could hardly have been bettered, according to Observer's man on the spot - who opines that the food was much better than that on the royal yacht.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zinat Ibrahim: "Social Affairs Minister Before </F> Consultative Council"]    [Text] The beginning was an item in one of the  government-owned newspapers:    "Number of juveniles in welfare institutions drops to only  200."    Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of insurance and social affairs,  gave the figure in her statement before the Consultative  Council's committee on services.    The minister did not say whether the figure was the result  of  a decline in the juvenile crime rate or whether there were other  causes.    AL-JUMHURIYAH weekly posed the question to officials  responsible for juveniles in police stations and welfare  institutions in an attempt to monitor the facts.    The details of the news item said there were fewer than 200  juveniles between the ages of 15 and 18 in welfare institutions  throughout the republic.    The constant decrease in this number has forced the ministry  to convert some juvenile institutions to other functions. In  addition, there are governorates where there are no juveniles  who have received judicial sentences.  <H5>  Figures </H5>   Public Security reports for 1993 state that a total of  17,896  juveniles committed acts of theft, murder, prostitution, etc.    The reports show that 74 boys and 12 girls under age 7; 132  boys and 15 girls under age 11; 1,000 boys and 93 girls under  age 13; 5,000 adolescent boys and 411 adolescent girls under age  16; and 9,000 adolescent boys and 439 adolescent girls under age  18 committed crimes punishable under the juveniles law.    Among them were 3,347 who committed crimes of deception,  5,181 who committed crimes of battery, 285 who committed crimes  of murder and wrongful injury, 3,487 who committed crimes of  public transport or vagrancy, 216 who committed crimes of  vandalism, and 65 who committed crimes of violation of trust.    There were 7,031 juveniles who committed various  misdemeanors.    Security reports for 1993 also recorded a definite increase  in the number of crimes and juvenile perpetrators compared with  1992.    The reports recorded 257 felony cases committed by 299  juveniles in 1992. There were 6,327 juvenile misdemeanor and  vagrancy cases. There were 15,536 male juveniles charged and  1,274 females.    Public Security reports also list 27 juvenile welfare  institutions and homes under the Ministry of Social Affairs.    The penal institution at al-Marj contains at least 500  juveniles. It is administered by the Prisons Department and  Juvenile Police Administration. Juveniles who have been  judicially sentenced are committed to it.    It is the only institution whose case records show not a  single case of escape. This is because it enforces the closed  institutions law and is under strict security guard.    Other juvenile welfare institutions and homes:    For example, according to security reports, 70 juveniles  have  been committed to the al-Jizah classification center by judicial  sentences.    There are 120 juveniles in the education home in al-Jizah,  100 juveniles in the youth institution in 'Ayn Shams, 50  juveniles in the people's education home in Old Cairo, 50 girls  in the institute for minors charged in cases of prostitution and  out-of-wedlock pregnancy, 115 girls in the al-'Ajuzah girls'  institution, and 50 male and female juveniles in the al-Jizah  observation home.    The security reports also say that an average of 5,841  juveniles run away every year from juvenile welfare institutions  and homes.    Social and security studies and research confirm the  evidence  of the public security reports.    The most recent study on juvenile misdemeanor was done by  Colonel 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, head of the Juvenile  Investigation Department in Cairo.    The field study proved the phenomenon of juveniles running  away and that there are insufficient welfare homes and refuges  to absorb delinquents, vagrants, and orphans. Those who manage  most of the institutions have a low level of qualification, and  budget and facilities are meager.  <H5>  Increase in Juvenile Crimes </H5>   We asked Col. 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, "How many juveniles  come in every day?"    He replied: "There is no fixed daily statistic, as the  number  depends on police campaigns. For example, there were 180  juveniles arrested on 27 March. On 31 March the number dropped  to 35."    Is there an actual decrease in the number of crimes  committed  by juveniles?    'Atiyat Muhammad Salih, head of police women social workers  at the department, replied: "The answer definitely is no. There  is a clear increase in the rate of crimes of various kinds and  degrees of seriousness committed by juveniles.    "The decrease has occurred only with regard to cases of  subjection to delinquency including: begging; gathering  cigarette butts; sleeping in streets, large water pipes, ruins,  and garbage bins; and other cases that lack the element of  crime."    She continued: "Also, there are gaps in Law 31 of 1974. In  the 20 years since the law was passed, the community's scale of  values has changed due to social, economic, and psychological  circumstances.    "For example, anyone caught for the first time is handed  over  to his guardian, who is warned to watch his behavior carefully.  If the same juvenile is apprehended again, the guardian has the  right to lodge a complaint within 10 days, in which case the  guardian will be charged with the misdemeanor of negligence and  pay a fine of only 5 pounds."  <H5>  Where Do They Go? </H5>   How does the chief woman social worker of the Cairo police  explain the phenomenon of juveniles running away from social  welfare institutions and homes?    She answered: "I personally am asking that the welfare  institutions belonging to the Ministry of Social Affairs be  abolished. More private associations should be established, such  as the My Children Association (Gam'iyat Awladi) in  al-Ma'adi, the Firm Handhold Association (Gam'iyat  al-'Urwah al-Wuthqa) in the Citadel, and other associations  that provide physical, social, educational, and psychological  care for youngsters.    "Most of the institutions under the Ministry of Social  Affairs financially, technically, and administratively can be  seen as schools to graduate children who are even more  delinquent and more dangerous to the community.    "These institutions are unable to absorb juveniles because  of  meager resources and mismanagement. An institution's board of  directors does not meet at the scheduled times. No one knows the  secrets of these institutions that are managed in an inhumane  manner.    "We may remember that most of the victims of the American  tourist Mr. William were children who had run away from  institutions.    "In addition there are repeated cases of flight due to  inhumane treatment in most of these homes. This treatment comes  across in the stories of the young runaways who are  reapprehended and return to us. These cases are documented in  police station books. The number of runaways is at least 50  percent.    "One of the most important factors aiding juveniles to run  away is that most of these institutions implement an open-door  system without guards.    "The 'Ayn Shams popular institutions and girls' welfare  homes  are open institutions. Juveniles in them are allowed to go out  once a week. Usually a juvenile goes out and does not return.    "Juveniles in other institutions are allowed to go out daily  and carry on their normal lives."    Major General Hamdi al-'Awadi, director of the Cairo police  investigation department, thinks that the lack of a strict  security guard at the institutions contributes primarily to  juveniles running away.    "Most of these institutions are negligent in performing  their  mission, which is to reform and educate juveniles, caring for  them medically and psychologically, so that they become good  citizens in the community.    "There are many reasons for this. Most important, the role  of  Social Affairs is limited to establishing juvenile institutions.  There is no attention to protecting the basic rights of  juveniles, respecting their feelings, and providing the  specialized expertise to undertake their care.    "Young people are extremely sensitive to the labels with  which they are branded. Criminology investigations dealing with  the process of applying criminal labels have shown the damage  that results from characterizing young people permanently as  miscreants or criminals."    He continued: "This necessitates the formation of a high  commission on juveniles. It should include all the organizations  and agencies active in the area. There should be full  coordination between the juvenile police, the juvenile courts,  the Social Affairs Ministry's social welfare institutions, and  private associations.  <H5>  Confessions of a Runaway </H5>   Ahmad is a child who has run away from the 'Ayn Shams  institution. We met him at the Cairo Juvenile Police Station.    Ahmad, who had run away, refused to give his full name for  fear of punishment when he returned--first from the director of  the institution, then from its seven supervisors, its head, and  finally the head of the ward.    Punishments are many and varied in the institution.    There is hair shaving; cleaning and sweeping the wards;  chores and services in the homes of officials; sweeping,  cleaning, and shaking out bedding and carpeting; polishing  furniture; washing dishes; and hanging out laundry.    On returning, a juvenile gets a grade. Four disobediences  mean being beaten with a cane across the hand or being made to  kneel for hours on end.    Full meals are not served. The food listed on paper is quite  different from what is distributed to the juveniles.    A sick juvenile gets no doctor or medicine. He works and  sweeps even if he comes down with a fever.  <H5>  Human Crime </H5>   I left the juvenile police station at al-Azbakiyah for the  juvenile welfare homes.    The Egypt Society for the Protection of Women and Children  depends financially, technically, and administratively on the  Ministry of Social Affairs.    The society is located on Dikirnis Street, off al-Khalifah  al-Mansur Street, in the Safir section of Heliopolis.    It includes the Women's Protection Home, registry no. 94 of  the year 1969, as well as al-Amal Nursery School, license no.  469 for the year 1986.    Before going, we telephoned the home about whether it would  accept a young girl.    The woman official agreed to accept the girl at once,  without  asking any questions.    According to regulations, this home is supposed to accept  only girls who have been sentenced by the juvenile prosecutor.    We hesitated for a long time before entering the home--an  old-fashioned villa with faded walls flecked with yellow paint  that gives you a feeling of gloom and mystery.    In the neglected garden are scattered remains of old toys, a  broken swing, and a few chairs on which a child could not sit  without falling and being hurt.    The villa has two stories. The reception room and the  nursery  school are on the first floor.    There were four girls, aged between four and five. One  supervisor was in charge of all the children's affairs.    We asked about the director of the home.    "She's not in," answered a young girl.    "Who is in charge here now?"    "I," she answered, in a tone tinged with fear and caution.    The girl exchanged long glances with the supervisor of the  nursery school. She left us and went into a side room.    We asked the nursery school supervisor: "Where are the girls  who live in the home?"    "There are no girls now. But there is a girl coming in a  while." She meant the imaginary girl whose coming we had  announced!    A few moments later, a woman in her thirties appeared--a  mute. She came from the upper story and was accompanied by  another woman.    The two women were, as they say, skin and bone--withered  features, in their eyes a sad downtroddenness reminiscent of the  system of forced labor and humiliation.    We asked again for the name of the directress of the home.    The nursery school supervisor replied: "Ghadah Muhammad  Amin.  She lives permanently on the top floor of the home. There is a  room for her and two rooms to receive visiting girls."    We asked to see the register of visiting girls, but the girl  on duty suddenly returned to ask us to make an urgent telephone  call.    The girl dialed a certain number, and Hilmi Mahmud Salih,  the  society's director, told us over the line: "You are forbidden to  obtain any information. Photographing is forbidden." We would  have to see him first at the general administration in Qasr  al-'Ayni!    I left the room where the mute woman was sitting. We tried  to  communicate with her by signs and glances.    The woman said quite innocently, "Pregnant girls come here.  They leave immediately after giving birth."    We asked the overseer of the nursery school, "Where do the  girls go after giving birth?"    "As soon as a girl gives birth, the directress of the home  turns the infant over to the police station, and they take  charge of placing it in an orphanage. The mother leaves the  home."    We left the home stunned. How could girls be allowed to go  out and risk becoming delinquent again and again?    We got the answer from someone in the vicinity of the home.    A man who refused to allow his name to be mentioned told us:  "The circumstances of this home are suspicious. It accepts any  girl carrying an out-of-wedlock child. When she gives birth, she  becomes a domestic servant with the knowledge of the home, which  takes her entire salary and gives her a small part of it.    "I know lots of stories about the girls who leave the  home--'Abir, Hiyam, and many others. Some obey the orders of the  directress; others run away onto the streets, into the unknown."    The man continued very nervously: "Last week there were 10  girls here. Day before yesterday there were three. Where did  they go?    "Those here permanently are the mute and her companion.  Their  health has been ruined from working night and day.    "Those in the early months of pregnancy manage to work in  domestic service. The others do chores around the home until it  comes time to give birth."  <H5>  Papa Wahid </H5>   Al-Hurriyah Institution for Social Care has more than one  shift.    The 75-year-old institution used to be called the Fu'ad I  Orphanage of the Egyptian Society. Its head in 1919 was 'Ali  Pasha Mahir.    It subsequently became the 'Ayn Shams Social Administration.  It is under the Ministry of Social Affairs.    Although we entered the institution without an appointment,  we saw healthy children living a normal life in a peaceful house  in which one could feel real, not artificial warmth.    When we asked some of them whether they were happy here,  they  answered with childish innocence: "Very happy, thanks be to God.  We all love Papa Wahid."    We learned that Papa Wahid is the director in charge of  al-Hurriyah Institution and that it accepts children who are  victims of orphanhood, divorce, poverty, or illegitimacy.    The director was the only child of parents whom he never has  seen all his life. He does not even know what they look like. He  was raised with his paternal uncle and his wife. There he  learned the meaning of orphanhood and the cruelty of  discrimination between children living in one house.    When he grew up and obtained a crafts school diploma, he  decided to repeat the General Secondary Examination and enroll  in the Social Service Institute in order to devote himself to  caring for these youngsters.    For 32 years he has been caring for children whom he regards  as his own. There are 95 children in the institution, and they  call him "papa."    His own son lives in the building and spends his spare time  with his "brothers" in the home.    They are children against whom no court rulings have been  passed, but their social and economic circumstances have made  them orphans although their fathers and mothers are still alive.    The director of the institution said very bitterly:  "Although  the home has room to accept at least 120 children, insufficient  resources prevent us from accepting any but critical cases. The  budget is very meager and not fixed, and the money never  stretches far enough. The result is that there are neglected  victims--children exposed to delinquency of whom the streets are  full."    A child is subjected to thorough social investigations  before  being committed to the home. The institution accepts children  from the age of six. It provides them with care and gives them  opportunities for a normal education from primary school until  graduation from university or technical and crafts schools,  depending on their talent and ability.    Despite the meager budget, the institution seems model.  Original oil paintings by College of Fine Arts students living  in the home adorn the walls.    In the extensive long halls, one sees only flowerpots of  green plants that the children carefully tend.    The kitchen is extremely clean and lacks nothing. The  refectory has clean and serviceable tables and chairs.    The dormitories are divided according to the children's  ages.    All the dormitories remind one of four-star hotels. A social  specialist supervises each wing.    There is a mosque for prayer, a study hall, and a dispensary  equipped with various kinds of drugs.    We saw not a scrap of paper on the floor and not a single  fly.    What most drew one's attention were the children's  expressions, which radiated joy, contentment, and a sense of  confidence and security.    We asked the director of the home whether the institution's  rolls recorded a single case of running away.    Khalid and Sayyid answered together: "Once Mr. Richard came  here. He took us to al-Amal Village in Madinat Nasr. We couldn't  stay there, although the institution is pretty and has  everything. We came back because Papa Wahid and our brothers and  sisters are here. We all love each other."    How has the home's director been able to provide these  facilities for the children of the institution?    "The budget from the government is very meager, amounting to  120,000 pounds. Half of it is allocated to employees' salaries;  the other half to feeding the children.    "I therefore turn to the method of nonmonetary contributions  in kind. Charitable people provide us with all the needs of the  children: clothing, school equipment, medicine, even some kinds  of food, candy, and drinks that the children ask for."    I asked how he explained the running away of children.    He answered: "It results primarily from the policy of the  institution's management--whether the institution can become a  factor attracting the young person by providing love and  affection first, and then comprehensive care."</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Unemployment 'sapping our strength' - Economic communique focuses on worries about jobs and growth / Jobs become priority Following are extracts from the Group of Seven economic communique issued in Tokyo yesterday: STRENGTHENED COMMITMENT TO JOBS AND GROWTH 1. Progress around the world towards democracy and open market economies surpasses our most optimistic expectations of only some years ago. To reap full benefits of recent historic transformations, our societies must respond to a number of challenges; achieving economic recovery and job creation, successfully concluding the Uruguay Round this year, integrating countries in transition into the world economy, supporting developing countries and reconciling global growth and environmental objectives. We are determined to address these challenges. We renew our commitment to extend international co-operation, in particular by strengthening multilateral institutions. WORLD ECONOMY 2. We are concerned about insufficient growth and inadequate job creation in our economies. 3. We are particularly concerned with the level of unemployment. More than 23m people are unemployed in our countries; that is unacceptable. Much of the recent increase is attributable to the present economic slowdown, but a significant part of the current level of unemployment is structural. Reducing unemployment, therefore, requires a double strategy: prudent macroeconomic policies to promote non-inflationary sustainable growth, and structural reforms to improve the efficiency of markets, especially labour markets. 4. We are taking and will take appropriate measures to implement this agreed growth strategy to promote a sustainable expansion designed to create substantial increases in employment. We will consult closely so that our national policies can be mutually reinforcing and compatible with our shared goal of a strengthened and recovering world economy. Europe is carrying out vigorously the Growth Initiative agreed in Edinburgh and strengthened in Copenhagen. Europe is committed as a matter of overriding importance to implementing firm budgetary and other measures needed in order to ensure that conditions for rapid reductions in interest rates are created. In North America, strong actions, which have been long overdue in the US and which we welcome, are being taken to ensure substantial and steady reductions in fiscal deficits over the medium term, higher level of domestic savings and investment, and lower long-term interest rates. Japan has taken a series of stimulative policies including the most recent comprehensive package. Japan will implement fiscal and monetary measures as necessary, to ensure sustained non-inflationary growth led by strong domestic demand, keeping in mind the need for long-term fiscal prudence. This will contribute to the important goal of significantly reducing external imbalances. Successful and rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round will also boost the confidence of investors and consumers, and thus will be an important contribution to recovery and growth. 5. To enhance opportunities for employment and growth it is essential to address structural issues which constitute obstacles to strong economic recovery and to longer-term growth potential. In this context, we endorse the report of our finance ministers focussing on a broad range of structural reforms, inter alia: Greater labour market efficiency; Improvement in education and training; Enhancement of savings and investment; Maintaining and improving the multilateral trading system; Reduction of subsidies; Addressing the economic impact of ageing populations; Controlling overall outlays on health care; Enhancing efficiency in financial markets while ensuring their stability; Developing international co-operation on the environment. 6. We agree to send representatives to a meeting in the US in the autumn to explore the causes of excessive unemployment and to search for possible answers to this critical problem which saps the strength of our societies. TRADE 7. Maintaining and expanding the multilateral trading system is essential for world growth. We are determined to curb protectionism in all its manifestations and agree that no recourse should be made to initiatives and arrangements that threaten to undermine the multilateral open trading system. We also confirm that any regional integration should be complementary to and supportive of the system. Our highest priority is a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. ENVIRONMENT 8. Environmental issues remain a high priority on our policy agenda despite difficult economic times. RUSSIA AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION 9. We reaffirm our support for the reform efforts in the countries in transition. . . based on the principles of help for self-help and partnership. 10. We welcome the further progress made by Russia since Munich in its courageous reform efforts under the leadership of President Yeltsin and supported by the Russian people in the recent referendum. We urge Russia to intensify its efforts to reduce inflation and the budget deficit, and to take all the necessary legal and administrative measures to build on the strong start in privatisation and to promote further structural adjustment. We recognise the importance of improved market access for economic progress in Russia. Recognising that privatisation and enterprise reform are at the heart of Russia's transformation into a market economy, we agree to create a Special Privatisation and Restructuring Programme, in co-operation with international financial institutions, consisting of enterprise restructuring support, technical assistance and oblast support, focusing on an initial period to the end of 1994. In total, this programme is expected to mobilise Dollars 3bn. In addition, we are ready to encourage our private sectors to assist in this process, sharing with Russian counterparts methods and techniques to increase productivity. 11. We welcome the progress made in the nuclear safety programme agreed at the Munich Summit. Urgent safety measures, co-ordinated through the G24, need to be implemented rapidly to secure real improvements at the plants still causing great concern. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 13. We will pursue a comprehensive approach, covering not only aid but also trade, investment and debt strategy, and a differentiated approach, tailored to needs and performances of each country and taking environmental aspects into account. INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION AND FUTURE SUMMITS 16. We value summits for the opportunity they provide to exchange views, build consensus and deepen understanding among us. But we believe summits should be less ceremonial, with fewer people, documents and declarations, and with more time devoted to informal discussion among us, so that together we may better respond to major issues of common concern. We intend to conduct future summits in this spirit. We have accepted the invitation. . . to meet in Naples, Italy, in July 1994.</p>

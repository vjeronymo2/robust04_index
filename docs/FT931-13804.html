			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Data General does better than expected DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, had a better-than-expected first quarter, achieving a small profit despite weak market conditions. Net income was Dollars 800,000 or 2 cents a share, against Dollars 4m or 12 cents last year. Operating income was Dollars 4.2m, against Dollars 4.9m. First-quarter revenues fell to Dollars 279.6m, from Dollars 294.8m as sales of traditional proprietary products declined. Data General said, however, sales of its 'open systems' computers continued to grow during the quarter, and became the company's top selling product line.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Was Jackson Video Hijacked?"A Current Affair" was ready to air an exclusive  home video of Michael Jackson on Monday and Tuesday nights, until Jackson's  lawyers showed up at the last minute and prevented the show from running the  video as planned, according to the syndicated show's executive producer, Gerald  Stone. "A Current Affair" had gotten the video from Steve Howell, a cameraman  who worked with Jackson on some videos and had taken extra footage of Jackson  around his house. Stone said Howell told "A Current Affair" that Jackson gave  up the rights to the video, but Jackson's lawyers claimed the video was  "hijacked," and Howell did not have legal access to it. "A Current Affair"  smelled a news story, and on Monday did a piece on the confusion surrounding  the tape (another segment was scheduled for Tuesday night). While the program  used excerpts from the tape as part of the news story, "in deference to Michael  Jackson, we didn't run the whole thing," Stone said. He added that Howell  denied Jackson's attorneys' accusations. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

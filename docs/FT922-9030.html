			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Time for summer table talk . . .  - With the first burst of sunshine, Lucia van der Post has been thinking about tables FOR somewhat more down-to-earth and less nostalgic picnicking there is the Huzar table (right). No more lolling on rugs damp with dew - this picnic table seats four in comfort and folds into a flattish carrying case so that it can be stowed in boot or boat. Made from plastic with a strong aluminium frame, it is easy to clean and robust as well as light. It could go happily to pool or polo, to riverside or point-to-point, to Badminton or Glyndebourne. It weighs 21 lb, pulls out to measure 33 1/2 in by 26 in and it comes in blue, green, red or yellow. It can only be bought by post and costs Pounds 69 from Huzar Co, PO Box 12, Knebworth, Herts SG3 6QQ. Tel: 0438-811018.</p>

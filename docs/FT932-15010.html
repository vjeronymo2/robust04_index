			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS smelters marshal their defences THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday set up an organisation to promote and defend its operations internationally. Several western companies are represented on the International Aluminium Committee, which will be based in St Petersburg and have liaison offices in Brussels and New York. One of its most urgent tasks will be to put the CIS industry's case to the European Commission, which is considering whether it should set draconian quotas for CIS aluminium imports. Virtually all the CIS smelters are represented on the new committee as well as Concern Aluminiy, the central holding company, whose president, Mr Igor Prokopov is chairman of the new organisation. Among the western companies, all of them suppliers to the CIS industry, are the AIOC Corporation, a New York-based trading company; Granges, the Swedish aluminium group; Joseph Muller of Switzerland; Kaiser, the US aluminium group; the Kumera Corporation, a Finnish equipment supplier; and Reynolds Metals, another big US group. Mr Sam Manaktala, a Kaiser director who has been appointed a director of the new organisation, said the western companies' role was to act as advisers to an organisation which would in concept be similar to the European Aluminium Association or the American Aluminium Association. 'It will consist of people with similar objectives, working together. If the Russian aluminium industry can organise itself in a structured way it will be good for them and good for the rest of the world's aluminium industry.' The IAC aims to help attract more foreign investment in the CIS industry, both at the smelters and in downstream operations. In the longer term the committee will help the integration of the CIS into the world industry. Some of the Russian members said they were concerned about the poor image of the CIS industry being projected internationally and recognised that they needed an organisation to put their industry's case. The new organisation has only a few weeks in which to influence the European Commission's inquiry. Some western aluminium producers have complained that their smelters have been operating unprofitably for two years and their very existence is threatened because of a surge in CIS aluminium exports since 1991. They estimate that 600,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium entered the EC last year and 450,000 tonnes in 1991 compared with an annual average of 82,000 tonnes before 1990. The commission is inquiring into their complaints under rules that allow measures to 'safeguard' EC industry. These rules permit the imposition of quotas or tariffs. The European Aluminium Association is understood to be pressing for an annual quota of 82,000 tonnes to be imposed, the 'normal' level before the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

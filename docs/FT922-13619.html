			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris recovers losses on strong start in New York PARIS bucked a generally easier trend on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS dipped below 19,000 before turning upwards as bargain-hunters had to raise their bids to attract any sellers. The CAC 40 index hit a low of 1,899.90, but a strong opening on Wall Street helped it to close up 36.16 or 1.9 per cent to 1,943.64, recouping more than half of Wednesday's 3.4 per cent loss. Turnover was high at FFr3.7bn. Perrier was one of the day's most active stocks, as remaining shareholders sold out to Nestle. The stock was steady at FFr1,700 with 184,575 shares traded. Alcatel Alsthom added FFr22 to FFr617 as its 1991 results came in at the top of expectations and a stronger oil price pushed Elf up by FFr14.40 to FFr368.40. Continued pessimism pushed Euro Disney down by FFr3.80 or 2.7 per cent to FFr137.70. The theme park, which opens this weekend, has fallen 16.6 per cent from its all-time high of FFr165.20 and some analysts believe that the stock is oversold. FRANKFURT remained quiet as investors stayed on the sidelines pending the outcome of the UK election. The overnight fall in Tokyo and the rejection by the German interior ministry of a 5.4 per cent pay rise for public sector employees had a limited impact. Talks between unions and employers are due to restart on Monday, with the unions threatening to strike if the settlement recommended by arbitrators is not accepted. The DAX index fell to 1,710.29 before closing up 0.24 at 1,720.25. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, closed down 3.41 at 698.65. Turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM5.4bn. The banking sector continued to lead the market following strong 1991 results this week and forecasts of positive earnings in 1992. Commerzbank was DM3.10 stronger at DM263.80 while Deutsche Bank advanced 70 pfg to DM711.20. The pharmaceuticals group Gehe was one of the best performers of the day gaining DM25 or 2.7 per cent to DM937 after announcing that it was to raise its dividend by DM2. MILAN fell to a new 1992 low as an early rebound faltered. However, dealers were cautiously optimistic that there was good support for the Comit around the 485 level, which they saw as the floor for the market until the formation of a new government. Position squaring was in evidence ahead of the options expiry on Monday and the close of the monthly account on Wednesday. The Comit index eased 0.51 to 496.23 in turnover estimated at L50bn after L74.2bn. The banking sector fell 0.8 per cent, which Mr John Stewart of Pastorino attributed to the Bank of Italy's announcement of a rise in bad loans. Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura lost L140 or 2.8 per cent to L4,860. San Paolo rebounded after its recent weakness, adding L55 to L12,005. A block of 5m shares amounting to 0.8 per cent of the bank was passed through the market late on Tuesday at the issue price of L12,200. There were rumours that the shares changed hands between members of the bank's underwriting consortium rather than being sold to an outside buyer. Sip fell back L9 to L1,435 in profit-taking after the previous day's news of a higher dividend. But the savings shares added L9 to L1,424. AMSTERDAM showed some resistence to the falls in Tokyo and the US. The CBS Tendency index was off 0.6 at 123.4 in turnover of Fl 578.9m. A lack of corporate news kept price movements to a minimum. Some profit-taking in Elsevier was noted and it closed down 70 cents at Fl 110.8. Other blue chips were quiet: Royal Dutch up 20 cents to Fl 146.20 and Unilever down 80 cents to Fl 180.60. VRG declined Fl 1.10 to Fl 46.50 ahead of its results which came after the close. The paper wholesaler reported a provisional fall of between 25-30 per cent in first quarter 1992 net profit. BRUSSELS recovered some of its earlier losses. The Bel-20 index fell 4.93 to 1,165.61. Solvay, which proposed an unchanged dividend, gained BFr25 to BFr12,025 with 2,500 shares traded. ZURICH rose in light trading. The SMI index gained 2.8 to 1,829.1. Banks were firmer with SBC bearers up SFr1 at SFr278 and UBS bearers SFr10 stronger at SFr3,740. STOCKHOLM followed Tokyo and New York lower. The Affarsvarlden index closed down 8.2 at 961.0 in turnover of SKr431m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1135.87  1134.89  1134.65  1136.84  1138.21  1140.28  1140.33  1140.98  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1141.18    Day's Low  1134.02  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Apr 8     Apr 7     Apr 6     Apr 3     Apr 2 1143.45   1156.82   1155.59   1144.60   1149.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

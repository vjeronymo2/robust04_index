			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (3): Climate of mistrust slowly begins to dissipate - The government is rethinking its ideological opposition to privatisation in the light of a gaping budget deficit Until recently, investment bankers were viewed with suspicion by officials in Greece's socialist government, who claimed that their conservative predecessors paid out excessive amounts in advisory fees with little in the way of results. The ambitious privatisation programme undertaken by the conservatives brought many international investment bankers to Athens for the first time. While a number of mandates were awarded, union opposition and government in-fighting meant that only a few transactions were completed. Even the much-vaunted privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms company, fell through when the government changed. Faced with a gaping budget deficit and a desperate shortage of funds for upgrading public utilities, the socialists have been forced to reverse their ideological opposition to privatisation. However, they have chosen a more diluted form: partial flotations of a handful of state-owned enterprises on the Athens stock exchange. Where the investment banks are concerned, the climate of mistrust is dissipating slowly as the government examines ways of maximising revenue from the proposed flotations, scheduled to start this autumn. 'It is accepted that commissions are going to be slimmer this time and that some imaginative solutions over share distribution will have to be worked out in order to bring the unions on board,' says a government adviser. A dozen investment banks are vying for the lead manager's role in the flotation of 25-30 per cent of the telecoms company, of which at least half will take the form of an international tranche to be sold in Europe, the US and Japan. Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg, which have been appointed global co-ordinators and joint lead managers for the issue's international tranche by the conservatives, are hoping that willingness to reduce their commission will overcome lingering political doubts over their association with the previous government. Their re-appointment would certainly speed up the flotation from which the government hopes to raise at least Dr300bn. If successful, it should be followed by listings of the Public Power Corporation and two state oil refineries. Financial advisers from abroad are also in demand for public works projects as the government assesses bids for projects with a sizeable percentage of EU funding. Several projects, such as a toll highway through northern Athens, the new Athens airport to be built at Spata, and a suspension bridge across the Corinth Gulf, include a self-financing component together with EU assistance, with little or no contribution from the government's investment budget. Arrival of the international investment banks also coincided with the emergence of corporate finance specialists at Greek banks, who sharpened their skills while advising on mergers and acquisitions of Greek companies by European competitors in the run-up to the single market. This local expertise was tapped by the previous government - both in making initial valuations of companies scheduled for disposal and in finding buyers for smaller enterprises. The OTE (Greek telecom company) listing also offers a large slice of business for local banks. Like the international bankers, Credit Bank (Greece's largest private bank) is hoping to be reappointed lead manager of the domestic tranche of the OTE listing. There will be at least half a dozen other Greek banks involved in underwriting what will be by far the largest issue ever made in Greece. 'While we are unlikely to handle a really big deal on our own, our advantage is that we know the local market, we offer a diversity of skills and we can accept smaller deals that no international investment bank would be interested in,' says Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha Finance, the investment arm of Credit Bank. Alpha Finance combines underwriting, corporate advisory and fund management services under one roof. It is also setting up a bank in Romania, which will combine commercial and investment banking, with the aim of offering corporate advisory services to Greek companies active there and in playing a role in Romania's privatisation programme. For the moment, however, Alpha Finance, like other local investment bankers, is focusing on bringing Greek companies to the Athens Stock Exchange. 'Equity business picked up sharply just as privatisation was falling off and there is now a line of listings stretching to the end of the year,' Mr Vourloumis says. The growth of fee-based business in Greece has encouraged Barclays de Zoete Wedd to set up an Athens-based operation based in the same building as Barclay's Athens headquarters. BZW Hellas is also handling flotations, especially those that can also be marketed to institutional investors abroad. 'There is an increasing amount of financial intermediation going on in Greece, so it makes sense to have a local presence. We have also been able to capitalise on existing client relationships,' says Mr Christos Megalou of BZW Hellas. The range of business is likely to grow as Greek companies get used to the idea of calling in an investment banker. Treasury management services and financial restructuring are two areas where demand is expected to increase. A new round of acquisitions is also expected as consolidation affects more sectors, with large Athens-based companies, for example, taking over smaller rivals in northern Greece. BZW acted as financial adviser last year in the biggest local acquisition for some time: Veropoulos Supermarkets' Dr4bn takeover of three rival supermarket chains. Although there is unlikely to be room for more than two or three full-fledged investment banks in Athens, several boutique operations have managed to carve out niches in the market. 'There is a cultural change under way. Companies are looking to corporate finance specialists to provide the kind of solutions that their local bank is not equipped for,' says Mr Victor Pisante, of Telesis Capital, a small investment banking operation which has the support of a brokerage subsidiary.</p>

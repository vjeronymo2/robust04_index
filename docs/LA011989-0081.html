			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZARIAN BACKS OFF ON BUILDING EXEMPTIONS  </P> <P> After being told by his colleagues that he would lose the vote, Glendale City  Councilman Larry Zarian backed off from introducing an ordinance Tuesday to  exempt 19 projects from the city's building moratorium.  </P> <P> Zarian had said during a Jan. 6 council meeting that he wanted to exclude from  the moratorium projects that were "90% done, a week or two away from final  approval."  </P> <P> During Tuesday's meeting, council members Jerold Milner, Ginger Bremberg and  Mayor Carl Raggio indicated that they would not vote for exceptions to the  building freeze while the city studies changes in the zoning code. Councilman  John F. Day agreed with Zarian's proposal.  </P> <P> Zarian said he was disappointed by the outcome of the straw vote. He said the  projects in question were unfairly delayed because overburdened city officials  did not process the applications in time.  </P> <P> Raggio and Bremberg said they would make all new projects comply with whatever  zoning changes are approved. Milner, however, said he would consider granting  exemptions during the council discussion of the proposed zoning changes.  </P> <P> City Planning Director John McKenna said he expects to have the draft zoning  ordinance ready for the council's consideration by late February.  </P></p>

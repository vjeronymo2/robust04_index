			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTIONS INITIATED IN CASES OF DEATHS, INJURIES  </P> <P> Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in a wide variety of job-related  deaths and injuries. Here are outlines of some recent cases:  </P> <P> Michigan: A decision is pending from the Michigan Court of Appeals on whether  there is sufficient evidence for a trial in the carbon-monoxide death of a  cable TV installer. Prosecutors want to charge a company foreman with  involuntary manslaughter. They say he knew the van in which the man died had a  faulty exhaust system. Two lower courts have disagreed on the evidence issue.  </P> <P> Wisconsin: A jury convicted a company of reckless homicide in the death of a  man who drove a front-end loader off a 60-foot cliff. Prosecutors said the  employer knew the man had epilepsy, had given him less than 40 hours of  training and had no on-site supervisor. Another company pleaded no contest to  an endangerment charge and was fined in the death of a man killed when a crane  collapsed.  </P> <P> Texas: Two construction companies and one executive were convicted of  criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of three workers in separate trench  cave-ins. The three convictions were overturned on the grounds that state law  was preempted by federal occupational safety regulations. They are being  appealed. A third company has been charged in a similar case.  </P> <P> New York: An appeal is pending in the assault convictions of two executives of  Pymm Thermometer Corp. for exposing workers to toxic mercury. A judge dismissed  the verdict on preemption grounds.  </P></p>

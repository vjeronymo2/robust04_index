			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BP turns the tap off FT-SE Index: 2,522.6 (-1.1) A few years from now, investors may well look back on yesterday's results from BP as a critical point in the group's development. The traditional case for investing in BP shares was that a stated policy of at least maintaining the dividend in real terms protected shareholders from their exposure to volatile oil prices. After yesterday's announcement of an increase just below the headline rate of inflation, that policy is in question. More fundamentally, the company is shrinking. As that message sinks in, the remorseless underperformance of the shares may well continue. It is not easy to see where BP goes from here. Last year's capital spending of Pounds 4.5bn produced a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.1bn, bringing gearing to just under 80 per cent. In the second half, replacement cost profit was a mere Pounds 200m. Given that the immediate trading outlook is unchanged, it seems fair to conclude that earnings can no longer support the cost of the Pounds 227m quarterly dividend. Failing a rise in the oil price, a further cut in the real dividend seems only a matter of time. Granted, the group will be doing its utmost to stem the cash outflow this year. The capital budget has been slashed for all but the exploration and downstream operations. The assumption must be that further disposals will be needed to close the funding gap. As a strategy, it smacks of damage control rather than forward planning. BP could conceivably be rescued by the oil price. But like the US oil companies, it must be close to giving up hope on this score. After all, the entire industry is suffering from the past assumption that price rises would justify investment. If BP's difficulties are worse than most, it is because its balance sheet was weakened by the 1987 buy-back of the Kuwaiti holding at precisely the wrong point in the cycle. There seems little point in berating Mr Robert Horton, BP's hapless chairman. The wider issue is whether that single miscalculation will in the end bring the company's long-term future into question.</p>

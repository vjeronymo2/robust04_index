			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: F&amp;C; achievement with a touch of adventure - Investment Trusts THERE IS a reassuring solidity about the Foreign and Colonial investment trust. It is both the largest trust - with gross assets of Pounds 1,405m - and the oldest. Its name conjures up its Victorian origins. Founded in 1868, it was designed to offer investors a better return than that available on gilts (then yielding 3 per cent). The original portfolio contained such exotica as Danubian bonds and Egyptian railway loans. Michael Hart, its joint manager, joined Foreign &amp; Colonial in 1953 and has been running the trust since 1969. Along the way, he passed his company secretary examinations and studied at night school to get a degree from the London School of Economics. The trust has an excellent long-term record - in terms of net asset performance, it was second in the international general sector over the 10 years to end-1992, according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies. Someone who invested Pounds 1,000 in 1945, and then re-invested all the dividends, would now have more than Pounds 635,000; the same sum invested in a building society would have grown to just under Pounds 14,000. It all sounds respectable and solid but Foreign &amp; Colonial actually does some quite racy things. It speculates in currencies - at the end of 1992, for example, 40 per cent of its assets were in the UK stock market but only 31 per cent were in sterling. The trust is prepared to 'gear up' by borrowing to invest in shares, as witnessed by its Pounds 110m debenture issue in November 1989. It is also willing to venture into unusual areas, being one of the first British investors to buy Japanese stocks - in 1961 - and moving into Brazil early in the 1970s. Foreign &amp; Colonial also tries to take a contrarian approach and buys into markets when they are unfashionable. This approach does not always work - the trust was too optimistic about the Japanese market in 1992, for instance  -but the strategy is crucial to long-term success. Such a large trust, covering such a wide area, cannot be run by one man alone. Eric Elstob is the other joint manager, while Andrew Barker looks at the American market, Ian Wright at the Far East, and Stephen White at Europe. At the end of 1992, the spread of assets was UK (40 per cent), Europe (15 per cent), US (30 per cent), Japan (9 per cent), other Far East (4 per cent) and Latin America (2 per cent). The list of 10 biggest stocks has an international flavour: BTR, Shell, BAT, Robert Fleming, Glaxo, Cable &amp; Wireless and BT are all British but Home Depot, Great Lakes and Sysco are from the US. It is Foreign &amp; Colonial's international spread that appeals so much to private investors, who would find it very costly to construct such a diversified portfolio on their own. The global spread also explains its success, as the long-term fall in sterling has boosted the value of the group's international stocks. It does mean, though, that the trust can offer only a lowish yield - of 2 per cent - and does not qualify for full Pep status (see below). So, it is most suitable for those seeking long-term capital growth. Large general investment trusts fell out of favour in the 1980s, and some - like Globe, once the largest trust of all - disappeared via takeover. But Foreign &amp; Colonial has been nimble enough to avoid this fate; it was the first trust to launch a savings scheme in 1984. Since then, the number of shareholders has almost quintupled - to 56,751 - which has helped to narrow the discount considerably. The trust owns 30.5 per cent of its management company, Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, which has around Pounds 7.5bn of assets under management. Hypo Bank of Bavaria owns a 50 per cent stake in F&amp;C Management. In 1991, the trust announced its 21st consecutive annual increase in dividend. That sort of consistency has been the key to its success; and although Hart, who is 59, must retire some day, it is hard to see any reason why the trust should slip from its previous high standards. Key facts. The trust had gross assets of Pounds 1,405m and net assets of Pounds 1,223m as of February 3. At the close of business that day, the net asset value per share was 237p and the shares were trading at 219p, a discount of 7.7 per cent. The dividend yield was 2 per cent and the annual management fee is 0.3 per cent. Board. The trust has a large and diverse board. Apart from Hart, Elstob, Barker, Oliver Dawson and James Oglivy, all from the management group, there is also Sir Timothy Bevan (a former Barclays chairman); Sir John Egan, the chief executive of BAA; Haruko Fukuda, a director of Nikko Europe; Lord Lennox, a former ambassador to Spain; and Lord Rockley, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson. The chairman of the trust is John Sclater, also chairman of Berisford International. Savings scheme and Pep details. The minimum investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25 a month. The only charges are brokers' commission of 0.2 per cent and government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. Because Foreign &amp; Colonial has more than 50 per cent of its assets outside the European Community, it does not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance. Instead, you can invest Pounds 1,500 into the main trust and top up with one of the other trusts run by the group. On a lump sum Pep, there is an initial charge of Pounds 50 plus VAT (Pounds 5 plus VAT a month for regular savings); there is also an annual administration charge of Pounds 5 plus VAT a month. There is a top-up charge of Pounds 25 plus VAT and dealing charges within the Pep are 0.2 per cent. The minimum lump sum Pep investment is Pounds 2,000, or Pounds 100 a month.</p>

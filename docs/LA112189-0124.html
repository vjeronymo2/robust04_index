			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> TENNIS CLUB, CONDO PROJECT ON AGENDA  </P> <P> Proponents of a 10-acre tennis club and 53 adjacent condominiums are asking for  approval of their project at tonight's City Council meeting, despite a  recommendation from the Planning Commission that the development be denied.  </P> <P> The project by developer Cecil R. Bunnell has been in the works since 1986,  when he submitted plans for a tennis club and self-storage units at a site near  the corner of Camino Capistrano and Oso Road. That plan drew criticism from  city officials and neighbors.  </P> <P> The revised plan for 53 condominiums to replace the storage units was harshly  criticized by the Planning Commission last month in a unanimous vote against  the project.  </P> <P> "This was an awful project," said acting Planning Commission Chairwoman Carolyn  Nash. "We wouldn't allow it to be built anywhere in the city."  </P> <P> Nash said the proposal for 53 condominiums includes a plan to build 25 homes on  six acres near Trabuco Creek that is designated as permanent open space. She  also said that if the project were built as proposed, it would violate the city  General Plan.  </P> <P> The council meeting begins at 7 p.m. in City Hall, 32400 Paseo Adelanto.

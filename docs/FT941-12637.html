			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Longevity is raising new obstacles to inheritance - Financing the Family / Care of the elderly / Assets over Pounds 8,000 are used to pay for care if a person enters a residential home by arrangement with a local authority Longevity is putting a strain on many families. Middle-aged couples can find themselves worrying about two sets of ageing parents, who may slide rapidly from active self-reliance to total dependency. Some people in their 60s and 70s are still caring for frail parents in their 80s or 90s, writes Bethan Hutton. Anyone in this position comes under not only emotional but also financial pressure: help with caring at home is not cheap, and full-time care in a nursing home can cost more than the national average wage. There is still a common assumption that, when people become too frail or disabled to look after themselves, a whole range of social services opens up to help. To a certain extent, that is true - if your local social services department agrees that there is a need, and if you have no means to pay for yourself. But the welfare state no longer automatically pays for long-term nursing care for the elderly. Since April, any elderly person going into a nursing, or residential, home by the arrangement of a local authority has to be means-tested; and any assets over Pounds 8,000 are used to pay for care. This can include the family home, if no spouse or dependent relative is occupying it. Local authorities have no power to force the sale of a home, but they can put a charge on the property and claim some or all of the proceeds when it is eventually sold. The means-testing can also include a person's entire occupational pension, even if he or she has a spouse who is also dependent on it for an income. With nursing home fees running at Pounds 400 a week or more in some areas, it does not take long to wipe out the value of a house or a pension. Only when assets fall below Pounds 8,000 will the state step in. Families depend on their local authority to assess that the elderly person needs care - what is an intolerable situation from a carer's point of view may be seen differently by the social services department, particularly at a time of year when the budget is already overstretched. In such cases, if the family feels it can no longer cope, it will have to find the money for nursing care privately. Many old people intend their children to inherit the assets, including the family home, which they have accumulated over the years. The state pays no attention to such wishes. Transferring ownership of a property or investments before a person needs to go into a home may be in vain - the law says that, if a person has deliberately deprived himself of assets to increase his entitlement to benefits, he will be assessed as if he still had those assets. A lot of people remain unaware of the expense and the regulations involved in caring for a dependent elderly person until they are themselves landed with the responsibility, or a relative or friend is in that position. At that stage, they may begin to wonder whether any provision can be made to prevent them from becoming a burden on their own relatives or the state. The good news is that provision can be made, but the inevitable bad news is that it can be very expensive if you leave it until your late 50s or 60s, which is when the possible effect of old age and infirmity on a family and its finances tends to penetrate people's awareness. A handful of insurance companies offer products designed to meet the cost of nursing home care. As the population ages, and the welfare state is reduced to a safety net for those who have not made provision for themselves, further developments are likely in the next few years. Existing products come into two main categories: point-of-need products, designed for elderly people in imminent need of care; and long-term insurance, which is designed for younger people, worried that they may have to go into a home at some point in the future. Point-of-need products are generally based on impaired life annuities, for which a lump sum (perhaps from the sale of a home or a maturing investment) is needed. Anyone whose health has deteriorated to the stage where they need to go into a home is likely to have a reduced life expectancy, so insurance companies are willing to pay them a higher income from a lump sum than a healthy person of the same age. Sometimes an agreement is made between the insurance company and the care provider, that fees will go up by a fixed percentage each year, or follow the retail prices index, so that pay-outs can be stepped up in line, avoiding any shortfall due to inflation. Insurance against possible future need is offered by Commercial Union, PPP Lifetime, and Prime Health, among others. You pay a small regular or large one-off premium to buy cover for a certain amount a year or a week. If you already have a good pension, you may only need to insure for a top-up amount, rather than the full nursing home fees. Couples can choose joint life policies. Payment is triggered when a doctor certifies that you have become incapable of a certain number of 'activities of daily living', such as eating and going to the toilet unaided. Some policies have a half-way trigger, so that a portion of the sum insured can be paid when you become partially incapacitated, but can still remain in your own home. The third option is to step up your rate of general savings or pension contributions, to provide an extra cushion against health care costs; though, of course, this could reduce your entitlement to benefits, and if you need care for an extended period, your money could run out. It is sensible to get independent financial advice before picking any of these products, as structures and prices vary considerably. The suitability of any of them will depend on your age, state of health, and current financial position.</p>

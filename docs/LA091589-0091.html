			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGENTS SEIZE BOATS, CARS IN PROBE;  </P> <P> PROPERTY OWNED BY DEPUTIES IN DRUG UNIT HELD  </P> <P> Federal agents, investigating nine Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics  officers in connection with missing drug money, have seized personal property  owned by officers, sources said Thursday. And the mother of one of the  suspended investigators complained that her car was confiscated as part of the  probe.  </P> <P> In addition, sources close to the investigation said that the homes and offices  of eight deputies and their supervisor have been searched. All were relieved of  duty on Sept. 1 amid allegations that tens of thousands of dollars in drug  money seized in narcotics raids was unaccounted for.  </P> <P> Although court records remain sealed, one source said that in addition to the  search warrants, "there were also seizure warrants" that targeted specific  property owned by the narcotics officers.  </P> <P> State Department of Motor Vehicle records show that the officers own numerous  late-model automobiles and one has an antique Ford. The Times has found that at  least five of the officers own expensive boats and that two purchased the  vessels with cash during the last 14 months.  </P> <P> The source would not specify what property has been confiscated, but the mother  of one deputy told The Times that her own car was seized last week by Internal  Revenue Service agents.  </P> <P> Shirley Daub, whose son, Ronald E. Daub, was suspended two weeks ago, said that  IRS and FBI agents appeared at her Van Nuys home last Tuesday with a warrant  ordering her to surrender her 1988 Oldsmobile coupe.  </P> <P> Mrs. Daub said she had paid about $13,000 in cash to a Whittier car rental  agency for the used car but was told by federal agents that they believed that  the money came from her son as part of some "ill-gotten gains" as a narcotics  officer.  </P> <P> "They asked me where I got my money (for the car) like I committed a crime or  something," Mrs. Daub said. She said she had used some of her own savings,  along with money provided by a younger son, to buy the vehicle.  </P> <P> "I told them that I had saved money and had driven my old car for a long time,"  she said. "I've worked for most of my life, why isn't it possible that I bought  it myself?"  </P> <P> Her younger son, Reid, told The Times that he gave his mother some of the money  with proceeds from a house sale. He added that his brother, the veteran deputy,  had accompanied their mother to complete the car purchase -- but only because  no other family member was available.  </P> <P> "Regardless of what my brother did or didn't do (on the narcotics team), my  mother bought that car," Reid Daub said. "What right do they have to implicate  my mother in this investigation?"  </P> <P> Deputy Ronald Daub said he could not talk about the investigation on the advice  of his attorney. Robert Giannangeli, a spokesman for the IRS, declined comment,  as did Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Hagemann, who is heading the federal  money-skimming inquiry.  </P> <P> State and federal laws require that before property can be seized, warrants  must be filed in court establishing reason to believe that the property was  purchased with funds gained illegally or was used in an illegal activity. The  warrants remain sealed in this case.  </P> <P> In addition to Daub, the suspended officers include Sgt. Robert Sobel and  Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez,  John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna.  </P> <P> A source close to some of the officers confirmed that vehicles had been taken  by federal agents. But attorneys for two of the officers said they were unaware  of any seizures.  </P> <P> Attorney Mark Beck, who represents Sobel, said none of his client's boats or  cars had been confiscated. And Richard Hirsch, who is Bauder's lawyer, said  that no cars or boats were taken from his client. The deputies have  consistently declined comment or have been unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Mrs. Daub said federal agents asked her not only about her car but also whether  she had received any jewelry or expensive gifts recently from her deputy  sheriff son. The clear implication, she said, was that if she had received any  such gifts, it was from drug money.  </P> <P> "I felt like my civil rights were violated. . . . It was like, 'I'm his mother,  so shoot me,' " she said.  </P> <P> The eight deputies and a sergeant -- all members of a narcotics investigation  team -- were placed on administrative leave in what Sheriff Sherman Block  called possibly the worst scandal in his seven-year tenure.  </P> <P> State records show that Sobel, Daub, Cortez, Amers and Kaliterna all own nearly  new or costly boats.  </P> <P> According to sources, Sobel bought his 31-foot Huntermar sailboat for $31,500  in cashier's checks and cash in June. He is the legal owner of the vessel, the  state reports. The sergeant also owns a 1987 BMW and a 1988 Chevrolet Blazer.  </P> <P> Daub also bought a boat for cash, his purchase coming in 1988 for $17,668 for a  19-foot ski boat, sources said. Daub or his wife also own a 1988 motorcycle,  are making payments on a 1987 Cadillac sedan and are leasing a 1986 Nissan  coupe.  </P> <P> Cortez bought a 20-foot, 1989 ski boat for about $23,000 a year ago and is the  registered owner of a 1988 Chevy station wagon, a 1928 Ford and a 1978 Ford,  the DMV reports.  </P> <P> Kaliterna is the registered owner of a 19-foot ski boat, a 1989 Jeep and a 1984  Oldsmobile. Amers is the registered owner of a 1989 ski and pleasure boat that  is 22 1/2 feet long and a 1985 Chevrolet commercial vehicle.  </P> <P> Garner or his wife own a 1987 BMW 535i, a 1989 Ford Bronco, a 1980 Ford pickup  and a 1986 off-road vehicle.  </P> <P> Registration information was incomplete or could not be found for the remaining  deputies.  </P></p>

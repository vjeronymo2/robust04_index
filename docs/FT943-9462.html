			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Rapid deregulation urged for gas market The Consumers' Association today urges the government to move ahead quickly with deregulation of the domestic gas market. The association is concerned that the drive towards deregulation appears to be faltering. A statement expresses particular concern about the possible delay in introducing the necessary legislation to amend the present Gas Act. Mr Stephen Locke, the association's policy director, said: 'Any delay would mean a longer wait before customers see the benefits of competition. The government must get a move on. We have all had to put up with British Gas's unwelcome monopoly for too long.' The association was responding to the joint consultation paper by the government and Ofgas, the industry regulator, on opening up the domestic market to competition beginning in 1996. The association said it was concerned about recent British Gas statements that prices for large numbers of gas consumers might have to rise in the run-up to competition as cross-subsidies are removed. 'The current price formula guarantees annual price cuts, and competition must not threaten this,' it said. It also rejected suggestions that the activities of the Gas Consumers Council could be incorporated into Ofgas. British Gas has increased prices for as many as 400 industrial customers on its interruptible tariff. But it stressed that there would be no increase for customers using less than 1m therms a year. The company said it was obliged to operate a tariff until action was taken on the consultation document and deregulation introduced. The Gas Consumers Council denounced the move as 'part of a series of selective price increases while British Gas defends itself against competition'.</p>

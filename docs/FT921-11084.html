			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Just pensions Sir, So Mr Neil Kinnock is going to raise pensions 'at once' if elected, ie before equalising state pension ages. That would, of course, not only benefit many not in need, but further widen the gap in the treatment of comparable men and women, thereby certainly breaching the spirit - and probably, also, the law - of the EC directive on equal treatment in social security. Would not the Pounds 3bn or so it would cost to raise the pension be better spent in equalising pension age at 60 (to be the starting age of a pension decade) to bring justice to half the population and benefit to many now without pension or earnings?

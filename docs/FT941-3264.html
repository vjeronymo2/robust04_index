			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / French MP keeps immunity The French parliament declined to lift the immunity of Mr Michel Noir, mayor of Lyons, under investigation on suspicion of diverting city funds to finance his election campaign. A Lyons judge had asked parliament to lift Mr Noir's immunity so that he could be placed under judicial control, which could involve restricting his movements, barring him from contact with other persons in the case and possibly making him pay bail. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly, said the assembly's standing committee had ruled that, under the constitution, parliament's authorisation was required only if a member was to be arrested. 'The request said that the committee's authorisation was sought only for the measures involved in judicial control,' Mr Seguin said. Only if Mr Noir violated bail terms set by the judge and was subject to arrest would the assembly's permission be required, he added.</p>

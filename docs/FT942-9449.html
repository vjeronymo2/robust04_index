			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: La vera storia On a rainy Saturday, Luciano Berio's opera La vera storia crowned the South Bank's festival of his music magnificently - perhaps even beyond the expectations of the festival-planners and the BBC, who put this concert version on. Premiered at La Scala in 1982 but new to Britain, La vera storia was here 'semi-staged' by Tim Hopkins, as tidily as could be managed on a stage crowded with Berio's very large orchestra. Berio's dramatic plan for Act 1 involves only bare archetypes on the 19th century Italian model: as exemplified by the four principals of Verdi's Il trovatore - their operatic voice-types, their standard roles, sentiments and fraught relations ' and by his lusty crowd-choruses. There is no story (true or otherwise), just a second-order 'story' about what those musical stories were like and what they meant. So far, so Italo Calvino, who indeed wrote the libretto. He and Berio discussed ideas for the opera in 1977, and soon he supplied the words, first for the archetypal chorus in its many moods, jocularly unbuttoned or feral or political, and then for the soloists, stereotypical too but more elevated. At that point Calvino apparently withdrew to let Berio develop his own plan for Act 2. It recycles the music and most of the first-act words, with some re-ordering and reassignment to different voices, for a more immediate drama: an urban nightmare of modern authoritarianism, with the 1969 Milan scandal about the death-in-custody of the anarchist Pinelli at its polemical heart. Berio conducted the BBC Symphony with many extra players, its full-time singers, its part-time chorus and various electronics chaps, to hugely assured effect. In Act 1, which proceeds in block-like distinct numbers, the chorus shone in theirs, as did the peripatetic brass band. For some of the excellent soloists, the onslaught of Berio's exposed, brass-heavy orchestra (designed for quarantine in an opera-pit) was daunting ' but not for Felicity Palmer's 'Azucena' archetype: indomitably eloquent, and superbly forceful in tragedy-vein. Still less Milva's stentorian ballad-singer, intruding brassily wry, down-to-earth songs amid the idealised operatic routine of Act 1 (vide Zerbinetta in Strauss's Ariadne,and Brecht passim). Berio intended the successive ballads for various voices, but since Milva can deliver every one to perfection she sang them all. Between them, Milva and Miss Palmer claimed Berio's most intimately characterful vocal lines, inspired by the accents of southern Italian folk song. In Act 2, where the orchestral weight is more fluently lightened, all the other soloists (Sue Patchell, Luisa Castellani, Michael Myers, David Wilson-Johnson, Jeremy White and Peter Hall) came into their own, as did Berio's jazzy clarinet and saxophone. If the semi-staging left the implied action vague, the music rendered it cruel and clear - but visionary too. Though at the very least La vera storia is agit-prop of a high order, all its best music transcends that. A full staging at Covent Garden or the ENO would be an exciting prospect.</p>

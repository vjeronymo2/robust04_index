FBC also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 7, 1994, under the designation of Docket No. 94&hyph;19, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 16685). On April 26, 1994, the docket was redesignated 94&hyph;22 (59 FR 21800). This notice grants the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.1.7,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of Standard No. 116 states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When brake fluid is tested according to S6.7, at the storage temperature and for the storage times given in Table II_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Upon inversion of the sample bottle, the time required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid shall not exceed the bubble flow times shown in Table II; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) On warming to room temperature, the fluid shall resume the appearance and fluidity that it had before chilling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table II of S5.1.7 states that when the brake fluid is stored at ^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C. for 144 hours  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  4.0 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 10 seconds. When stored at ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C. for 6 hours  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0.2 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 35 seconds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notified FBC that a sample of Prestone Brake Fluid, AS&hyph;400, failed to meet the no-crystallization requirements of S5.1.7 (NHTSA file NCI 3293). FBC's initial investigation determined that the brake fluid was packaged on May 4, 1993, at its subsidiary, Paulsboro Packaging, Inc., and that the fluid was manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and identified as UCC's PM6060, lot  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0319083. FBC further stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All [of the] product in FBC's distribution system packaged from the specific lot  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0319083 was placed on hold and all packaging of Brake Fluid PM6060 was ceased pending a full investigation and implementation of corrective measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FBC produced 202,704 units (12.0 fl.oz.) from lot  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0319083, and currently has 61,752 units on hold at various warehouses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on review of all data and consultation with UCC, it is FBC's opinion that the noncompliance will not affect product performance in a motor vehicle or create a safety concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FBC is recommending that no recall of [the] product outside of FBC's distribution system be made. It is further recommended that the product in inventory (61,752 units) also be released for sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FBC also stated that it has elected to convert to an alternative UCC brake fluid identified as PM6340, which has a freeze point of ^65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C., and will provide an added margin to meet the requirements of S5.1.7, Standard No. 116.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of its petition, FBC attached a letter from UCC, dated January 17, 1994. The UCC letter describes the results of tests it performed on samples of the noncompliant brake fluid:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically with regard to the DOT ``Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature'' test (FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7), Union Carbide Corporation, using the DOT FMVSS 116 procedure, performed the test at ^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C for 6 days [144 hours] and ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C for 6 hours. Following completion of the tests:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> at ^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C for 6 days, the sample passed all requirements. The sample met the requirements for appearance at low temperature, bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ^at ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C for 6 hours, the sample passed the requirements of bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. Upon completion of the 6 hours at ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C, some crystallization was noted in the sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _attempts were made to isolate the crystallized material. It was a soft, non-abrasive gel that was difficult to isolate as it flowed with the brake fluid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Union Carbide Corporation also conducted the test of FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7 on the sample with rigorous temperature control at ^49 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C to more closely realize the ^48 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C limit of the test's specified temperature range (Section 5.1.7 test parameter: ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C). The sample was clear, showed no crystals, had a bubble travel time of approximately 5 seconds and regained its appearance and fluidity at room temperature. These results were confirmed by a second run at the same conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

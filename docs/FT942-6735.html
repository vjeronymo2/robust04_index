			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Liffe seeks Pounds 10m via rights issue Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, hopes to raise up to Pounds 10m through a rights issue which it says is primarily aimed at addressing the demand for trading permits. Liffe plans to issue 'quarter-shares' by way of a bonus which may be converted into full A,B,C or E shares on a 4-for-1 basis. A share in Liffe entitles the holder to a permit which allows them to trade specific products. Holders of A shares can trade in all futures, B shares in all financial options, C shares in all futures except long gilt and short sterling contracts, D shares in all equity options, and E shares in all futures except long gilt, short sterling, bund and Euro-mark contracts. Liffe said the issue would provide for a 25 per cent increase in each relevant category of trading permit. The amounts payable on conversion are: Pounds 50,000 for A shares, Pounds 25,000 for B and C shares and Pounds 6,250 for E shares. Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the issue would overcome the potential constraints on the further development of futures and financial options business on Liffe.</p>

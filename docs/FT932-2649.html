			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (6): Uncertainty inhibits inflow of capital  -Ray Bashford and Anthony Robinson find that foreign investors are hesitating THE SLOW flow of foreign capital into Poland remains one of the biggest obstacles to long-term growth. While there have been notable successes in the automotive, telecommunications and paper industries, a hesitancy remains among foreign investors which is inhibiting an acceleration in industrial development. Listed, the reasons for investment in Poland are impressive. It has a population of 40m people, relatively low wages, a motivated and well educated workforce, good transport connections and historic ties with potentially large markets to the east. Yet the overhang of political uncertainty, a tradition of labour militancy and doubts about doing business in a country which is still in default on large foreign debts act to negate these advantages. In addition, as government officials are well aware, Poland is in competition with Hungary and the Czech republic for the attention of the foreign investor. Hungary, for example, lacks the domestic market of Poland, but embarked on market-type reforms much earlier while both the Hungarians and the Czechs have greater access to international capital markets. The Czech republic has the added advantage of being relatively unencumbered by foreign debt. But Hungary, which received roughly 60 per cent of the estimated Dollars 7bn equity capital invested in post-communist central Europe by the end of last year, has itself entered a pre-electoral phase of political turbulence and is suffering from an unexpected slowness in resuming economic growth. Czech prospects have also been dimmed by the collapse in post-divorce trade with Slovakia and uncertainty over the outcome of its mass privatisation programme. Now there are signs of a growth in foreign investor interest in Poland, despite the uncertainty generated by last month's no-confidence vote and elections in the autumn. Mr Ian Hume, who heads the World Bank office in Poland, is one well placed observer who believes that Poland is experiencing a 'mini-boom' for foreign capital after a slow start. A businessman echoes this guarded optimism. 'You look at the telephone book here and it's like a Who's Who of international companies,' he says. 'The problem is that most of them have small representative offices and are still looking at what's available and how conditions are.' The completion of detailed comparative studies of 36 sectors of the Polish economy prior to privatisation has shed new light on several thousand Polish enterprises which are now open to purchase by competitive tender. Entrepreneurs who specialise in Poland's many smaller sized industrial companies, like Mr George Bonner of the Toronto-based UNP, enthuse about the 'hidden jewels' waiting to be burnished by an injection of capital, management know-how, foreign patents and patience. Meanwhile Poland is acutely aware that it is competing in a world hungry for investment. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the minister for privatisation, says: 'These are recessionary times; we are being forced to compete not only with Hungary and the Czech republics but also with Asia and Latin America for foreign investment.' Some potential investors go away empty-handed. A western banker in Warsaw cites one US company which, after spending considerable time examining prospects in Poland, finally decided to set up in Mexico. While noting the difficulties, Mr Lewandowski believes, however, that there are encouraging signs that foreign investment, either funded or committed, will reach Dollars 10bn in three years. With the present total standing at between Dollars 4bn-Dollars 4.5bn, he forecasts an average annual inflow of Dollars 2bn - which is at the top end of estimates from Polish and foreign businessmen. A feature of the figures is the wide gap between the amount foreign companies have directly invested in buying assets and the sums they have pledged to invest in the longer term. The overall picture is distorted by Fiat's decision to buy a majority stake in FSM, the small car producer in southern Poland. The Italian group has made a commitment to invest between Dollars 1.8m-Dollars 2bn within eight years. The Fiat deal gives an example, too, of how, after taking on the debt of the companies they are buying, foreign companies are putting a small amount of money up front, compared with the total funds committed. After the initial purchase of the plant the Italian group has given an undertaking to invest 10 times this amount in the longer term. This gap, which is much greater in Poland than in Hungary, is present in most of the large deals. In part it reflects a reluctance by foreign companies to arrange large-scale financing before testing market conditions, as well as concern about trade relations with the EC. They would also like to hear a stronger and clearer voice of support for foreign investment from the government. Another brake on inward investment is an unwillingness by western banks to lend at normal rates to projects in Poland. The country has yet to reach agreement with its bank creditors on a Dollars 12.1bn debt which has gone unserviced since the autumn of 1989. But negotiations with the London Club of bank creditors are proceeding, with the aim of achieving an overall 50 per cent write-off followed by the resumption of normal banking relations. Foreign investment remains a contentious issues. Even those politicians who have been pushing the reform process have been reticent to issue public statements of strong support for foreign investment. Mr Jerzy Strzelecki, under-secretary of state in the Ministry of privatisation, says that it is common to hear arguments about 'selling off the family silver'. In many cases he believes this has more to do with political rhetoric than strong opposition. Mr Strzelecki does not expect to see any fundamental change in the attitude to foreign investment as a result of the forthcoming elections. But he feels that there could be some alterations in the timetable for decisions in the run-up to the September polls. The remittance of profits is not a vital question, as most companies are still concentrating on bringing funds in. Those who do have profits to move abroad have done so with a minimum of interference from the government. As an incentive for investment the government is willing to consider tax concessions for projects worth over ECU 2m in areas of high unemployment, or where modern technology is being brought in and the investment is to concentrate on export production. Italy, through its Fiat investment, is by far the biggest source of funds. Excluding this deal, Italian enterprises have invested 5.4 per cent of the total (according to government figures). US capital accounts for 18 per cent  -with the International Paper Company purchase of the Gwydzin paper and pulp plant raising its proportion. Germany's contribution is relatively low. The Poles explain that this is caused by Germany's preoccupation with eastern territories, but historic tensions have also contributed to the reluctance. The western neighbour's total could rise significantly if it wins the competition to buy the remaining state telephone switching gear manufacturer. A wait-and-see attitude continues. Investors which have made the jump report solid process. As a western banker put it: ' People are being slow to come to Poland but I know of no foreign company which regrets coming here.'</p>

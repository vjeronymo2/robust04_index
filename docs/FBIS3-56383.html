			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine says the three-  nation agreement that Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine signed in  Moscow on Friday [14 January] to withdraw the nuclear weapons  his country inherited from the former Soviet Union is an  indication of understanding of Kiev's problems rather than the  result of pressure or arm twisting.    Speaking at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow on Friday, he  said the new agreement would be make it possible to send the  Start-I treaty for parliamentary ratification because the  conditions set in a resolution by the Supreme Soviet have now  been removed.    Kravchuk says his country is given assurances of security  guarantees, territorial integrity, financial incentives for the  weapons and help in dismantling them, and no threat of economic  pressure.    For its part, Moscow is committed to supply fuel grade  uranium to Ukraine, minus the cost of dismantling the weapons  and reprocessing the nuclear warheads, Kravchuk told Interfax.    He said that experts on all sides are yet to estimate the  amount and form of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons  to be withdrawn from Ukraine. One option is to write off the  Ukrainian debt for fuel imports from Russia, Kravchuk said.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  told Interfax Friday that as a result of the dismantling of  Ukrainian missiles Kiev would receive nuclear fuel in the form  of rods for uranium reactors, but "there is no question about  writing off the Ukrainian debt to Russia."    In response to Kozyrev's statement his Ukrainian counterpart  Anatoliy Zlenko underlined in his conversation with Interfax  that this form of compensation is foreseen in the tripartite  Russian- American-Ukrainian agreement on the withdrawal of  nuclear missiles from the Ukraine's territory signed in Moscow.    The Ukrainian leader denied allegations that his country was  offered $1 billion as compensation for the withdrawal of its  nuclear weapons. He said the question was not on the agenda.    As a next step, said Kravchuk, Moscow and Kiev could try to  resolve the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet this year,  proceeding from the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea.  If the two problems are removed, he said, this will help to put  bilateral relations on a friendlier footing as befits partners  and good neighbors.</p>

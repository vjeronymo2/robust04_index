			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Ten die in Kabul attack Three shells slammed into a crowded bazaar in Kabul yesterday, killing at least 10 people and wounding 16, while delegates to an assembly to elect a new Afghan president were meeting nearby, Reuter reports from Kabul. It was not known who fired the shells but army officers reported clashes around the city between government forces and fighters of the formerly communist militia. The attack was one of the worst since fighting last August between the army and a maverick mujahideen party, when rockets and shells killed more than 2,500 people in Kabul.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Danes face leaner future within EC FOR 20 years the Danes have enjoyed the economic benefits of European Community membership. At the same time they have shown no interest in political integration which would lead to a European union. Having the best of both worlds may prove much more difficult after Tuesday's referendum result. Not that the Danes want to leave the Community. A Gallup poll earlier this week showed 67 per cent wanting to remain in the EC, with only 21 per cent against. But there is scant support for any moves towards federalism, a point that Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, was keen to stress in his 'Yes to Maastricht' campaign. He told voters that all they were being asked to do was to back further political co-operation. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, yesterday described a United States of Europe as nothing more than a 'beautiful dream' which could not be realised. Mr Hans Jorgen Nielsen, of Copenhagen's Institute of Political Science, said: 'No Danish survey whatsoever has shown sympathy for strengthening supranational institutions or the existence of a European identity.' The voters who said No reflected a cross-section of opinion, stretching beyond protest groups familiar in other anti-EC campaigns. The loss of political sovereignty emerged as a burning issue. The gender gap was particularly noticeable - nearly 60 per cent of women rejecting the Maastricht treaty. Danish women seem to have been swayed by the argument that a vote for Maastricht would threaten the social welfare system and be a step nearer a European army. There was a comfortable Yes majority among men. The second largest group of No voters came from supporters of the main opposition Social Democrats. Their recently elected leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has been attacked for not being effective enough in its Yes campaign. Around 60 per cent of his party's supporters voted No. A group of No voters, who helped to tip the balance, was identified as fishing communities on the West Jutland coast, once staunch supporters of the EC. They were apparently protesting at what they see as the bureaucratic way in which the common fisheries policy is administered by Brussels. Opinions differ on the future of Danish politics. The Social Democrats would like to cash in on their supporters' evident disaffection with the government, but the parliamentary balance has not changed and the next general election could be at least two years off. But Mr Ellemann-Jensen warns: 'We have a crisis of confidence between the voters and the political parties.' He points out that only a few weeks ago the Danish parliament voted 130-25 in favour of ratifying the treaty. Mr Nielsen disagrees. 'It is hardly a general revolt against the politicians. The parties are not being punished. The Social Democrats continue to be strong.' In his opinion the outcome came down to a simple lack of interest among Danes in the outside world.</p>

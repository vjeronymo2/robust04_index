			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Falling prices could drive Japan into the rough: Lower golf course fees and other consumer costs may not be all good news The Dollars 130 round of golf has at last arrived in Japan. Last month, some clubs just outside Tokyo began charging Y13,000 for so-called 'self days' - 18 holes without a caddy. A few years ago the same courses were charging between Y30,000 and Y40,000 for an afternoon's entertainment. What is happening on the golf courses is typical of the most striking by-product of the country's long recession - falling prices. Prices of many goods and services are in steep decline. Though the government's official statistics say that consumer price inflation is still positive, at 0.9 per cent last month, hardly anyone believes them any longer. The official index - revised every five years - measures patterns of spending that are no longer prevalent in Japan. In particular, it underweights both services, such as a round of golf, and the vast discount sector that has sprung up in the last few years. Japanese consumers have sharply increased the proportion of their household spending in these discount emporia - yet these sales are barely picked up in the official figures. Unofficial evidence suggests prices have been falling for more than a year. A recent survey by the large Seiyu supermarket chain estimated that prices in its shops had dropped by 6 per cent in the last year. Even the official figures show that wholesale prices are falling. For many economists, the decline carries with it alarming echoes of the prolonged global deflation of the 1930s when a collapse in prices forced companies to cut wages and lay off workers, leading in turn to a fall in demand as unemployment rose and disposable incomes fell. In the Japan of the 1990s price-cutting has already burnt deep into corporate profits. As Mr Alexander Kinmont, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, says, 'sectors that are heavily dependent on domestic labour are being squeezed sharply, as the prices of their goods fall while demand for their products remains flat.' Service sector companies are typical. Price cutting in the airline sector has sent companies such as Japan Airlines into pretax losses for the last three years. Even manufacturers, though they are less labour-intensive, have reported stagnant profits directly attributable to price-cutting. However, Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, believes the worst is already past. He argues that this 'demand deflation', or weak demand forcing down prices, was what Japan experienced in the first phase of recession in 1991-93. The current phase, he argues, is marked by a much more beneficial 'cost-driven deflation'. The rapid appreciation of the yen in the last year and falling input costs are now enabling companies to cut prices without severely denting their profitability. The lower prices are then feeding through directly to the consumer whose purchasing power has risen as a result. 'The acceleration of growth will continue, while prices continue to fall - precisely the combination that implies a supply-driven deflation.' Economic theory suggests this ought to be the quickest route out of recession. Falling prices raise real disposable income, making customers more likely to spend. Higher spending raises corporate profits and lifts the economy out of slump. But the beneficial impact on companies is limited by the price elasticity of demand for their goods - the amount by which sales rise as prices fall. New research by economists at the Industrial Bank of Japan suggests that for manufactured goods, each 1 per cent fall in price raises sales by just 0.17 per cent. For services the figure is 0.63 per cent. In other words, higher spending is not offsetting losses in revenue caused by lower prices. In any case, there is continuing doubt about the willingness of Japanese consumers to spend. As Mr Kinmont says: 'If a customer thinks prices of consumer durables, for example, will be 5 per cent lower in a year's time, he will defer his spending. The danger is that consumers will go on doing that, leading to a downward spiral.' And there is certainly scant evidence of a recovery in consumer spending. Despite the fall in prices, retail sales fell by 4 per cent in the year to May. Even allowing for the higher spending at the discount stores (not reflected in these figures either), it is likely that sales are still falling. But the biggest danger of all in deflation lies in the huge corporate debt burden. Corporate indebtedness rose sharply in the boom years of the late 1980s. A prolonged period of falling prices raises the real level of that debt, and makes it harder for companies to service it. It is a sobering thought on the putting greens around Tokyo. Many of the courses were built in the boom years of the late 1980s, on the back of huge borrowings. Falling green fees may be good news for golfers, but the courses need more revenue, not less, to meet their debt-servicing costs. They might not survive the Dollars 50 round, if it comes.</p>

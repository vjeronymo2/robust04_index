			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Plan for private sector to take over running of 20 pits PRIVATE SECTOR companies are to be given the opportunity to run 20 pits under plans for the first stage of privatisation of the coal industry. British Coal has added two pits which had been mothballed for several years to the 18 which the government said in its coal white paper last month would be offered to independent operators. It also emerged yesterday that under proposals being finalised this week, British Coal intends to offer the pits on a one-by-one basis, rather than wait for the conclusion of consultations with unions on all 20. This raises the possibility that British Coal will advertise for bids in about a month and could result in some pits reopening under private sector control in the autumn or early winter. The sale or licensing of the pits - either is a possibility - will be the prelude to full privatisation of the industry, including the 31 remaining pits. British Coal executives expect a privatisation bill to be tabled in the autumn with royal assent likely in the middle of next year. British Coal also plans to offer for sale in the late summer its Coal Products subsidiary, which makes and sells smokeless fuel, and Compower, a data-processing business dealing with pay systems. A management buy-out team will be among the likely bidders for Coal Products, which has a turnover of Pounds 150m a year. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said yesterday that he also hoped a new home could be found for the Coal Research Establishment, a research agency, possibly under another government organisation. British Coal expects to complete later this week the initial legal documentation for the potential sale or leasing the 20 pits. The pits which have now been added to the list are Frances, Fife, which has been mothballed since 1984 when it produced 350,000 tonnes a year, and Keresley, Warwickshire, which closed in 1991 when production was 1.2m tonnes. These are added to 12 pits earmarked for closure and six for care and maintenance. British Coal has rejected requests from potential bidders, including the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, that it continues to mine the pits pending lease negotiations. Mr Ray Proctor, executive in charge of the leasing or sale arrangements, also said yesterday that British Coal would take some machinery from the pits. 'We have to be conscious of the needs of the continuing collieries,' he said. Any mines licensed will be added to the 94 which already operate in the private sector. Their output, at 1.1m tonnes a year, is small compared to British Coal's, and they employ an average of 12 people. The new generation of licensed mines will be able to employ up to 150 people under legislation which is unlikely to be changed before full privatisation. Sale boards go up, Page 10</p>

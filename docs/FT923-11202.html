			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / French ex-minister admits he knew of Aids-infected blood A FORMER French junior health minister, Mr Edmond Herve, told a Paris court yesterday he knew in June 1985 that blood stocks being used in transfusions were contaminated with the Aids virus. He said, however, that he had followed the unanimous advice of experts in allowing blood stocks to be used for a transitional period before blood Aids activists are pictured left outside the court brandishing red-daubed portraits of Fabius and Mitterrand disinfected by heating became available. Mr Herve appeared as a witness in the trial of four former senior health officials charged with allowing blood to be used for transfusions which they knew to be infected with the Aids virus. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the socialist party and prime minister at the time the victims were given their transfusions, told the court he 'was never made aware of heat treatments'. At the time he had seen the need to act rapidly on Aids. 'As soon as the scientific elements were gathered, I decided for obligatory testing,' he said. 'It was my function as prime minister.' It is not yet known exactly how many people contracted the Aids virus in France after receiving contaminated blood. At least 1,200 haemophiliacs have already had the virus and more than 250 have died. The lawyers representing the victims claim that the final tally of sufferers will run to several thousand. The four health officials on trial have been accused of using the blood even though they were aware that disinfection techniques were available and that Aids-free supplies were available from other countries.

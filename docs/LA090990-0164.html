			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST SPUTTERS IN 21-7 VICTORY OVER RIO HONDO  </P> <P> There were no surprises Saturday afternoon during L.A. Southwest's football  opener against Rio Hondo at Southwest. It turned into a rather boring and  sloppy game with little scoring and few exciting plays.  </P> <P> But Southwest's players were ecstatic after the 21-7 victory in which they  committed numerous penalties and four turnovers.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad we got through this," Southwest Coach Henry Washington said.  "We're going to be a lot better football team down the line.'  </P> <P> Washington also believes that sophomore quarterback Craig Manigo, who led  Southwest to its first postseason bowl last year, will perform a lot better in  the future.  </P> <P> "I think Craig was a little nervous," he said. "I expect him to do a lot better  later on."  </P> <P> The 5-foot-9, 150-pound Manigo completed 10 of 19 passes for 101 yards, three  touchdowns and three interceptions. His 12-yard touchdown pass to freshman  receiver Michael Stephens started the scoring with 11:38 left in the second  quarter.  </P> <P> The pass completed a five-play, 39-yard drive. Freshman Angel Andrade's extra  point put the Cougars ahead, 7-0.  </P> <P> Rio Hondo, third in the Foothill League last season, scored its only touchdown  with 2:46 remaining in the second quarter after linebacker Gus Flores  intercepted a Manigo pass that was intended for Stephens.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners went 46 yards on four plays to tie the score. Quarterback  Albert Solarzano passed to Gabe Cotero for a 25-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> The Cougars drove 66 yards on six plays on their next possession. Manigo passed  27 yards to freshman tight end Michael Scott for a 13-7 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> The Cougars scored their last touchdown with 9:40 remaining. After driving 43  yards in eight plays, Southwest punted only to regain possession and 15 yards  after a Rio Hondo penalty on the kick.  </P> <P> Freshman running back Larry Edmonds ran five yards on first down, and Manigo  hit Stephens for a 12-yard touchdown pass and 19-7 lead.  </P> <P> Manigo connected with Stephens for the two-point conversion and 21-7 lead.  </P> <P> The Cougars are off next week. They will open Western State Conference play at  Harbor College on Sept. 22.  </P></p>

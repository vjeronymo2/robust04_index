			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Pre-Christmas sales dismay retailers THE VOLUME of pre-Christmas sales was sharply lower than retailers had hoped for, in spite of heavy price discounting, while retail sales this month are expected to fall for the first time since June last year. This is the message from the latest Distributive Trades Survey conducted by the Confederation of British Industry. Retailers report that sales in December were fractionally up on a year ago, but by much less than had been anticipated in the November survey. The heavy price discounting seen throughout last month did not produce the hoped-for boost, said Mr Nigel Whittaker, survey panel chairman. Moreover, what sales there were involved consumers moving their purchases forward from this month to December. 'As a result, retailers now expect sales to weaken in January,' Mr Whittaker said. The survey, conducted between December 16 and January 8, shows that 39 per cent of retailers reported sales last month above the level of the same month the year before, while 34 per cent reported lower sales. This gives a positive balance of 5 percentage points, compared with a positive balance of 28 points for those who had been expecting higher sales last month. Taking the distributive trades as a whole, covering 15,000 outlets in the wholesale and motor trades as well as retailers, the picture was even more gloomy. Overall, 31 per cent of traders reported higher sales in December than the year before, with 38 per cent reporting lower sales. The negative percentage balance of 7 points comes after three successive months in which sales were reported to be up on the same month the previous year. Among retailers, grocers and chemists reported continued year-on-year growth in sales, while off-licences and retailers of footwear and durable goods all reported sales volumes below those of the previous year. Clothing retailers experienced a particularly sharp turn-around after two months of sales growth. Only 25 per cent of retailers expect sales this month to be higher than a year ago, with 31 per cent expecting lower sales. This balance of expectations suggests that overall sales will fall this month for the first time since June. Off-licences and booksellers expect the largest declines. Modest sales growth and falling expectations for trade this month have led retailers to cut back both on stocks and on wholesale orders. A higher proportion of retailers reported placing lower orders with suppliers last month than in December the previous year, and similar numbers expect to reduce orders this month. Lower orders from retailers have already bitten into wholesale sales, which have slipped below the depressed levels of December 1990 after three months of year-on-year growth. A total of 27 per cent of wholesalers report higher sales last month compared with 37 per cent reporting lower sales. The negative balance of 10 points remains above the low of a negative balance of 48 percentage points in February. Sales in the motor trades remain poor and are expected to deteriorate again this month, although at a slower rate than last year. Most report lower sales last month, although the negative balance of 47 points is an improvement on the low of a negative balance of 89 points in May of last year, while sellers of parts and accessories report sales last month up on the year before.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   RETAIL SALES BY CATEGORY: 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Per cent balances     Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail total           -7   -1   11    0  -8  -4   0  11   8  20  25   5 Grocers                51   64   46   52  59  62  54  30  50  41  67  43 Specialists food      -37  -10   -4  -45  -1 -34 -42  -6  -3   6  23  -6 Confectionery,   papers, tobacco      34   38   48    6  33   6  35  50  25  57  36 -15 Off-licences          -23  -49  -13  -34 -45 -64 -62 -46  -7 -23 -26 -34 Clothing                5   -2    8   -7 -30  -2 -15  13 -31  37  47  -9 Footwear              -59  -86  -78  -51 -32 -52  -9 -43 -48  17 -15 -44 Durable household   goods               -11  -42   13  -15 -10 -15 -45 -26 -42   7  -5 -23 Booksellers &amp;   Stationers          -50  -52  -27  -45 -27 -35  -3 -33 -28 -15 -32 -48 Chemists              -26   28   -4    8 -36  -4 -14  26  83  25  37  26 Other retail          -57  -11  -27  -27 -51 -28 -50 -11  -7 -18 -24 -24 Furniture/carpets     -43  -27   39   43 -69 -59  52  40  53  11  15  56 Hardware, china, DIY  -40  -58   -8  -34 -26  -4 -32  27  18  -5 -20 -13 Motor trades          -71  -76  -70  -79 -89 -82 -65 -56 -66 -63 -50 -47  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI Distributive Trades Survey  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are balances: the numbers of traders reporting sales on a year ago, less those reporting decreases.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL BALKS AT PARKLAND PRICE TAG;  </P> <P> FRYMAN CANYON: COUNCILMAN YAROSLAVSKY SAYS A $1.96-MILLION CITY CONTRIBUTION  FOR THE PROPERTY COULD JEOPARDIZE OTHER SITE ACQUISITIONS.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council delayed a vote Tuesday on a proposal to spend  $1.96 million to help buy Fryman Canyon for parkland after Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky expressed concern that the high price might jeopardize other park  acquisitions.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said there were two possible park sites in his Westside district --  one near Fossil Ridge and the other in Benedict Canyon -- that might be aborted  by the Fryman Canyon purchase.  </P> <P> The decision to delay a vote until Nov. 7 came on the recommendation of  Councilman Michael Woo, whose district includes the steep and heavily wooded  canyon where property owner Fred Sahadi has proposed building 26 luxury houses.  </P> <P> Woo told colleagues there was no need to allocate the money as long as the  Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state park agency, is still studying  whether to participate in a plan, devised by Woo and Mayor Tom Bradley, to buy  the 63-acre canyon for $10.9 million.  </P> <P> The Bradley-Woo plan called for the conservancy to put up $8.7 million, the  city to contribute $1.96 million and private parties to provide $250,000 in  charitable contributions.  </P> <P> The conservancy board of directors on Monday reaffirmed its "historic interest"  in buying Fryman Canyon but refused to approve the Bradley-Woo plan until it  checked with the state attorney general's office and the state Department of  General Services about the terms. The conservancy board gave itself a Nov. 5  deadline to reach a decision.  </P> <P> The conservancy has been reluctant to participate in a deal to buy the canyon  if the total price is more than $8.7 million -- a valuation once agreed upon as  fair by state officials. Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston has  expressed concerns about paying $10.9 million when his agency does not have a  state-approved appraisal justifying the price.  </P> <P> Questions about the deal also began to surface on the council floor Tuesday.  Yaroslavsky warned his colleagues that if too much is paid for Fryman Canyon,  other worthwhile Santa Monica Mountains parkland purchases "would be blown out  the window." The per-acre price would be among the highest in the history of  the conservancy.  </P> <P> "Up until now you haven't heard from other quarters," Yaroslavsky said. "But  this decision may have an impact on other projects and we need to minimize  that. There are major acquisitions that are much cheaper than this one. I don't  think the people want to pay a developer more for his property than it's  worth."  </P> <P> Woo, in a testy reply, said: "I am not proposing to pay the developer more than  it's worth." The councilman also pledged to work with other council members to  be "sensitive to parks projects in your districts."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky's concerns echoed those of Joyce Coleman, a top Sierra Club  official, who objected to any conservancy attempt "to raid funds set aside to  protect and expand Solstice Canyon Park" in Malibu. For it to pay $8.7 million  for Fryman Canyon would require the conservancy to drop other acquisition  projects.  </P> <P> The council agreed to set Nov. 7 as the next date for taking up the question of  spending the $1.96 million.  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, the council voted 6 to 5 to reject a plan to make half of Fryman  Canyon a cultural-historic landmark. Opponents of the housing development  originally sought landmark status as a means to preserve the land. But in  recent months, that proposal had taken a back seat to a plan to acquire the  Studio City site as a park.  </P></p>

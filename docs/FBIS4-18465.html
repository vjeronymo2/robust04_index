			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bossi: League Must Set Terms; </F> Pannella: Stop Squabbling"]    [Text] (ANSA) Pontedilegno, Italy, April 2 -- Northern  League leader Umberto Bossi today declared that his movement  "must be in a position" to set the terms for coming changes as  another ally of Forza Italia's Silvio Berlusconi said if the  struggle on the victorious right is not stopped, it would be  better to return to the polls.    Bossi, the pivotal figure in Berlusconi's Freedom Front  alliance keeping the nation guessing on a government-formation  timetable five days after the watershed general election, said  the swing to the right was "horizontal, and not vertical. We  want a vertical shift, towards federalism" and reiterated his  opposition to businessman Berlusconi in the premier's office.    Speaking at a mountain retreat here, near the northern city  of Brescia, the League leader said in talks in Rome Wednesday [6  April], after the holiday break, the agenda will be topped by  federalism and that debate must be extended to "all the  political parties because I want to listen closely to what these  people have to say, on the platforms and not on chit-chat."    "I have to get a good understanding of the room there is for  a constituent government, which I feel is essential, and I want  precise guarantees for forming it. From now until April 15 we  have to use the time available to us well," he added with  reference to the date for convening the new Parliament of the  twelfth legislature of the republic.    After reviewing the steps leading to the naming of a  premier-  designate by Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Bossi said he  did not "give a damn" about receiving the mandate he could  possibly claim as the leader of the party which captured 176  seats in the new Parliament compared to Forza Italia's 142.    On the distribution of portfolios, he declared, "The League  doesn't need anything. We don't want to be sold for what we are  not. We have struggled so hard to change the country because we  believe in freedom. We're certainly not Berlusconi's bag boys."    Among the options open, he added, is League support from the  outside for a government, with no direct League involvement with  the executive.    Summing things up in the wake of the vote, Bossi spoke of a  left "clinging to the defense of party power and state industry"  and, on the other side, "the Freedom Front where there is a  Berlusconi attempting to salvage the duopoly he was part of and  there is the National Alliance, which is opposed to federalism,"  he said with reference to the neo-Fascist formation which  flanked Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the south.    He said he still had to talk with the National Alliance. "I  want to see if they are able to vote for federalism with the  problems they have within. So there are two poles which are not  associated."    He went on to say, "We maintain that a constituent  government  is needed and to have guarantees, we have said there must be a  League man. We cannot give in on this point. I repeat,  Berlusconi cannot be premier."    "This is the situation, then everybody can embroider on this  as they want. Moreover, in this country there is the problem of  ethics with the newspapers and television. There are people who  have too much power in the media and we have always fought this  situation," he added with reference to Berlusconi's Fininvest  empire which controls publishing companies and three television  networks, aside from retailing, real estate and other interests.    In Rome today, another potential government partner,  ex-Radical Marco Pannella, said if fighting within the Freedom  Front is not wound down, it would be better to schedule new  general elections, and warned against depleting the "clarity" of  the outcome of the vote.    According to Pannella, a new government must be ready and  waiting in the wings for the inaugural session of the new  Parliament, he declared in a statement to his Pannella Club,  which he took to the conservative camp when the League and Forza  Italia agreed to back his referendum proposals to dismantle the  unions and unemployment benefits provisions as well as to  de-regulate the licensing of retail outlets.    With his six deputies in the Lower House and two senators,  Pannella reiterated today that voters who cast ballots for his  candidates intended to introduce a "fourth pole" to the new  government. "This left tried and failed. It's time to begin  again. We can be the lever for the formation of a democratic  party," he added.    Fielding questions, one of which was on him being touted as  foreign minister in the new cabinet, Pannella quipped brightly,  "I'm even ready to become premier."    Also speaking out today was the former Northern League  secretary in Genoa, Bruno Ravena, who declared to Bossi: "Your  attitude these days reminds me of the whole trash can I thought  we had put behind us" and urged him to "sit down at a table and  negotiate for a government platform in conformity with what the  voters expect."    Ravera, who was fired by Bossi when a Progressive candidate  was swept into the mayor's office in city elections in November,  argued, "The people of Italy want your League, Forza Italia and  the National Alliance to rule together and do not approve of the  unseemly spectacle you, at this time, are giving with an  attitude which recalls the dangerous power games of the parties  just buried."    Gianfranco Fini, the neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social  Movement] leader who changed his party's name to National  Alliance in time for the elections, today told Bossi: "You can  meet whoever you want, and say and do whatever you want, but  remember that talk is zero and the electoral campaign is over."    Responding to the League leader's latest foray, Berlusconi's  other essential ally argued, "Bossi's activism only hides the  embarrassment of the League leader who is attempting to show  that everything depends exclusively on him."    Referring to the League's showing in nation-wide  proportional  voting Sunday [27 March] and Monday, Fini said, "He who  represents 8 to 9 percent cannot presume to impose federalism,  first of all, on everyone. When he is ready for quiet debate,  at that point we can verify if it is possible to give rise to a  government in harmony with the electoral choices of the  Italians."    The leader quoted in today's edition of LA STAMPA as saying,  "Mussolini is the greatest statesman of the century" went on to  note that there is more to Italy than Bossi's northern  stronghold, that "government platforms have to be agreed to,  with balance, without childishness, without prime donne, without  pre-conceived positions."    Government formation must go forward, he added, "especially  with the certainty that whoever takes on responsibility for  pitting pride against the requirements of the nation is certain  to pay the consequences."    Fini concluded his remarks in Rome by underscoring the need  for the victorious right, which includes his field of 148  successful candidates now in the new Parliament, to "exploit in  the best of ways for economic recovery the confidence in the  monetary and financial markets shown in the Italian political  shift."</p>

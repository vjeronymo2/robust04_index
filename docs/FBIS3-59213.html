			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Beate </F> Mueller-Blattau, from the Villa Bonn program, place not given --  live, monitored in progress]    [Text] [Kinkel] ...with the aim of doing something for the  people affected, that must be our policy.    [Mueller-Blattau] You say friendly; I have problems with  understanding that, for example in the case of China.    [Kinkel] Why? We have good, friendly relations with this  country, that is the way I would put it. That changes nothing  about the fact that at every meeting, such as last week with the  president of the parliament, I emphatically and clearly say: you  have committed such-and-such and such-and-such a violation of  human rights in your country. You must please ensure  that...[changes thought] I cannot sit there and say: we have an  absolutely valid understanding of human rights, we are imposing  our understanding of human rights onto you, a country like China  with a great history and culture. They won't allow us to  dictate to them like that. The way Mr. Mueller imagines this,  that you can make foreign policy in this way, is just not  possible. One must address the issue clearly, unambiguously,  with an understanding of this country, its culture, its  different history. That is the problem, and foreign policy is  not a matter of getting up on a table, shouting heave-ho and  thinking we can impose our views on others.    [Mueller-Blattau] Quite another country, that is Japan with  its great economic power, is a tough competitor for German  industry, for example the car industry. Does something have to  change there, in economic relations?    [Kinkel] What does have to change mean? We must remain  competitive, and we must assert ourselves vis-a-vis the Japanese  car market, the engineering market, etc. It's as simple as that  and at the same time so difficult, for the Japanese have, it is  true, gained huge advantages over us and there are whole sectors  where we have fallen behind technologically. Just take  bio-engineering, where in America there are a thousand  production facilities in this field and here there are 12. A  thousand as against 12.    Last week I spoke to the German Research Institute and the  Max Planck Institute -- we must be very careful that, as a big  industrial country, we don't fall behind in the technology  sector, and of course one of our great competitors is Japan.    [Mueller-Blattau] I deduce from that industry and foreign  policy are quite obviously very closely connected.    [Kinkel] Yes, far more than before. Foreign economic and  trade policy has become a focal issue above all for German  foreign policy and plays a very decisive, important part for  example in European and transatlantic relations now that the  security issue has gone into the background following the end of  East-West confrontation, therefore, we must devote great  attention to these foreign trade issues in our foreign policy.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: DTI to investigate more share dealings connected with Wace THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday widened its investigation into share dealings connected with Wace Group, the printing company. The two DTI inspectors investigating Wace are now looking at share dealings in two further quoted companies - Tinsley Robor, a printing company which Wace considered taking over in early 1990, and in European Colour, a Stockport-based manufacturer of chemical colours. The DTI said yesterday that the share deals it was investigating 'might have been a preliminary to a possible takeover or merger' but that it was not looking at the affairs of either company. The DTI declined to comment on the targets of the inquiry but it is understood that one of the share deals in the inquiry is a 7.1 per cent stake in European Colour in the name of J Riley. European Colour could not confirm yesterday whether this shareholder was Mrs Jayne Riley, the half sister of Mr John Clegg, Wace's managing director who resigned suddenly two months ago. However, Mr Mike Armitage, managing director of European Colour, said the J Riley shareholding, shown in the accounts dated March 1991, had 'transmogrified' out of a 5 per cent shareholding of a K Riley, bought in October 1986, when the company was known as Horace Cory. Mrs Jayne Riley's husband is Mr Keith Riley. Following Mr Clegg's departure, the DTI launched an inquiry under Section 442 of the Companies Act into the 'membership' of Wace Holdings UK, a subsidiary of Wace Group previously known as Parkway, a printing company which Wace took over in 1990. 'Membership' covers all persons financially interested in the company. A dossier passed by Wace to the DTI showed that nearly 10 per cent of the shares in Parkway had been bought and registered in the names of members of Mr Clegg's family and others connected with them in the months before Wace's bid. Many of the share purchases were in the names of Mrs Jayne Riley and Mr Keith Riley. Mr Clegg has said through his solicitors that he has 'never acted on nor provided to others any price-sensitive information' and is happy to co-operate with the DTI. A similar pattern of buying Tinsley Robor shares about the time of Wace's interest has subsequently emerged, with registration in many of the same names - including that of Mr Keith Riley. Yesterday, Mr Armitage said that European Colour had never received an approach from Wace about a takeover or merger, but added that the company had been trying to uncover the identity of several shareholders controlling around 7 per cent for several years. It had found this search 'exceptionally difficult' because of the use of nominee names by some shareholders, but was now 'aware of links' between several beneficiaries.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Reed/Elsevier The cheering of City analysts at the merger of Reed and Elsevier will certainly be echoed by Reed's shareholders. Elsevier's secure revenues from scientific publishing contrast starkly with Reed's exposure to consumer advertising. By merging, Reed shareholders have gained access to Elsevier's high-quality earnings flow in return for giving up some of their potential profits from any cyclical advertising upturn. Given that recovery still seems far away, that looks like a good deal for Reed, though it is at least partly discounted by yesterday's 45p share price rise to 531p. The deal creates a large group with strong finances which put it in a good position to make acquisitions. The Official Airlines Guide may be a natural purchase to go with Reed's travel-related businesses. Together the companies can invest more heavily in electronic publishing and they may be able to cross-market some products. But there are relatively few cost savings, and it has yet to be proved that the strategic benefits will follow. It is questionable, for example, whether Elsevier's strength as an up-market European publisher will help Reed overcome its difficulties in breaking into the continental consumer magazine market. The marriage of a growth company with good earnings to a partly-cyclical stock also looks slightly odd at a time when companies such as ICI are breaking up to avoid the growth side of their business being rated as a lowly cyclical. Reed and Elsevier argue that the merger is worth at least the sum of its parts and offers opportunity for the future. They must hope that the markets do not come to think that two plus two equals three.</p>

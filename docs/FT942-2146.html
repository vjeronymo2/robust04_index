			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Future of Sizewell C rests on 3.7p claim The UK nuclear review will help determine whether Britain will invest billions of pounds more in the industry. But the debate will swing on an argument over only 3.7 pence. That, says Nuclear Electric, the England and Wales power generator, is about what it would cost to produce a kilowatt hour, or one unit, of electricity from the twin reactor power station it wants to build with private-sector funds at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast. The company's problem is persuading investors and the government that 3.7p is achievable. Sizewell C opponents say it is wildly optimistic. The construction of the 2,600 MW Sizewell C is one of the central issues of the review. The nuclear industry hopes a new station, probably Sizewell but possibly Hinkley Point C in Somerset, would be the first of a series of plants to be built in the next century. Either would be based on the design of the Sizewell B station, which Nuclear Electric expects to start operating later this year. There is virtually no chance of Nuclear Electric's being able to build new stations while it remains in the public sector, which is one of the reasons it wants to be privatised. It may just be able to build another plant if it can convince the private sector to contribute towards building Sizewell C. That in turn will depend on its ability to persuade potential investors that the figure suggested is achievable. In its submission the company gives a range of possible figures for likely unit costs at Sizewell C, but Mr Mike Kirwan, the finance director, said yesterday that 3.7p was the most likely outcome given the company's assumptions on the capital costs (Pounds 3.5bn), plant operating efficiency (85 per cent) and an 11 per cent return on capital demanded by the private sector. Even the 3.7p might present potential investors with problems. Only a few months ago the company was talking about 2.9p. Nuclear Electric said the change was not a climbdown. The lower figure would apply if the plant were to be built in the public sector, where an 8 per cent return on capital was considered the norm. Another difficulty is that the 3.7p figure is more than 50 per cent above the 2.4p price of electricity this year in the wholesale electricity trading pool for England and Wales. Nuclear Electric says market prices will rise by the time the new station is built. But it does not dispute that a gap is likely to remain and it is partly for this reason that 'government commitment and support' will be needed. Details of that support have still to be formulated, although Nuclear Electric stressed yesterday that it may not lead to actual expenditure but could involve government guarantees or setting aside a proportion of the market for nuclear power. Ministers' willingness to make such commitments will depend on their judgment of Sizewell C's unit costs. According to the Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities, a pressure group against nuclear power, an approach likely to be taken by the private sector investor would result in an estimate of 5.8p. This could rise to 7.4p if the investor is assumed to be risk averse. Part of the explanation for the gulf between Nuclear Electric's figure and those of others is that the history of nuclear power is littered with examples of cost over-runs. Nuclear Electric says it has revised only once the Pounds 2bn cost (in 1987 money) of building Sizewell B and that was because the government decided against building other plants in the series and so economies of scale were lost. However, the Central Electricity Generating Board, from which Nuclear Electric was spawned in 1990, revised Sizewell B costs several times, never downwards. Doubts about Nuclear Electric's Pounds 3.5bn estimate are raised because the figure is only about Pounds 700m above the present-day money cost of building Sizewell B, which is less than half its proposed size. Similarly, nuclear industry opponents are sceptical of its assertion that Sizewell C can operate at 85 per cent of its potential capacity. But perhaps the biggest doubts centre on Nuclear Electric's belief that 11 per cent will be considered an adequate return on capital by the private sector. PowerGen, Nuclear Electric's fossil-fired generation company in the private sector, says it uses a rate of return of at least 10 per cent on its gas-fired plants. The risk on gas-fired plants is considerably less than with nuclear because they are cheaper and quicker to build. Mr Kirwan said yesterday that the government's involvement could lower the risk for nuclear power. Nonetheless the onus is on Nuclear Electric and Mr Kirwan to persuade the government to participate. Even then they may struggle to persuade the private sector to follow the state's lead.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / People: Contacts and superstition - . . . were the building blocks of Thailand's largest hotel chain. Now, founder Chanut Piyaoui plans to expand abroad For a woman who says demurely that she knows little about finance or economics, Khunying Chanut Piyaoui is doing remarkably well. She is the founder and managing director of the Dusit Thani group, Thailand's largest hotel chain. Now aged 72, Chanut (Khunying, roughly equivalent to 'Lady', is a title bestowed on women by Thai monarchs) built Bangkok's first modern international hotel 25 years ago. 'I didn't know about finance - I just wanted the best,' she says. She went on to establish and manage luxury hotels all over Thailand as tourism and business travel rapidly increased in the 1970s and 1980s. The company, which last year made a net profit of Bt 214m (Dollars 8.6m) on turnover of Bt 1.03bn, also holds the Thai franchise for Best Western, the US hotel chain. On the advice of a fellow director - her son, Chanin Donavanik - Dusit has recently made substantial investments overseas, partly because the growth of tourism in Thailand has started to slow and hotel profits have fallen. 'I would like to invest overseas, not to make a lot of money, but because I want to present Thai customs, Thai tradition, Thai art and culture, Thai food and hospitality.' This apparent high-mindedness, along with her supposed ignorance of financial matters is taken with more than a pinch of salt by those who do business with her. The judgment of one foreign business consultant in Bangkok is perhaps more revealing: 'She's as tough as nails and knows everything that is going on.' Those qualities may become more familiar to foreign hoteliers as her group embarks on an ambitious plan to internationalise its operations with hotels in China and Vietnam and in southern Europe. Like other ethnic Chinese tycoons in Asia, Chanut has fostered an authorised  -and thoroughly bowdlerised - version of her life story. Her father came from the Chinese island of Hainan and owned a saw-mill, but he lost his business when he pledged the property as a loan guarantee for a friend who subsequently defaulted; her mother owned a rice-mill. Chanut's education in Bangkok was disrupted by the second world war and the Japanese occupation of Thailand. Her subsequent attempts to study for a degree in the US were stymied by her poor English. She was, however, impressed by American hotels and motels, and she returned to Bangkok in her mid-twenties to put up a 60-room hotel called 'The Princess' which opened in 1949. At that time most Thai hotels were regarded as brothels. The women who ran them were seen as traditional mama-sans, not hotel managers. Chanut set out to change all that. She saw the hotel business as a way to become an independent businesswoman. The venture was not a success, but the difficulties she faced - and her stays in the Waldorf Astoria in New York and the Georges V in Paris - gave her the idea of building the five-star Dusit Thani as 'the landmark of Bangkok'. The distinctive triangular Japanese-designed hotel, was the tallest building in the Thai capital when it was built in 1970, remains the centrepiece of the Dusit Thani chain. It is patronised by the Thai royal family and aristocracy as well as foreign business executives and tourists. Chanut's struggle to raise the Dollars 20m that was eventually needed to open the hotel has become the stuff of Thai business legend. She is all the more remarkable for being a single woman - a divorcee who calls herself 'chairperson' of the company - in an Asian business world dominated by men. 'It was very difficult at that time, especially as a woman,' she says, 'but most people were kind, so I was able to make it . . . I didn't have any collateral and I went to see one of the smallest banks and asked the manager to help me. I knew him and his family but the money I needed was much higher than their registered capital, so they asked another bank and they both guaranteed a loan without collateral.' It was not the last time that she displayed an instinct for business opportunities which more than makes up for her lack of formal training. For example, the Dusit Thani's lobby was enlarged after Chanut saw the 400-seat jumbo jets being built in Seattle where she was attending a tourism conference. She ended a management contract with the Westin group after two years because the profits she was earning were not high enough to pay off her debts. That decision enabled Dusit Thani to grow into a hotel management company in its own right. The official version of Chanut's career and the growth of the Dusit Thani chain concentrates on the triumphs rather than the failures. Yet the group has not been free from controversy. It has been accused more than once of damaging or trying to profit from what remains of Thailand's natural environment. The most notable example is the recently-opened Rayavadee resort in southern Thailand which is managed by Dusit. Environmentalists say the hotel is illegally sited in a national park, although Chanut says there is a title deed that proves otherwise. The official history of her life is so sparse that it leaves much of her business activities since the Japanese occupation in the realm of gossip. Yet one factor in her rise is abundantly clear. Personal relationships are vital to business in Thailand and Chanut's success reflects the quality of her connections. Her friendships with members of the Thai royal family have been crucial, but, like all royal matters in Thailand, they are not subject to public scrutiny. Suffice it to say that Princess Galyani, the King's elder sister, opened Chanut's first hotel in Bangkok four decades ago and many subsequently. The land for the Dusit Thani was leased from the Crown Property Bureau. Political influence and good connections with the Chinese business community are more important than either luck or financial acumen for commercial success in Thailand. Chanut has influence in abundance. Asked if she still relied on personal contacts more than anything else in her business, she replies 'yes', but quickly changes the subject. How business is really done is never part of the authorised version in Thailand. Those contacts will be less useful as the group expands internationally, especially outside Asia. Nevertheless Chanut has sanctioned an ambitious drive overseas. In 1992, Dusit bought a stake in The Melrose in Dallas, Texas, and now manages the property; it opened its first hotel in Indonesia in June this year; it is investing in a resort development in Majorca; the first Dusit resort in Nepal is due to open in 1996; it runs Vietnamese restaurants in Tokyo and Berne; and further deals are being negotiated in China, Vietnam and elsewhere. The Thai name Dusit Thani, Chanut agrees, is not easy to market internationally, but she is loyal to it. Dusit Thani, the 'City in Heaven', was the name given to a proposed utopian town by the late King Rama VI. Chanut prayed to his statue for permission to use it for her first big hotel. The belief that the success of her business is wrapped up with divine forces as well as royal friendships highlights another aspect of her business style. Chanut, in common with many Chinese entrepreneurs, is superstitious. Her foreign partners will find she uses a powerful device to determine the best date for opening a hotel: she consults the Chinese calendar to find a lucky date.</p>

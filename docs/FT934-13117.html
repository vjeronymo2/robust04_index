			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Safety in numbers? Not always - Rationalisation / A reduction in the multitude of funds could benefit investors TO THE casual observer, there would seem to be too many unit trusts. At the end of August, 1,537 funds were available from 160 management companies, giving the first-time investor a bewildering choice. Every year, the number of funds on offer seems to increase remorselessly. In the bull market of 1987, there were just 1,137 funds from 139 companies on offer. Even allowing for a slight expansion of the definition of a fund in June 1993 (following the Unit Trust Association's redesignation as the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment funds), this represents a substantial advance. It is not as if fund management companies were making much money out of all this diversity. Take the example of the international equity growth sector, where the investor had 158 funds to choose from at the start of September. Just over a third of those funds (54) had less than Pounds 10m under management. Not only is it hard to offer a truly international spread with that kind of sum, it is also hard to see how the manager can be making a profit. Even on a 1.5 per cent annual charge, a Pounds 10m trust would bring in just Pounds 150,000 of revenue a year. By the time you have paid the manager, and allowed for the costs of running the fund, you will be left with loose change. Consumers could certainly have a more than adequate choice with a much smaller range of funds; every sector could have its index fund, a selection of 'value' or recovery managers, growth stock players and small-company specialists. Add in a few funds with different charging structures (some with low front-end charges and exit fees, others with high initial charges and a low annual fee), and you could probably get by with 20-25 funds in each sector. Despite the apparent need for the industry to rationalise, there is little sign of change. The problem is that history has shown that it is much easier to raise money by launching a new fund than it is to generate interest in an existing trust. 'It is much easier to get press coverage for new funds,' says Judy Delaforce, product development manager at fund management group Fidelity. Peter Emms, group marketing director at M&amp;G, says that new funds give intermediaries a chance to arouse the interest of their clients. There have also been good reasons to launch many recent funds, argues Delaforce. 'With the recession, it has been appropriate for some more cautious funds to be launched, such as money market trusts, balanced funds (those which include both bonds and equities) and controlled-risk funds (those which use futures and options),' she says. But investors face the problem of choosing a fund that turns out to be last year's fashion. If the fund shrinks, as investors move on to the latest fad, it becomes difficult for the manager to produce a strong performance, because he is forever having to sell investments to meet redemptions. Furthermore, fund management groups have a natural incentive to put their best managers in charge of their largest funds, so investors in a small fund can lose out. So what scope is there for an industry shake-up? Some managers may be happy to carry on as they are. 'Many of the small trusts are managed by private-client stockbrokers and portfolio managers who have set them up for their own clients,' says Delaforce. 'Brokers find it more profitable to run their own unit trusts than to sell someone else's' For the moment, most groups in the unit trust industry are enjoying the good times, as funds flow in at the rate of around Pounds 1bn a month. The pressure to rationalise, which must have been intense in a bear market like that of 1990, has eased. But some companies have given up the ghost, as when insurance group Aetna sold its trust range to Thornton fund managers. The most substantial recent reorganisation occurred when Henderson merged with Touche Remnant. The combined group quickly produced plans to streamline its trust range from 35 to a more manageable 21. Although mergers require the approval of unitholders, there is normally no reason for them to object. Most mergers are conducted on an offer-to-offer basis, to leave a unitholder no worse off. If fund A, with an offer price of 100p, merged with fund B, with an offer price at 50p, then a unitholder with 1,000 units in fund A would find himself with 2,000 units in fund B. However, there is a potential cost from government stamp duty, which is deemed to be payable when trusts merge. This can discourage some managers from rationalising their ranges. What will probably halt the flow of fund launches is if managers achieve success in selling the trusts that they have already. There are some signs of this happening. 'Promoting your existing funds is becoming more acceptable to clients, if you can show them a solid performance,' says Fidelity's Delaforce, who in September launched a marketing campaign based on the group's European fund. M&amp;G has long used advertising campaigns which emphasise the success of some of its long-running funds, such as the Recovery unit trust. It is currently relaunching an old campaign  - 'The only three funds you'll ever need'  - based on its Recovery, Managed and European Dividend funds. A large fund can afford to spend more on marketing and attract more investors. It will be perceived as a less risky choice, on the 'no-one ever got fired for buying IBM' principle. It can also, once the annual management fee has grown sufficiently, afford to attract investors by cutting the initial charge. So by the year 2000, the industry may yet be leaner, more efficient animal than it is now.</p>

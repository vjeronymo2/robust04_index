			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> FDIC Chief Urges Deposit Insurance Reform: Depositors should be required to  pick up more of the cost when financial institutions fail, L. William Seidman,  chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the House Banking  Committee.  </P> <P> However, Seidman said he is not yet prepared to endorse any specific plan to  alter the current federal insurance system. The FDIC currently protects  deposits up to $100,000. Seidman also said the corporation is studying a  proposal to prohibit so-called golden parachutes for managers of banks that  fail. The hearing was the first in a series to be devoted to the issue of  deposit-insurance reform.  </P></p>

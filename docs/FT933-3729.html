			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Gardening: A super spot for some late-summer lusting - Spurred by hearsay, Robin Lane Fox roams a world of borders where a mind's autumn image is transformed into colourful reality IN MY mind's eye, I have had an image of a late-flowering border, planted as borders used to be planted in the days of soft watercolours when nobody was ashamed of golden-rod. In this clear, calm autumn, the image has evidently grown into a lust, or so I deduce because I have just run it to ground in the natural habitat of late-summer lusting. The garden of The Lordship at Benington near Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, appealed to me on hearsay, a botanical symbol in the Yellow Book and a star in the Good Gardens Guide. Visiting on the off chance, I find that I have hit the mark. Next year's TV movie, Late Summer Lusting, has just been filmed in the garden and I will wait to see if it satisfies the same instincts which the garden has just satisfied in me. The Lordship is a site with an extremely long history and a large supporting farm but the presiding spirit of the garden since 1970 has been Sarah Bott. Now in her mid-50s, she has the quietly-spoken firmness of an assured plant-person. She was born a Fox - part of the family which owned the great gardens at Glendurgan, Cornwall, which are now a public asset - and her gardening began at the age of 10. She is living evidence for those who think that gardening is a genetic mania. She is also evidence for those who think that it is fostered culturally: her mother Barbara's example has not faded after 40 years, although Hertfordshire is not Cornwall and The Lordship's quick-draining clay is unsuited to good camellias. People flock to the garden in February when the snowdrops are out in force but, although abundant, they are not particularly rare. In my garden guide, The Lordship is also said to be noted for its border of penstemons. Wherever is it? I wondered, on arriving at its puzzling entrance. The Lordship stands in its own park and its architecturally baffling house adjoins such features as a mock Norman gateway, a broad, ancient moat with no water, and a white jasmine as high as the eaves of a brick-built wall with overtones of the 18th century. We began by exploring a clock-wise route: the moat, the keep, and the problem of black spot on Margaret Merrill, a hugely impressive Magnolia grandiflora (which had none of the problems of mine as related in this column recently). There were some contrary flashes of plantsmanship: I had mistaken a late eupatorium for a deutzia; Sarah Bott had shown her lemon verbena, 3 ft high and unscathed by the winters. A square of Rosa moyesii geranium was looking lovely with its late rose hips; we agreed in disliking the harsh colours of Rosa cerise bouquet; we disagreed on the respective merits of R. Fruhlingsgold and Fruhlingsduft. It seemed like a pleasant outing, but not the satisfaction of a late-summer lust, while we strolled beneath the pillared veranda swathed in the large leaves of Vitis coignetiae with views across an amply-lilied lake. The rock garden was past its best but, in a dell behind it, I did find an emblem for corporate financiers, reading this column in their search for a new logo: a rather fine statue of Shylock stands in stone above a planting of White Honesty. Away to the left, I caught sight of the best white agapanthus, the ardernei form which has featured here since I re-met it, long after The Lordship had been growing it without fuss. Perhaps I should have guessed: we turned the corner and looked up the length of a hidden double border, longer than anything in an Oxford college and the translation of my mind's autumn image into reality. On either side of a stepped path runs just the border which autumn evokes in the mind: unusual crocosmias; tradescantias in a second flowering; polygonums, both common and uncommon; Rose Nevada; the Barnsley white mallow; marvellous drifts of ligularia; the best violet-blue strobilanthes I have seen for ages; shaggy annual asters from a seed packet; climbing white solanum on the pillars of the old brock gateway; more eupatoriums which do not look like deutzias; the gentle blue spires of Veronica exaltata; and the tall points of white, like beads, on that quiet winner, Lysimachia ephemerum, which plainly was enjoying the damp in the ground. Seen from below, it was breathtaking: it is better from above, replied Sarah, my companion, the only Bott in the landscape. When she began, she gained help from reading such writings as those of Graham Thamas and the Sunday articles of Vita Sackville-West, whose legacy lives on for the over-50s. She inherited a border which flowered only in July and had none of the family plants in which she moved: the eupatoriums, the dusky crocosmia which she knows as Aunt Lucy, the personal echoes of friends and relations which sound especially familiar to those of us who started to garden while seriously under age. As we climbed, I noticed how the border must have been just as impressive in previous months: Bott recommends the last week in May, when the last of the tulips match the early border beauties and she prepares for some notable delphiniums. Like many good gardeners, she disagrees with the usual perceptions: she finds June and July often to be a disappointment. The Lordship's long borders do not focus on one or two colours. They do not exclude plants which rarified gardeners now fail to appreciate: annual asters, perhaps, or pale pink perennial bolsam. The results reflect the particular span of a lifetime and match an image, not a fashion. As we looked down, the guiding spirit declared herself content with her work. Gardeners have only to look at their results to see imperfections, but true gardeners are content with progress and the process. What next, I wonder? For visitors, the answer is a left-hand turn through a brick gateway into a kitchen garden of mixed penstamons, a wonderful swathe of the blue Clematis Perle d'Azur, and borders of gold and silver foliage, some of which have been banished after attempted introduction by her gardeners. For the owner, the mid-50s are a time in life for tree planting and continual weeding because The Lordship's enormous gardens run on a head gardener and an assistant. In winter, there will be dogwoods in blazing red beside the lake and winter-scented honeysuckle and hellebores on the ruins of the old Norman castle. Not every gardener can go to ground in a winter retreat which has been inhabited for nearly 1,000 years. Before the public season ends this month, late-summer lusters should pay it a visit and enjoy borders which live up to any mind's-eye view. Benington Lordship, five miles east of Stevenage, is open on Wednesdays (12-5) until September 30 and specially open for FT visitors this Sunday (2-5).</p>

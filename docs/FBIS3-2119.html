The provincial government offices stationed outside the  province made indelible contributions in 1993 to Hebei's success  in accelerating the opening to the localities at home and abroad  and maintaining rapid development in economic construction.  Focusing on the requirements put forward by provincial leaders,  they made use of their special positions and advantages,  actively conducted explorations, pioneered the way forward, and  notably changed and improved the work to bring in investment  from outside the province and establish ties with foreign  countries, develop economic and technological cooperation,  provide information, increase income, receive guests and provide  service, exercise management, and strengthen basic construction.  They created an income of 26.68 million yuan in the whole year  and realized a profit of 10.66 million yuan, a net increase of  48 percent from 1992. Meanwhile, the offices served as liaison  offices for 360 projects of the province, signed 86 letters of  intent, officially signed 185 contracts, planned to bring in  $380 million from abroad, and provided information on 1,422  occasions, thus making contributions to the endeavor of building  an economically strong province.    During the conference, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, and Ye Liansong, provincial  governor, attended to meet with all the delegates. Cheng Weigao  commended several offices that had won notable achievements and  clearly urged the participants to particularly do a good job in  bringing in investment from abroad and establishing lateral ties  at home, in management, and in service and to make still greater  contributions to Hebei's economic development and opening to the  outside world in the new year.

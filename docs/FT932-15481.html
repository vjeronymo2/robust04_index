			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Observer: Body count It is not just the residents of Los Angeles who have strong feelings about the case against the four white police officers accused of violating black man Rodney King's civil rights. The ugly video film of a man being beaten while he was on the ground has meant that everyone from Paris to Tokyo has a view on a drama which threatens to inflame Los Angeles again. Less well known is the fact that when it comes to racial balance in recruitment, the record of Los Angeles' police department is above average. According to a recent University of Nebraska survey of the ethnic mix in 50 US city police forces, New York has the lowest ratio of black police officers to black residents whilst LA is top. Some 14 per cent of its officers are black, which is in line with the black proportion of the city's population.</p>

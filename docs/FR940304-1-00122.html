			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Lastly, some comments urged changes in the ranges and ovens test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure as well as the microwave oven test procedure. Aloha Systems, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commented that the present test procedure using an aluminum block is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realistic, and that induction cooking cannot be evaluated with the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure since that procedure requires iron pots and pans. (Aloha  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems, Inc., No. 2, at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and the Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers both urged the Department to change its microwave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure to the 1988 International Electrotechnical Commission test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for measuring microwave power and energy use. (Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 18; Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 25.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modifications to the test procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Pool Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to comments on pool heater classes, Southern Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, Energen, South Carolina Gas and Electric, Laclede, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oklahoma Gas Co. proposed that an additional product class for pool heaters be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established_gas pool heaters with automatic ignition. (Southern Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15; South Carolina Gas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric, No. 34 at 6; Laclede, No. 55 at 6; and Oklahoma Gas Company, No. 57  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 7.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes there is no significant difference in consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility between gas-fired pool heaters which use electricity and those which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not. In addition, pool heaters are customarily installed adjacent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pump and filter. Therefore, electricity will be readily available for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool heater. The Department decided to keep gas-fired pool heaters as one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class and to consider electricity-using design options as another design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option. Accordingly, the installation and maintenance expenses (in addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increased manufacturer costs) associated with design options using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity were considered in the economic calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another product class issue dealt with heat pump pool heaters. Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Heat Systems (Air Energy Heat Systems, No. 44 at 1) provided efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. The company stated that coefficients of performance are available in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mid five's and will reach the low six's in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has adopted American National Standards Institute Standards Z21.56&hyph;1989 and Z21.56a&hyph;1990 as the test procedure for pool heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American National Standards Institute standards apply to gas-fired pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters only, not electric resistance pool heaters or electric heat pump pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. Since a test procedure does not exist for electric pool heaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients of performance data were not used in the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for pool heater design options, the Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association argued that since pool heaters have ``no flues,'' many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the design options listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate, such as use of flue dampers, multiple flues, and increased flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baffling. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most pool heaters currently being manufactured pass the water through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat exchanger pipe which is located inside a combustion chamber above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner. This design does not have a flue, and would not benefit from design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options to improve the flue. The Department agrees with Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association and is not considering these design options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One company took issue with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association's comments about flue dampers not being an appropriate design for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool heaters. Flair said, ``We know of several manufacturers who build boiler-type pool heaters equipped with flues.'' (Flair, No. 85 at 1.) Flair also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the Department evaluate a water heater design option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatic ignition with a flue damper for pool heaters. (Flair, No. 85 at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is not aware of any residential pool heaters being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured currently with separate boilers or tanks that store water at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elevated temperatures. Flue dampers are effective only at reducing standby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses from storage tanks. Therefore, flue dampers were not considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automatic ignition was included as a design option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment dealt with pool heater test procedure issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Energy Commission stated new test procedures are needed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil-fired, electric resistance, and heat pump pool heaters, and the gas-fired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool heater test needs to include standby losses so that intermittent ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices are credited for increasing the energy factor. (Commission Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission, No. 24 at 5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Modifications to the test procedures for pool heaters, which address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

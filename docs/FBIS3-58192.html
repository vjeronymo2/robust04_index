			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "Message From the Voters"] </F>   [Text] Local Elections. The strategy for the Folketing  election should be in place.    Local elections are not a Folketing election. Still, so many  tendencies countrywide can be inferred from how the voters  expressed themselves on Tuesday [18 November] that these have  immediately been included in the party leaders' strategic  considerations preceding the Folketing election.    Aside from the two EC referenda, this is the first time in  almost three years that voters have had the possibility of  telling politicians what they think. Therefore, the local  elections can be described as a kind of midway election, not  least because a change of government, over which the voters had  no influence, has taken place since the last Folketing election  in December 1990.    The local elections became a remarkable battle between the  two great blocs, the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal  Party, between Uffe and Nyrup. The small parties were trampled,  the somewhat larger ones squeezed.    The Liberal Party and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were the great  victors in the local elections, having never before achieved  such success in the urban areas, where the Social Democratic  Party and the Socialist People's Party previously were the  dominant parties. The Social Democrats lost more this time in  comparison to the local and the county council elections of  1989, but the prime minister's party still did better than  expected, and relief over the result has made Prime Minister  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen behave like a winner almost on a par with  Ellemann-Jensen. The Radical Liberal Party was the only one of  the small coalition parties that received a reward from the  voters. On the other hand, the election was a catastrophe for  the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party. The  Conservatives lost, but not by as much as most people had  expected. The extremist parties, i.e., the Socialist People's  Party and the Progress Party, also took a hit from the voters.  <H5>  Election Results </H5>   One has to be cautious in trying to read the nationwide  result of the county council election--the election that best  can be compared with a Folketing election--directly as a  Folketing election. However, the Social Democratic Party  received 34.3 percent of the votes compared to 35.4 percent in  the last county council election, while the Social Democratic  Party won 37.4 percent of the votes in the landslide at the  Folketing election in December 1990.    The Radicals won 3.9 percent of the votes at the county  council election on Tuesday, an increase of 0.5 percent compared  to the last county council election. The Radicals won 3.5  percent in the Folketing election. The Democratic Center fell  from 2.5 to 1 percent in the county council election; the  Christian People's Party from 1.9 to 1.6 percent. In the  Folketing election the two parties won 5.1 and 2.3 percent  respectively.    The Liberal Party has thundered forth from 17.8 to 27.1  percent in the last county council election, while it won 15.8  percent in the Folketing election in 1990. The Conservative  Party won 12.8 percent compared to 14.5 percent in the last  county council election and 16 percent in the Folketing  election. The Progress Party now has 5.1 percent compared to 7  percent in the last county council election, but the party won  6.4 percent in the Folketing election. The Socialist People's  Party has fallen from 10.7 percent to 9.1 percent; the party won  8.3 percent in the Folketing election.  <H5>  The Uffe Effect </H5>   If these numbers are extrapolated to a Folketing election,  the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party will have  dropped out of the Folketing. Occasionally they do so also in  the opinion polls, but even though they might be able to pass  the threshold in the upcoming Folketing election, the government  majority has been lost. The question, however, is whether the  Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen after the Folketing election  can muster a majority of the Liberal Party, the Conservative  Party, and the Progress Party.    The outcome of the next Folketing election therefore might  well be that Prime Minister Rasmussen will continue as prime  minister for a social democratic-radical minority government.  The Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen might do well in the  election, but might not be able to benefit from it anyway. Most  voters will be siphoned off from the other nonsocialist parties,  and there might not be a majority that can designate  Ellemann-Jensen as prime minister in 1994.    It is only fair to say that Ellemann-Jensen is well  satisfied  after Tuesday's election. The Liberal Party has now become an  urban party especially attractive to young voters. However, his  problem in next year's election campaign will be to maintain the  Liberal Party's progress when the Social Democratic Party and  Rasmussen get the Social Democratic Party's election machine  started up. Even though the Liberal Party might win the  Folketing election in a landslide, the Folketing election will  be make-or-break for Ellemann-Jensen. If he does not manage to  effect a change of government, it will be quite uncertain  whether or not the Uffe effect can hold on to the Liberal  Party's new voters if the Liberal Party continues to drag on for  a few more years in opposition.  <H5>  The Conservatives </H5>   The Conservative Party is in a different position than the  Liberal Party. The Conservatives, of course, also have their  eyes on the Folketing election. But the most important thing for  the party is to recover and gain some new voters. If there is no  change of government in 1994, this will be no catastrophe for  the new party leadership headed by Hans Engell. The party  leadership will be able to display the result, but it can easily  manage several years in opposition without it causing internal  problems.    It will be most important for the Conservatives to maintain  their close alliance with the Liberal Party. The two parties  must not let themselves be played against each other; the  Liberal Party and the Conservative Party must always appear as a  credible alternative to the existing government. That is why the  Liberal Party's popularity with the voters might cause anxiety  for the Conservatives among whom some fear that the Liberal  Party might be tempted to go it alone when settling with the  Social Democratic Party.  <H5>  Government Problems </H5>   Prime Minister Nyrup Rasmussen apparently also sees himself  as a winner in the local elections. Of the four governing  parties, however, it is really only the Radical Left Party that  is a winner. Among the Radicals, the mood is very high, and  group leader Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen was almost euphoric as he  congratulated the radical members of the local administration  and of the county council: "The gain in the number of seats won  is nothing but formidable."    The radical politicians are clearly in tune with their  voters. That is why the radical Folketing groups view the local  election result as a confirmation that the Radicals made the  right decision when they joined the Nyrup government in January.    For the Democratic Center, Tuesday's election was nothing  less than a catastrophe. The party lost its four county council  members and almost all its local administration members. In the  party's traditional stronghold, Gladsaxe, the party lost all of  its seats in the local administration. The Democratic Center has  been doing some serious soul-searching since the party joined in  the government, but now the party has almost gone into a coma.  Party leader Mimi Jakobsen was on an official visit to the  Middle East when she received the depressing news. She states  that she alone is responsible for the party's poor election  results, but that the Democratic Center will remain in the  government and that there is no intention to change the party's  direction.    The Democratic Center's obvious problems can also become the  prime minister's. Prior to the coming Folketing election, the  Democratic Center will be even more anxious to define their  position than they have been so far, so that the image of the  government will sputter more and more. This will delight  Ellemann-Jensen and increasingly irritate the many Social  Democratic Folketing members, who would like to see the  Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party kept out of  the government. The Democratic Center's group leader Bente  Juncker, who is at odds with Jakobsen, has announced a more  aggressive approach.    The Christian People's Party also received a jolt from the  voters, but not as strong as that of the Democratic Center. The  Christian People's Party is more used to hovering near the  threshold in the polls. But this will not keep Merethe Due  Jensen and Inger Stilling Pedersen quiet.    Soul-searching is also on the agenda for the Socialist  People's Party and the Progress Party. The Progress Party  members have to decide whether or not to draw a more aggressive  front with the Social Democratic Party in the coming election  campaign. The Progress Party must take into account that the  party's policy concerning immigration did not win them any votes  in the local elections.</p>

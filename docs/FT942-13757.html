			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Trade accords 'must have fair labour clause' The introduction of fair labour standards into future international trade agreements should be based on the fundamental principles of the International Labour Organisation. This was the main message from the ILO's director general, Mr Michel Hansenne, in a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ILO's Declaration of Philadephia which set out the principles of the organisation. He called for a 'multilateral approach' by governments, employers and workers 'to improve respect for workers' rights and promote social progress everywhere.' Mr Hansenne said it would be 'tragic if the debate over social clauses in trade agreements should degenerate into acrimonious allegations of social dumping from one side and disguised protectionism from the other.' He added that many countries had already adopted ILO human rights conventions on freedom of association, the right of workers to organise and to bargain collectively and the prohibition of slave labour. 'All countries, regardless of their level of development have the capacity to observe these principles if they have the political will to do so,' he added. Although the ILO is 'not a trade organisation and has no mandate to regulate trade,' he said the ILO would co-operate with the new World Trade Organisation or other bodies in preparing a social clause linked to trade.</p>

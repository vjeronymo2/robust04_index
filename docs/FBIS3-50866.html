			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Melisa Soto and Zaida Pereira; </F> from "The News" newscast]    [Text] The implementation of the value-added tax [IVA] has  been temporarily suspended over the entire country until the  people are duly informed about it. Melisa Soto has more details.    [Soto] The Third Tax Disputes Court, presided by Judge  Orlando Sarti, made the surprising decision after lawyer Rafael  Balled Mardeni filed last Thursday a Constitutional amparo  petition requesting the suspension of the IVA implementation.  The lawyer felt the IVA implementation violates Articles 223  and 49 of the Constitution, as it undermines the rights of  Venezuelan citizens since they are not duly informed about the  implementation of the IVA. In the lawyer's opinion, this has  lead to great confusion among the people and total anarchy on  the part of merchants when they collect this tax.    [Begin recording] [Balled] I sincerely feel we have  prevented  a mass uprising like the one that took place on 27 February,  because there is no way to stop the merchants' abuses in  collecting this tax from the people.    [Soto] Do you not think this situation may cause greater  confusion among the people.    [Balled] Not at all. Henceforth, the government will have to  properly inform the people about the tax, something they have to  do now because of the amparo petition filed, and everybody will  immediately stop paying IVA.    [Soto] How long will the temporary suspension last?    [Sarti] It is no secret people have been paying IVA since  last year, although the law and its regulations stated it was  going to enter into effect on 1 January 1994. It is no secret  people have been paying it since last year. This has been true  anarchy. As for a timetable.... [pauses] the court did not give  the government a timetable, because it felt that the Executive  Branch's wisdom, or rather that the government's wisdom may be  reflected in whether it takes a long or short time in  implementing a good information campaign of what this tax should  be, namely, the people should be able to understand it. [end  recording]    [Soto] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] Senator Cristobal  Fernandez intervened as a witness in this suit.    [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We warned from the start that  because this is a regressive and unjust tax it would be an  unbearable burden on low-income groups and that ultimately it  does not provide a solution to close the fiscal gap, which is  what the government sought with it. We believe the next  congress must establish a new tax collection system and a  broader tax reform, which puts the burden on large income and  luxury goods and avoids imposing such a heavy burden on the  people of Venezuela. [end recording]    [Soto] It is worth noting that any merchant who, starting at  1100 on Thursday, continues to collect IVA will commit an  offense that may be punishable with jail.    Upon learning of the ruling by the Third Tax Disputes Court  suspending the IVA, Finance Ministry Adviser Alcides Villalba  stressed the Constitutional amparo does not suspend the tax, so  it will continue to be collected.    [Pereira] Villalba added the amparo petition will be  appealed  if it is made official, since the Court has not handed the  ruling to the Finance Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office,  or the Comptroller General's Office. In his opinion, this  ruling only serves to confuse the people since some people  refuse to pay this tax. Villalba stated the amparo brings about  a suspension when it refers to other cases, but since this is a  tax measure the amparo does not have this effect. This is an  individual not a collective amparo, he noted, adding it cannot  be carried out. He also said the survival of the Venezuelan  State depends on the IVA.    [Begin recording] [Villalba] As I understand it, based on  news media reports, many of them reliable and others not so....    [Unidentified speaker, interrupting] It may be  disinformation.    [Villalba] Based on disinformation, the judge said there is  widespread misinformation. I would ask the judge if he reads  the newspapers. This has been in the media. This problem has  been under discussion in this country for three years. [end  recording]    [Pereira] The Finance Ministry representative said this is a  political decision, and if it had come at another time, he would  have thought the purpose was to destabilize the government.    Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said the IVA  implementation is not a whim of the Executive Branch since it  responds to the reforms to the tax system that have been under  study for almost four years. He added the new tax is necessary  to control the fiscal deficit that has been worsening the  country's economic and social situation year after year.    [Begin Velasquez recording] The IVA is a fiscal necessity. I  want to explain that the government I have been leading since  June did not invent it. It was part of a modernization program  of the Venezuelan fiscal system, which had been agreed on since  1989. Along with the other laws that became part of the special  powers law, the Congress was unable to approve them for  basically political reasons. My government took on the  responsibility of promulgating those laws. The state's fiscal  deficit is profoundly harming the situation in Venezuela,  because it leads to a permanent devaluation of the bolivar due  to inflation and to this enormous social cost that 20 million  Venezuelans are paying. Let us not say 20 million, rather 18  million Venezuelans; two million persons are not suffering.    The oil revenues keep coming in, but it is no longer  sufficient to meet all the requirements of the state, which has  to pay 1.2 million public employees and state employees  protected by collective agreements and which has the obligation  to maintain health, education, public security, and road  services and to maintain the equipment of the Armed Forces. We  must find other fiscal resources that will, among other things,  make it possible to lower the fiscal deficit, and -- this is  something the government that will take office in 28 days will  do -- seek other income formulas and resources that will make it  possible to lower that deficit in one, two, or three years.

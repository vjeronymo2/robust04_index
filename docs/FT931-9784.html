			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures down STERLING futures had another mild fall yesterday as the pound remained weak on the foreign exchanges, raising speculation that the UK government would find it difficult to cut interest rates again, writes James Blitz. The UK currency flirted with its historic low against the D-Mark throughout yesterday and this helped to depress sentiment in trading on the March futures contract. The onset of yesterday's keynote speech by Mr Eddie George, the Governor-elect of the Bank of England, also saw selling of the March contract. Mr George is reputed to take a hard-line view about the need to combat inflation, raising speculation that he would warn against hasty interest rate cuts. Both factors helped to push the March short sterling contract down 8 basis points at one stage yesterday, to a low of 94.07 in the mid-afternoon. The contract finished at 94.08, at which level it prices three-month money at 5.92 per cent in UK Budget week next month. Dealers remained divided as to whether the contract could fall much further from these levels. Some continued to feel that it was a good buy, with good reasons to expect rates in both the UK and Europe to fall in the near term. However, a London-based dealer suggested that the contract could easily reach convergence with yesterday's closing level for three-month money, which yesterday was 6 1/8 per cent. In his view, the pound's weakness made another near-term cut in base rates unlikely. Sentiment in the cash market was much easier after most of the Pounds 1.05bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England in the morning was removed. The March Euromark contract gained 7 basis points to close at 92.02, following slight falls in the first two days of this week. In the German cash market, call money rates of between 8.55 and 8.60 per cent were quoted unchanged throughout the day. The better tone in Germany could not lift spirits in French franc markets, however. The Director of the French Bankers' Association said base rates may have to rise if short-term interest rates remain high. The March franc contract fell 2 basis points to a close of 88.54. Both one-month and three-month French francs ended at around 12 per cent.</p>

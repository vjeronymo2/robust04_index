			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 9 -- First Deputy Defence Minister Jerzy  Milewski expressed his satisfaction with the re-establishment of  Polish-Chinese military relations after having met with the  chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation  Army General Zhang Wannian, who has begun a three-day official  visit in Poland.    According to Milewski the Chinese official's visit to Poland  and the fact that "China is noticing us" proves that "great  China wants to develop cooperation with us and we are open to  this." He added that the 38 year-long break in relations in  this sphere may be regarded as being wasted time.</p>

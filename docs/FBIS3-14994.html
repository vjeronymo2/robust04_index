He declared  about this at a meeting with heads of the republic's atomic  power plants on Monday.    The president reassured that the problem related to the  supply of atomic plants with fuel would be solved in the near  term, and in accordance with the tripartite statement between  Ukraine, Russia, and United States signed in Moscow. Russia  pledged to deliver fuel for atomic power plants in exchange for  nuclear warheads.    In Kravchuk's words, currently, the government is solving  issues to improve material conditions for the employees of  atomic stations. In particular, the income tax for key experts  of atomic power stations is to be lowered by 10%.    Kravchuk said that the proposal of atomic power stations'  leaders to introduce world prices for power supply should be  thoroughly examined. He said that "one should do this very  accurately and in a balanced manner so as not to deepen the  crisis phenomena in the economy and in the state." In  Kravchuk's opinion, the issue of drawing foreign investments  into atomic energy "is to be further analyzed and examined."    A presidential decree on urgent measures to develop the  atomic energy complex is expected to be issued in the near  future.</p>

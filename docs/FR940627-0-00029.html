			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current reporting requirements expire on June 30, 1994. Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could result in a loss of information. Rather than requiring the pipelines to expedite implementation of the new regulations to prevent a regulatory gap, the Commission in a contemporaneous order, in Docket No. RM87&hyph;5&hyph;016, is extending the current reporting requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994. The regulations adopted by this order will then go into effect on August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 U.S.C. 553(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will first provide an overview of the Order No. 497 requirements and address the general comments relating to retention of these provisions as a whole and will then address specific comments and issues regarding the Standards of Conduct, tariff requirements, and reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Overview of the Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, as part of its continuing assessment of the Order No. 497 regulations, it would consider comments on the need to retain these requirements as a whole. Many pipeline commenters submit that all the Order No. 497 requirements should be removed as unnecessary and duplicative of existing prohibitions on undue discrimination. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  They maintain that six years after promulgation of the regulations, no pattern of abuse has been demonstrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AER/MRT, CNG, Columbia, El Paso, Enron Pipelines, INGAA, K N Energy, KGPC, National, Panhandle Eastern Pipelines, Questar, WGM, WNG/Northwest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> They further contend that the potential for pipelines to provide preferential treatment to their affiliates has been virtually eliminated by the restructuring of pipeline operations pursuant to Order No. 636. They maintain that the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service has resulted in a truly competitive market in which all gas sellers will be able to compete on an even basis. They argue that the Commission's establishment of a mechanism permitting firm shippers to release capacity has eliminated the pipelines' monopoly over transportation service, so that the pipelines' ability to grant significant preferences to affiliates is reduced or eliminated. The capacity release mechanism, they maintain, creates an open auction for firm capacity in which the pipeline must award capacity to the highest bidder and so cannot favor its affiliate. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  They also assert that the ability of pipelines to favor affiliates with important transportation information has been undercut by the Commission's requirement that the most critical transportation information be disclosed publicly on pipeline EBBs. Moreover, if some potential for abuse remains, they contend the Commission's complaint process and enforcement staff provides adequate means to detect and prevent such abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> They similarly contend that, under Order No. 636 provisions, pipelines cannot discriminate in awarding interruptible service because it must be awarded to the highest bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These commenters also contend that the limited need, if any, for the regulations, must be juxtaposed with the anticompetitive effects of the regulations. They assert the regulations run counter to the Commission's goal of fostering competition because they have the effect of inhibiting beneficial communication between pipelines and affiliates, thereby limiting the ability of affiliates to compete in the marketplace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Commission decides to retain some or all of these requirements, these commenters recommend that the Commission provide a sunset date (generally one year) on which the regulations will expire. They assert that a sunset provision will ensure a comprehensive reevaluation of the requirements after further experience with capacity release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other side, Hadson and Indicated Parties support the continuation of the requirements, with some additions. Hadson asserts that the new deregulated gas environment will increase competitive pressures on all players, thereby increasing the incentive and likelihood that pipelines will try to enhance the competitive position of their affiliates and sales marketing divisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

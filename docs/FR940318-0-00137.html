			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 612(d), any petition must ``include a showing by the petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there are data on the substance adequate to support the petition.'' Petitioners may provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations to scientific literature, where appropriate. However, submitters are advised that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnishing copies of supporting articles, reports, or letters will expedite the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Agency receives a petition with insufficient data, EPA will not commence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review until the petitioner submits the missing information to the best of the petitioner's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability. EPA will inform the petitioner when the petition is complete for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiating the 90-day review period. To the extent the petitioner does not have the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, EPA may also seek data from sources other than the petitioner, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers or users of products that contain the substitute. In such cases, section 612(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly provides that ``the Administrator shall use any authority available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator, under any law administered by the Administrator, to acquire such information.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These authorities include section 114 of the CAA as well as information collection provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of other environmental statutes. Where EPA cannot obtain sufficient data within the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90-day review period, the Agency may deny the petition for lack of adequate technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Criteria for Evaluating Petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating petitions, the Agency will follow the same criteria as for review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP Information Notice which notifies EPA of the intent to introduce a substitute into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce. This will ensure that both petitions and notifications are judged by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Petition Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Petition Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule describes a generic petition process. Petitions should be sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket number listed in the beginning of this final rule as well as to the SNAP Coordinator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Petition Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Agency receives a petition, it will log the petition into the SNAP tracking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. If the petition concerns a substitute previously either found acceptable or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable under the SNAP program, the Agency will as a courtesy contact the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitter of that substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will grant or deny the petition within 90 days of receiving a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. If the Agency grants a petition to add a substitute to the list of unacceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes or to remove a substitute from either list, the decision will be made through notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comment rulemaking. In such cases, the statute requires EPA to propose, take comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on, complete final action, and publish the revised lists within six months of the grant of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition. Otherwise, responses to petitions, including explanations of petition denials, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the next 3-month  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice updating the SNAP determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the final determination, the Agency will inform petitioners within 90 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether their request has been granted or denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Listing of Substitutes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section presents EPA's listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial sectors: Refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvents cleaning, fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppression and explosion protection, sterilants, aerosols, tobacco expansion and adhesives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings and inks. Parts D through K below present a detailed discussion of the substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing determinations for each of the major use sectors. Tables that summarize listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions in this section are included in appendix B. Listings of substitutes within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticides sector will be added in future notices, as information on these substitutes becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the Agency. This final rule focuses on substitutes for class I substances, given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accelerated production phaseout schedule for class I substances. One of the goals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP is to encourage transition away from class I substances as rapidly as possible. SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will begin analyzing alternatives to class II substances in the near future. Results of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses will appear in quarterly updates to the SNAP lists, which will be published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as described in Sections III.C.4. and VII.A.3.g. of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop the lists of unacceptable and acceptable substitutes, EPA conducted screens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of health and environmental risks posed by various substitutes for class I compounds in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use sector. These screens are presented in individual background documents entitled ``Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances'' for each use sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These background documents are available for review in the public docket supporting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. Whenever the initial risk screen indicated a potential risk, the substitute was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated further to ascertain whether the potential risk was accurately estimated and if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management controls could reduce any risk to acceptable levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these analyses, EPA classified as unacceptable only uses of substitutes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose significantly higher human health and environmental risks than those risks that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrue through either continued use of the class I substances themselves or through use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other available substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States plan to announce the dates of the next North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks and suspension of the joint military  exercise "Team Spirit" as early as next week, a Foreign Ministry  official said Thursday. The announcement will be made around  the time an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection  team arrives in North Korea, according to the official. But the  announcement will carry conditions -- that North Korea allow  unrestricted IAEA inspections as agreed this week, and that  Seoul and Pyongyang reopen dialogue, he said.    Unification-related ministers met Thursday morning and  discussed necessary action following the North Korea-IAEA  agreement on nuclear inspections.    Pyongyang is demanding that Seoul and Washington suspend  Team  Spirit and schedule the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks  simultaneously with the arrival of the IAEA inspection team, the  ministry official said. This would constitute the "small  package deal" between Pyongyang and Washington.    North Korea has yet to notify the IAEA of the entry date and  schedule for the inspection team, but Seoul expects the IAEA  delegation to arrive in Pyongyang late this week and begin work  next week. Inter-Korean dialogue is likely to resume next week  as well, the official predicted. The resumption would be in the  form of previous working-level contacts for the exchange of  presidential envoys. He said the announcement on Team Spirit  and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks would come around that  time.    "But it will be a conditional announcement," said the  official. North Korea would have to meet the necessary  prerequisites in order for the high-level contact to take place  and for Team Spirit to be canceled. Speculation has it that the  date of the high-level contact would be sometime in mid-March,  since the IAEA inspection team needs two to three weeks in North  Korea and another few weeks to file a report.</p>

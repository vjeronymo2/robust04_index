			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  stressed that Egypt made tremendous efforts to help achieve the  signing next Wednesday of an agreement on the implementation of  the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It helped  the two sides overcome most of the obstacles that hindered the  agreement, he said.    In a statement appearing today in MAYU, which speaks for the  National Democratic Party, Mubarak said that despite obstacles  the Golan Heights will soon return to Syria. He noted that  Syria and Israel are eager for peace and that Egypt is helping  the two sides surmount the difficulties so that an agreement can  be reached.    On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak addressed a new appeal to  the parties to the conflict in fraternal Yemen to demonstrate  self-restraint and prevent bloodshed for the sake of the Yemeni  people's future.    On the results of his recent visits to China and some Arab  countries, Mubarak stressed that the trip to China was extremely  fruitful and produced positive results. He noted the need for  continued cooperation between Egypt and China.    President Mubarak emphasized the need for boosting  Egyptian-Chinese relations in all fields because China, with its  formidable capabilities, will play a more influential role in  international politics.    He explained that China agreed to reschedule Egypt's debts.  He said the move, a privilege not given to any other country,  reflects an appreciation of Egypt's status and role on the  international scene.    Mubarak said that he had rejected an idea to delay his visit  to China. I insisted on going to Beijing on the scheduled date,  although I postponed my visit to Japan because of that country's  government crisis, he said.    On his visits to a number of Arab countries before and after  his trip to China, Mubarak said: I am always eager for  coordination and an exchange of views with Arab leaders on all  issues of concern to the region and on international issues of  mutual concern.    He added: I am eager to meet with Arab leaders whenever I  have a chance. During my recent tour, I met with Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id of Oman. I have the closet ties with the Sultan and  the Omani people. Regarding the United Arab Emirates, its  positions toward us are honorable. Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan is a  dear friend, and when we meet we discuss all issues frankly and  in a brotherly spirit and we always arrive at identical  viewpoints.    On relations with Bahrain, President Mubarak said the  Bahraini people are really kind and proud of their relations  with Egypt. My meetings with Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah  are always characterized by cordiality and understanding, he  said.    President Mubarak added: I was willing to conclude my trip  with a visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia to meet with my brother  the custodian of the two holy mosques, King  Fahd-Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Crown Prince 'Abdallah, and the leaders  of the kingdom. I proceeded from eagerness to coordinate and  exchange views with them on all issues of concern to the region  and the world. Saudi Arabia is a big, influential Gulf state  and agreements between us reflect positively on our fraternal  peoples.    On the implementation of the economic reform program in  Egypt, Mubarak told MAYU that the world economy is now unstable,  causing higher prices. Egypt is affected by this, but we are  concerned that people with low income not be hurt, he said.    He added: In the reform plan we are fully committed to  certain principles. We do not approve any new loans except when  there is an urgent need and we are making strenuous efforts to  write off half of our foreign debts.    Concluding his statement, President Mubarak renewed his call  for investors to establish their projects in Egypt on lands  where the state has provided facilities. Projects costing about  10 million pounds do not need permission from any quarter, he  said.    President Mubarak explained that a good economy supports the  climate of freedom and democracy. We are interested in  reforming Egypt's economy and establishing it on firm and strong  bases so that freedom and democracy will flourish, he said.</p>

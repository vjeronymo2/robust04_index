			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has decided to deal positively with  Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir's proposal to  establish the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC).    In view of U.S. concern over a new economic bloc in Asia,  Japan has been taking a prudent stand toward the proposal for an  economic cooperation mechanism to be organized by ASEAN, Japan,  the ROK, and China. Japan's policy change is aimed at  demonstrating Japan's policy of attaching importance to ties  with ASEAN, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  ministers conference is going to have summit talks on a regular  basis. Also, Japan wants to check U.S. moves to make the North  America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) an exclusionary economic  bloc.    The government intends to propose to ASEAN nations that they  design the EAEC as a consultative body open to the world.    The concept of the EAEC is based on Prime Minister  Mahathir's  1990 proposal for the East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). At that  time, the United States and Australia strongly opposed the  proposal, saying that the EAEG was "an attempt to divide the  Pacific region." Taking this into account, the EAEC was  redesigned to not give the impression of a protectionist  economic bloc. The framework of the EAEC is now under debate at  the ASEAN economic ministers conference. While some quarters say  that the EAEC should start as a subsidiary of APEC, details have  not yet been determined.    The Japanese Government has not clarified its stand toward  the EAEC proposal in consideration of the positions of ASEAN,  the United States, and Australia. Japan also thought that its  participation in discussions on regional frameworks might affect  developments in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which sought a  global framework.    Japan's policy change is based on the following factors: 1)  The Uruguay Round has already been concluded successfully; 2)  When the United States announced its "emphasis on the Pacific  region" at APEC's Seattle summit in November, ASEAN nations  strongly expressed their concern over U.S. hegemony in Asia; and  3) ASEAN nations also expressed their concern over the  exclusionary nature of NAFTA.    The government once welcomed the U.S. House's approval of  NAFTA; however, the Foreign Ministry was displeased with the  Clinton administration's attempt to use the "Japan threat" in  persuading the House by stressing that "Japan will invade Mexico  if NAFTA fails to pass."    Under such circumstances, the government judged that Japan  had better to take part in the "open" EAEC to balance its  diplomatic policies toward Asia and the United States.</p>

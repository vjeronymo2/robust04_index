			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Baranovskiy: "Foreign Policy Victory: </F> The Leader of a Project on Russian Security Problems of the  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Wonders  Whether It Should Be Put Down to the Credit of the Russian  Federation"]    [Text] Official Russian diplomacy, foreign intelligence,  and a whole number of well-known analysts from academic circles  are unanimous that it was necessary to prevent the incorporation  in NATO of our former Warsaw Pact allies.    We were successful long ago in propounding this line--in  Western capitals--and we have made it clearly understood to  Warsaw and Prague and Budapest that they should not look for  full membership in the near future. Only satisfaction may be  felt, it would seem: We stuck to our guns, we are still reckoned  with, and our opinion is taken into consideration. This is  undoubtedly a foreign policy victory brilliantly organized by  Russia's Foreign Ministry. But perhaps we should not be in any  hurry to put it down to our credit?    First, we have somehow come by this success too easily.  There  were in NATO, after all, few who felt any particular enthusiasm  at the prospect of finding themselves dragged into possible  showdowns on the territory of the former socialist camp. But  there were no in any way serious moral-political or strategic  grounds for declining this role, seemingly. Now there are:  Moscow's position has to be considered, Russia's isolation is  impermissible, and all this affords more than serious arguments  for restraint in the eastern direction. So the opposition  emanating from us is in fact only to the benefit of many people  in the West, for it provides a perfectly convincing excuse for  calmly, without losing face, postponing sine die the adoption of  difficult decisions.    Second, the political costs of such a deliberate or  unwitting  ingratiation of the Western partners fall wholly on Russia--as  far as relations with the former allies are concerned, in any  event. Had the North Atlantic alliance rejected them on its own  initiative, it is toward it that their negative emotions would  have been directed. Now, however, it transpires that it is  Moscow that has prevented an introduction to the "select club"  for those who wanted this, so all possible rebukes should be  addressed to the former. We have essentially been tripped up,  having agreed to pay someone else's bill. And we should not  console ourselves with the fact that it is not about to be  presented or that it is not that large.    Third, there is something ethically unseemly in this whole  situation. A well-bred individual would hardly permit himself to  unceremoniously point out to the owner of the house to which he  wishes to come: Either invite the whole crew together with me or  invite no one without me. This way of framing the question has  grated on no one in the West, it seems. But even in high  politics, granted all its differences from everyday life, the  atrophy of elementary standards of decency is fraught with the  danger of a loss of self-esteem. And the latter consists also,  specifically, of not going into hysterics if for some reason or  other you have not been given an invitation.    And, finally, one further point of considerable importance.  Claims that the former socialist countries should obtain  Moscow's blessing for a foreign policy choice they have made are  already being classed as characteristics of Russian policy in  the international arena. The USSR once possessed in full measure  this droit de regard in respect to the Warsaw Pact countries and  even intended to preserve it after the disintegration of the  latter. What, are we once again attempting to reproduce the old  model of interstate relations in East Europe?    The issue of ethics in foreign policy cannot be brushed  aside  just like that since it by no means boils down to a simple  choice between the pompous trivialities of primitive idealism  ("let's live amicably") and rational, and sometimes cynical,  calculation ("might is right"). But it would make sense to  reflect on certain problems connected with our active attempts  to prevent the expansion of NATO even from a purely pragmatic  viewpoint also.    Of course, from the viewpoint of Russian influence it would  be splendid were our former allies to link a strengthening of  stability in the region not only with NATO but with Moscow also.  But the initiative should, for all that, come from them. The  Americans are not overly foisting themselves on West Europe,  which only makes their positions there stronger.    The set of problems today has proven very suitable for  "adopting a position" and graphically demonstrating both to  critics within the country and to foreign contracting parties  that Russia has its own, particular interests in the  international arena and is fully resolved to defend them.    The signal is, perhaps, timely, just as long as all the  steam  has not gone into the whistle. The question in itself is by no  means a super-priority for Russia. Whether, for example, the  Czech Republic joins or does not join NATO would have no  significance either for our relations with Ukraine or for the  prospects of normalization in the Transcaucasus or for the  development of events in Central Asia or for the continued  evolution of the CIS as a whole. That is, for the search for  answers to all the foreign policy challenges that truly demand  Moscow's paramount attention, but of which the problem of  military-political confrontation with the North Atlantic  alliance is not one.    Russia is, of course, interested in an all-European  architecture that does not erect new barriers between us and the  West. Aleksey Arbatov is perfectly right to stress that the  "filching" of states in this intermediate zone in terms of  spheres of influence could result in the restoration of frontal  confrontation (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 1 October 1993). But could  this be avoided were frontal resistance to the expansion of NATO  to be organized? And would such resistance not be phase one of a  future confrontation?    After all, many people in the West recognize the possible  negative consequences of an expansion of the North Atlantic  alliance and are displaying caution. True, illusory, and, I  would say, localistic sentiments prevail in political circles of  our former allies.    Perhaps it would be better to renounce the prohibitory  fervor, which tactically is of benefit clearly not to us and  which could strategically drive us into an impasse? It is not,  of course, a question of sitting with our arms folded and  waiting for something to turn up. Russia could, say, have very  serious reasons for considering the CSCE a more attracting  structure than NATO. So we should concentrate attention on  increasing the efficiency of the corresponding mechanisms in the  first case, not on throwing wrenches into the works in the  second. Especially since these works are spinning their wheels  as it is.    There is no doubt that we need to seek to ensure that other  participants in international life reckon with our foreign  policy interests, our concerns on questions of the country's  security, and our ideas concerning real and potential external  threats to Russia. The question is how to define these interests  and how to ensure that they are respected without reviving  stereotypes of the past or losing our own dignity. And, what is  of considerable importance, without causing repercussions that  could sooner or later boomerang against Russia itself.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing recovers to Pounds 2.05m STERLING Publishing Group, owner of Debretts Peerage, appears to be recovering from untimely expansion in 1990, with the announcement of Pounds 2.05m in annual pre-tax profits, compared with a losses of Pounds 1.04m. Mr Michael Preston, deputy chairman, was bullish about the current year, saying he would be disappointed if the company did not surpass 1990 profits of Pounds 4.4m. 'Advertising is showing a very healthy increase. The current year is looking very good indeed.' Mr Preston said the group had increased advertising revenue by 40 per cent in the year just ended, due to concentrating on more internationally marketable publications. Turnover for the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 35.9m to Pounds 41.6m, including Pounds 7.63m from discontinued operations. Interest payable fell from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 1.89m and debt was reduced by Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 17.6m. Since the end of the period borrowings have fallen by a further Pounds 3.6m, partly due to disposals. Sterling, which publishes reference and trade books which earn their revenue through advertising, pulled out of or discontinued several titles during the year. This meant a virtual turnround on the expansion of 1990-91 which brought the group into the sharply depressed US market. Jami, the direct marketing business, and two US publications had been sold since the year-end. Costs of reorganisation and disposals made after the year-end of Pounds 5.34m (Pounds 1.56m) were taken as an extraordinary item. A further Pounds 4.57m (Pounds 1.62m) charge arose from the accounting requirement that goodwill previously written off be taken in the profit and loss account upon disposal. The loss attributable to shareholders was almost doubled to Pounds 8.03m (Pounds 4.14m). Fully-diluted earnings per share were 6.9p, although on a continuing basis they were 6.1p, compared with losses of 5.5p. The proposed final dividend is raised to 2p (1p), for a maintained total of 2.5p.</p>

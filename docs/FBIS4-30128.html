			<p>BFN     [Text] The government decided on 23 June to hold talks  with North Korean officials to discuss ways to resume the  stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks. This has been disclosed  by a top Foreign Ministry official. During his telephone  conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa has asked that the United States urge  North Korea to resume the stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks  when it holds high-level talks with that country and instructed  Foreign Ministry officials to begin preparations for the talks  with North Korean officials.    Both the United States and North Korea are expected to  resume  the stalled third round of high-level talks early next month and  North and South Korea are moving toward holding an inter-Korean  summit meeting. In this way, moves are afoot to "resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue." These moves have  made the government feel the need for Japan to hold a dialogue  with North Korea. The Japan-DPRK normalization talks have been  stalled since last November.    The top Foreign Ministry official has pointed out that the  "issue of Yi Un-hae" [a Japanese woman allegedly abducted to  North Korea] -- who allegedly educated Kim Hyun-hi, who was  sentenced to death for blowing up a Korean airliner -- and the  issue of verifying North Korea's past nuclear development would  stand in the way of resuming the stalled Japan-DPRK  normalization talks.</p>

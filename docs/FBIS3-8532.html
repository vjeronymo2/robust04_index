			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Miroslav Konvalina] </F>   [Excerpts] Brussels--Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus is  at this very moment signing the Partnership for Peace project,  which offers postcommunist countries cooperation in security and  political issues. The Czech Republic has become the 11th country  to join the project. [passage omitted]    Klaus said in his speech that the Czech Republic regards the  Partnership for Peace as a brave initiative that means a new  stage in our relations with NATO, the military and political  organization of 16 countries that we are striving to join.    As far as our admission into the European Union is  concerned,  Klaus was, in his own words, very optimistic following his talks  with the EU Commission President Jacques Delors, in particular  when he said that the end or the turn of the century was too  late for us as a date for our admission as a fully fledged  member. The Czech prime minister shocked the Hungarians and the  Poles, in particular, with this statement. They are expecting  to be admitted to the alliance at the turn of the century.    Neither Delors nor Klaus regard it as decisive when a  country  submits an application for full membership in the Twelve. What  is more important is when they meet the specific qualitative  criteria for membership set by the Maastricht Treaty. [passage  omitted]</p>

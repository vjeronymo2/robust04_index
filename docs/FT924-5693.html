			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Santos takes 19.9% stake in Sagasco SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday acquired a 19.9 per cent stake in Sagasco for ADollars 107m (USDollars 73.1m), confirming its interest in the company in spite of the withdrawal of a ADollars 560m takeover offer. Santos bought 41m shares from the South Australian state government and institutions, and indicated it would seek 'suitable' board representation. The sale reduces the state government's holding in Sagasco to just over 51 per cent. The government put its stake up for sale in July, triggering a bid from Santos which was dropped after legal action by competition authorities. The case is expected to be heard in March.</p>

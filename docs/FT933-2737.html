			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Law body urges end to hearsay rule THE Law Commission, the government's law reform advisory body, is calling for abolition of the rule which prevents witnesses giving evidence second-hand in civil court, known as the hearsay rule. The rule has been criticised as confusing and unnecessary. It frequently results in increased costs and delays by requiring witnesses to attend and give evidence in person and can result in relevant evidence being excluded altogether where they cannot attend court. Judges are critical of the rule because the public finds it difficult to understand or accept, which undermines confidence in the judicial system. The rule is also difficult to reconcile with procedural changes introduced in recent years which were designed to speed up cases and introduce a more 'cards-on-the-table' approach to civil litigation. Although the commission recommends abolition of the rule it says there is still a need to make sure litigants are aware of the limitations of using hearsay rather than direct evidence. It therefore proposes a number of safeguards, including a duty to give notice to the other side of the intention to rely on hearsay evidence; guidelines to help courts in assessing what importance they should attach to hearsay; and the right for a party to call and cross-examine any witness whose evidence has been given as hearsay by the opposing side.

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UN group sends BCCI report to Abu Dhabi: Alternative rescue scheme for the failed bank's depositors endorsed A UNITED Nations study group has delivered to Abu Dhabi's rulers a report on the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and has endorsed a depositors' rescue scheme prepared by Paine Webber, the New York investment bankers. The alternative scheme would pay out more than the amount forecast by the liquidators of the collapsed bank. The 23-page report, prepared by experts working with the UN's Centre on Transnational Corporations, was sent on January 22 to Mr Ahmed Khalifa al Suwaidi, one of the closest advisers of Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. The letter to Mr al Suwaidi, from Mr Kamal Hossain, special adviser to the UN centre, says a rescue plan prepared by Paine Webber for a group of BCCI depositors could 'better protect the interests of depositors and indeed those of the shareholders than the way in which the matter is being approached by the liquidators'. The confidential Paine Webber plan describes the scheme prepared by Touche Ross, the provisional liquidators of BCCI, as 'unrealistically conservative'. The initial liquidators' plan last November estimated a recovery value on BCCI assets of ten cents per dollar. Paine Webber's plan calls for a contribution of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn (Pounds 1.68bn-Pounds 2.24bn) from the Abu Dhabi government, BCCI's majority shareholder. Mr Peter Hansen, executive director of the UN centre, said the letter to Abu Dhabi was not designed to exert pressure 'so much as to make ourselves available'. Mr Hansen called for international co-ordination of the BCCI liquidation rather than individual winding up of the collapsed bank in various countries. The UN report, which has already been circulated among 35 central bank governors, may, however, have arrived too late in Abu Dhabi. An agreement between the Touche Ross liquidators and Abu Dhabi majority shareholders was said last week to be no more than a 'signature away' from completion. The last leg of negotiations on this plan, which is believed to call for a Dollars 2.2bn ceiling on Abu Dhabi's contribution, was expected to take no more than a week. It was unclear yesterday just how seriously Abu Dhabi is considering the intervention by the UN centre, but the approach was being played down by the liquidators who do not want anything to get in the way of a deal.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: A revolution in Toyland Whatever happened to cuisenaire rods? When my children were small they were the badge of honour of the design-concerned home. You left them lying strategically around the place and visitors could instantly tell that here was a really concerned home - no nasty little plastic thingummies to sully the burgeoning aesthetic sense of the small set. Wooden, hand-made and strictly educational were what made a toy acceptable in the socially-aware home of the late 60s. So imagine my surprise on opening this year's edition of The Good Toy Guide * to see pages filled with jolly, brightly-coloured plastic toys, offering the kind of joys the poor, deprived children of the 60s never knew. There, in all its garishness, is the Little Pony Kitchen (Pounds 16.99 and 'robust enough to withstand the attentions of temperamental young chefs'), the Incredible Crash dummies (Pounds 4.99), the Jungle Fun Train (Pounds 36.95) and the Bontempi Barbie Audio Cassette Recorder with Microphone, in all its purple and shocking pink awfulness, (Pounds 31.99). Toys, of course, must change as the world changes but today's child is at least not deprived of jollity. Those wanting advice and inspiration as to what to give anybody under eight could do worse than send off for this guide - every toy has been tested, every one comes with full and clear descriptions of exactly what it does, its strengths and weaknesses, its price and a list of manufacturers' addresses. * The Good Toy Guide: Pounds 1.25 plus 50p p + p, from the National Association of Toy &amp; Leisure Libraries, 68 Church Way, London NW1 1LT</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 4.8m at Crest Packaging Crest Packaging, which came to the market last October, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m for the year to April 30. The comparison with 1993 was complicated by an exceptional gain of Pounds 12.7m on the sale of property, which produced a pre-tax figure of Pounds 17.6m. Profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 4.6m. The flexible packaging division was affected by site reorganisation, while the installation of a new production line affected the carton division. Turnover rose by 3 per cent, from Pounds 41.8m to Pounds 43m, helped by the flexible packaging division. This produced profits of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.3m) on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 25.5m). Pressure on margins reduced profits in the carton division from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.11m on lower sales of Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 16.3m). Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, said raw material prices, which account for 50 per cent of overall costs, were rising. The increase 'would be passed on to customers'. Earnings per share before exceptional items increased from 8p to 9.2p. Basic earnings fell from 30.7p to 9.1p. A final dividend of 2.75p is recommended, compared with a notional 2.43p.</p>

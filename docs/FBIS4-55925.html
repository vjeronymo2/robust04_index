			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 20 May (MTI) -- Coalition or a one-party  government is what is at issue on May 29, round two of national  elections, Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), said in Pecs, southern  Hungary, today.    For the Free Democrats, it will decide if they enjoy enough  support to implement their programme, he said.    Should the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) win an outright  majority in parliament, there are minimal chances of a  MSZP-SZDSZ coalition being formed, Kuncze said, adding that a  final decision would be up to the SZDSZ delegates' assembly on  June 5.    If the Socialists won more than 50 percent of mandates, the  SZDSZ would have no genuine weight in any coalition, Kuncze told  MTI, saying the Free Democrats are not willing to be coalition  "extras".    If the MSZP won less than 50 percent and the SZDSZ won about  25 per cent of mandates, the Free Democrats could have a genuine  influence on government, Kuncze said.</p>

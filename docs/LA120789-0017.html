			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CUBA;  </P> <P> 2,016 SOLDIERS DIED IN ANGOLA FIGHTING  </P> <P> Disclosing for the first time the human cost of its military involvement in  Angola, the Cuban government announced that 2,016 Cubans have died in the  African country since its forces were sent there 14 years ago. A spokesman for  the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C., gave that figure in  announcing that the remains of all Cubans who died carrying out international  missions in Angola and elsewhere have been returned to Cuba in recent days. In  1987, Brig. Gen. Rafael del Pino Diaz, who defected to the U.S., said about  10,000 Cuban troops had been killed in Angola since 1976.  </P></p>

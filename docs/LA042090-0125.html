			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> VOTE ON SUBDIVISIONS SPURS INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that it is  investigating a possible conflict of interest involving a planning commissioner  who voted to allow the building of subdivisions while reportedly holding a  financial interest in the development firm.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Crandall confirmed Thursday that her office is looking  into Harold Joseph's connection to Dallas-based Centex Development Corp., but  declined to comment further.  </P> <P> Joseph owns a San Clemente real estate firm with his wife.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with The Times last Friday, Joseph conceded he owned  $10,000 in Centex stock in November when he voted in favor of allowing the firm  to build subdivisions to include 476 single-family homes.  </P> <P> Joseph said he wasn't aware that his action was a potential violation of state  law, which prohibits public officials from voting on issues in which they hold  a financial interest.  </P> <P> On Friday, when he acknowledged the financial tie, Joseph said: "I wasn't  trying to do anything illegal."  </P> <P> He said he sold the stock last month when City Clerk Myrna Erway pointed out  that his ownership might be a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> At least two City Council members said this week that they are pushing for  Joseph's resignation. But Joseph said he will not make any decisions on his  future, including his position on the commission when his two-year term expires  in June, until he returns from vacation later this month.  </P> <P> The matter came to the attention of the district attorney's office last August  when resident Simon Zervos, a retired Coast Guard officer, filed a complaint  over a finder's fee that Joseph received last year for leading Centex to  purchase land in east San Clemente where the developer is now building 398  homes.  </P> <P> City Atty. Jeffrey M. Oderman ruled last year that the commissioner had done  nothing wrong because Joseph received the money from the property's previous  owner, Estrella Properties Ltd. Councilman Brian J. Rice said he will seek to  introduce legislation at the council's May 2 meeting calling for the planning  commissioner to be removed from the his post. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

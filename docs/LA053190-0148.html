			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' STAR TO BE TRIED ON COCAINE  POSSESSION  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Municipal Court judge ruled Wednesday that enough evidence exists to  try "Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer for cocaine possession.  </P> <P> The ruling by Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb came after a Los Angeles police  officer testified that Grammer confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine  in his patrol car after the actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in  1988.  </P> <P> "That cocaine was in my pocket. I felt stupid. I should have just told you I  had it," Officer Michael Akana quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better  than that. I would like to apologize to you."  </P> <P> Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubby beard, Grammer -- who plays  the pompous psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the TV series -- looked cheerful  as he came into court for the brief preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Grammer is serving a 30-day sentence for violating probation on an unrelated  drunk driving conviction. Because of jail overcrowding, he will be released  Saturday after serving 10 days.  </P></p>

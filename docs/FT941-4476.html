			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Danish jobless above forecast: Economic watch The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in Denmark was 12.5 per cent of the workforce in January, unchanged from December and up from 11.9 per cent in January 1993. The seasonally-adjusted figure of people out of work was 349,900 in January, compared with 348,700 in December 1993. However, January's unemployment rate was well-above average market expectations of a 12.1 per cent rate. A state-subsidised job-rotation scheme was introduced in January, but its effect is not yet clear. Germany's Hermes export-credit insurance programme is likely to post a deficit of DM7.5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in 1994, because of problems collecting debts from Russia and Iran, according to the chairman of the Bundestag's budget committee. In 1993, the Hermes programme deficit was DM5.1bn. Norway's consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in February, compared with January, taking the year-on-year inflation rate to 1.4 per cent. The January year-on-year inflation rate of 1.3 per cent was the lowest recorded since 1963. West German consumer price inflation was an annualised 3.4 per cent in February, according to revised figures, compared with an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in January. West German producer prices were unchanged in January compared with a year earlier.</p>

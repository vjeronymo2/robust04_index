			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Intriguing model for future of UK unions Sir, As a practitioner in industrial relations for a global company, I am familiar with Robert Taylor's reporting, scholarly work - eg, 'The Trade Union Question in British Politics' - as well as his latest publication, 'The Future of Trade Unions', reviewed by Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry ('Bedrock trade unionism lives on', September 1). It seems to me that Mr Davies's industry bias skews his observations in representing the author's position regarding the attitude of employers. A specific quote in the review is 'He (Taylor) contrasts British employers' 'commitment to deregulated labour markets' with the attitude 'of their European mainland counterparts who have a sense of social and ethical responsibility for the well-being of their employees''. Mr Davies finds this generalisation 'absurd and offensive'. In context, the full quote is 'British employers' commitment to the deregulated labour markets looks much firmer than that of their European mainland counterparts who have a sense of social and ethical responsibility for the well-being of their employees'. Certainly not an absurd observation, and offensive to whom? In reality, transnational enterprises manage work forces according to statutes of the member states in which they operate, and the 'sense of responsibility' of businesses, as evidenced in northern Europe, may be the result imposed by law rather than a higher social consciousness. In Robert Taylor's concluding chapter, notwithstanding his advocacy of the union movement, he is pragmatic in writing a prescription for the future. 'The trade unions in this country have reached an important crossroads in their history. They need to come off the back foot and take the initiative', and he acknowledges that unions must add value 'to the success of the enterprise in meeting the remorseless challenges posed to it by global competition in the open market'. Pressures to increase shareholder value, cyclical economic downturns, and the realities of alternative sources of lower unit labour costs, combine to have an impact even on enterprises with the most enlightened human resource programmes. Unions could well provide a buffer between unilateral actions by the employer and employees' collective best interests. Although I do not completely agree with all of Taylor's analysis and conclusions (for example, the role of unions in providing certain services outside the workplace and great expectations from EU directives), I believe he provides an intriguing model for the future. Clearly, any institution would prefer to operate unencumbered by outside influence; better then for business to develop a constructive partnership with a union than rely upon intervention by the government or the courts in determining the employer's relationship with the work force.

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner issues Dollars 1bn debenture TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment company, yesterday launched a Dollars 1bn debenture offer designed to reduce the burden of the group's outstanding Dollars 6.5bn of preferred stock. The Dollars 1bn offer is part of Time Warner's effort to work through its heavy debt load, a result of the company's formation following the merger agreement in 1989 between Time and Warner. The company, which last year made strides toward rescheduling its bank debt, recently indicated it may sell up to Dollars 3bn of assets over the next two or three years as part of the move to strengthen its balance sheet. Net proceeds of the debenture issue, which mature in 2013 and carry a coupon of 9.125 per cent, would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock. The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in dividend payments, was issued as a result of the merger agreement between Time and Warner. The dividends have plunged Time Warner into a bottom-line loss in spite of strong operating earnings from its music, film, publishing and cable television divisions. In the first nine months of 1992 it made Dollars 926m of operating income, but its debt servicing reduced net profits to just Dollars 18m and its loss after payment dividends on preferred stock was Dollars 449m. The offer, scheduled to close on January 19, is being underwritten by Merrill Lynch, BT Securities Corporation and JP Morgan Securities.</p>

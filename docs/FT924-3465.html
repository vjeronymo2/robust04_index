			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Review ordered after Clinton case A REVIEW of Home Office guidelines for dealing with press inquiries about individual cases was ordered yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, amid political unease over the searching of immigration files for information on US president-elect Mr Bill Clinton. Answering questions from the cross-party home affairs committee of MPs, Mr Clarke said that ministers had not been consulted and Mr Clinton's permission had not been sought before a check was made to see if he had applied for British citizenship during the Vietnam war. During the US election campaign, Mr Clinton was accused of 'draft-dodging' to try to avoid military service in Vietnam. Mr Clarke told the committee that in October his department's press office had been approached by journalists asking if Mr Clinton had applied for citizenship. The press officer had said that such matters were confidential, but had then had the files checked and advised journalists - in an off-the-record statement - that there was no point in pursuing the story. The guidelines will be reviewed with the Home Office chief press officer, Mr Clarke said, as he emphasised his view that individual cases should not be discussed without permission. One likely outcome of Mr Clarke's review is that such a politically sensitive press query should not in future be met without the consent of the person concerned, even where the inquiry draws a blank. Mr Clarke said that he was satisfied that 'no improper use' was made of the Home Office. After reports of coolness between Downing Street and the incoming US administration - which have been denied by Number 10 - Mr Clarke also emphasised that he had made sure that the background to the case was available to the British ambassador in the US. He said there was no need for disciplinary action, since the motives of the press officer concerned had been 'sensible' and no confidential information had been disclosed. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, tabled parliamentary questions yesterday asking for a full statement of the circumstances and what changes were being considered to prevent a recurrence. Labour's anxiety was intensified by the fact that two Tory party advisers had worked on the election campaign of President George Bush. In the Commons, Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said government departments must not be allowed to become an 'extension of Conservative Central Office'. He called for a ruling from the Speaker 'on the need to separate the daily workings of the department of state from purely party matters'.</p>

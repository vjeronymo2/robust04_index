			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Terrorism and the Peace  Process," AL-BA'TH says: It has been officially confirmed that  the Tel Aviv government and the occupation army are directly  linked to the Hebron massacre. Consequently, the major world  powers should have played the expected role in the face of the  mass murder operations carried out by the occupation troops and  the settlers, who are backed by the Tel Aviv government.    The paper adds: We expected decisive and serious measures to  put an end to the policy of murder, terrorism, and forced  expulsion that Israel is practicing against our people in the  occupied territories.    The paper blames the world's big powers for not taking  serious measures against the Israelis, who have continued to  commit more massacres and terrorist acts.    The paper stresses that in order to see a successful end to  the peace process and the achievment of its desired objectives,  an end must be put to the Israeli disdain for international  legitimacy and its resolutions. These resolutions should also  be implemented, particularly those relating to the complete and  comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.    The paper stresses that peace will remain distant from the  region as long as Arab territory remains occupied.    The paper concludes by saying: The facts of the conflict in  the region should be dealt with in accordance with the  resolutions of international legitimacy. Only in this way can  peace be established and the region escape the state of tension  that it has been living with for half a century.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 26 (CTK) -- Preparations for early  elections in autumn will be high on the agenda of a two-day  national congress of the opposition Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) which opened in Presov, east Slovakia, today.  Delegates will assess the period of the HZDS government, elect a  new leadership and approve a new election manifesto and statutes.    According to the latest public opinion poll conducted  immediately after the March 14 dismissal of Vladimir Meciar from  the post of Slovak premier and the ousting of his cabinet,  HZDS's shift to the opposition increased its popularity among  voters to more than 26 percent (against 22 percent in February).  Given this trend, the fragmented political scene and the loss  of interest by a considerable part of the population in  politics, Meciar's comeback as head of a new government after  the autumn elections cannot be ruled out.    Observers do not rule out that a further split of Meciar's  movement, which now has 56 deputies, down from a total of 74  after the June 1992 parliamentary elections, can occur at the  congress. According to speculations, the postponement of the  movement's change into a party could result in the withdrawal  from the movement of social democratic-minded deputies with  parliamentary foreign committee chairman Ivan Laluha at their  head.    Attending the congress are representatives of the Slovak  historical cultural institution Matica Slovenska, the  Confederation of Trade Unions and the Farmers Party. Members of  the diplomatic corps of the United States, Russia, China and  other countries are also taking part. Slovak President Michal  Kovac sent a letter to the congress, but it was not read. At the  HZDS conference in Presov, east Slovakia, HZDS Deputy Chairwoman  Olga Keltosova today said that it was unacceptable for the  movement to be reduced to maintaining a defensive policy before  the early elections in autumn. She rejected politicking by  individual HZDS members who want to act in line with their  "conscience," and said that the HZDS's election policy should be  unified.    The foundation of Milan Knazko's Alliance of Slovak  Democrats  and Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party-New Alternative  caused a personal and institutional catharsis in the political  centre, to which the HZDS belongs, whilst the political spectrum  on the right and the left has remained stable, Keltosova said.  The process abetted by various media has strengthened  "political anti-culture," she added.    In a letter sent to the conference, Slovak President Michal  Kovac described the HZDS as a meaningful political force. "It  would be no good if I hid the tension between the HZDS chairman  (Meciar) and the president which had gradually grown into open  attacks on the Slovak President," said the letter, read at the  conference. Kovac said this conflict had not been personal, but  because of its social and political character it had had a  negative impact on developments in Slovakia.    At a brief press conference in a break of the HZDS  conference, HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said the movement  would develop as a pragmatic centre party after the autumn  elections. The HZDS would seek to cover up a broader spectrum  of opinions and thus follow the line common in other European  countries, Kozlik said. Keltosova told journalists after the  first day of the HZDS conference that the HZDS would develop as  a political centre party and rejected the idea of the HZDS being  a "pragmatic centre party." She said that the HZDS was not  likely to change into a party at the current two-day conference  and added that in future the HZDS would maintain a clear  political profile. She described as the most acceptable option  the movement's entry into the liberal international.    Keltosova confirmed that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's shadow  cabinet would meet regularly once a week. She said former HZDS  ministers would participate in the work of the cabinet and that  the vacancies would be gradually filled.</p>

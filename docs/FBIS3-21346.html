			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Because of the crisis stemming from the Gulf war,  Saudi Arabia has had to pay out vast amounts of money, estimated  at $55 billion. However, despite that, it has been able to  surmount the crisis.    This was the message of the Saudi ambassador to Great  Britain, Dr. Ghazi al-Qusaybi, in a new response to biased media  reports being circulated about the Saudi Arabian economy.    In his reply, the Saudi ambassador dealt with more than one  economic aspect that those reports had raised. He categorically  denied the truth of a report that the Kingdom is attempting to  obtain loans to defray the state's general budget deficit. He  stressed that no negotiations were underway between Saudi Arabia  and any Western or non-Western banking institution to obtain  loans.    Ambassador al-Qusaybi's statements coincided with a study by  the magazine, CORPORATE LOCATION, to the effect that Saudi  Arabia, among all the Arab nations, was among the top 20 nations  in the world that have an appropriate climate to attract  investments. The study polled about 10,000 companies in the  United States and Britain, and all of them stressed that the  economic climate in Saudi Arabia was suitable for investment.  Those companies are active in all parts of the world. Half of  them specialize in production, and the other half offer  services, concentrating on engineering, new technology, and  mining industry sectors.    Moreover, a study by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and  Industry pointed out that since the beginning of its planning  era, the Kingdom has striven to prepare an appropriate  investment climate for the private sector through a clearly  defined economic policy based on the philosophy of free economy  and open markets. A group of regulations, measures, and laws  have shared in applying this philosophy, organizing  relationships between national and foreign capital on the one  hand, and between them and the state on the other. All of that  is achieved by the supervision of governmental or specialized  private organizations, who work to direct and guide the private  sector to available investment opportunities.    With regard to the details of all that, Ambassador  al-Qusaybi  explained that the Kingdom has not requested any loans from  international or financial institutions. The ambassador pointed  out that the only foreign loan the Kingdom had on hand was for  $4.5 billion. This is the amount the Kingdom previously borrowed  from abroad; there are no other loans.    The Saudi ambassador stated frankly that it was strange that  people were talking now about the Kingdom's general budget  deficit, since in the past six or seven years, there has been a  disparity between expenditures and income in the budget. As for  the statement of the Bank of International Settlements that as  of November 1993 Saudi Arabia has borrowed more than $2 billion  from it, over the past few years, that same bank has set as a  kind of general guideline standard for the percentage of  indebtedness, either domestically or abroad, that debts should  not exceed 60 percent of the gross national product. In fact,  Ambassador al-Qusaybi stated, the Kingdom's foreign and domestic  indebtedness, as the bank knows, does not even come close to 60  percent. On the contrary, the Kingdom's foreign debts do not  exceed $4.5 billion.    The Saudi ambassador clearly stated that the Kingdom did not  expect anyone to express uneasiness or to inform it of its  responsibilities in this important regard. The authorities  concerned will continue the pressure of governmental  expenditures, but in such a way as to not cause any injury to  the citizens. He pointed out that the inflation rate in the  Kingdom was one of the lowest rates in the world. As for the  price of oil and its influence on the Kingdom's economy, the  Saudi ambassador said: "I believe that we cannot be governed by  the day-to-day price of oil. Certainly, OPEC will take measures  to guarantee that the oil price will remain at reasonable  levels. What happened recently should not, in any case, be a  measurement for what the oil situation will be in the coming  months."    Going back to the Saudi Chamber of Commerce study, it stated  that private investment in the Kingdom enjoys many encouraging  incentives, which have contributed to the private sector's  participation in economic activity and to the increase in that  participation. These incentives include:     -  The Saudi Development Fund offers loans up to as much as  50 percent of the project's costs.    -  Total exemption of Saudi industrial or nonindustrial  companies  from all taxes pertaining to companies. They are subject to the  zakat [Islamic charity tax] at 2.5 percent of available  liquidity.    -  The imported goods required for the industrial project are  also  completely exempt from customs duties. These imports include  machinery, tools, equipment, systems, spare parts, and primary  and partially manufactured raw materials.    -  The state also offers the land required to build factories,  as  well as workers and officials' housing, on a nominal lease. This  has caused the state to build several industrial cities,  furnished with all services.    -  Local production enjoys complete protection by various means,  which includes limiting or preventing the importing of foreign  goods similar to local production, raising the customs duties on  them, and offering various means of financial assistance to  Saudi industrial organizations.    -  The exemption from export fees and all other taxes of  products  prepared for export is also permitted.    -  All of these measures are to encourage capital to enter  investment fields in the Kingdom. There are also several  incentives to foreign capital as well, including:    -  Foreign capital enjoys all the advantages enjoyed by national  capital. The industrial or agricultural project, in which  foreign capital is invested, also enjoys exemption from income  and company taxes for 10 years. Other projects are exempt for  five years. The exemption has the proviso that national capital  must own not less than 25 percent of the capital allocated to  the project as a whole.    -  In addition, there are several other incentives, such as  direct  and indirect support for the agricultural sector, through easy  loans, subsidies, favorable prices, and reduction of electricity  and water costs, since the state provides the private sector  with electricity at a very low cost. The state also bears the  expenses for training workers in national factories, either in  the Kingdom or abroad.       According to the study, all of this stresses the confidence  of the Saudi economy in itself while, at the same time,  confirming its soundness, especially in the integration between  the private sector and the state. However, that is without any  impinging on a free economy and free markets. An economy like  this is not affected by a crisis or crises, except if the crisis  occurs directly and, then, it rapidly transcends that crisis.    According to a specialist in this field, the financial  straits that affected Saudi Arabia because of the exorbitant  costs of the Gulf war were quickly ended, since the 1993 budget  was an expansion budget. It totalled 196.95 billion riyals [R]  (approximately $65 billion), i.e., an increase of 8.8 percent  over the 1992 budget. The deficit was estimated at R27.8 billion  ($8 billion), i.e., a reduction of 7.4 percent over the 1992  budget deficit.    It is clear from Saudi budget numbers that for the fifth  consecutive year estimates of general expenditures for 1993 are  higher than estimates for the previous year. This has helped to  keep the level of economic growth high for the foreseeable  future.</p>

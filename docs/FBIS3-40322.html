			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 20 January edition of the Belgrade  daily POLITIKA, in a page 9 article examining the social program  section of "The Program for the Reconstruction of the Monetary  System and Economic Stabilization of Yugoslavia," says that its  main goal is to shift the burden of social welfare from  enterprises and the economic sector to the state. The article  cites Mirosinka Dinkic, an employee of the Belgrade Economic  Institute who participated in the drafting of the social  program, who states that the problem of surplus workers has to  be resolved as soon as the program goes into effect because "the  economy cannot function efficiently if the current number of  employees remains. This means that in the entire economic sector  -- excepting private firms -- out of a total of 1,780,000  employees, there is a surplus of 1 million workers." Thus,  virtually every firm will be faced with downsizing in order to  improve its business operations. According to the program's  assessment, 200,000 people currently employed in firms all over  Yugoslavia own land, and such people will inevitably have to  return to their land and be without work permits. It is up to  the firms to decide when and how this will be done but if they  want to succeed, they will have to do it as soon as possible,  Dinkic says. Dinkic points out, in addition, that it has been  assessed that about 100,000 workers in public enterprisesalso  own private firms which, in the future, should become their only  businesses. About 500,000 of the workers who will lose their  jobs will receive 50 percent of their salaries as unemployment  compensation from the state budget for a period of one year.</p>

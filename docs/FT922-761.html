			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (27): Bollywood hears cash registers clink - The country's film industry is among the world's biggest WANT TO forget the harsh world of reality? For less than Rs10 anyone can do just that for three hours of pure entertainment at one of India's 13,000 movie halls. With 900 films in 15 languages produced annually, the choice is wide. Some 14m tickets are sold daily. All of which makes the Indian film industry one of the biggest in the world. Although films are produced in all of India's major languages, the Bombay-based Hindi industry dominates the scene, both economically and culturally. Dubbed 'Bollywood' by its detractors for its near-parasitic dependence on Hollywood's creativity, the popular Hindi cinema has been the staple entertainment of the masses for over seven decades. Hindi films are released nationally, while regional language ones are released only in individual states. Currently, the movie industry is in a state of breathless expectation. In the 1980s, producers lost money; in contrast, the 1990s appear both bright and profitable. At theatre halls, cash registers have started clinking once again as a new generation of teenagers discovers the visual delights of the big screen. Home videos are boosting the trend. For theatre owners in some states, profits have also improved because of a recent minor tax change providing a modest rebate. No longer are movie theatres being converted into shopping complexes and office blocks. Though few new cinema halls are opening up, some old cinemas, which had fallen into seediness, are being restored. It is widely expected that the current ratio of eight cinema seats per 1,000 population will improve in the near future. Moreover, the video onslaught, which had become the bane of the business during the 1980s is no longer the menace it used to be. For almost a decade, rampant piracy robbed film-makers of royalties from video cassette sales, while keeping middle class audiences out of theatres. The Rs12bn film industry faced a challenge from a pirate industry whose turnover was almost equal. By the late 1980s, however, things had changed. Sporadic police raids and court cases, combined with the accumulation of vast personal fortunes, encouraged the bigger video pirates to legitimise their operations. Film producers and video pirates signed a reluctant truce. Not only did they start financing films together, but libraries began to stock legally-made cassettes. Licensed video sales looked up and today constitute about 10 per cent of total returns. One film producer who has been particularly successful in twirling the video boom to his advantage is Mr Ramanand Sagar. According to industry experts, Sagar Studios makes a clear profit of Rs800,000 on every video cassette it brings out. It keeps a tight control on production costs. Each video is made for roughly Rs250,000 - a low figure by industry standards. Despite the poor quality of sets and computer graphics, videos from the Sagar stable are immensely popular. The secret of Mr Sagar's success? He has cashed on a resurgent Hindu wave. His version of the Ramayan, one of India's two great epics, brought the country to a grinding halt every Sunday morning when it was broadcast on the state-run national television network. When Mr B. R. Chopra, a rival film-maker, was chosen to serialise the Mahabharat, Mr Sagar shifted to the video medium. His 78-episode magnum opus on the life of Krishna (of which 10 have been produced to date) has been marketed with flair. Popularity brings its own problems. 'We are losing at least Rs30m-40m a year because of cable pirates,' grumbles Mr Prem Sagar, managing director. Cable pirates, in fact, are taking over from the video pirates of yesteryear. Unauthorised cable networks in urban areas have mushroomed. For between Rs60-150 a month, they offer at least two cable channels during peak hours. Most also offer Star TV, the new Hong Kong satellite broadcasting station and CNN. According to Admarg, an independent Bombay-based market research agency, in December 91 there were 12,000 cable operators. There has been a brisk 20 per cent rise in the cable operator fraternity. Though Star TV is an advertisement-driven free service, cable operators frequently tape popular programmes. Illegal cable screenings of Star TV programmes (which include the BBC World Service, Asia MTV and Prime Sports) as well as locally-produced entertainment software, are rapidly becoming a far greater menace than the video pirates. The government has promised steps to update legislation on copyright and cable TV, but progress has been tardy. Ironically, the advent of satellite channels at the same time offers the promise of an additional revenue source for film producers to wash off red inkstains on their profit-and-loss accounts. 'At some point, Star TV will have to commission Indian software,' agrees Mr Shakti Samant, president of the Indian Movie Pictures Association. Most Indian film making is financed out of black money. 'Much of this comes from the underworld. Indian mafia dons want to meet the starlets and gain respectability at the same time,' says Mr Rauf Ahmed, editor of Filmfare, a monthly magazine with 500,000 readers. The problem is that few legitimate sources of funds are accessible for this high-risk business. With no banking or institutional finance available, film producers are forced to borrow capital at usurious annual interest rates of 36-48 per cent. Among the hundreds of film companies, just one, the Madras-based G V Films, is a public limited concern. Film-making is possibly one of the most disorganised ways of making money. 'Unlike in other parts of the world, film stars in Bombay work in up to 20 films at a time,' says Mr Firoze Nadiadwala, a leading film producer and distributor. Even top directors and technicians have multiple assignments. This results in scattered shooting schedules of films. Most films take up to two years to complete, with prohibitive cost overruns. That is why out of 900 movies produced in a year, less than 14 per cent succeed in making money. They either die still-born or distributors refuse to take them up. In India, films are usually distributed region-wise through one or combination of three options. Producers receive either a minimum guarantee basis (the distributor guarantees to pay the producer a minimum amount irrespective of box-office collections), a flat commission or a refundable advance. Despite the near-certainty of losses for low-budget productions with untested directors, the glamour and glitz of Bombay's stars continue to attract nouveau-riche suckers. The industry is rarely short of funds. In such a scenario, the mood is more upbeat than it has been for the past three years. It's time for lights, camera, and action in Bollywood.</p>

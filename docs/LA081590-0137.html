			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> TALK IT OUT BEFORE AND DURING  </P> <P> If you've been reduced to bickering while traveling with your mate, don't be  ashamed to admit it. With a little eavesdropping, you'll discover you're not  the only one feeling tense when you're supposed to be having fun.  </P> <P> Ellis Wayne, a Newport Beach psychologist and frequent traveler, offers these  suggestions to help make you and your mate less testy when traveling:  </P> <P> * Before you leave, sit down and talk about what each of you wants from the  trip.  </P> <P> * Don't make decisions on the first day of a trip when you are tired and  haven't had time to adjust to your new surroundings.  </P> <P> * Be aware of your partner's desires and tolerances. If your partner is  miserable on a trip, you will be too, so do what you can to make the trip good  for your mate. That doesn't mean you have to give up everything you want to do,  however. Compromise.  </P> <P> * If you don't share the same interests, spend some time apart. When you return  to each other, you'll have adventures to share. And neither of you will feel  cheated.  </P> <P> * If you and your mate are very different, don't go on the kind of trip that's  going to cause tension. Go where it's comfortable so your differences will be  minimized rather than aggravated. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

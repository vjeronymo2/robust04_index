			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THREE COAL STRIKE LEADERS JAILED FOR VIOLATING BAN ON BLOCKING TRUCKS  </P> <P> A federal judge jailed three leaders of a coal miners' strike Monday for  violating a ban on blocking Pittston Coal Group trucks with massive sit-down  demonstrations.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, escalating a judicial crackdown on the civil  disobedience tactics of the United Mine Workers, found the three guilty of  contempt of court and said they will remain in jail until they can assure him  that his strike restrictions will be followed.  </P> <P> "The strike will continue," Marty Hudson, the main strike coordinator, said as  he was led away from the courthouse in handcuffs and leg irons along with  Jackie Stump, the regional UMW president, and C. A. Phillips, a UMW  International representative.  </P> <P> About 1,500 miners in southwestern Virginia and West Virginia have been on  strike against Pittston since April 5, after working 14 months without a  contract.  </P> <P> The federal action follows a state judge's decision Friday to fine the union $3  million for violating an order against mass picketing and sitting in the road  to disrupt Pittston operations in southwestern Virginia.  </P> <P> Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin promised additional fines each day the  prohibited activity continues, action that could bankrupt the UMW in two weeks  if carried through.  </P> <P> Last week, Williams ordered 317 demonstrators who have been arrested since his  strike restrictions were imposed to appear in court this month to show why they  should not be held in contempt. U.S. marshals began serving subpoenas Monday.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clermontia pyrularia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been found only on the island of Hawaii on the northeastern slope of Mauna Kea, the western slope of Mauna Loa, and the saddle area between the two mountains. Today, the species is found near the Humuula-Laupahoehoe boundary, near Hakalau Gulch, near Kealakekua, and near Kaawaloa. The five extant populations, which extend over a distance of about 47 by 6 mi (76 by 10 km), are located on privately, State and federally owned land. Although the exact number of individuals is not known, it is likely that not more than five individuals exist (HHP 1991d1 to 1991d6). This species typically grows in koa- and/or 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Wet Forests and Subalpine Dry Forests at elevations between 3,000 and 7,000 ft (910 and 2,130 m) (HHP 1991d2 to 1991d5, Lammers 1990, 1991). Associated species include pilo,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lythrum maritimum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (pukamole), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rubus hawaiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ('akala) (HHP 1991d2, 1991y). The major threat to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clermontia pyrularia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is competition from alien grasses and shrubs in the forest understory and banana poka as well as stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HHP 1991d2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colubrina oppositifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was first collected by Remy in the 1850s and was named in 1867 by Adolphe Theodore Brongniart (Mann 1867). The specific epithet describes the plant's opposite leaf arrangement. St. John (1979) called Oahu plants  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. oppositifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> obatae, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  but no subspecific taxa are recognized in the current treatment of the genus (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colubrina oppositifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), a tree 16 to 43 ft (5 to 13 m) tall, has opposite, stalked, oval, thin, pinnately veined, toothless leaves with glands on the lower surface. Leaves measure 2.4 to 4.7 in (6 to 12 cm) long and 1.2 to 2.8 in (3 to 7 cm) wide in mature plants and are larger in seedlings. Ten to 12 bisexual flowers are clustered at the end of a main stalk 0.1 to 0.3 in (3 to 8 millimeters (mm)) long; each flower has a stalk about 0.07 to 0.1 in (2 to 3 mm) long which elongates in fruit. The five triangular sepals measure about 0.06 to 0.08 in (1.5 to 2 mm) long, and the five greenish-yellow or white petals are about 0.06 in (1.5 mm) long. The somewhat spherical fruit, 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 11 mm) long, is similar to a capsule and opens explosively when mature. This species can be distinguished from the one other species of the genus in Hawaii by its growth habit and the arrangement, texture, venation, and margins of its leaves (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colubrina oppositifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was found on the island of Oahu in the central and southern Waianae Mountains and on the island of Hawaii in the following areas: The Kohala Mountains; the northern slope of Hualalai; and the western, southwestern, and southern slopes of Mauna Loa. Today, the species is known on Oahu in eastern Makaleha Valley, Mokuleia Forest Reserve, and Makua Valley; on Mt. Kaala; and near Honouliuli Contour Trail on privately and State-owned and federally managed land. The 6 extant populations on Oahu, which extend over a distance of about 9 by 4 mi (14 by 6 km), contain approximately 94 known individuals (HHP 1991e1, 1991e2, 1991e5, 1991e9 to 1991e12). On the island of Hawaii, there are 7 extant populations which extend over a distance of about 16 by 4 mi (26 by 6 km), are located on privately and State-owned land, and contain about 185 to 205 known individuals. The species occurs along the Mamalahoa Highway on the northern slope of Hualalai as well as in Kapua and Puueo in the southernmost portion of the island (HHP 1991e3, 1991e4, 1991e6 to 1991e8, 1991e13 to 1991e16). This species typically grows in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diospyros sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (lama)-dominated Lowland Dry and Mesic Forests, often on aa lava, at elevations between 800 and 3,000 ft (240 and 910 m). Associated species include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Canthium odoratum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (alahe'e) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reynoldsia sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ('ohe) (HHP 1991e3, 1991e8, 1991e9, 1991e15, 1991e16, HPCC 1991b). The major threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Colubrina oppositifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are competition from alien plant species such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lantana camara <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (lantana),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pennisetum setaceum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (fountain grass), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Schinus terebinthifolius <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Christmas berry); habitat disturbance by feral pigs; plant damage and death from black twig borer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Xylosandrus compactus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); fire; damage and disturbance from military exercises; and limited regeneration (HHP 1991e4, 1991e8, 1991e9, 1991e15, 1991e16; Joel Q. Lau, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rock (1917) named  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea copelandii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to honor his collecting companion, M.L. Copeland, with whom he first collected the species in 1914 on the island of Hawaii (Rock 1917). St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987), believing there to be no generic distinction between  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delissea, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transferred the species to the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delissea, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the older of the two generic names, creating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. copelandii. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The current treatment of the family (Lammers 1990), however, maintains the separation of the two genera, and plants found on the island of Hawaii are considered to be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. copelandii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> copelandii. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Subspecies  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> haleakalaensis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> found on Maui, is not as rare. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea copelandii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> copelandii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the bellflower family is a shrub with a habit similar to that of a woody vine. The alternate, stalked, toothed leaves are 7.9 to 10.6 in (20 to 27 cm) long and 1.4 to 3.3 in (3.5 to 8.5 cm) wide and have fine hairs on the lower surface. Five to 12 flowers are clustered on the end of a main stalk 0.8 to 1.8 in (2 to 4.5 cm) long; each flower has a stalk 0.2 to 0.6 in (0.4 to 1.6 cm) long. The slightly hairy hypanthium is topped by five small, triangular calyx lobes. Petals, which are yellowish but appear rose-colored because of a covering of dark red hairs, are fused into a curved tube with five spreading lobes; the corolla is 1.5 to 1.7 in (3.7 to 4.2 cm) long and about 0.2 in (4 to 5 mm) wide. Berries are dark orange and measure 0.3 to 0.6 in (0.7 to 1.5 cm) long. This subspecies is distinguished from ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> haleakalaensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the only other subspecies of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea copelandii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , by its narrower leaves. The species differs from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its growth habit and the size, shape, and dark red pubescence of its corolla (Lammers 1990).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

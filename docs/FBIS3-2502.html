Amelio briefed Qiao on his firm's planned presence in China,  saying that it hopes to become an enterprise which conducts  experiments with semiconductor products, research and  manufacturing.    Qiao praised the U.S. National Semiconductor Corporation's  promotion of its cooperation with China to a new high, adding  that such cooperation will enjoy a bright future.    Touching on Sino-U.S. ties, Qiao said that the relations  between the two countries are developing in general and hoped  that Sino-U.S. ties will continue on the basis of the three  communiques between the two countries.    The top Chinese legislator reaffirmed that there is no  conflict of fundamental interests between the two countries.  China does not agree with the practice of linking everything to  the most-favored-nation status, he said.    The U.S. National Semiconductor Corporation, which plays an  important role in the global semiconductor market, is one of the  giants in the U.S. electronics industry. It opened a  representative office here today.    Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing also met here with Dr.  Gilbert Amelio and his party.</p>

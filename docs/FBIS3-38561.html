One hundred soldiers will be posted to the city's main  courthouse while the others will replace local police in the  provinces of Reggio Calabria, Catanzaro and Cosenza for routine  patrol duties in what has been dubbed Operation Riace, aimed at  crime-fighting and prevention in the region.    Separately, investigators said the same M-12 nine-caliber  machine-gun was used in attacks December 2, January 18, and  February 1 against Carabinieri police car patrols in the region.  No one was injured in the first attack but both members of the  two-man patrols were killed in the second and third attacks.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Polish coal strikes may spread:  European News Digest Strikes in Poland's opencast lignite mines yesterday were set to spread to the hard coal sector even as Mr Marek Pol, the industry minister, appealed to the Solidarity-led workers to start talks with the government. Solidarity's coal mining section in Katowice said yesterday that selected stoppages would be starting that evening. Yesterday the strike in the lignite mines which directly supply fuel to a third of Poland's generating capacity had power grid officials warning that power cuts could affect individual consumers. Power supplies to heavy industry were reduced during the day. The stoppages, which stem from fears in the brown coal sector that a planned restructuring of the industry would lead to job cuts, are being backed by Solidarity which is campaigning for an end to state sector wage controls and income growth in real terms.</p>

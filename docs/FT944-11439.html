			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Smaller numbers on your telephone bill - Peter Knight looks at the large and complex variety of saving schemes Hurrah for the free market. Some of the political promises made at the time BT was privatised are finally coming true - competition in the domestic telephone market really is driving down the cost of talking. Business has already benefited but now householders can cut their phone bills quite substantially by using alternative telephone companies or subscribing to the discount schemes offered by BT. Mercury, the well-established UK telephone company owned by Cable &amp; Wireless; Energis, owned by the National Grid, and the cable television companies, offer telephone services to homes, usually with promises of cheaper long-distance calls and charging by time rather than unit. This competition, as the privatisation theorists promised, has forced BT to improve its service, reduce the cost of long-distance calls and offer a range of discount options. You can even collect air miles on your telephone account. But this does not mean that life is any easier. On the contrary, we have lost the glorious simplicity of the old GPO days when everyone was expected to rejoice at the privilege of owning a phone no matter what the quality and cost of the service. Now we have a range of savings options that, at first sight, seem complex enough to flummox Gary Kasparov. Telephony has become a commodity business and the telephone companies compete primarily on cost. Some offer better services, such as highly detailed bills, but for most of us the main reason for using another service would be because it is cheaper. Unless you subscribe to cable television that also offers telephone services, you cannot escape BT altogether because BT provides the main infrastructure on which the other carriers piggyback. This means that as soon as you use an alternative carrier you will have two bills, one from BT and another from your chosen alternative. Take the cost and hassle of subscribing to two services into account when making cost comparisons. Also remember that BT offers a range of discount options to suit all sorts of customers from the very low user to the terminally loquacious. These discounts are based on the volume of calls, so if you shift some of your calls to another carrier, then the rate of discount from BT will be smaller. More on this later. Most people have very definite telephone needs and calling habits. Here are some rule-of-thumb suggestions to reduce your bill, calculated to meet the needs of four different types of customer. Local calls only Stick with BT and investigate some of their discount schemes. The new carriers are competing mainly in the long-distance and international sectors. The only exception is if you have cable television and that company offers telephone services - then you could dispense with BT altogether, but compare charges first. If you spend less than Pounds 35 a quarter, join BT's Light User Scheme, over that amount, then look at some of the other BT schemes. Local calls and long distance calls to one person If your bill is below Pounds 100 a quarter and local calls are the biggest cost, then it is probably sensible to stay with BT and use its Family and Friends discount scheme (see below) if it is offered in your area. If the bill is mainly made up of long-distance or international calls, then look at an alternative carrier. Bills of more than Pounds 100 a quarter with lots of long-distance calls If long-distance calls are contributing most of the cost, then you can save by using an alternative carrier, such as Mercury or Energis. Depending on the age of your local BT exchange, you could also benefit from better services (such as fully itemised bills) by using a carrier other than BT. If you want to stay with BT, then look at the discount schemes that are aimed at you. But remember, if you use both BT and an alternative carrier, you will reduce the savings made on the BT discount schemes. Pounds 100-plus bill made up mostly of long-distance and overseas calls Investigate another carrier immediately, but check that the rates for the region of the world you are calling regularly is competitive with BT. If you call the US mainly, then check out the call-back schemes offered by some specialist operators who advertise in the FT. BT DISCOUNT SCHEMES Light User Scheme. Rebate offered for customers who spend less than Pounds 10 a month. Friends and Family. Provides a 5 per cent discount on five nominated telephone numbers, which can include one international number. Only open to those customers whose local exchange provides full itemised billing. One-off joining fee of Pounds 4.99. Option 15. Designed for customers with quarterly bills of over Pounds 40 and promises a 10 per cent discount. Quarterly fee of Pounds 4. Dr John Hunter of Hunter Associates, specialists in telephone call charges, says the actual savings once the charge has been included in the equation is less than 5 per cent on a bill of Pounds 50 a quarter and around 7 per cent on Pounds 100 bill. Premier Line. Designed for those with regular bills over Pounds 100 a quarter. Provides up to 15 per cent discount on direct-dialled calls and customers can accumulate 'Talking Points' which can be exchanged for gifts or air miles. Annual fee of Pounds 24. Once this fee has been included in the calculations, Hunter estimates that the scheme will give about 10 per cent savings on a bill of Pounds 100 a quarter. Savings rise with the size of the bill, but you will have to spend about Pounds 1,000 a quarter before you achieve 15 per cent. BT also offers a range of discount options to business. These might be worth investigating if you make a lot of business calls from home, but remember that you will have to re-classify your line as business to take advantage of these discounts, and that costs more. It might be worth buying a calculator before you start to work out your options. Information: BT - dial 150. Mercury: Freecall 0500 200 960 Energis: 0800 162 162.</p>

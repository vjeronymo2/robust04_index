			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Reward for LWT managers Sir, In his story 'LWT managers likely to receive Pounds 55m payout' (May 7) Raymond Snoddy quoted my description, 'an outstanding reward for an outstanding performance,' but failed to report some of the most important features of that performance. Since December 15 1982 the FT All Share Index has risen 18 per cent; the LWT share price rose 304 per cent. LWT's market capitalisation increased from Pounds 73m to Pounds 355m, and the IRR for LWT shareholders was more than 50 per cent a year. The scheme was not, as Lex describes it, a share option scheme; LWT's managers risked approximately Pounds 3m of their money, and the scheme was approved by LWT's shareholders. And finally, perhaps Bectu should ask themselves whether their members were better to have been at LWT since 1989 than at the four companies which lost their franchise.

One of popular  Ukrainian lawmakers, Mikhail Kosiv from Lvov, whose opinion is  heeded by various segments of population, calmed down Ukrainians  by saying that the Crimea would not join Russia.    Kosiv who repeatedly visited the peninsula, gave a  staggering  forecast. He said that the Crimea will belong to Tatars in  future, since every second newborn baby now is a Tatar.    In Kosiv's opinion, Turkey is also interested in Tatars'  domination of the peninsula: Over 500,000 Crimean Tatars now  live in Turkey, and they helped and continue to help their  countrymen on the peninsula.    "If we also take into account such a factor as the Ukrainian  Fleet on the Black Sea and Ukrainian bases in the Crimea, there  will be no problems for Ukraine in that area," Kosiv concluded  his forecast.    Yuriy Shukhevich, right-wing leader of the Ukrainian  National  Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defence, who is no less popular  in Ukraine's western region than Kosiv, claims that Israel is  interested in the Peninsula very much.    "Remember that Jews always dreamt of their own autonomy back  in the Soviet Union but in the Crimea rather than in  Birobidzhan," he said. "Therefore, I believe that Israel's  influence will grow there."    In Shukhevich's opinion, the destiny of the Crimea will be  decided not in Simferopol or Sevastopol but in Kiev where, as he  believes, there is no firm presidential power for the time being.</p>

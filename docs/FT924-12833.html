			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (2): A godfather retires - Robert Graham examines the role of the Italian state in industry THE ROLE of the Italian state in industry is undergoing its first real structural change since the Mussolini era. In the past three months the Amato government has initiated a seemingly irreversible movement away from the state's traditional role as owner, promoter and financial godfather to industry. The state is set to become less interventionist and companies more tightly managed according to market criteria, while a greater share of activity will be hived off to the private sector. Speed of change will depend on the stability of the government, the opposition of powerful lobbies, the attitude of the trades unions, access to funds and government ability to prepare a privatisation programme that convinces investors. At present the state accounts for 15 per cent of non-agricultural employment, 20 per cent of added value and 25 per cent of fixed investment. The political parties are almost unanimous in accepting the need to slim down this presence, albeit for differing reasons. But the scale on which this should be carried out, and the methods employed, are far from agreed. The Amato government is oscillating between two contrasting 'conceptual' positions over the new role of the state. One group within the government, backed by many managers among existing state companies, favours developing links between the public and private sectors along the lines of French and German models. They argue that the state should earmark strategic sectors which require large capital outlays and long lead-times on investment returns, and then create mixed state/private sector groups linked to mixed or even solely state financial institutions. They see this as the sole means of ensuring that Italian industry maintains (or obtains) a share of the markets in new areas of high technology, especially information technology. This approach also tackles one of the fundamental long-term weaknesses of Italian industry  - the existence of a few very large private groups such as Fiat, Pirelli, Montedison-Ferruzzi and Olivetti, and a plethora of small companies, with little between of medium-size. A second approach argues that 'internationalisation' of the Italian economy has eroded the need for the state to ear-mark 'strategic sectors.' Steel, chemicals, aluminium and ship-building, for instance, were promoted on protectionist principles of assuring domestic supply. With the lower tariffs and greater international competition, these principles went out of date. Furthermore, with pressure on costs the portfolios of IRI, the state main holding company, or ENI, the state oil concern, can scarcely be considered wholly strategic - or, indeed, logical. They have become over-loaded, with loss-making companies taken on for political and social reasons. The parlous state of public finances also means that funds for state industries can only come from the market. And even if the government were minded to provide subsidies, this runs against the increasing vigilance of Brussels, which penalises unfair competition. For instance, Finmeccanica, the engineering subsidiary of IRI, had to pay back - on Brussels' orders - the subsidy received to cover the losses of Alfa Romeo prior to its sale to Fiat in 1986. Italian state aid to industry during the 1980s was running twice as high as that of France, nearly three times that of Germany. Thus, instead of turning to the state for financial assistance, the second school of thought argues that the government's role confine itself to fiscal incentives and generating the right kind of climate to encourage foreign and domestic private investment to stimulate new industries. This would also entail new stimuli for the creation of medium-sized companies, in particular providing tax incentives for smaller companies to merge without being penalised by added value tax on revalued assets. A powerful reason for the prevalence of the small family company is precisely the lack of incentive to be more visible to the taxman. Without new medium-sized players, privatisation of industry merely risks exchanging state ownership for control by the big names in the private sector - perhaps creating new de facto monopolies in the process. Professor Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, is opposed to such an outcome. But equally, no member of the government has come forward with concrete ideas about how a slimmed-down state sector might tackle the problems of providing Italian industry with the right mix of technology and economies of scale to compete internationally. Emotionally the government favours the idea of a slimmed-down but strong state presence acting in concert with private capital, especially in sectors of advanced technology, which require long lead times on investment returns and entail risk. A group like ENI, which in 30 years has become one of the most important forces in the international oil business, grew up as a clear projection of the Italian's state need to assure foreign energy supplies without being dependent upon the old cartel operated by the 'Seven Sisters'  -the seven biggest multi-national oil companies. One important factor influencing the outcome will be the future status of the state-controlled banks and financial institutions which still account for two thirds of activity in the banking system. For instance, should the Treasury's BNL or IRI's Comit be restructured in a formal financial/banking alliance with Finmeccanica, which has become the state's arm in several advanced technology sectors? ( Finmeccanica has 45 per cent of SGS Thomson,one of the cornerstones of French plans for 'poles' of advanced technology and industrial production.) The government now seems willing to accept the concept of surrendering 51 per cent control of most - if not all - companies. But this still begs the question of the future shape of state-owned stakes. Can the state retain control through a British style system of a golden share, or should there be a clear minority stake ? Privatisation and the consequent reduction in the state presence is seen by the international community as an essential means of gaining credibility. Thus on July 11, in one of its first acts, the Amato government decided to convert into joint stock companies IRI, ENI (the state oil concern), ENEL (the electricity authority), and INA (the insurance institute). The original idea was to group them into one or two 'super-holdings' along with the Treasury's own banks and financial institutions. The super-holdings were to have 'clean assets' of L60,000bn, against which bonds were to be issued as a preliminary to subsequent privatisation. But this plan was dropped. It was too complex. It created an additional administrative structure which raised legal problems with foreign creditors over some L80,000bn worth of debts in these entities. Instead, these four entities became joint stock companies on August 7, with slimmed down three-man boards and the Treasury as sole shareholder, as a preliminary to restructuring their holdings. The main immediate effect has been to remove a string of political appointees from their boards, although the presidents have been retained for the time being. The board shake-up, inplying technical management, is a big break-through. The government's resolve has also been evident in the decision to place into voluntary liquidation Efim, the loss-making state industrial holding. Over the years Efim had accumulated an unplanned mixture of assets, from aluminium and automotive glass making to aerospace and mass transit systems, but was weighed down by debts of over L8,500bn. The move underlined the fact that the government was no longer prepared to keep alive loss-making groups. The real test for the message from Efim will come in the next two months.</p>

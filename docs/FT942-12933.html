			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Map of Spanish banking redrawn after auction As an event, the auction of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), for many years the biggest name in Spanish banking, came close to matching the country's famous Christmas lottery, known as El Gordo or 'the Fat One'. The result, announced after prolonged suspense on Monday night and broadcast live on television and radio, was as unpredictable as the lottery. And there could be no doubt that the prize awarded to Banco Santander, at a price of just over Dollars 2bn for a 60 per cent stake, was indeed the Fat One - the largest takeover and restructuring in Spanish history. Restoring Banesto's balance sheet has required a total of some Dollars 3.7bn in recapitalisation and support. With its sale of recently-created new shares to Santander, Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund reaps a profit of Pta133bn (Dollars 971m), reducing by 40 per cent the amount the private banking system and the Bank of Spain stood to lose in the operation. The price paid by Santander - Dollars 255m more than the next-highest bid from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) - caused some stupefaction in Madrid's financial community. But Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said it was 'a unique opportunity'. It marked, he said yesterday, 'a definitive redrawing of the banking map of Spain'. The shape of Spanish banking has changed radically since the country joined the EU eight years ago. What it had once thought of as big banks  - such as Banesto - were dwarfed by the European competition. The process began in 1987 when Banco de Bilbao tried to take over Banesto. The following four years saw one more attempted merger and two successful mergers among the leading banks, and the fusion of state banking interests into the new Argentaria. What used to be eight top banks - the private-sector Big Seven and the state's Banco Exterior - have now become four large and one smaller group, Banco Popular. The new Santander-Banesto group, with about 11 per cent of total deposits in Spanish commercial banks, will, according to Mr Botn, have a retail banking network 'in line' with BBV and Banco Central Hispano. BBV, with clear ambitions of leadership in Spanish banking, has now failed twice to obtain Banesto. But it was never obvious how it would absorb such a large network as Banesto's in addition to its own. Argentaria, on the other hand, wanted Banesto's branches as much as Santander, especially in small towns and rural areas. But the semi-state bank entered the most timid bid - 25 per cent below Santander's. Its dilemma was that the only way of making a takeover of Banesto politically acceptable was to link it to further privatisation. And the higher the price it paid for Banesto, the harder it would be to ensure a successful share flotation. With fewer outlets than the other three big groups, Argentaria will now be on the lookout for an alternative acquisition. The final touches have yet to be put to the new map.</p>

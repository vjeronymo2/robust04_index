			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PHONE SERVICES ALLOW YOU TO DIAL-A-LIFE  </P> <P> Need a new mattress, but don't feel like getting out of bed? Slumber comfort is  just a phone call away -- as are dream dates, decorators, teachers and  T-shirts, all via the city's assorted Dial-A lines.  </P> <P> Dial-A-Floor. Dial-A-Chef. Dial-A-Hearing Test. In New York, where time is  always tight, you can get everything from soup to nuts -- and a redecorated  kitchen to eat them in -- with nothing more than a touch-tone phone.  </P> <P> "You can call us from your office, from your home, from your car -- doesn't  matter. And within two hours, we can deliver you a mattress," said Joe Vicens,  vice president of sales and marketing at Dial-A-Mattress.  </P> <P> "We get close to 1,000 calls a day," he said. "On a top day, we get 1,500  calls."  </P> <P> It wasn't always so. For seven years, Vicens answered the phones alone. But  times have changed; there are more two-job families, less time to shop. And  it's so easy to punch in 1-800-MATTRES (nobody said spelling was a requirement  for sales).  </P> <P> Dial-A-Mattress was born 12 years ago when a small furniture company owner,  Napoleon Barrigan, spotted a "dial-a-steak promotion in one of the papers,"  Vicens recalled. "This gave him the idea for Dial-A-Mattress. Surprisingly, a  lot of people started calling."  </P> <P> The steak idea is still hot. Dial-A-Chef will dispatch a genuine, trained cook  to your residence to prepare the repast of your choice.  </P> <P> "We are not a catering service. If you're planning a dinner party, you call us  up. We send over a chef who prepares an entire meal right in your home," said  manager Charles Dean, whose company opened last year.  </P> <P> He has about two dozen chefs, who handle everything from vegetarian delights to  fine French cuisine. The chefs get $20 to $50 an hour; they work a minimum of  four hours, and raw materials cost extra, Dean said.  </P> <P> Since man does not live by bed alone -- or by pheasant under glass -- there are  Dial-A-Prayer and Dial-An-Atheist.  </P> <P> "I give thanks, O God, that because I believe in thee, I can be positive about  life. . . . Remove the fears from my heart, I pray, for fears draw negative  feelings. Prune my thoughts of defeat," intoned a recent Dial-A-Prayer.  </P> <P> Thus inspired, it's on to the secular, like Dial-A-Hearing Test. There was no  answer there, leading a caller to believe it apparently works this way: If you  can hear the phone ringing, your ears are OK.  </P> <P> Obviously in demand: secretaries. There are three Dial-A-Secretary numbers for  people seeking temporary office assistance, a figure outdone only by Penthouse  magazine's risque Dial-A-Forum Letter and its five exchanges.  </P> <P> Overall, Manhattan offers 40 Dial-A services -- uh, make that 39. Out of  business: Dial-A-Dentist. "I'm sure you've got the wrong number. This is a shoe  store," advised the worker answering the phone at the line once used for dental  aid.  </P> <P> The services are not only for adults. Students stumped by homework can  Dial-A-Teacher from Monday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Instructors take  phone calls and provide instant assistance in both English and Spanish.  </P> <P> People looking to get dressed but not dressed up can ring Dial-A-T-Shirt, where  custom print jobs are a specialty. These guys will put anything you want on a  hat, T-shirt or sweat shirt, said manager Dean Artenberg.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, people still must come down to the store to pick up their  orders, although Artenberg said he can understand why they would rather do  their business by phone only.  </P> <P> "It's getting to where you go out on the street around here, you might not ever  be coming back," he observed.  </P></p>

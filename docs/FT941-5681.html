			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Czechs retaliate against Slovakia The Czech government yesterday retaliated against Slovakia's imposition of a 10 per cent import tax by unilaterally devaluing the special currency used for Czech-Slovak trade, Reuter reports. The Czech government devalued the Czech crown used within the special clearing currency by 3 per cent. Slovakia yesterday introduced a 10 per cent tax on imports of many consumer goods to curb its mounting trade deficit, which totalled 26.7bn crowns in 1993. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister (left), said the Slovak tax was a 'semi-devaluation' of the Slovak crown.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have retroactive effect unless so specified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are as follows: (1) for Program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 278.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation and Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendment to section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 2014(e)) which is reflected in this rule was enacted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 as section 1717 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relief Act (1990 Leland Act), Title XVII, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624 (104  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stat. 3783, Nov. 28, 1990). This amendment was effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 1, 1992. The provisions of this rule are required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented not later than October 1, 1994, in order to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all State agencies are in full compliance with the amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as soon as possible. For this reason, Ellen Haas, Assistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has determined pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 5 U.S.C. 553 that public comment on this rule prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation is impracticable and that good cause exists for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making this rule effective less than 30 days after its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication. However, because we believe the administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule may be improved by public comment, comments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited on this rule for 60 days after publication. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received within the comment period will be analyzed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any appropriate changes will be incorporated in the subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 351 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988) (HPA) amended Section 5(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require State agencies to offer eligible households with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly or disabled member a method for claiming a deduction for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recurring medical expenses in place of provisions that had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required households to report and verify expenses monthly. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 7, 1989, the Department published an interim rulemaking at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 54 FR 24518, which implemented Section 351 of Pub. L. 100&hyph;435.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rules are still in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

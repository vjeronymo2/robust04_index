			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KHABAR-SERVIS report: "Republic Does Not Have Foreign </F> Currency Market as Such"]    [Text] The state of the foreign currency market in  Azerbaijan and the exchange's effect on it were discussed in the  course of the recent visit by an IMF mission to Azerbaijan, at a  meeting between IMF representatives, headed by William  Alexander, and top officials of the Baku Interbank Foreign  Currency Exchange (BMVB). "I did not get, however, any advice or  recommendations from W. Alexander regarding our work," said BMVB  head manager Farkhad Amirbekov. "This is understandable: The  foreign currency exchange practically does not function, which  means there are no problems worth discussing. Neither is there a  foreign currency market as such in Azerbaijan today."    Many questions in this area are awaiting resolution. F.  Amirbekov noted that the two main components of the financial  market in Azerbaijan--the interbank foreign currency market and  the credit market closely associated with it, currently  practically do not function. There is no free redistribution of  noncash foreign currency, no normative acts of the National Bank  regulating the foreign currency market, while the Law "On  Foreign Currency Regulation," which the parliament has adopted,  is still not operating. No system has been set up for hard  currency earnings of enterprises to be redistributed between  banks through unrestricted sale on the foreign currency market.  Still unresolved are taxation issues for domestic and foreign  enterprises on the territory of the republic that have foreign  currency earnings. The Law "On Profit From Physical Persons"  needs to be amended since in its current form it actually  stimulates the growth of inflation.    The work of the BMVB is also made more difficult by the fact  that beginning in May this year a certain percentage of  enterprises' hard currency earnings is to be sold to the state  at the National Bank exchange rate and become part of the Common  Foreign Currency Fund, while the remaining share is left with  the enterprises. Thus, the National Bank does not have its own  resources and revenue, and cannot act freely with respect to the  exchangeable part of the Stabilization Fund's resources. In our  opinion, it is necessary to transfer the Stabilization Fund to  the sole jurisdiction of the National Bank and resolve the  question of distribution of foreign currency. In this case the  Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange will begin to function, too.  It would also make sense to mandate selling a part of  enterprises' foreign currency earnings through the foreign  currency exchange, as is done in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Moldova.</p>

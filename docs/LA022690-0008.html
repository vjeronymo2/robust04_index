			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOB LOSSES  </P> <P> Robert Jones' column "Fouling the Air With Numbers" (Part A, Feb. 8) was salty  and impressive.  </P> <P> However, I apparently did not explain clearly the methodology used.  </P> <P> The 50% number Jones quoted so freely referred to the maximum loss of jobs in  industry sub-segments that will have powerful economic incentives to depart. It  overstates my research findings for some sectors.  </P> <P> The main point is this: Hundreds of thousands will lose their jobs and then  wait (pump gas or go on relief) until someone invents the new technology  needed. The pain of a two- or three-year period of joblessness can be  excruciating -- and for the less skilled people may become permanent. New jobs  in 1994 for new college grads cannot cover the pain of the blue-collar workers  laid off in 1990.  </P> <P> To elaborate, Jones omitted my comments about Southern California growth  prospects being great enough to create jobs for many newcomers -- particularly  highly skilled technicians and scientists -- but not for the woodworkers,  plasterers, furniture finishers and the like who would be losing their jobs  along with the market for their skills.  </P> <P> There are a lot more humane considerations in the numbers than we have seen in  print yet.  </P> <P> JOSEPH E. HARING, Ph.D.  </P> <P> Director  </P> <P> Pasadena Research Institute  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Gardening: Shady plants come into the open - Robin Lane Fox concludes that the sun is less of an enemy than many growers have feared PERHAPS it is this wonderfully cool summer, but I am learning to question one of the great divides in gardening. We all ask: does a plant need sun or shade? Catalogues mark the great divide with little symbols; dictionaries are keen to tell you the answers. As a result, I have been scared of whole groups of plants because they are supposed to prefer a shady existence. As a non-shady character, I cannot give them that. I now find out that we are freer than we have believed, behind barriers of our own making. Some of these barriers may have formed round my misunderstandings. I am sure I was once taught that auriculas needed shading when, in fact, these wonderfully ringed and marked forms of primula are very much happier in full sun. Perhaps I muddled the instructions. But I did not muddle them for the yellow-flowered forms of clematis which are coming into their best. Popular wisdom tells us to plant them in semi-shade, preferably facing east: I still have it on their labels. I also have the plants. One of them, a plain Orientalis, is doing its semi-shaded best, striving for more sunlight, invading the eaves and showing, on the last count, three flowers facing boldly to the east. My other plant is the vastly better Bill Mackenzie form, which was noticed several years ago by Valerie Finnis in the gardens of that great Surrey plantsman. Facing due south, Bill Mackenzie also has scaled the drain pipes: in full sun, he is smothered in flowers every year and shows not the slightest sign of scorch. Other re-thinks are more dramatic. In the next few weeks, one of the charms of gardens in the west of England and Ireland are the dieramas and their curving wands of deep pink or white flowers. Their popular name is Venus Fishing Rod, and they arch over on to the soil like offshoots from some heavenly cast. The flowers are like small gladioli, borne profusely on long stems above leaves like rushes at the edge of a pond. Admittedly, the leaves turn brown and linger on among the greenery; but the plants are enchanting, fit for a goddess who would angle, no doubt, in the nude. Everyone says a Venus Fishing Rod likes damp soil, and most people suggest semi-shade because of the imagery of water and so forth. Wistfully, I have avoided them in my dry, stony garden - but I have just seen a magnificent clump standing in full sunlight on just as stony a soil in the middle of Broadway, in the Cotswolds. Its owner confirms that there is nothing wet or shaded about the position. Without any umbrella, Venus is fishing happily and flowering madly in her beautiful white form. Why, after all, do plants need shade? In Britain, very few need it to protect leaves from too-fierce sun. What they actually want is water, and I find that occasional cans of it will bring down all manner of barriers. If you feed your garden properly in summer you will, in any case, be watering these plants with Phostrogen from the hose or can, applied to the roots and leaves. On dry days, feed them in the evening; and by wetting them at that time, you will fortify them for exposure to all but the fiercest sunlight the following day. Beside paving stones, the old dogma about shade is often mistaken, too, and for similar reasons. Leaves can remain in sun if roots can run coolly under a stone parasol. I find that sun on these terms is entirely acceptable to many epimediums or to schizostylis, with their lovely pink and white flowers. Even their expert growers told me that this experiment was stupid. Nonetheless, they have flowered and spread for three years in my garden without any light shade to protect them. They want cool roots rather than sheltered leaves. In most areas, shade is a mixed blessing, anyway. To the purists, it means leaf mould, the damply-scented floor of a tall wood, or lightly-filtered light along the banks of a passing stream. Collectors in the wild are likely to put the indiscriminate label of shade-lover on plants which they find in these natural conditions. Most of us cannot match them. For us, shade means scrappy soil beneath a neighbour's sycamore or the backside of an unfavoured urban plot. Why should anything prefer these conditions to decent soil, within range of a hosepipe, in fresh, open sunlight? On either side of any divide, there are always firm exceptions. My point is that the frontier itself is arbitrary. Many good plants will flourish better in the open with water than in the half-light among another tree's roots. In both our kingdoms, human and vegetable, the most frequent reason for 'preferring a shady place' is identical: drink.</p>

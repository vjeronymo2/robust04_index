			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Pessimistic mood likely to depress prices - New York With pessimism running so high on Wall Street, stocks are likely to stumble again this week, whether or not the Federal Reserve decides to lift short-term interest rates. 'Even though the economy, inflation and corporate earnings remain favourable, the money at the margin is in a nasty mood,' says Mr Byron Wien, Morgan Stanley's portfolio strategist, in a recent investment advisory. But bearishness has reached such a crescendo that Mr Wien and other market observers are taking the contrarian view that the market is poised for a sustained rally. 'The balance of power, we hope, will shift back to long-term investors over the summer.' In the meantime, investors will have to be quick on their feet when they return from the long Independence Day weekend tomorrow morning. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin a two-day policy-making session in Washington. It is anyone's guess whether the year's fifth move to tighter money is imminent. For Wall Street, it appears to be a lose-lose situation. If the Fed stands pat despite the dollar's steady erosion, share prices are likely to slide in sympathy with the plight of the greenback. With the US currency hitting a series of record lows against the yen last week, the bellwether Dow Industrial index could only manage a net gain of 10 points last week. To a lesser degree, the subdued trading was a reaction to the perception of mounting inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector. A lack of response to these signals by the Fed could drive long-term bond yields even higher, especially with June employment data, the month's most important economic release, due on Friday. Share prices, in turn, would probably swoon. On the other hand, if the Fed opts for higher rates, more investors are likely to pull out of equities in favour of cash, fearing an autumn of cooling economic activity and withering corporate earnings. Mr James Solloway, senior vice-president at Argus Research in New York, is one of a minority of Wall Street analysts who believe the Fed will hold off on higher rates. He says the central bank is reluctant to link monetary policy with currency fluctuations, and dismisses the perception that a surge in inflation is on the horizon, despite the recent upturn in commodity prices. However, he admits to uncertainty on how the market will react to whatever tack emerges from the FOMC session. 'Right now, this market is driven by emotions, not by the fundamentals,' says the Argus analyst.</p>

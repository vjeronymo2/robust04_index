			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Redland Strong growth in the UK, France and Germany prompted the City to raise its profit estimates for Redland yesterday. But the shares still fell 5 per cent on the group's disclosure that its tax rate is set to rise towards 35 per cent next year, after 30.5 per cent in 1993. The full upturn in pre-tax profits will thus not feed through to earnings. There are good explanations why Redland's tax charge should be rising sharply when that of RMC, which also derives the largest share of its profits from Germany, is not. One is that Redland's investment programme in the east of Germany is coming to an end, and capital allowances are petering out as a result. But the surprise nevertheless rekindles scepticism about Redland's dividends policy. The tax bill would not be so high now if the group had not maintained a barely covered dividend throughout the trough of the UK recession. Coupled with the near doubling of shares in issue over the past three years, this policy has increased the burden of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. Ironically, this makes it impossible for Redland to raise its dividend now, when the underlying operating performance might justify it. While a yield of over 6 per cent offers some support, the contrast with RMC is stark. This more conservatively managed company increased its interim dividend by 6.1 per cent last week. Redland will not easily correct its under-performance of more than a fifth against RMC in the past year.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Waging a war for US business - Guy de Jonquieres interviews Clinton's export policy 'general' As befits the son of a career soldier who grew up with General Douglas MacArthur's farewell address on the wall of his family home, Mr Jeffrey Garten has a penchant for military metaphors. When he talks about his job, his conversation is dotted with phrases like 'no first-strike policy', 'strategy' and 'war room'. Mr Garten is not a Pentagon brass-hat, but the Clinton administration's under secretary of commerce for international trade. However, the martial imagery clearly fits with his convictions about the need for radical change in US national priorities since the cold war ended. In his writings and speeches - which he turns out prolifically and at great length - he has pounded away at the theme that the overriding concern of policy today is no longer defending national security but a remorseless global battle for economic advantage. As commander of the federal government's newly-refurbished export promotion drive, he is in the frontline of that offensive. And he has powerful backing from President Bill Clinton. Not only has Mr Clinton thrown much bigger resources at export promotion, but he has proudly claimed credit for pitching in to win a Dollars 6bn civil aircraft order from Saudi Arabia in February. 'I would be very surprised if we did not have many more successes,' says Mr Garten, a 47-year-old former investment banker who is widely acknowledged to be one of the intellectual leading lights of the Clinton administration. 'In the past, export policy has been seen as a stepchild of the commerce department. Nobody's thinking that any more. It's now embedded in our perception that exports are what is going to make the US economy spin.' But while the administration basks in the early results of its foreign sales drive, they are provoking outrage abroad. The French government - itself no mean export promoter - is still fuming at the Saudi deal. Disappointed foreign bidders for a Dollars 4bn Saudi telecommunications contract, won by American Telephone and Telegraph last month, allege it was rigged politically in favour of the US company. Mr Garten is unrepentant. He insists Washington is simply a late entrant in a game long played by other governments, notably in Europe and Japan. If they resent the US muscling in, they should not have started the ball rolling. What is more, he says, the US aims to play very hard indeed. With the blessing of the White House, export promotion has blossomed into an administration-wide effort, co-ordinated at regular cabinet-level meetings involving officials from the state department and other federal agencies. It all comes down to growth and jobs. Pulling out a set of flip charts, Mr Garten reels off figures showing how much exports have contributed to recent increases in US gross national product and well-paid employment. 'We do not have the great luxury of saying this job is good and that job is bad. The first thing we want is high levels of employment.' But how does the policy fit with the globalisation of business, as companies increasingly source components and manufacture products worldwide? How can Washington be sure that support for American companies will end up benefiting workers in the US rather, than say, in Singapore? Mr Garten insists his department vets every application for export assistance to determine its contribution to the domestic economy. But he admits that choosing between the relative merits of US-owned companies and local subsidiaries of foreign groups can be tricky. So far, he says, the problem has arisen less in export promotion than in deciding whether foreign-owned subsidiaries should be eligible to participate in the administration's sharply increased funding for research and development in high-technology industries. 'This thing comes up all the time. We don't have the most consistent policy right now. They're very difficult issues . . . and we know they're important,' he says. Finding a solution is a high priority, he says, likely to require international negotiations. Washington's assertive championing of national business interests also sits rather oddly with other aspects of its trade policy. Does it not, for instance, risk devaluing indignant US assertions that Japan's domestic market is rigged by politicians and bureaucrats in favour of national producers? 'We certainly can't mortgage our entire international economic strategy to perceptions of what we would like the Japanese to do,' he says. And asked how he would field objections from, say, Sweden, that the US may distort competition and discriminate against companies from smaller countries whose governments pack less international punch, he replies: 'I would say that you engage in subsidised financing . . . the Swedes are doing it. I haven't measured it, but if any government came in and said it was totally pure - first of all, if it's from Europe or Canada  - I would be sceptical. You certainly couldn't expect US policy to be geared to the one or two countries that possibly could be pure.' If other governments really feel strongly about US tactics, he says, they should agree to sit down and negotiate more effective ways of eliminating export subsidies. Until that happens, the administration remains determined to lobby hard for US companies and match the competition, subsidy for subsidy, in bidding for contracts it really wants. Mr Garten concedes that, in practice, budgetary constraints will compel the administration to be selective about the projects it backs. Already, he says, it is under pressure to improve the efficiency of its export promotion effort before requesting more funds from Congress. Furthermore, for all his enthusiasm about the mechanics of the effort and the new resources at his disposal, he admits to more than a shade of doubt about the value of the purpose they serve. 'Without question, no good is going to come out of this. It would be vastly preferable to have a system where companies are competing on their quality and reputation, not on the subsidised financing they get. We would prefer not to play this game at all.'</p>

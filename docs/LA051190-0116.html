			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'CHEERS' ACTOR IS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL ON DRUG CHARGE  </P> <P> Two judges took action Thursday against actor Kelsey Grammer, a star of the  "Cheers" TV series, in separate cases involving failure to enroll in alcohol  and drug abuse programs.  </P> <P> Grammer surrendered to a Van Nuys Municipal Court judge, who had issued an  arrest warrant for him last week, and was ordered to stand trial on a cocaine  possession charge.  </P> <P> A short time later, another judge in the same courthouse scheduled a probation  violation hearing into Grammer's failure to enroll in a court-ordered alcohol  abuse program stemming from a 1987 drunk-driving arrest.  </P> <P> Grammer, who plays the comically egotistical psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane,  on the popular NBC television series, was surrounded by reporters and  photographers as he entered the courthouse to surrender to Judge Aviva K. Bobb.  The judge last week issued an arrest warrant because Grammer failed to appear  in court to prove he had completed a drug rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> Grammer's attorney, Robert L. Diamond, requested that Grammer be given another  chance to take part in the program, which allows first-time drug offenders to  avoid jail and expunge the arrest from their records.  </P> <P> Diamond said Grammer failed to attend the course because his fiancee suffers  from a seizure disorder requiring constant medical supervision.  </P> <P> "We all have other responsibilities," Bobb responded, and ordered Grammer  arrested. She scheduled a preliminary hearing on the cocaine charge for May 21  and set bail of $7,500. He faces a maximum three-year jail sentence.  </P> <P> Grammer, 35, of Van Nuys, said that he thought he "was supposed to show up on  the 8th. It was just an oversight.  </P> <P> "I've been going through a time with my girlfriend who's been very ill. It has  interfered with my complying with the court," said Grammer. The actor said his  girlfriend underwent brain surgery two weeks ago, and the couple went on a  cruise to Mexico while she recovered. "I'm ready to go now," he added.  </P> <P> After the hearing in Bobb's court, Grammer was taken before Judge Patricia  Gorner Schwartz in a courtroom six floors below. Schwartz issued an arrest  warrant for Grammer on Feb. 6 after he failed to complete 10 days of community  service and an alcohol rehabilitation program imposed after he pleaded no  contest to drunk driving.  </P> <P> Grammer was sentenced to community service for previously failing to show up in  court to prove that he was enrolled in the alcohol program, court records show.  </P> <P> Diamond said he would guarantee Grammer's participation in the program this  time, but the judge scheduled a probation violation hearing for May 16 and set  bail of $10,000.  </P> <P> Grammer posted bail on both charges Thursday afternoon and went free.  </P> <P> Grammer was arrested for possession of a quarter-gram of cocaine after being  pulled over by police in North Hollywood in April, 1988, for expired license  plate tags. The actor showed up two days late in October for a hearing.  </P></p>

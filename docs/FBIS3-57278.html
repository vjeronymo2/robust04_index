			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Givi Lominadze, state minister and chairman </F> of the Temporary Committee for the State of Emergency in Western  Georgia, by Armaz Saneblidze in Senaki; date not given:  "Turning Back"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Saneblidze] A person  arriving in Samegrelo [Mingrelia, former stronghold of Zviad  Gamsakhurdia] can see that the mood has obviously changed. The  local situation is gradually improving. Batono Givi, is this  really the case?    [Lominadze] That is correct. As someone who is involved in  affairs here 24 hours a day and for whom such a change should  apparently be less noticeable, I can indeed see that it has  changed. Compared with the first few weeks, there is a big  difference. The situation has clearly improved. [passage  omitted]    However, believe me when I say in all seriousness that we  are  a long way from achieving stability. I cannot say that  everything has already been put right in western Georgia. More  or less, only more or less.    If, for example, we are not facing the problem of violent  interference on the part of the opposing side and an  exacerbation of the situation in both the Guria and Imereti  zones and in Samtredia, Vani, and Khoni where this question is  no longer on the agenda, we can expect complications at any  moment in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, Chkhorotsqu, and Senaki.    This we know from information and analytical materials in  our  possession and from having our finger on the pulse of the  sociopolitical life in this region. I do not exclude that one  fine day, a certain armed force will burst into Zugdidi or  Senaki or Khobi or Tsalenjikha or Chkhorotsqu and declare that  they have restored the jurisdiction of the legal authorities, as  they call them.    As I have said, there is no danger of this occurring in the  rayons of Guria and Imereti. However, they are faced with all  those economic and social problems that exist throughout  Georgia; these are being felt more painfully as the local  population has experienced the fear of weapons and insults on  the part of the supporters of the ex-president.    Compared with other areas of Samegrelo, the situation is  different in Poti. There, economic and social problems have to  be resolved, although I would say that the criminal situation is  stable -- at least, it is under control.    There is a difference regarding economic and political  problems themselves: For example, there is one set of such  problems in Senaki and Poti and another in Tsalenjikha and  Chkhorotsqu. Sometimes the difference is sharp.    Finally, I would say that the difference between what we  encountered there first and the situation today is like that  between day and night.    Naturally, it would have been desirable to have gotten the  factories and establishments working more quickly, but this  would have been the best that we could have expected.    What did we first encounter? The railway was destroyed;  there were no buses; naturally, there was no gas or electricity;  the medical establishments were ransacked; there was no bread or  water. There was nothing. There were more than 200 destroyed  houses in Senaki alone; the people were frightened. The  situation was the same in Abasha and Khobi and the towns and  villages were so empty that it seemed that no one was left alive.    What are things like today? All the tea-processing plants  are functioning as best they can given the reduced electric  power supplies. We arrived just in time as the sanitary  conditions were so bad that all kinds of infections could have  broken out at any moment. Our most pressing problem during the  first 10 days was cleaning up the towns.    Stability will only come when justice reigns, law and order  is established, and the factories and establishments are working.    The realization of these factors will save the whole of  Georgia and western Georgia, in particular.    We probably need to conduct the merciless struggle against  bandit formations for one to one and a half years. Do not think  that all those people who have gone into the woods will give  themselves up, lay down their weapons, stand at the side of the  road or go back to the tea plantations or do what they were  doing before.    They will not do this; they have gotten used to doing no  work. Armed with machine guns, they can appear on the highway  and obtain in five minutes what they would have earned in 10  years. Try convincing those people now to lay down their  weapons, as this will be good for them and necessary for Georgia  and to go back to picking tea leaves. A difficult thing, don't  you think?    [Saneblidze]Of course.    [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it  has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and  actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that,  having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do  but sit idly by and wait for the results.    This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes,  we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did  not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of  this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as  well.    There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or  Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people  have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they  do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or  will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality  for their own purposes? No one.    Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the  situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single  moment. [passage omitted]</p>

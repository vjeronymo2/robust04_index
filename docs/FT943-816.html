			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reckitt rights not welcome The timing, if not the substance, of the move by Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household goods and pharmaceutical products group, to acquire L &amp; F Household from Eastman Kodak, took the market by surprise and triggered a steep decline in Reckitt shares. Reckitt stock was the FT-SE 100's worst performer, closing 43 off at the session's low of 555p, as the market reacted violently to the deeply discounted Pounds 230m cash call which accompanied the L &amp; F Household purchase. Talk that Reckitt was about to buy L &amp; F Household has been in the market for around two months. In August, and before the latest steep slide in share prices, the market was full of stories that Reckitt was prepared to pay upwards of Dollars 1.7bn for L &amp; F. One leading analyst described the proposed purchase of L &amp; F as a 'good strategic move' but said the market had not taken kindly to the rights issue. He professed concern, however, at Reckitt's claim that the purchase will have insignificant impact on its earning's for 1995. 'Insignificant impact is taken as market code for earnings dilution,' he said.</p>

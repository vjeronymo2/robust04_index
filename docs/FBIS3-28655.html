An officer of the  6th Infantry Division based in the town of Dinaig said the  hostilities began 27 January when a combined force of about 600  Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters attacked three security  checkpoints of the Consunji logging company. The logging company  has been operating in the area for many years.    Two security guards died during the attack on the  checkpoints  located a few kilometers from MILF's Camp Abubakar Sedik. Al Haj  Murad, MILF vice chairman for operations and concurrent  chief-of-staff of the Bangsamoro Islamic Army, denied the  military's allegations. Murad said the fighting started when  combined forces of the logging company's security guards and the  military encroached on and penetrated the defense perimeter area  of their camp.    Murad said there has been a standing formal agreement  between  the MILF and the government for a cease-fire. The agreement,  respected until the incident of 27 January, was entered into in  1984.    The clashes also constitute a gross violation of the ongoing  government-MNLF cease-fire agreement, Murad said. The MILF, he  added, had always supported the peace negotiations between the  government and the MNLF and the cease-fire agreement forged  earlier this month. The MILF, he said, has not been formally  included in the ongoing peace talks but had pledged support to  it. He hoped the clashes will not escalate into major  hostilities.    He called on all concerned to find ways to stop this even as  he ordered MILF fighters and supporters in Mindanao to be on a  more "active" defense posture.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST U.S. ENVOYS LEAVE KUWAIT POST;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: AMBASSADOR HOWELL LEADS THE FINAL PLANELOAD OF U.S. CITIZENS TO  SAFETY IN WEST. 'WE DID NOT CLOSE THE EMBASSY,' HE ASSERTS. 'THE FLAG FLIES.'  </P> <P> The hostage saga for Americans in Iraq and Kuwait ended Thursday with the  departure of W. Nathaniel Howell III, the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait who held  out in his besieged embassy for nearly four months.  </P> <P> "The flag flies" there still, Howell said when he arrived in Germany as part of  the last planeload of Americans to come out of Iraq. The embassy compound,  which he abandoned after 110 days of steadily dwindling food supplies and  shortages of electricity and hot water, will remain technically open although  unstaffed.  </P> <P> Smiling and chewing gum, the ambassador told reporters at the Frankfurt airport  that the 31 Americans on board the Iraqi Airways jetliner with him represented  "all the Americans who wanted to leave Kuwait."  </P> <P> "We're very happy to be here," Howell said. "We're very delighted that all  Americans who wanted to leave Kuwait did.  </P> <P> "This morning, I closed the embassy," he began, then corrected himself: "We did  not close the embassy, but vacated it. The flag flies."  </P> <P> Howell declined to describe conditions in Kuwait. When asked how the embassy  refugees managed to survive, the diplomat grinned broadly and said, "That's a  secret."  </P> <P> In the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein  declared the neighboring sheikdom his country's 19th province, and he ordered  all foreign embassies there to close by Aug. 24. Most complied, eventually  leaving only the British and Americans as holdouts. The British ambassador and  his staff came out with the American diplomats Thursday.  </P> <P> For the first three months of the crisis, the Americans in the embassy,  determined to defy Iraq's orders to vacate, were denied supplies and lived on  embassy food stocks -- eventually little but canned tuna -- and boiled water  from their swimming pool. Early this month, the Iraqi occupation forces began  allowing them small amounts of new provisions.  </P> <P> Howell was accompanied by his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, his  three other embassy aides and a number of Americans who had taken refuge inside  the compound. Wearing a scraggly white beard and a bright green jacket, Howell  appeared healthy. A U.S. Consulate spokesman, Craig Springer, said none of the  returning Americans required medical attention.  </P> <P> Before the takeoff from Baghdad, a U.S. Embassy spokesman there also had a  succinct comment on Howell's condition: "He's a tough old dog."  </P> <P> The Americans were part of a total of 94 passengers aboard the U.S.-chartered  Boeing 707 that first flew from Baghdad to Kuwait city Thursday to pick up  foreigners, returned to the Iraqi capital for more passengers, then departed  for Germany. Also aboard were 25 Britons, 16 Canadians, nine Japanese and a  scattering of other nationalities, according to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt said the Americans, including  the five diplomats, would stay here overnight and fly to the United States  today.  </P> <P> U.S. officials in Baghdad say that no more charter flights of Americans are  planned. About 500 U.S. citizens remain, mostly in Kuwait, and are not expected  to request departure. Most of those left are spouses and children in Arab  families and consider either Iraq or Kuwait their home.  </P> <P> Although greeted by U.S. Ambassador to Germany Vernon A. Walters, Howell either  eschewed or was not offered what might seem to be routine diplomatic  courtesies. He waited in baggage claim along with the other passengers, then  was escorted through the sprawling airport with shouting reporters trailing him  up two flights of stairs to a drab chain hotel adjacent to the airport, where  he was to spend the night.  </P> <P> Howell stopped long enough to accept a "Free Kuwait" button from a Kuwaiti  woman whose family of eight came to the airport clad in black sweat shirts to  "thank the Americans" for supporting their homeland.  </P> <P> The ambassador appeared to emerge as a hero to those who had shared the  experience with him.  </P> <P> "He's a hero, like John Wayne," Jack Rinehart of Stover, Mo., one of those  trapped in the embassy before his release, was quoted as saying by the  Associated Press. "He drank the same dirty water; he slept outside with the  flies and the heat."  </P> <P> An Irishman with a cast on his leg was taken off the plane in a wheelchair, but  his name and details about his injury were not immediately available. When  asked how he was hurt, he laughed and said, "Celebrating!" as he was wheeled  away.  </P> <P> Howell's afternoon flight capped a week of emotional departures of hundreds of  foreigners from Iraq and Kuwait. Many of the hostages -- including American,  Japanese, British, Italian and French citizens -- had been held as so-called  human shields at Iraqi military and industrial sites to deter a potential  U.S.-led attack. Others floated in limbo in Baghdad or hid out in Kuwait.  </P> <P> In a surprise move, Iraqi President Hussein announced last week that he would  release all foreigners, claiming that the purpose of their captivity had been  served. He said the stay of the "guests," as he called them, gave Iraq time to  build up its military forces to confront an expected invasion.  </P> <P> According to Western and Arab diplomats, the visit of three of Iraq's Arab  allies to Baghdad last week helped persuade Hussein to release the hostages.  Jordan's King Hussein, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat  and Ali Salim Bidh, the vice president of Yemen, all spoke with the Iraqi  leader and advised him that the hostages were more a cause for war than a  deterrent.  </P> <P> At one point, President Bush had indicated he was "tired" of the treatment of  Americans in Iraq and Kuwait, raising speculation that the embassy drama might  provide a spark to ignite a U.S. drive to push Iraq out of the sheikdom.  </P> <P> During his recent visit to South America, Bush effectively reversed himself and  indicated that the exit of hostages from Iraq and Kuwait could in fact free his  hand for military moves.  </P> <P> In any event, U.S. officials in Washington insist that the departure of Howell  does not indicate acceptance of Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Over the months, embassy after embassy in Kuwait shuttered as hardships mounted  on diplomats who stayed behind. At one point, an East German official who  ventured from his home looking for water was taken into custody and flown to  Baghdad. Iraqi troops once stormed the French Embassy but declared the move a  mistake and retreated.  </P> <P> To celebrate Howell's safe departure, American officials still in Baghdad held  a champagne party Thursday and promised to take a day off.  </P> <P> Williams reported from Baghdad and Jones from Frankfurt.  </P></p>

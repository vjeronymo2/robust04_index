			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- "We will fight, holding  ever higher the banner of independence, democracy and  reunification held aloft by the patriotic martyrs, undauntedly  facing brutal suppression by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim  Yong-sam clique and thereby overthrow the colonial fascist rule  of the U.S. imperialists and establish an independent government  of the nation in order not to spoil the price of blood shed by  the valiant fighters of the Kwangju resistance," declared Cho  Il-min, chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the South Korean  National Democratic Front (Hanminjon), in a statement issued on  Tuesday on the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising.    "The uprising made the South Korean people clearly see that  the United States is an aggressor and murderer, not a friend,"  he said. "Unless the Americans are driven away, the South Korean  people cannot get rid of colonial slavery nor can achieve the  democratisation of society and the independent, peaceful  reunification of the country."    Cho Il-min further said:    "We will wage the anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle more  courageously, never forgetting the heinous crimes committed by  the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the military fascist  murderers in slaying in cold blood Kwangju citizens who  courageously rose in the uprising for independence, democracy  and reunification and turning Kwangju into a blood.    "The United States must take steps to pull its forces and  nuclear weapons out of South Korea, clearly seeing that there is  no room for it to stay in South Korea where anti-U.S. sentiments  are growing day by day and not making light of the unshakable  will of the South Korean people to fight it out to defend the  national sovereignty.    "The United States must renounce its policy of isolating and  stifling the DPRK over the `nuclear issue', sincerely seek a  peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula  through the medium of DPRK-USA negotiations and respond to the  just proposal of the DPRK to replace the armistice agreement  with a peace agreement."</p>

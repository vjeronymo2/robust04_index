			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted that there is  a big gap between the Syrian and Israeli stands vis-a-vis peace  in the Middle East. Meanwhile, he reiterated that Syria will be  committing a big mistake if it believes that the United States  will exert any pressure on Israel. Rabin wanted to say that  Israeli intransigence will continue and that his government will  not make any change in its policy rejecting the Security Council  resolutions.    The Israeli stands, which are hostile to the peace process  and to the spirit and bases of the Madrid conference, have not  surprised Syria because Israel was established on a policy of  aggression, usurpation, and expansion. Syria, however,  participated in the peace process and responded to the U.S.  initiative, proceeding from definite bases -- namely, exchanging  land for peace, implementing the Security Council resolutions,  and achieving a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts  of conflict.    Syria has worked over the past two and a half years to  render  the Washington talks a success, saved the peace process more  than once from intentional Israeli destruction, and facilitated  the task of U.S. envoys in the region. Since the United States  has reiterated -- through President Bill Clinton and Secretary  of State Warren Christopher -- its commitment to go ahead in the  peace process in accordance with its bases, Syria has the right  to ask the United States keep its promise and play the fair role  of full partner. Syria understands that fairness achieves rights  and entrenches justice. Syria does not, at all, call on the  United States to become biased toward Syria; it wants the United  States to be biased toward the Security Council resolutions and  the principles of the international laws that ban occupation of  land by force, any change in the land's cultural, historical,  and demographic features, and the law of jungle.    In view of Israel's history, which is full of wars,  aggressions, and massacres; in light of the clear maneuvers and  procrastination it showed in Washington; and given its rejection  of the requirements of the peace process -- particularly full  withdrawal from the occupied territory -- Syria will continue to  ask the United States to fulfill its guarantees and its  commitment to play a fair role. Syria believes there is no way  to achieve peace in the Middle East without effective American  intervention in the interest of the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    All the world hopes will not convince Israel to make one  single step toward achieving peace if this step is not  accompanied by the appropriate pressure. The current situation  should prompt the entire international community to make an  urgent move to end the present stalemate in the Washington talks.    Israel will commit a grave mistake if it believes that Syria  will, ultimately, succumb to its blackmailing, twisted methods,  partial settlements and relinquish one single inch of the Golan.    The Golan has been Syrian land from the beginning of  history,  and Syria will not relinquish one single inch of its land and  will not bargain over its sovereignty. It neither relinquishes  Arab rights or bargains over them. If peace is not fair or  comprehensive, and if it does not end Israeli occupation of all  occupied territory it will remain a temporary deal that will be  destroyed by acceleration of events.</p>

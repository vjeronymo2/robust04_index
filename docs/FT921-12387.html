			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Powers challenge by Tec chairmen THE AUTHORITY of the government to block a radical training initiative for the long-term unemployed, devised by a training and enterprise council, is to be challenged today. The challenge to Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, will be made at a meeting of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen. It follows the withholding of approval by Mr Robert Jackson, the employment minister, for a pilot project planned for this April by Norfolk and Waveney Tec. The Tec - the chairman of which is Mr John Lineker, recently appointed by G10 to lead negotiations with the government over funding - sees the case as an important test of the authority of Tec boards. Tecs' relations with the government are already strained, with some threatening not to renew their contracts this year because of proposed cuts in funding for Youth Training and Employment Training. Norfolk and Waveney Tec wanted a two-track scheme to replace ET. All the long-term unemployed would retain their entitlement to training. That could include short training for those who wanted to brush up on skills to return to work quickly and longer training for those with special needs. Those requiring specific occupational skills training could apply for a Tec 'award', for which they would have to demonstrate that they had identified a need for the relevant skill and a possible job vacancy. Up to 10 per cent of the award would be paid back in monthly instalments when the individual found a job. A letter from Mr Lineker to Mr Howard described the package as 'thoroughly researched'. It had received overwhelming support from the jobless and employers. A letter from Mr Jackson to Mr Lineker said the ideas might be considered next year.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Weak demand affects Japanese retailers TWO Japanese retailers belonging to the Seibu Saison group, a leading retail and consumer services concern, were hit by sluggish consumer confidence due to the weak economy and bad summer weather. Seiyu, a supermarket chain which owns the Intercontinental Hotel group, saw a 3.3 per cent decline in sales to Y529.3bn (Dollars 4.9bn) for the first six months to August and a 15.6 per cent drop in operating profits to Y12.4bn. Cost cutting efforts and a decline in interest payments on borrowings helped the company to post a 0.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y7.5bn. After-tax profits fell Y19.5 per cent to Y4.3bn. Mr Katsuhiro Fujiseki, president of Seiyu, said a full recovery in consumer spending was unlikely before the second half of the next business year to February 1995. For the year to next February, the company expects pre-tax profits to rise 1.3 per cent to Y13bn on a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y1bn. Family Mart, the country's third-largest convenience store operator and a subsidiary of Seiyu, saw a 4.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y8bn. After-tax profits fell Y3.6 per cent to Y3.9bn. Operating profits dropped 5.6 per cent to Y7.3bn, the first year-on-year decline, while sales at existing stores fell for the first time by 0.7 per cent. For the full year to February the company expects pre-tax profits to rise 0.6 per cent to Y17bn on a 4 per cent rise in sales to Y77.5bn.</p>

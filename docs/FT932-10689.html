			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit Jefferson Smurfit is a curious stock market beast. There are few enough quoted cardboard box manufacturers exposed to markets as diverse as Venezuela and Ireland, fewer still that make any money from them. Shareholders may be disgruntled that pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent to IPounds 95.5m last year. That, though, represents a creditable achievement given Smurfit's chronically depressed markets. The company's robust balance sheet and geographical spread have enabled it to weather the recession better than most. Although some may baulk at Smurfit deriving almost 60 per cent of its trading profits from Latin America, others will view that as an attraction, given the continuing weakness of continental European markets. There are benefits to come from the flotation of Smurfit's US associate, JSC. That, though, may be later rather than sooner given its trading weakness and the pricing troubles in the US board market. Whatever Smurfit's attractions, though, investors may find their gaze straying elsewhere if recovery really does take hold. Smurfit's more highly geared Scandinavian and north American rivals should see their profits shoot ahead far faster.</p>

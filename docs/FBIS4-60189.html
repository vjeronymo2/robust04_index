			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received the following. A responsible  source has stated the following:    In an attempt to cover up its shelling of residential  quarters and hospitals in the capital, Sanaa, Ta'izz,  al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah, and other cities with Scud missiles --  whose use in wartime against civilians and civilian  installations is prohibited -- the gang of apostasy and  secession within the leadership of the Socialist Party has  claimed that the two missiles that fell yesterday evening on  Aden airport, which houses military targets and from which the  warplanes under the control of the secessionist gangs take off  daily to bomb the civilians and the members of our Armed Forces,  hit the homes of citizens and caused damage to them, injuring  some of their inhabitants.    We doubt such a false claim could fool anyone. And this will  also not justify the ugly, heinous crimes of this gang, which  will not be forgotten by our people.    Since this criminal gang ignited the fighting in Yemen, the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy have abided by the  orders of the brother chairman, Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, to ensure the safety of civilians and their  property, no matter what crimes the secessionist gang commits  against secure cities and defenseless civilians. The source  said the Armed Forces do not possess Scud missiles, which the  secessionists claimed that the forces protecting unity and  legitimacy used in operations to hit Aden airport.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders believe zinc market squeeze is over A TECHNICAL squeeze on nearby supplies that has threatened to create turmoil on the London Metal Exchange's zinc market seemed to be over, traders and analysts were suggesting last night. This was reflected in a substantial fall in zinc prices yesterday. Metal for immediate delivery closed Dollars 21 a tonne down at Dollars 1,150 while three-month zinc fell Dollars 19.25 to Dollars 1,144. The LME twice issued formal warnings that it was taking an intense interest since the squeeze began to build last December. Traders suggest that those responsible for the squeeze had used options to take control of between 60 and 70 per cent of the exchange's zinc stocks. However, metal became much more freely available this week and Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, said the threat of LME action might have been responsible for the change of heart. 'While some of the technical tightness might have been rolled over to future months, the squeeze is probably over,' he added. There has been widespread market speculation that some zinc smelters have been behind the squeeze, hoping that the resulting higher LME prices would make the mining companies more willing to accept higher charges for treating zinc concentrates.</p>

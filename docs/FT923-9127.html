			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Philippines plans Eurobond launch: Two US banks already in discussions FOLLOWING completion of its commercial debt rescheduling package last month, the Philippines is planning to return to the international financial markets for the first time since the debt crisis of the 1980s. Two US banks, Chase Investment and J P Morgan Securities, are already in discussions with the authorities in Manila about a potential Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) offering of Eurobonds, which could be launched as early as next month. Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, told a news conference: 'We think this is a logical step, and then hopefully after the national government has taken that step, private corporations. . . can also begin to take the plunge back into the voluntary financial market.' The terms of the bond issue were still being worked out, he added. Analysts believe the offering is feasible, not only because of the debt rescheduling but because of renewed confidence in the country's future under the newly elected administration of Mr Fidel Ramos. 'I don't think you could have talked about the country's return to international markets six months ago,' said Ms Joyce Chang, vice-president of emerging markets at Salomon Brothers in New York. 'There is a positive feeling both internationally and domestically about prospects for the new government.' The country's secondary market debt, which was trading at about 49 cents in the dollar prior to the election, is now quoted at 58 cents in the dollar. However, she cautioned that a number of difficult measures had still to be taken by the government. The Philippines' return to the international capital markets would follow rehabilitation of Latin American countries such as Mexico and Brazil, after a long absence following the 1980s' debt crisis. The Philippines' financial crisis began in 1983 when the central bank's gross reserves plunged to dangerously low levels, prompting a unilateral debt moratorium. The Dollars 100m Eurobond is expected to be issued through a state bank or agency, such as the National Development Bank, and to have a short life of two or three years. According to bankers, Manila would have to pay interest of about 3 1/2 percentage points more than the yield on the comparable US Treasury note. The Philippines 'would be hard put to justify a finer spread than Argentina or Venezuela,' said Mr Paul Luke, head of research at Morgan Grenfell in London, which paid around that level for recent debt offerings. Philippine officials are supporting moves to encourage the entry of foreign banks, adds Jose Galang in Manila. Under a proposed bill the banks would be allowed entry as full-service branches, wholly owned subsidiaries, or as 70 per cent equity partners with domestic banks. The policy-making Monetary Board, of which Mr del Rosario and the governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines are members, has endorsed the bill. The timetable for introduction of the proposals has not been disclosed but officials have said it would be a priority. Opposition from domestic commercial banks had derailed plans by previous governments to allow the entry of foreign institutions. However, many of the 24 domestic banks have foreign investors as minority partners. There are four branches of foreign banks operating in the Philippines - Citibank, Bank of America, Hongkong and Shanghai, and Standard Chartered.</p>

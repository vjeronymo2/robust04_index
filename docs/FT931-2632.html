			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Strong US boost helps Telemetrix to Pounds 9.8m TELEMETRIX reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 9.8m in 1992, compared with a restated Pounds 4.1m, thanks mainly to strong sales growth and sharply-improved margins in GTI, its US subsidiary. Group turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 98.2m (Pounds 83.7m) as Telemetrix completed a restructuring and management shake-up to concentrate on the manufacture of components for local area computer networks and telecommunication systems, test equipment and support services. The most dramatic improvement came at GTI, the Nasdaq-quoted company in which Telemetrix has a 61 per cent stake, and its Valor unit making networking products. GTI's turnover improved 37 per cent to Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 44.5m) while profits surged to Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 4.7m). Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, said the group saw great potential for further growth in the LAN market, explaining that most personal computers were still not connected to a network. Zetex, the wholly owned UK maker of specialist semi-conductors, also saw a sharp increase in profits to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.2m) on turnover up from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 15.9m. Telemetrix said that group debt had been eliminated. Restructuring costs associated with the closure of the defence sector business of the Trend subsidiary, taken above the line, were Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 1.5m). These were largely offset by a gain of Pounds 3.4m from the sale of part of the holding in GTI. Earnings per share were up sharply at 5p (1.7p). The dividend is lifted to 0.8p (0.6p).</p>

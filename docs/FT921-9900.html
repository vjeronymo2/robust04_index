			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The tourist in her own country: As the Queen enters the fifth decade of her reign, the monarchy faces challenges greater than ever before AS KING Lear discovered unhappily, longevity does not necessarily make a sovereign popular or serene. Indeed, if Queen Elizabeth II contemplates the history of her forebears on the British throne, she must see that the record during the past 200 years or so has been decidedly mixed. Although she is well-loved by her subjects, it does not follow automatically that the monarchy's reputation is high and unquestioned. Certainly, age by itself will not assure her of greater dignity and public respect: as old men, George IV and William IV were neither loved nor admired, while Edward VIII threw it all away when he married Mrs Simpson. Yet, the reasons why some monarchs have become venerated patriarchs (or matriarchs) while others have not are complex and often obscure. George III's reputation improved immeasurably the older (and madder) he became. At the end of her reign, Victoria was even more selfish, obstinate and bigoted than she had been at the start; but none of this mattered to her subjects, who worshipped her as an imperial icon. Edward VII was scarcely a more admirable individual than George IV, but the public perception of him was very different. And while George V became a lovable king, he was never a particularly lovable man. So, at one level, royal reputation turns out to be like any other: what Shakespeare once described as 'an idle and most false disposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving.' But it is fashioned also by broader forces over which the monarchs themselves have had little control and often have not even understood. In every reign, and in every generation, the British have projected on to the person of their sovereign their own collective hopes, anxieties and expectations. In so doing, they have created and re-created their monarchy in their own self-image. How far should the Queen be comforted or worried by this as she enters the fifth decade of her reign? Compared with George IV or William IV she has enjoyed a relatively good press. Compared with George V and George VI, she has done rather less well. And compared with George III and Victoria, she did much better at the beginning of her reign but seems less likely to enjoy the sunset apotheosis and uncritical veneration of their later years. Why so? As in previous ages, the answer lies in a combination of individual royal personality and the broader tissue of national circumstances. In a society where old age is more a commonplace problem than an unusual sign of admirable endurance, it no longer guarantees certain celebrity in the way it once did - witness the almost Pythonesque demise of the Kremlin old guard. To make matters worse for the present Queen, the slot of apotheosised matriarch is not yet even available to her. Indeed, if the Queen Mother outlives her own century, as she seems to have every intention (and capability) of doing, that slot is not going to become available for many years. As to her own personality, we know little more about it now than we did at the beginning of her reign, despite the BBC's televised attempt on Thursday to make her more accessible. Like her father, she is reputedly pleasant, decent, dutiful, conscientious and high-minded. But, like him again, she is also limited in her education and her social vision, seems lacking conspicuously in imagination and flair, and is conservative enough to regard most change as change for the worse. Whether these are the ideal attributes and attitudes for a head of state in the late-20th century is, perhaps, open to question. And then there is her family. As the Queen surveys the tribe of which she is the hereditary chief, she must often shudder, and it is difficult not to feel some sympathy. When she acceded to the throne, the royal family consisted effectively of five people: the Queen herself, her husband, her sister, her mother and her grandmother (Queen Mary). But during the past 40 years it has developed into an over-extended, multi-generational dynasty, devoid of any central direction, purpose or justification. For most contemporary commentators, whose analysis is scarcely more profound than that of the gossip columnist or the 'investigative journalist,' this is enough to explain the unhappy state and uncertain prospects of the monarchy today. But while individual character, the reaction between the generations, and the creative image of the royal family undoubtedly are important, they are only part - and perhaps the lesser part - of the whole picture. Now, as in the past, the monarchy must be viewed in the broader context of national development and the popular collective mood. At the time of her Silver Jubilee in 1977, Elizabeth II was anxious to stress that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: that she was, like her forebears, a symbol of British national identity. But in the course of her reign, that sense of national identity has much weakened. Scotland wants devolution, Northern Ireland will surely rejoin the south before the next century is many years old, and England itself is now a multi-racial society. Where exactly does that leave the monarchy as the traditional embodiment of Britishness? A closely-connected subject, which also has important implications for the monarchy's future, is the fast-changing relations with Europe. It is not just that the Queen's head might disappear from UK bank-notes, coins, even postage stamps - it also is difficult to envisage a serious role for Britain's royal house in any tighter form of continental federation. What would the British monarchy do then? In previous times, it could have turned to the Empire or the Commonwealth to keep it busy. But the independence of the former colonies, and the changing identities of the old dominions, mean that the Commonwealth is no longer the royalist, Anglophile community it was at the Queen's accession. Yet, it is only as the sovereign of her remaining overseas possessions, and as head of the Commonwealth, that she can lay claim to a genuinely global role. She herself believes passionately in it - but few others do. It will not last. Shorn of its international trappings, how would - or will - the monarchy adjust? As the British nation itself is re-defined; as Britain's relations with Europe are re-ordered; as the once-British Commonwealth evolves and disperses; and as Britain gradually - and painfully - adjusts to the fact that it is no longer a world power, this is bound to require a fundamental re-thinking of the monarchy's purpose and functions. The old way of doing things - ceremonial grandeur, tax exemptions, overseas tours, gracious smiles - which may have been right at the outset of the Queen's reign, no longer seem acceptable or appropriate. What is to be put in its place? This has been made all the more urgent because of the impact of Thatcherism on popular perceptions of the monarchy. As a symbol of national identity, Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, upstaged the Queen easily. Norman Tebbitt, perhaps Thatcher's closest lieutenant, denounced the Prince of Wales and many Thatcherites regarded the monarchy as just another vested interest, an unacceptable amalgam of snobbery and frivolity. While the welfare state consensus prevailed, the monarchy's position as benevolent referee seemed clear and secure. But now the goal-posts have been shifted, its position seems decidedly shaken. There is little evidence that the Queen, or her relatives and advisers, have recognised the full implications of these developments so far as the monarchy is concerned. And it is here that we must return to personalities again. Clearly, there is need for a serious re-evaluation of the monarchy in the next few decades. Whether the present queen - 40 years in the job and, thus, hardly likely to change her approach to it - is the person to undertake such a re-appraisal is not clear. Nor can we know whether Prince Charles, her heir, would - or will - do any better. Whoever is responsible, part of the process of the readjustment ought to involve the dismantling of the old, out-of-date imperial monarchy that flourished from the time of Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present Queen's accession. The tax exemptions, the ceremonial grandeur, the Commonwealth tours, the endless public appearances, the whole sycophantic mythology of imperial ornamentality - all this needs to be scaled down or swept away, and the monarchy brought into line more appropriately with the diminished nation over which it now reigns. Described like this, the royal future might seem rather unappealing: a moped monarchy which is little more than an hereditary, non-elective presidency. But while the monarchy would be well advised to abandon its recent imperial past, its lengthy history affords other more positive and encouraging precedents. It does not have to be like it is: passive, philistine, bewildered, anachronistic, obsessed with protocol and tradition, and smothered in a courtly embrace redolent of quarter-deck attitudes and saddle-soap. Previous monarchs have been lively, energetic, cultured, even intellectual: what a refreshing change it would be for that to happen again. Previous monarchs did much more than make an occasional visit to a concert or the opera and were involved, actively and creatively, in the promotion and patronage of the arts: that, too, would be a welcome development. The present Queen might follow the example of George I and use a small part of her enormous fortune to found some new university professorships. She might even set up a Windsor foundation and establish herself as a leader in creative philanthropy. The real problem with the British monarchy today is that it is not seen to be an active, serious or significant part of the life of the British nation. Doing her boxes, going on stage-managed visits, making speeches she has not written, meeting people only in wholly-contrived social situations - none of this brings the Queen into authentic contact with her subjects. Like all members of the royal family, only more so, she is little more than a tourist in her own country. If the British monarchy is to have a future, she should think about taking up residence for real. These individual suggestions can take us only so far. It is not just that the British monarchy has lost its way - it is also that the British people no longer have any real collective sense of what they want their monarchy for. Just as most societies get the gods they deserve, so most monarchies get the sovereign they deserve. One reason why the British are so uncertain with their monarchy is that they are so uncertain about themselves. For both the Queen and her subjects, there are challenging times ahead.

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Margaret Price - Queen Elizabeth Hall Another royal birthday has passed without Margaret Price receiving the honour that is her due. It may be that the criteria by which these decisions are made cannot be divulged, but it is starting to look as though a career largely furthered and celebrated across Europe is no substitute for a more insular popularity at home. On Friday the singer was in London for a recital at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The programme was all German song, Schumann in the first half, Brahms in the second, and it only served to emphasize what a European artist Miss Price has become, for there are not many native German-speakers who sing Lieder as eloquently at the moment; and there have been precious few British singers to equal her in this field at any time. In Schumann's Kerner Lieder, Op. 35, never much loved by audiences for their heavyweight Teutonic romanticism, she came up against memories of past London interpreters such as Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (a particular champion of the set) and radiated a beauty over the music that the others could not match. The songs were taken slowly and, as is her inclination, in too deliberate a manner. But the audience was held. Above all, one felt for the first time that the songs made sense as a cycle. The feeling of a sun-lit warmth of emotion, at first starting to melt the chill ending of 'Frage' and then flooding out through 'Stille Tranen", was gloriously handled, both by the soprano and her accompanist, Graham Johnson. The music's heartbeat had been caught and the performance made a deeply moving descent down to the numbed desperation of the ending. In her Brahms - a selection of eight Volkslieder and the Zigeunerlieder, Op. 103 - lighter moods predominated. A delicious sentimentality for 'Da unten im Tale"; no false attempts at funny voices for the ever-popular 'Vergebliches Standchen'. And, always, the purity of the voice and unforced utterance of the German poetry were there to give pleasure. For singing of this quality no further recognition is perhaps necessary. At the other end of the scale, just starting out on a career which one trusts will live up to its initial promise, is the young soprano Alison Buchanan. Still in her early 20s, she appeared on Thursday in the 'Young Artists' lunchtime recital series at Covent Garden, coincidentally accompanied by a young pianist, Eugene Asti, who has himself been working with Margaret Price. It was an enjoyable occasion, not maybe one to burn itself upon the memory, but leaving a feeling of considerable optimism for the future. This is based largely on the beauty and ease of Miss Buchanan's voice. Nothing in a quite adventurous programme seemed to trouble her vocally at all; the tone is attractively warm, beautifully lambent when she sings quietly, a voice born of nature, not of artifice. She sang her Debussy and Wolf songs with due care for style and language, though not yet quite enough personality (too much earnestness, a smile or two would help there). Once into English-language songs by Walton, Copland and Bolcom, the face lit up and so did the words. Her Cole Porter encore about the little oyster was sheer delight: a delicious lunchtime find] Anthony Thornycroft's monthly Sponsorship column will appear on this page next Monday.</p>

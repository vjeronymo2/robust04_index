			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by reporter Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230): "The </F> Earlier Talks on Economic Issues Start, the Greater the Benefits  for Both Sides of the Strait"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- Compatriots across the  strait are gratified by the progress made in the working  discussions in Beijing between officials of the Association of  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Straits  Exchange Foundation [SEF], which have marked a new phase of  implementing the agreements reached at the "Wang-Gu" talks.  That the topic on exchanges and cooperation in the fields of  economy, trade, science and technology was not on the agenda of  the discussions cannot but be considered a blemish on an  otherwise very successful meeting.    The "Wang-Gu" talks in April 1993 were clearly defined by  both sides as "nongovernmental, economic, routine, and  functional." Among the four, the significance of the "economic"  character cannot be overlooked. "Nongovernmental" and  "functional" refer only to the objective characters of ARATS and  SEF; the word "routine" defines the nature of the talks, which  are aimed at solving existing problems arising from cross-strait  contact and exchanges. Only the "economic" character manifests,  in a forward-looking manner, increased cross-strait economic  exchange, greater economic cooperation, and mutually beneficial  cooperation that will contribute to prosperity and welfare on  both sides of the strait. That the ARATS's proposal for  inclusion of discussions on economic affairs was adopted at the  "Wang-Gu talks" and was written into the "General Agreement on  the Wang-Gu Talks" has broadened the immediate significance of  the talks and made the agreement more popular across the strait;  moreover, it meets the needs of cross-strait economic exchange  and will serve as a guide for cross-strait economic exchange and  trade.    The success of the "Wang-Gu talks" has injected new energy  into nongovernmental economic exchanges and trade across the  strait. While the tide of Taiwan businessmen's investment in the  Mainland has been growing unabated, a new trend of large  businesses and financial groups vying with one another for  business opportunities on the mainland has emerged. Immediately  after the "Wang-Gu talks" concluded, a delegation of officials  from 15 private-sector banks in Taiwan made a fact-finding tour  of the Mainland. It has been learned that 38 percent of the 270  publicly listed companies in Taiwan have been authorized by  their boards of directors to invest in the Mainland. Because of  objections from the Taiwan authorities, most of these listed  companies have not been able to implement their investment  plans. Nonetheless, cross-strait trade and economic exchange  grew rapidly in 1993. Statistics from the Taiwan side indicate  that Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong in 1993 were $18.45 billion,  up 19.7 percent over the previous year; imports stood at $1.72  billion. Taiwan ran a trade surplus of $16.72 billion.  According to an analysis by Taiwan's "Ministry of Economics,"  if trade with Hong Kong was excluded, Taiwan would have run a  trade deficit $8.85 billion. Cross-strait entrepot trade  accounts for the bulk of Taiwan's trade with Hong Kong; it is  therefore clear that the Mainland has become a principal market  for Taiwan's economic development.    A pattern of mutual reciprocity is emerging in cross-strait  economic exchanges and trade. In terms of indirect trade, the  Taiwan side is enjoying a huge surplus, which has to a  considerable extent helped sustain Taiwan's economic prosperity;  the Mainland side, on the other hand, has run a huge trade  deficit. Out of political considerations, some officials in  Taiwan have purposely made a political issue out of Taiwan's  growing "dependence" on the Mainland. It should be pointed out,  however, that the surplus-deficit situation in cross-strait  trade was not created artificially. The deficits are, on one  hand, due to the shift of production to Taiwan-funded  enterprises on the Mainland; on the other hand, because of the  Taiwan authorities' policy that places restrictions on the  amount and grades of semifinished products exported from the  Mainland to Taiwan, cross-strait economic exchanges and trade  remain at rather low levels. Many people in the business  circles of both sides have pointed out: If the ban on the import  of Mainland high-tech semifinished products is lifted, it would  not only help correct the trade imbalance but also improve  Taiwan's competitiveness in the international market. In  investment, investment by Taiwan businessmen has increased with  each passing day, and protection for the rights and interests of  Taiwan investors is being constantly improved. The Taiwan  authorities, on the other hand, have set numerous restrictions  on in Taiwan businessmen's investment in the Mainland. To this  day people from the Mainland's economic and trade circles are  barred from visiting Taiwan. Therefore, it is necessary for the  ARATS and SEF to reach a consensus through economic discussions  and work out measures for implementing higher-level exchange and  cooperation under the principle of reciprocity.    Topics on economic affairs account for a significant part  of the "General Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." They range  from "covers the rights and interests of Taiwan investors in the  Mainland and related issues," "the issue of mutual visits by  industrialists and businessmen," "stepping up the development of  energy and other resources and exchanges in this field," to  "mutual visits by scientists, the exchange of scientific  publications, discussions on the standardization of  technological terms and the standardization of product  specifications," and "scientific exchanges in the fields of  computers and other industries." At the time of the "Wang-Gu  talks," the two sides already had considerable differences over  these issues which needed to be worked out through common  efforts in later talks. Over the past half-year or so, the  ARATS had made a great deal of preparations so that talks on the  aforementioned topics could be placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF  working discussions at an early date. It sent several letters  to the SEF in hopes of bringing about a fact-finding tour to  Taiwan by Mainland economic and trade circles. It put forth --  at the first working discussion on implementing the general  agreement of the "Wang-Gu talks" -- a "schedule of discussions"  that called for an exchange of views or comprehensive  negotiations on all topics -- including economic exchanges --  covered in the general agreement. Moreover, the Mainland has  also taken positive steps to advance cross-strait exchanges in  the fields of economics, trade, and science and technology. It  has also responded positively to Taiwan's concern over  legislative protection for the rights and interests of Taiwan  investors in the Mainland. Thanks to the ARATS's active work  with relevant authorities, a draft of the "Law on Protecting the  Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" has been submitted to the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for  deliberation.    It is the wish not only of the ARATS but also the business  circles on Taiwan that issues related to the economy and science  and technology are placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF working  discussions. In early December last year, the first meeting of  the second board of directors and supervisor of the SEF adopted  a motion by Wang Youzeng [Wang Yu-tseng], a director of the SEF  and executive chairman of the Taiwan Business Federation,  recommending that the "Mainland Affairs Council" "lift the ban  to make it possible for leading Mainland industrialists and  businessmen to visit Taiwan." In January this year, SEF  Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] said in answering a reporter's  question that cross-strait economic exchanges and trade is  extremely important; it cannot continue to be clouded with  uncertainties. Authorities must formulate specific policies for  Taiwan's business circles to follow. Exchange of high-level  visits between economic and trade circles across the strait is  also very important. This year should see, at the least, the  start of such exchanges. Taiwan's KUNG SHANG SHIH PAO  [COMMERCIAL TIMES] also published an article the other day  urging authorities to lift restrictions on visits to Taiwan by  Mainland industrialists and businessmen at an early date.    The reality of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade  over  the last decade or so shows that both sides will benefit  economically by complementing each other's strengths. Moreover,  the earlier such cooperation starts, the greater the benefits  for both sides. The Taiwan authorities realized early on that  "only by having the Mainland as its hinterland will Taiwan be  able to solve its current and future economic difficulties."  Due, however, to political considerations and man-made factors,  development of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade has  been placed under considerable restrictions. The "Wang-Gu  talks" have removed a psychological barrier enabling both sides  to eschew divergent views on politics [bi kai zheng zhi shang di  qi jian 6699 7030 2398 3112 0006 4104 2978 6015] and develop  economic cooperation through negotiations on routine affairs.  It is therefore rather urgent for the two sides to study ways  to comprehensively implement the agreement and place -- as early  as possible -- economic issues on the agenda of the follow-up  talks. Increasing mutual understanding through talks will help  facilitate formulation of specific measures and plans for  advancing cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation and  effectively pushing forward cross-strait economic, scientific,  and technological exchanges, thereby ushering in a situation in  which both sides will emerge as winners.</p>

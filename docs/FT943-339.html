			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwanese cast their nets wider  -Pollution and overfishing has hit local catches Fishmongers at Keelung port's bustling fish market hawk scaly wares ranging from imported Norwegian salmon to Pacific tuna and squid caught off the Falkland Islands. Pollution and overfishing of nearby waters has forced Taiwanese fishermen to scour ever more distant shores. The catch of neighbouring China nearly tripled from 1981 to 1990 to become the world's biggest fisheries producer. Taiwan will soon sign an accord with the 15-nation South Pacific Forum allowing its fishermen uniform access to waters controlled by those countries, according to the country's ministerial-level Council of Agriculture. The South Pacific is an important fishing ground for Taiwan, especially for tuna and skipjack. Forum members are Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Fiji, Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru, Niue Island, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since the United Nations switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1971, Taiwan has encountered difficulties in securing fishing grounds, especially from countries with which it does not have diplomatic ties. In 1989 the quasi-governmental Overseas Fisheries Development Council was set up to negotiate fishing rights and help settle an escalating number of fishing disputes. The government has already secured fishing rights within the 200-mile coastal zones of South Africa, Tuvalu, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, all countries with which Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations. Commercial fishing agreements have so far been reached with over 20 countries or territories, of which those with Indonesia, India and the Falkland Islands are the most important. Talks are under way with several other countries including Vietnam and Burma. Although Taiwan does not appear in statistics compiled by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation, it ranked the 18th among fishing nations in 1990, and falls within the top five in production of both tuna and squid. Government efforts to curb growth in the domestic fishing industry cut the total catch to 1.317m tonnes in 1991 from a 1990 peak of 1.455m. But production has risen since. Taiwan, a major fish exporter, sold just over a quarter of its catch overseas in 1993. Tuna dominated exports and the biggest markets were Japan, Thailand and the US. Fish imports have grown to meet increased domestic consumption resulting from economic growth. Official figures show that Taiwan's imports more than doubled over the past decade. Unofficial imports from China are also on the rise. Taiwanese fishermen either pick up their illicit cargo from Chinese ports or buy the fish from Chinese boats at sea and smuggle it into ports such as Keelung. With nearby waters depleted, nearly 60 per cent of the 1993 catch came from distant seas. Tuna caught in distant seas through long-lining jumped 80 per cent in 1993 from 1992. Last year's catch of squid, caught by a type of hook-and-line method called zigging, climbed 22 per cent. The two species combined comprised one-third of the total catch last year. Despite Taiwan's pariah diplomatic status, which prevents it from joining international organisations, the government generally complies with international maritime and fishing conventions. For instance, it banned whaling in 1983 and in 1993, it outlawed drift net fishing following a United Nations resolution against the practice. As competition grows fiercer for fewer fish, Taiwanese fishing boats have encountered numerous disputes over fishing grounds from the South China Sea to the South Atlantic. Recognising the problems of overfishing, the government in 1989 instituted a policy of trying to contain growth of the fishing industry. Through restrictions on boat-building and a boat buyback programme Taiwan's fleet was cut to 28,880 vessels last year from peak of 32,340 in 1990. But remaining boats and those which are being built are more sophisticated and thus have a higher catching capacity.</p>

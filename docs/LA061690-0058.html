			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN AUSTRALIA, IT TAKES 5 TO CHANGE LIGHT BULB  </P> <P> Question: How many electrical workers does it take to change a light bulb?  Answer: In Australia, five.  </P> <P> A New South Wales government report released this week tells a woeful tale of  public-service inefficiency before recent government restructuring of state  industries.  </P> <P> It said the state's electricity commission needs five workers to change a light  bulb in one of its power stations because of union rules.  </P> <P> "An electrical fitter and his mate were on top of the crane," commission  General Manager Barry Flanagan explained in the report. "The fitter called to  the man driving the crane to move it to the next light. That man driving the  crane couldn't accept the call from the tradesman.  </P> <P> "He had to have a rigger and a mate standing by him so the tradesmen could talk  to the rigger and the rigger could tell the crane driver."  </P></p>

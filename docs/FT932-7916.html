			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Holiday agency stops trading Holidaymaker Group of Brigstock Road, Thornton Heath, south London, has ceased trading and the Civil Aviation Authority has called in its bond of Pounds 17,250. The group traded as Airtour Europe, Airtour France and Airtour Swiss, specialising in flights to European destinations. Its air-travel organiser's licence authorised it for up to 1,000 passengers. It has no connection with the Lancashire-based tour operator Airtours. Passengers of Holidaymaker booked on flights with British Midland, Swissair, Lauda Air or Alitalia not in possession of tickets will not be able to travel but will be able to claim a full refund from the CAA's air travel organisers' licence section.</p>

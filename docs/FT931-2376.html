			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Ruling is sought on BES scheme A Pounds 25m loan-backed Business Expansion Scheme organised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd may have failed to qualify for tax relief due to an oversight on the eve of the Budget, John Authers writes. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in his speech that shares in BES companies had to be issued to shareholders by midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against them. BZW, a London-based securities house, said yesterday that there were 'uncertainties in the Inland Revenue press release' and that it was seeking a ruling from the Revenue. The Inland Revenue said that it was left to individual tax inspectors to decide when a share had been 'issued'. It said: 'This will normally happen when the shareholding has been listed in the company's register of members.' BZW's Gracechurch companies bought repossessed properties from Barclays Bank's loan book. They were launched at the end of February and were fully subscribed within a week. Earlier this week two other companies, raising money for Oriel College Oxford and the University of Bristol, had to offer to return money to investors after failing to allot shares by the deadline.</p>

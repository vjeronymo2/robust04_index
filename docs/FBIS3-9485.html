Later they were forced to walk for about a  kilometre through no-man's-land between Bosnian Serb and Croat  forces, before being taken to a UN Protection Force post by  Croats. After the theft of their vehicles, the drivers were  loaded into a lorry and taken towards the nearby front line, UN  High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] spokesman Peter Kessler  said. "They were then lined up in front of a house. At this  point it became very, very terrifying for them," he said. "They  were told to empty their pockets, to give their belongings to  the Bosnian Serbs. When they saw their personal property being  thrown on the ground they then feared that they would be shot."  After being searched the UNHCR drivers were told to walk on  their own to a minefield, holding white flags over their heads  and to look out for snipers as it was no-man's-land. It was only  after walking about a kilometre they located a post manned by  Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces at Zepce,  about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of where they were  abducted. The Croats drove the team to a UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] base. "The entire situation was terrifying for the  convoy team," Kessler said.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic earlier Thursday told  Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in  former Yugoslavia, that the local Serb commander had acted  without authorisation. He would be punished, Karadzic said,  according to Kessler. The Serb leader also promised his forces  would return the nine stolen UN aid-convoy trucks which have  since been located.    Convoys would again start moving from the Croatian capital  Zagreb to the Maglaj region once the United Nations obtained  security guarantees, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski, adding  that convoys were nevertheless still leaving from Zenica, in  central Bosnia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding whether mining equipment is being inappropriately included in the construction equipment category, the Agency believes that mining equipment should not be treated as a separate class of equipment. There is acknowledged crossover of equipment used on construction and mining sites. For example, excavators, off-highway trucks, crushing equipment, rubber tired loaders and dozers, and crawler tractors are types of equipment commonly used by both mining and construction industries. While some equipment may currently be used only at mining sites, there is no way to predict future equipment use with certainty. Given the high degree of similarity between construction equipment and equipment used in mines, EPA believes that it is justified in treating equipment used in mining as a subcategory of construction equipment. EPA is not required, in determining classes and categories of nonroad engines or vehicles, to subdivide such engines into small subcategories of engines, each of which may have less of an impact on nonattainment than the broader category in which they are included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, it should be noted that the American Mining Congress specifically stated in its comments in the recent EPA rulemaking on preemption of state standards for nonroad engines and vehicles that surface mining equipment should be considered ``construction equipment'' in the context of that rulemaking (EPA Docket No. A&hyph;91&hyph;18). In addition, EPA held a meeting with the American Mining Congress on July 22, 1993, and asked for specific information to support their request for exemption from the proposed regulations. Such information requests included specific dollar figures for the technology needed to comply, a component level breakdown of costs, annual equipment sales and horsepower ranges of mining equipment and other information specifically targeted toward the impacts of mining equipment on ozone and CO nonattainment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As of October 25, 1993, the close of this rulemaking's second comment period, the Agency had not received this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A complete breakdown of the information requested, as well as a summary of the meeting, is contained in Docket  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A&hyph;91&hyph;24, Item No. IV&hyph;E&hyph;01. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the comment that mining equipment operates well outside of nonattainment areas, the American Mining Congress submitted as part of its public comment a report from the TRC Environmental Corporation which states that 40 mine sites are located in ozone nonattainment areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Moreover, EPA is not required to make determinations of nonroad contributions to air pollution on a site by site basis, or to regulate on a site by site basis; CAA section 213 requires a national program based on an aggregate significance determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Analysis of Nonroad Engine Emissions in the Mining Industry,'' TRC Environmental Corporation, July 1993, p. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters suggested the Agency use varying horsepower cutoffs above which nonroad engines should not be regulated. The main rationale given by commenters was that the technology improvements and/or design changes to these larger engines would be too costly. EPA has received very little data directly addressing the actual costs anticipated for these changes, and no information was provided detailing the specific unique high cost technologies that these engines would need, even after the specific request by EPA discussed above. As discussed in section VII, EPA agrees that the cost of compliance for engines over 560 kW (750 horsepower) would be more than the average cost per engine estimated in this rule. EPA uses the net present value of the retail price increase per engine reported in this rule to estimate the cost of this regulation to society, not to predict the cost of any particular engine covered by this rule. While the Agency did not do a cost breakout by engine size, EPA's assessment of the limited cost data submitted by one manufacturer of engines greater than 560 kW suggests that the retail price of these larger engines could increase by approximately $100 per 75 kW due to this regulation. Therefore, in absolute terms, the cost is greater for larger engines. However, in relative terms, the price increase for larger engines only represents about one percent of the total cost of the equipment in which the engine is used. On average, this represents a slightly lower percentage price increase than for smaller engines covered by this rule. EPA has determined that this level of increase for extremely high cost machinery is reasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also received several comments stating that certain farm equipment, skid steer loaders in particular, should be exempted from regulation because they do not significantly contribute to ozone nonattainment. As discussed above, EPA is not required to make a significance determination for every category of nonroad engine it intends to regulate. The significance determination applies only to the initial determination regarding emissions from all nonroad engines and vehicles. Once that determination is made, the Agency shall promulgate regulations for all classes and categories that contribute (without reference to significance) to nonattainment in more than one area. The Nonroad Study clearly shows that farm equipment air pollution causes or contributes to nonattainment in several of the nonattainment areas studied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to specific subcategories of farm equipment, EPA is not required to make determinations regarding every subcategory of equipment that it intends to regulate. The Senate, in fact, instructed EPA not to disaggregate the universe of nonroad engines into small subcategories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, given EPA's finding regarding farm equipment, skid steer loaders and other subcategories of farm equipment will not be exempted from the regulations promulgated in this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Senate Report 101&hyph;228, p. 104. The Senate provisions regarding nonroad engines were ultimately rejected in favor of the House of Representatives' provisions, but the language in the Report indicates the intent of Congress in determining the breadth of categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT  </P> <P> Workers Plead Guilty in Defense Kickbacks Scheme: Two defense industry workers  pleaded guilty to charges that they received more than $47,000 in kickbacks for  directing the business of their employers to various defense subcontractors.  The convictions of Frank Brown, 56, and Raymond Fisher, 67, marked the latest  in a long-term government investigation of fraud and other improprieties in the  defense industry.  </P> <P> Fisher pleaded guilty to failing to report more than $22,000 of income on his  1984 tax return and more than $18,000 on his 1985 return. Prosecutors said the  unreported money stemmed from kickbacks he received from directing the business  of his employer, the Eaton Corp., to various defense subcontractors. In a  separate case, Brown pleaded guilty to failing to disclose more than $7,000 he  allegedly received in kickbacks as an employee of Hamilton-Avent and Cetec.  (Court Case Nos. 90-668, 90-669.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Lehman sues Chinese companies for Dollars 100m Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, is suing three of China's biggest trading companies for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) in debts arising from foreign exchange trading. China United Petroleum Chemicals (Unipec), International Non-Ferrous Metals Trading (Minmetals) and China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export (CNM) have been given 30 days to appear before the US district court in New York to answer the claim. According to documents lodged with the court, Lehman claims that Unipec owes it Dollars 44m, plus interest, arising from losses incurred in its foreign exchange and swap trading activities with the bank from May until August this year. Lehman claims a further Dollars 55.5m, plus interest, from Minmetals and CNM for losses arising from similar transactions over the same period. The suits were filed on Tuesday and have stunned bankers in Beijing and Hong Kong. They said that the companies concerned were trying to raise bank finance and that, if the suits drag on, then international banks may be wary of lending to them. 'These companies have extensive international involvement,' said one European banker stationed in Beijing. 'Foreign banks have something to lose here, but China has more to lose from this action.' Lehman's decision to seek legal redress follows failed negotiations with the companies. In a statement, Lehman said the lawsuits should be viewed 'only as a necessary step toward resolving a commercial dispute with two customers'. None of the Chinese companies concerned has made any comment. The bank's lawsuit comes at a time, however, of increasing frustration with lending in China. Some bankers said yesterday that the suit might indicate that western financiers would be more public in seeking recovery of unpaid debts. At the weekend it emerged that 31 foreign banks had petitioned Mr Zhu Rongji, China's economy minister, to help them recover Dollars 600m in loans to Chinese state industry which had gone bad. The petition was submitted to Mr Zhu last month, the Tokyo newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported. The loans are believed to date back to the early 1980s and many of them are connected to leasing. Of the banks concerned, 24 of them are Japanese with total loans to Chinese industry outstanding of Dollars 1.8bn. Bankers also said that problems the London Metals Exchange had encountered with China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) had not engendered confidence in China. Citic Shanghai, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is alleged to have defaulted on obligations of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m arising from futures trading on the LME earlier this year. Citic's initial response was to claim that the trading by Citic Shanghai was unauthorised and therefore not the responsibility of the parent company. Recently, however, it had indicated it would make good its obligations, bankers said yesterday. 'Citic is one of the very best names and we can do nothing but assume that they will settle the bill,' said one.</p>

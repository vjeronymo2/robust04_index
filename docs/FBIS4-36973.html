			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arrow antiballistic missile has been launched  successfully. In the eighth test of the Arrow system, the  attacking missile passed close to the target missile. Its  warhead exploded, fragments hit the target as planned, and for  the first time ever succeeded in blowing it up.    Our army affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports that  the launch was conducted from a ship not far from central  Israel's seashore.</p>

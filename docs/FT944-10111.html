			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Bureaucrats triumph as new chief heads for Bank of Japan When the Japanese press descended on Mr Yasuo Matsushita's home early yesterday morning, following the announcement of his appointment as the next head of the Bank of Japan, the governor-designate was apparently nonplussed. 'I haven't been told anything about it,' he said. But the expression of surprise can have been little more than an early rehearsal of the new governor's capacity to dissemble - a vital asset for a central banker. The elevation of the 68-year-old Mr Matsushita has been an open secret in financial circles for weeks. The new central bank chief, who takes over from Mr Yasushi Mieno next month, is a former senior vice-minister in the Ministry of Finance, the highest-ranking post in Japan's powerful bureaucracy. But unusually for a Bank of Japan governor, he also has practical experience in the private sector. A graduate of Tokyo University, he spent a year studing languages at Syracuse University in upstate New York. He is understood to be proficient in several languages including English, German, and, somewhat improbably, Latin. He joined the finance ministry in 1950 and rose steadily through the ranks, spending spells in the banking and budget bureaux. He reached the top job in 1982 and retired from the ministry in 1984. Mr Matsushita then followed the time-honoured practice of what is known in Japan as amakudari, or 'descending from heaven', by which lifelong bureaucrats take up lucrative posts in the private sector. He became chairman of Taiyo Kobe, a medium-sized commercial bank, and oversaw its merger with the larger Mitsui Bank. He was appointed chairman of the merged entity, which changed its name to Sakura Bank in 1992. As chairman and then executive adviser at Sakura, Mr Matsushita steered the company through a turbulent period induced by bad loans. The new governor's direct experience of dealing with the financial sector's difficulties was regarded as a plus by most analysts in financial markets yesterday. 'This balance between hands-on private sector management and good standing with the bureaucracy is a big help,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo. 'It will enable him to meet the principal challenge ahead - micro-management of the financial system.' That challenge remains a daunting one. Most banks are still heavily burdened with problem loans, and industry observers expect the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry, which has principal responsibility for banking supervision, to continue to manage the difficulties piecemeal, assisting troubled institutions where necessary and encouraging gradual consolidation within the industry. But Mr Matsushita will also come under pressure to ease monetary policy early in his five-year term. Mr Mieno, who took office in 1989, drew fire from critics for presiding over a restrictive policy that burst the 'bubble economy' of spiralling asset prices and led to Japan's longest recession since the second world war. The country is still emerging tentatively from that downturn, but Mr Mieno has been shifting policy gradually from expansionary to neutral. This is despite the fact that inflation is currently negative and the spectre of a sustained fall in prices, increasing the real cost of servicing loans, haunts the financial sector. The appointment demonstrates the enduring power of Japan's bureaucracy. The governorship usually alternates between a finance ministry apparatchik and a Bank of Japan official. Mr Mieno was a lifelong central banker and the position was expected to revert to a ministry man (they are never women). It is understood Mr Matsushita was chosen some months ago. But in a rare display of political independence, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, objected to the process and asked for consideration of other candidates. After a protracted and occasionally public quarrel within the ministry, the bureaucrats' view prevailed. The ministry's triumph was interpreted by some in financial markets as a worrying sign that the autonomy of the bank's governor would be compromised. In the past five years Mr Mieno had established a reputation for taking an outspoken and independent-minded approach, and as a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, Mr Matsushita is not expected to follow suit. 'I'm a bit concerned about his connection with the Finance Ministry and I wonder how much independence he can have,' said one banker. But such fears are probably founded on a false premise. The Japanese economic policy establishment is monolithic and generally has been dominated, even in Mr Mieno's lively term, by the Finance Ministry. The influence of a central bank chief is limited, even in the monetary field. But the incumbent's personality can make a difference at the margins. According to Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, 'the main difference between Mr Matsushita and Mr Mieno is likely to be one of style. The new governor is unlikely to be as doctrinaire as Mr Mieno and will probably have more sympathy with the position of the banks and with the aims of the Finance Ministry.'</p>

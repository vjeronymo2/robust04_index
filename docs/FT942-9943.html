			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US-Japan business chiefs in trade talks - Private group seeks to break impasse US and Japanese business leaders, frustrated by the lack of progress in the two countries' trade talks, are taking it upon themselves to try to break the impasse. The Japan-US Business Council, a private sector group representing leading businesses in the two countries, is planning to put together its own proposals on how access to Japan's market can be measured and increased. They will also consider how the country's perenially high trade surplus can be reduced to more internationally acceptable levels. Mr Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-US Business Council and chairman of Fuji Xerox, the office equipment maker, said yesterday he expected that the compilation of a list of ways to measure market access would be a prime candidate for a special task force expected to be set up by the council in July. Mr Kobayashi, who was highly critical of the Japanese government's resistance to US proposals on measuring market access, said foreign access to Japanese markets should be evaluated by 'objective criteria' which would not need to be a specific number of sales or market share figures. 'If the private sector can really use this process to monitor what is happening we can really do much better than the governments,' Mr Kobayashi said. Deregulation was 50 per cent a private sector issue. 'During the past few months (the private sector has) managed to discuss very delicate issues such as insurance and auto parts,' he said. Business people have also started to express more loudly their own views and 'of the need to change gear in order to be more productive.' The precarious state of the Japanese government also calls for the private sector to step in, Mr Kobayashi indicated. The government is aware of the short time left before the Naples G7 summit at which the two sides were supposed to reach some agreement on the stalled framework trade talks and has begun its own lobbying to resume negotiations with the US.</p>

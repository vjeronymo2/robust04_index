			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / US cancels development loan debt The US Treasury said yesterday it was cancelling some development loan debts to Argentina and Jamaica as part of President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. Jamaica's foreign aid debt to the US was slashed by 70 per cent to about Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m), and Argentina's by 10 per cent to Dollars 34.3m. Both governments are expected to enter into special 'Americas Framework Agreements' with the US which would donate interest payments on the remaining debt to local environmental groups and child development projects. The payments would be in local currency. The plan is expected to generate about Dollars 3.1m for projects in Argentina over 15 years and Dollars 12.3m for Jamaica over 20 years.</p>

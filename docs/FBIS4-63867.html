			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Banting] </F>   [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Tajikistan and Uzbekistan  will be visited this week by U.N. Assistant Secretary-General  Marrack Goulding. He will hold talks with the prime ministers  of the two republics, will hand over to the Tajik Government a  message from the U.N. secretary-general. This news was  furnished to ITAR-TASS by Marrack Goulding, who is now attending  a U.N. conference on disarmament here.    Goulding bluntly refused to disclose the contents of Butrus  Ghali's message, but noted that it was devoted to the political  situation in Tajikistan and to the settlement of the existing  differences between the Tajik Government and the opposition.  Goulding's visit to Tajikistan will take place on the eve of the  multilateral consultations on the situation in that republic,  which are expected to begin on June 4.    Goulding spoke highly about Russia's efforts to settle the  conflict in Tajikistan. "Moscow is rendering the most vigorous  support to the U.N. efforts to achieve a settlement in that  republic," he stated.    The U.N. assistant secretary-general ruled out the  possibility of U.N. peace-making forces being sent to the  republics of the former USSR. "We regard the achievement of  political concord between the conflcting groups as an  indispensable precondition for this," he stated. "But there is  no such precondition in any of the republics, including Georgia,  which urges us to send our troops to Abkhazia. Therefore,"  Goulding pointed out, "we welcome Russia's full-scale  participation in the settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts in the  former USSR, and we believe it is very important to ensure close  cooperation between the United Nations and Moscow in this  effort."    Chief of the analysis and forecasts department of the  Russian  Foreign Ministry Ednan Agayev, who is attending the U.N.  conference in Hiroshima, told ITAR-TASS that he welcomed  Goulding's visit to Tajikistan. He expressed the hope that this  would contribute to more active U.N. participation in the effort  to settle the conflict in that republic. "Unfortunately, the  U.N. still does not display any readiness to assume a greater  share of the responsibility for this effort. It is adhering to  a passive stand," he noted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The Army has  accused the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) of  being responsible for dynamiting electricity high-tension pylons  and for placing bombs in commercial establishments, resulting in  at least three people being wounded during the past hours.    The Information and Press Department of the Army (Dide) has  stated the URNG has caused the wave of terrorist attacks taking  place throughout the country on the eve of the 30 January  referendum to reform the country's Constitution.    "With these criminal actions, the URNG is endangering the  people's personal safety, destroying the country's  infrastructure, and causing countless industrial damages," the  Army has stated.    According to the Dide, the guerrillas are seeking to  intimidate the people to prevent them from participating in the  referendum, because the URNG opposes Guatemalans expressing  their desire to vote.    The Armed Forces communique also states the URNG is seeking  to imply that they are still active and give the international  appearance that Guatemala is undergoing a reign of violence.    According to National Institute of Electrification (Inde)  sources, losses resulting from the dynamite attacks surpass 2  million quetzals (approximately $340,000).    The Army has implemented operations and is maintaining  security measures along bridges and electricity high-tension  pylons to prevent further attacks, Dide Spokesperson Major Edith  Vargas has said.    The referendum scheduled to take place tomorrow aims to  ensure the approval of reforms to 48 articles of the  Constitution, such as rescheduling parliamentary elections for  an earlier date, changing the Supreme Court of Justice, and  shortening the presidential term from five to four years.    Guatemala is the only Central American country where  guerrilla activity, which began in 1960, still persists.</p>

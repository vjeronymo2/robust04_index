People across the province have overcome  difficulties and promoted overall economic and social  development by further emancipating their minds, seeking truth  from facts, seizing opportunities, earnestly carrying out  reforms, and working in a down-to-earth manner. We have  stabilized and strengthened agricultural foundation and promoted  rural reform. We have accelerated the change of enterprises'  management mechanisms, readjusted the economic structure,  improved the construction of infrastructure projects, strived to  broaden the scopes and fields of the drive to open to the  outside world, and improved the structure and level of export-  oriented economy. In light of new problems cropping up during  the course of rapid economic development, we have followed the  requirements of the central authorities to strengthen and  improve macro-economic control. In addition, we have paid  attention to the drive of deepening reform and opening wider to  the outside world so as to gradually solve outstanding  contradictions and problems in our economic life. As a result,  Zhejiang has maintained a good momentum in sustained, rapid, and  sound economic development. According to initial statistics,  Zhejiang's gross provincial product reached 164.5 billion yuan  in 1993, an increase of 25 percent over 1992. We have adhered  to the principle of attaching equal importance to both spiritual  and material civilization construction. We have formulated a  provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization  construction. We have actively explored ways to build our  party. We have conducted new elections for local people's  congresses at provincial, city (prefecture), county, and village  (township) levels. We have strengthened the style of thinking  and work among our leadership and the construction of  grass-roots party units. We are carrying out the current task  of the anticorruption struggle in accordance with the plan of  the central authorities and have achieved some initial results.  The construction of a socialist democratic legal system has  been strengthened. We have done a great deal to improve all  facets of public security and achieved marked results. Thanks  to common efforts made by the broad masses of cadres and people,  Zhejiang's political and social situation is stable. Our  economy and people's livelihood have been improved. We have  achieved new results in all undertakings. On behalf of the  Provincial CPC Committee, the provincial people's congress  standing committee, provincial government, and provincial  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I would like  to extend my sincere thanks and highest respect to the broad  masses of cadres, personages of all circles, and PLA personnel,  armed police, and public security personnel who have worked hard  on all fronts and made contributions to the drive of socialist  modernization in our province.    Li Zemin said: The year 1994 is crucial for the reform drive  and economic development. This is also a year for  conscientiously carrying out the goal and various tasks put  forward by the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. Our overall  requirements are as follows: We should continue to take Deng  Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the basic line of the party as our guidance, comprehensively  carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress,  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. We should accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economy; maintain a good  momentum for sustained, rapid, and sound economic development;  maintain political stability; and promote overall social  progress. In the new year, all our tasks must be subject to and  serve the general goal of deepening reform, opening up wider to  the outside world, promoting economic development, and  maintaining stability. We should correctly handle the  relationship between reform and economic development and  stability. We should insist that development is the last word.  We should promote economic development by depending on reforms  and push forward reforms and economic development in an  environment in which the economic, social, and political  situations are stable. We should achieve long-term stability by  conducting reforms and economic development. We should focus on  economic development and switch our efforts to the track of  genuinely enhancing economic performance. We should promote  structural readjustment, technical progress, business  management, and overall economic quality among our enterprises  by conducting reform, reorganization, and transformation.  Continued efforts should be made to give priority to increasing  agricultural production and deepening rural reform so as to  promote an overall economic development in rural areas. We  should try every possible way to ensure the harvest of grain and  other farm produce and to enhance peasants' incomes.  We should actively and carefully push forward various reforms  in accordance with the requirements of the central authorities,  properly handle the relationship between all sectors, strengthen  and improve macro- economic control, further change the  management mechanisms of enterprises, explore effective ways to  establish modern enterprise systems, attach great importance to  cultivating and developing the market system, do a good job in  promoting supplementary reform in social security, and ensure a  fine order for economic operations. More efforts should be made  to open wider to the outside world. We should try to increase  the total amount and the quality level of export products. We  should maintain a good momentum of expanding foreign trade and  utilizing foreign funds. We should adhere to the principle of  paying attention to spiritual and material civilization  construction, conscientiously strengthen the building of the  party, organize cadres and people to study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the decision of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  arm party members and the great masses of cadres and people  across the province with the theory of socialism with Chinese  characteristics. In light of the guiding spirit of the  provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization  construction and the 10th plenary session of the eighth  provincial CPC committee, we should carry out spiritual  civilization construction in a thoroughgoing manner, correctly  handle various social contradictions, improve all facets of  public security, strengthen the construction of socialist  democracy and the legal system, unswervingly conduct the  anticorruption struggle, further improve party work style, build  a clean government, and extend every effort to maintain social  and political stability.    Li Zemin emphatically said: To carry out this year's work  well, we should work harder and persist in the party's  ideological line, characterized by emancipating the mind and  seeking truth from facts; in the party's basic work line of  doing everything for the people; performing all tasks by relying  on the people; and coming from the masses and going to the  masses; and in the integration of the ideological line and the  mass line of the party. In our practical work, we should listen  to the opinions expressed by the people, try to understand their  feelings, care about the problems of the people, truly solve the  problems that have direct bearing on the interests of the  people, show respect for the wishes of the people and their  pioneering spirit, and properly guide and protect their  initiative so as to give it full play. Only by closely relying  on the people can we overcome all difficulties cropping up  during the course of our progress and continuously push forward  the undertakings of reform and national construction.

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Muesli for the masses HAD YOU been able to track down Michael Foxen 20 years ago to his bicycle mending shop in north Africa and told him that today he would be chairman of The Real Food Group with a turnover of Pounds 6m and a staff of 100 he would not have believed you. He would also have had considerable trouble hearing you. Scarlet fever as a child left Foxen with impaired hearing. At 18 he was told that he would almost certainly be deaf by the time he was 25. Foxen had won a scholarship to London University, but he decided to see the world instead. Thanks to warmer climates and a changed diet his hearing did not deteriorate and in 1975 Foxen returned to the cleaner airs of Edinburgh. With his wife, Charlotte Mitchell, Foxen now sits atop an extremely healthy organic and natural health food empire. The empire includes two bustling retail shops in the centre of Edinburgh; a 40,000 sq ft warehouse on the outskirts full to the gunnels with the 5,000 different lines they carry for the shops, national wholesaling; and mail order business and a franchised supermarket chain, specialising in health food, which has 12 outlets in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Foxen opened Real Foods, Natural and Organic Victuallers in a shop so small that no more than three customers were allowed in at one time. But he opened with strong convictions and a customer-friendly approach. He believes passionately that food does not have to be expensive to be good for you and that packaging adds little value but great expense for the consumer. He bought directly and displayed his wares in bulk which meant that the more customers bought, the lower the price. Queues soon formed outside the shop. His timing was excellent. hippies, communes and Old Aged Pensioners formed faithful customers and the mail order side was soon turning over Pounds 1,000 a week including regular despatches to central London (today Real Foods exports to the Falkland Islands, Iceland and Hong Kong). In 1976 Foxen found a second retail site in Broughton Street above which lived Charlotte Mitchell, then at the Scottish Craft Centre. Mitchell had contracted multiple sclerosis and was trying to explore the possibilities of a gluten-free diet. Foxen first advised her on how to expand her diet, then gave her a job. Eventually they married. As the business grew they imported more and more produce directly: black mission figs from California, red lentils from Turkey, pumpkin seeds from China, brown rice from Italy and pasta from Greece and Italy. Their range of mueslis has been consistently the biggest seller and in their Edinburgh warehouse is a mix machine which blends a staggering one tonne of muesli an hour. There have been failures. The very mention of apricot kernel butter from China - considered in the late 1970s to be a cure for cancer - still makes Foxen and Mitchell wince. Their biggest organisational mistake also stemmed from over-enthusiasm. As the business grew they found that it attracted like-minded individuals who were not necessarily the most suitably qualified for the specialised jobs the organisation demanded. Their most effective management decision showed no such weakness: at the very beginning they employed a chartered accountant who, after nine years with Real Foods, has turned restaurateur. For the first ten years profits were consistently ploughed back to allow the business to grow. By the mid-1980s the business had not only established Foxen and Mitchell's livelihoods but had given them different avenues down which to pursue their own particular interests. As a food buyer Mitchell would visit the huge annual French organic food and wine fair, Rouffach, in Alsace. She became fascinated by organic wines, then almost unobtainable in the UK, and with her own staff as a loyal customer base, began to import her own range of organic wines. A throwaway line to a publisher friend over dinner one night led in 1987 to her writing The Organic Wine Guide (Mainstream Publishing). Moving on from wine she approached the Caledonian Brewing Company in Edinburgh to see if they would be interested in producing an organic beer. Originally rebuffed, she was invited back when a new management team took over. The resulting brew, Golden Promise, has transformed the fortunes of the brewery out of the red and into profit. Mitchell is now chairman of the Soil Association, the charity founded in 1946 by Lady Balfour to promote the health of the soil, and consequently, the health of those who live on its produce. Foxen has pursued his own philosophy but operates more in a manner befitting a company chairman. By 1984 he had realised that the large supermarket chains, in taking their produce more and more up market, were losing sight of their original customers - those in the C2, D and E socio-economic classes. Combining his commitment to natural foods with the realisation that it was now much easier to find equally committed individuals to act as franchisees, Foxen launched Scoop-A-Market as a no-frills supermarket operation aimed at supplying good quality foodstuffs at low prices. The concept has been successful for franchisees and for the Real Foods group. The franchise system saved the company from the nightmare of heavy bank borrowings. Having progressed in so many directions the company could evolve in any number of different ways. Foxen believes that the future lies in niche marketing and talks enthusiastically of new opportunities for selling natural and organic foods which he personally would like to pursue. Mitchell, on the other hand, prefers the pleasures of a well-stocked, well managed shop, and would like to find more retail sites and continue to educate the public to the pleasures of food that is good for the body and the soil which produces it.

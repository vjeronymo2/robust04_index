			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] left Beijing for  Pyongyang aboard a (North) Korean airways plane Tuesday [17 May]  afternoon.    The three IAEA experts will conduct additional inspections  of  nuclear laboratories at Yongbyon, 100 km north of Pyongyang, and  check whether nuclear fuel rods have been replaced at the  North's 5-megawatt reactor.    The inspections, coming after a two-month pause, are  important because they will determine whether the dispute over  Pyongyang's nuclear program is referred to the United Nations  Security Council for sanctions, or the United States and North  Korea hold a third round of high-level talks.    Before departing for Pyongyang, the head of the IAEA  inspectors stated that he can say nothing before the actual  inspections, which will begin as soon as possible.    Western sources here said the IAEA experts may differ with  North Korean officials on the scope of the inspections, but such  disagreement will never be so serious as to block the holding of  a third round of high-level talks between Washington and  Pyongyang.    North Korea is likely to employ the two undeclared nuclear  facilities as a final card to be used in negotiations with the  United States and the IAEA. Whether the North accepts  inspections of the two undeclared sites will be the final issue  to be resolved at the negotiations, the sources said.    Meanwhile, the three-man IAEA team will end the first stage  of inspections by this weekend and report the results to agency  headquarters in Vienna. This means a decision on the third  round of high-level dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang  will come next week at the latest.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oslo, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Norwegian Acting Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal held talks here  on Wednesday [12 May] night with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), on further developing the  mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.    Li, who arrived here on Tuesday for a five-day visit to  Norway, spoke highly of the cooperation between Norway and China  after they established diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago.    He said that many new changes emerging after the Cold War  have created favorable conditions for international cooperation  and development.    He said, however, regional conflicts are increasing in the  world and economic situation in many countries is worsening.  Thus, preservation of world peace and promotion of economic  development remain the two primary tasks for the international  community.    Li stressed that China pursues a foreign policy of  independence and peace and wishes to develop friendly relations  with all countries in the world.    He added that all nations, small or big, weak or strong,  poor  or rich, have the right to equally participate in international  affairs.    Li said that Western Europe plays an important role in  international politics and economy, and China shares common  views with it on many important international issues.    He said China would like to develop cooperation with the  west  including Norway on the basis of mutual respect,  non-interference with each other's internal affairs, equality  and mutual benefit.    Godal said that East Asia, which has been experiencing a  fast  economic growth, is playing a more and more important role in  international affairs and China is an active stable factor there.    He said Sino-Norwegian relations have developed rapidly in  recent years and his government wishes China more successes in  its reforms.    He added that China's reform will benefit the world economy  and the trade and economic cooperation between Norway and China.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SURVIVOR;  </P> <P> TED KENNEDY WEATHERS FALL FROM GRACE IN THE '80S TO BECOME A FORCE IN THE  SENATE  </P> <P> At 3:27 p.m. on Nov. 6, the senior senator from Massachusetts enters the Senate  and strides down the aisle, thick frame filling his double-breasted suit. The  chamber is vacant but for a few tourists and the pantheon of marble busts --  John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr -- in their honored niches above the  gallery.  </P> <P> For a moment, the senator slumps in a chair, studying a black briefing book on  HR 2710, a bill to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 1981.  </P> <P> He steps to the podium, 99 vacant desks behind him. Holding the notebook at  arm's length, he recounts the compromise that congressional Democrats have  fashioned with the White House Republicans. When deviating from the text, he  stammers a bit. Hand gestures -- little chops and stabs -- substitute for  oratorical pizazz. He drones. The gallery shrinks.  </P> <P> But then the senator begins to describe the explosive growth in salaries for  industry executives who have resisted better pay for their minimum wage  workers, fat cats pulling in high six figures while opposing a six-bit raise.  </P> <P> His voice rises, spiking the chamber with outrage and sarcasm. He is bellowing,  to no one, but with the same vigor as if it were August, 1980, and Madison  Square Garden were again crammed to the rafters.  </P> <P> Having spoken his mind, he wheels up the aisle and exits through the double  doors.  </P> <P> To his innumerable critics, the image of Edward Moore Kennedy declaiming to a  phantom audience is an apt metaphor for his long fall from grace.  </P> <P> Kennedy began the 1980s with a sound thrashing at the hands of former President  Jimmy Carter; his marriage ended in divorce, while tales of boozing and  womanizing continued unabated; for six years he languished in the minority  after Republicans captured the Senate; the decade was dominated by his  ideological antithesis, former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> He personifies liberalism for a generation. But in 1990s America, that is a  backhanded compliment at best.  </P> <P> "After all is said and done," says Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater, "Ted  Kennedy is still the man in American politics Republicans love to hate."  </P> <P> At least some of the blame for liberalism's decline may be laid at his door,  and he has been unable to articulate a compelling vision of America's future  acceptable to a majority of the Democratic Party, much less the American  electorate. Ruled by his passions, for good and ill, he will forever draw  resentment from those who believe he squandered his chance to leave a larger  imprint on society.  </P> <P> This image of liberal impotence, however, can be misleading. For as the 1990s  begin, Ted Kennedy sits in the catbird seat on Capitol Hill. He will not be  President, and seems to know that. Instead, he has channeled his energy and  ambition into the Senate, a small, clubby hive of barons that perfectly suits  his talents.  </P> <P> Now fifth in seniority in the upper chamber, he has built a kind of shadow  government as chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and head of  Judiciary and Armed Services subcommittees. Through serendipity and political  acumen, he is positioned to dominate the domestic agenda for the rest of this  century.  </P> <P> Even Kennedy's political adversaries acknowledge that his fingerprints may be  found on much of the significant social legislation of the past  quarter-century: voting rights, immigration reform, occupational safety, fair  housing, consumer protection, and on and on.  </P> <P> In the 100th Congress, he shoved 39 bills through his committee and into law,  including a big AIDS package and restrictions on the use of lie detectors in  the workplace. Of nine Democratic objectives in the Senate for this second  session of the 101st Congress, five will be routed through Kennedy's Labor  Committee.  </P> <P> "He's becoming the statesman that we all hoped he would be," says Sen. Orrin  Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on Labor. "Whether you agree with him or  not, he's become one of the all-time great senators."  </P> <P> Yet, as ever, he remains a figure of controversy and complexity -- diligent,  shrewd, loud, funny, indiscreet, generous, bibulous, moody, tenacious. An  extroverted raconteur with a million friends, he can be his own worst enemy.  His vices are well-catalogued, most recently in a Gentlemen's Quarterly article  that portrayed him as an alcoholic libertine "who grew to manhood without  learning to be an adult."  </P> <P> Steadfastly consistent in his political catechism, he is nevertheless a study  in paradox: a peerless orator afflicted with bouts of baffling incoherence and  blurry political vision; a droll, self-deprecating wit who can be foul-tempered  and impatient; a champion of righteous causes whose personal morals are  perpetually under fire; a compassionate advocate for the better angels of our  nature, capable, in the phrase of one admiring former aide, of "calculated  demagoguery"; an implacable foe of Reaganism and Reaganomics who openly admires  Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> He embodies a peculiarly American archetype -- the Good Bad Boy -- who  perseveres, with charm, despite life's vicissitudes and his own defects. Driven  by dreams of a better future, he refers frequently to the past and his fallen  brothers -- often to good political effect, but without seeming manipulative,  perhaps because so much of his personal memory is our public memory.  </P> <P> "Don't you think," says former Kennedy press secretary Bob Shrum, "that the  country has a very complicated set of feelings about him and his family?"  </P> <P> The most public of politicians, Ted Kennedy is also one of the most difficult  to know. Several months of Kennedy-watching leave a curious thatchwork of  impressions.  </P> <P> Accustomed to dominating any room he enters, he can be overbearing and caustic  -- "that snitty tone," one acquaintance calls it -- if the limelight focuses  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Intensely competitive, he loves to wager, not as a compulsive gambler but  rather as someone who enjoys being right.  </P> <P> He is neither erudite nor particularly analytical, except when it comes to  politics.  </P> <P> He also is impulsive: During a trip to Sparta, Ga., in December, he abruptly  deviated from the schedule to tromp through a marshy field and inspect the wood  filigree on an old barn that was for sale. "It's only $7,500," he muttered  aloud, "but where would I put it?"  </P> <P> In late February, during a dinner in Washington for Vaclav Havel, Kennedy  decided the new Czech president must visit the Lincoln Memorial -- and off they  went, late at night.  </P> <P> "If you want to find Ted Kennedy," says Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.),  echoing a similar line about Franklin D. Roosevelt, "listen for the laughter."  </P> <P> Robust humor is both salient in Kennedy's character and a secret to his  political success. He is a gifted mimic, whether imitating Italian ward heelers  in New England or his grandfather's singsong Boston brogue. He often lampoons  himself, particularly his girth.  </P> <P> His puckish streak plays well on the Hill, where humor can heal even the most  jagged political wounds.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Kennedy and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) fell into a heated  Labor Committee argument over additional federal aid to education. After  several barbed exchanges, Kennedy cut off the discussion and gaveled the  session to a close. But as the two senators left the room for a meeting of the  Judiciary Committee, Kennedy threw an arm around his colleague's shoulder.  "C'mon, Strom," he urged, "let's go upstairs and I'll give you a few judges."  </P> <P> The flip side of good humor is bad humor, particularly if Kennedy's patience is  taxed.  </P> <P> In Geneva, Switzerland, several years ago, he threw a bitter tantrum when a  snafu caused a girlfriend to show up at the wrong airport terminal. Last  November, as Congress careened toward a recess, he apologized for his office  petulance by sending flowers to his secretaries -- with a note signed, "From  Grumpy."  </P> <P> Even the ritualized courtesies of the Senate melt away when he blows a fuse.  Kennedy erupted during a small, private meeting about a drug bill in the vice  president's office in the Capitol. When Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) persistently  questioned a Kennedy amendment regarding the death penalty -- a provision that  Senate leaders already had agreed could come to a floor vote -- Kennedy  exploded: "I even opposed the death penalty for the man who killed my brother!"  </P> <P> In recent years, Kennedy has found it easier to make public reference to the  tragedies that stain his life. But sometimes the scar tissue rips away.  </P> <P> In November, 1983, the night before a memorial Mass at Holy Trinity Church in  Georgetown marking the 20th anniversary of John Kennedy's assassination, he  stopped abruptly while rehearsing his remarks and stalked in sorrow and anger  down the aisle and out of the church.  </P> <P> In 1986, at a House luncheon celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Peace  Corps, Kennedy again faltered during his speech. Waving a hand in front of his  face as though trying to claw away the pain, he turned, left the podium and  walked back to his Senate office alone, several staff members trailing at a  respectful distance.  </P> <P> The overriding impression Kennedy leaves is of a man consigned to perpetual  motion. Involuntary idleness -- waiting for a late plane, getting stuck in  traffic -- often makes him furious.  </P> <P> "He's like a shark -- not in the negative sense, but rather in the fact that  he's got to keep moving all the time. That's part of Ted Kennedy's metabolism,"  says Thomas M. Susman, who spent 11 years on the Judiciary staff.  </P> <P> "Why is he so driven?" another former Judiciary staffer asks. "Because when  you've got a legacy like his, you're one step ahead of the shadows. He's  competing with myths." Less generous and more prosaic is the explanation of  another aide who sees occasional glimpses of "a spoiled rich kid . . . who's  never had to wait in line for anything."  </P> <P> He ardently believes in the urgency of his causes, in pushing for a society  that is fair, just, humane. As the sole male survivor in a family obsessed with  public achievement, he is constantly confronted with the unfinished agenda --  and legendary stature -- of his brothers.  </P> <P> And were he to stop "moving all the time," in Susman's phrase, who would Ted  Kennedy be? Perhaps just another rich playboy, a clutch of appetites and  indulgences, a nobody. As one of his closest friends observes, "This is a man  who's not asking many questions about life; he's just doing it."  </P> <P> "My babies," Rose Kennedy once said, "were rocked to political lullabies."  Clearly, Ted Kennedy remembers the lyrics.  </P> <P> When referring to himself professionally, he almost invariably uses the word  "politician, and on political terrain he is as sure-footed as anyone on Capitol  Hill.  </P> <P> In the cloakroom or on the floor, Kennedy shuttles between senators, wheedling,  guffawing, importuning and periodically peeking at a note card of colleagues to  lobby and subjects to discuss.  </P> <P> Brother Jack considered his youngest sibling the best politician in the family,  and that may be most evident in Boston.  </P> <P> The Kennedy brand of politics requires a big, sometimes brassy supporting cast.  </P> <P> "Kennedy uses staff people the way Pony Express riders used horses: Ride 'em  hard and then leap to another horse," says Thomas M. Rollins, former staff  director of the Labor Committee. "He's a genius at managing people."  </P> <P> Kennedy's presidential ambitions once attracted bright young Democrats who  envisioned themselves with big offices in the White House West Wing. Today the  rewards must be found in working for a senator able to get things done.  </P> <P> His staff is one of the Senate's largest, with nearly 100 professionals and  several dozen interns and visiting fellows. Universally acclaimed for its  competence, the staff is often suspected of being the driving force behind the  senator's success. In truth, the relationship is symbiotic, an intimate bond of  mutual benefit.  </P> <P> Kennedy's nocturnal ramblings and other personal habits have been the subject  of uncommon public interest since a young woman died in his car beneath the  bridge at Chappaquiddick more than 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Tales of his drinking and raffish behavior have become part of his public  persona, often lumped under a vaster damnation known as "the character issue."  </P> <P> He appears to compartmentalize his off-duty conduct and his Senate  responsibilities. During dozens of interviews for this article, with friends  and foes, not one could cite an instance in which drinking appeared to impair  him professionally.  </P> <P> Yet Kennedy also has a knack for embarrassing himself in public. He was: caught  in flagrante delicto with a female luncheon companion on the floor of La  Brasserie restaurant in 1987; photographed last summer atop a comely brunette  on a boat in St. Tropez; observed with Dodd in 1985 as they smashed each  other's autographed pictures in La Colline restaurant on Capitol Hill; involved  in a barroom scuffle last winter at 2 a.m. with a heckler in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Such episodes provide ample ammunition for the senator's political antagonists.  "He has been utterly shameless, brazen and indifferent to what should be his  internal conscience," says Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative  Caucus.  </P> <P> Without question, Kennedy likes to drink. During a two-hour stretch on a  Lufthansa flight from Boston to West Germany in November, he downed two  Scotches, two vodkas, and, with dinner, three glasses of red wine. After three  hours of sleep, he appeared sharp and refreshed upon arriving in Frankfurt,  where he put in a full day. He also is disciplined enough to stop drinking  during his annual winter diet. Last year, for example, he lost 50 pounds in 49  days, imbibing little more than a weight-loss concoction.  </P> <P> But the wine-and-women lifestyle leaves him vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy.  When the nomination of John Tower as Defense secretary turned into a referendum  on extracurricular behavior, no senator kept his head lower than Kennedy -- to  the point that it became a joke on the Senate floor and in the press gallery.  (Kennedy eventually voted against Tower's nomination.)  </P> <P> Kennedy is not enlightening when discussing morality and his private behavior.  He professes to ignore accounts of his drinking and womanizing. His colleagues,  he says, will judge him on the basis of the man they know rather than the man  they read about.  </P> <P> Among human virtues, Kennedy rates loyalty very high. For nearly 30 years, he  has been a faithful standard-bearer for the very young and very old, for  immigrants and refugees, for blacks and American Indians and blue-collar  workers. For the most part, these constituencies have repaid the allegiance. An  Ebony poll in 1988 found that the magazine's black readers trusted Kennedy more  than any other white American.  </P> <P> Kennedy sees himself now as more tolerant, patient, pragmatic -- "finally  hitting my stride." In recent years, he has elevated his native gift for  getting along with older men into a potent knack for coalition building.  </P> <P> He and Hatch, hardly organized labor's best friend, joined forces to overcome  White House opposition in 1988 and pass into law a bill that prohibits most  employers from using polygraph tests on workers or job applicants.  </P> <P> Last summer, Kennedy spent hours meeting with White House Chief of Staff John  Sununu, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Senate Republicans to reach a compromise  on the Americans With Disabilities Act, prohibiting discrimination against 43  million Americans with physical or mental handicaps.  </P> <P> Perhaps Kennedy's greatest asset in the Senate is persistence. In the late  1970s, he labored to fashion an 880-page bill that restructured the U.S.  criminal code, only to see the proposal die in the House. Six years later, he  finally succeeded in finessing many of the provisions into law.  </P> <P> But on other issues, the jury is still out. In the 1980s, Kennedy tried to  modify the liberal agenda by shifting costs away from the federal Treasury to  businesses. His most ambitious effort in this vein involves mandatory,  employer-financed health insurance, a proposal that thus far -- to Kennedy's  great frustration -- has failed to muster sufficient political support.  </P> <P> Less clear is Kennedy's larger message about the nation's future. Kennedy  speaks of "convincing the people that you want to be able to do more with  less," of discovering "ways that we can still stay committed to these  fundamental values, but do it in different ways."  </P> <P> When asked how Democrats can "move beyond the New Deal, the New Frontier, and  the Great Society," as he says they must, Kennedy replies, "We ought to be in a  more important and dramatic way focusing on the minimum standards of decency in  terms of the quality of life for working men and women."  </P> <P> That's the ideology Democrats are going to ride to the White House? he is  asked.  </P> <P> Kennedy shrugs and replies, "There are some that would agree and some that  would differ."  </P></p>

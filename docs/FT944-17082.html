			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (13): The customer is in the driving seat - Christopher Price explains how the car rental price war plays into travellers' hands Business travellers are firmly in the driving seat. A price war in the recession-hit car rental industry has been further compounded by an intensifying of competition with the entry of new operators. The result has been falling rates to historic relative lows as more companies have chased fewer customers. Most of the discounting has been felt at the leisure end of the market, with some rental companies operating at a loss in order to retain market share. But, increasingly, business users - who comprise 60 per cent of the total rental market - are benefiting. 'As contracts come up for renewal, businesses are increasingly reading about the price war in the car rental market and want a share of it,' says the managing director of one big rental group. 'We are having to respond.' A survey by the Association for Car Rental Industry Systems Standards (Acriss) of the big five European car rental markets - the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Italy - showed a decline in real terms last year by nearly 10 per cent to Dollars 3.86bn. Volumes fell 5.9 per cent. Germany was the worst hit, its rental market value declining 14.5 per cent between 1992 to 1993 to Dollars 1.9bn. Spain slid 6.6 per cent to Dollars 282.3m, while the UK managed a rise of 2.4 per cent to Pounds 806.1m. Germany, which accounts for 49 per cent of the market share of the five countries, is traditionally the largest car rental market. This is due to the legal requirement that, when a vehicle is damaged in an accident, a replacement car must be provided. At the same time, the dominance of the 'big five' operators - Europcar, Avis, Budget, Hertz and Eurodollar - is increasingly been challenged by Alamo, the big US rental group, which is striving to become a Europe-wide operator, and the rapid growth of rental brokers, such as Holiday Autos and Suncars. Brokers, which match renters with hirers and, because they do not own fleets themselves, do not have the high start-up costs of operators, increased rental days sold by 26.4 per cent last year. In the leisure market, the brokers have significantly undercut established short-period car hire rates and the vicious price war in the holiday market has been widely laid at their door. Their large-scale entry into the business market is seen as only a matter of time. The big rental groups are also under pressure from the manufacturers, particularly in the US, which have had to re-evaluate their positions during the recession. Many of the rental groups have special relationships with the big producers involving fleet discounts and maintenance. Overtures from Japanese manufacturers are expected to be listened to with increasing interest. Such has been the decline in hire rates in the UK that Acriss says it is now as cheap to rent a new car as to buy. According to the association, 'one can now rent a car every weekend of the year and also for a two-week period in the summer for a combined cost of less than the annual ownership cost of Pounds 5,188.' The latter is the Automobile Association figure. Of the major European cities, London is the fourth cheapest, according to a survey by Visa. The daily rate for a mid-range car was Pounds 56.50. Amsterdam was the cheapest at Pounds 47.70. Brussels was the most expensive at Pounds 132.40. Frankfurt came in at the equivalent of Pounds 50.97, Milan at Pounds 92.28, Barcelona at Pounds 63.41 and Paris at Pounds 79.78. With margins under pressure, the big players are fighting hard for market share, with the result being that some are operating at a loss. 'A price war may sound like good news for travellers, but in the medium term rates will have to rise if the industry is to invest in the service side of the business,' says Mr Malcolm Packer, managing director at Eurodollar's international operations. 'Some sense of sanity must return to the industry.' He fears that lower revenues will lead to lower quality and deliver less of what business travellers want and need. 'A businessman wants to arrive at his airport in the knowledge that there will be no queues, little paperwork and good onward directions. It all has to be as painless as possible.' The Acriss survey suggests that, with Europe's economy slowly pulling out of recession, the rental market may have bottomed out. Only Germany is forecast to see a further decline in its revenues this year, down 0.25 per cent. Spain is forecast to grow 12.88 per cent, France 4.61 per cent, Italy 4.96 per cent and the UK 3.41 per cent. Market volumes are forecast to grow nearly 7 per cent. Acriss is also forecasting a growing presence for the computer reservation systems (CRS) being increasingly used by airlines, hotels and car rental companies. Their growth is likely to underpin any recovery in the fortunes of the major rental groups, which are tied into the main CRS systems - Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan. Last year, they received over 20 per cent of their business through the CRS system. The number of CRS terminals grew by 1 per cent last year to 54,348, according to Acriss.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CAR RENTAL CUSTOMER DEMAND*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Proportion of rentals (%)           Rental demand  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country        Domestic          Foreign        High           Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France           80.3              19.7         June       January Germany          87.0              13.0      October       January Italy            70.9              29.1      October        August Spain            55.2              44.8       August      December UK               87.0              13.0         July      February  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *As measured by the big car rental companies: Avis, Budget, EuroDollar, Europcar Interrent &amp; Hertz  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ecrire  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Representatives of the front arrived at the Independent  Electoral Commission's offices in Johannesburg shortly before  4.30pm on Wednesday [9 March] to submit its candidate list.    The front was registered by its leader Gen Constand Viljoen  as a strategic option for the Afrikaner Volkfront [AVF,  Afrikaner National Front] to obtain its "volkstaat" [homeland].    The front's representatives included Conservative Party MP  Joseph Chiole.    The Freedom Front's decision took its Afrikaner Volksfront  allies by surpise. AVF spokesman Steven Maninger said the  decision would have an effect on the volksfront, but there was  no difference between participants and non-participants in the  elections on the viability of a volkstaat.    "They (the Freedom Front) also have the interests of the  Afrikaner at heart," Mr Maninger said.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;  </P> <P> TO REJECT BUDGET PLAN  </P> <P> By a vote of 179 to 254, the House rejected the fiscal plan forged by President  Bush and congressional leaders to cut deficit spending by $500 billion over  five years through tax hikes and spending restraint. Republicans voted 71 for  and 105 against and Democrats 108 to 149, sending government leaders in search  of more politically acceptable fiscal solutions.  </P> <P> The measure sought to raise the Medicare payroll tax as well as taxes on  tobacco, alcoholic beverages, gasoline, luxury items, plane tickets and other  items, and to curb or cut spending in the defense budget, Medicare, farm  subsidies, civil service retirement and scores of other federal programs.  </P> <P> Conservatives directed much of their criticism at the tax increases, while  liberals said the plan favored the wealthy at the expense of people in poverty  and on fixed incomes. Moderates also found much in it they disliked.  </P> <P> A yes vote was to side with the President and bipartisan Capitol Hill  leadership and support the deficit-reduction plan.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Nay  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> To Back the President  </P> <P> By a vote of 380 to 39, the House approved a resolution (HJ Res 658) endorsing  President Bush's military and diplomatic response to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.  Although far outnumbered by backers of the President, critics argued that both  he and Congress have disregarded the War Powers Act.  </P> <P> That post-Vietnam law requires Capitol Hill approval, within 60 days of  deployment, of military actions in which combat appears imminent. The troops  are to be brought home if Congress fails to provide a green light.  </P> <P> A yes vote endorsed Bush's policies against Iraq.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Yea  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> To Accept More Immigrants  </P> <P> By a vote of 231 to 192, the House passed a bill (HR 4300) increasing from  540,000 to at least 775,000 the number of legal immigrants the United States  will let in each year. This sent the bill to conference with a Senate bill  raising the ceiling to 630,000.  </P> <P> The bill is most favorable to foreigners with needed job skills, more than  tripling the cap on employment-based visas. Most of the bill's other new slots  would go to foreigners with family members in the United States and immigrants  from European and African countries that in recent decades have had  comparatively low quotas.  </P> <P> A yes vote was to pass the bill.  </P> <P> How They Voted  </P> <P> Rep. Moorhead (R): Nay  </P> <P> Rep. Roybal (D): Yea  </P> <P> Rep. Waxman (D): Yea  </P></p>

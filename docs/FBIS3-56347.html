"The Presidents announced that they would direct the  detargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective  commands so that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles  will not be targeted", according to the Moscow Declaration  signed by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on Friday.    "Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century --  virtualy since the dawn of the nuclear age -- the United States  and Russia will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a  manner that presumes they are adversaries", according to the  document.    The Presidents also urged to end nuclear tests and observe  the nuclear and other non-proliferation regimes.    They "strongly supported completion of negotiations on a  comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time" and  "expressed concern over increasing challenges to global  non-proliferation regimes", the declaration said.    The Presidents "agreed upon the need to strengthen those  regimes and... to create a new mechanism to enhance  transparency and responsibility in the transfer of conventional  arms and sensitive dual use technologies", according to the  document.</p>

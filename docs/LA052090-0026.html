			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON DEFENSE;  </P> <P> ON NAVAL WEAPONS, THE SOVIETS HAVE A POINT;  </P> <P> WITH BOTH SIDES SEEKING DEEP CUTS, WE SHOULD PUT ELIMINATION OF SEA-LAUNCHED  CRUISE MISSILES HIGH ON THE LIST.  </P> <P> Amid predictable last-minute wrangling over the arms treaty that President Bush  and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev hope to sign next month, the Soviets  have renewed their demand to limit a breed of especially destabilizing naval  weapons.  </P> <P> In this case, the Soviets are pushing for something that would help our  security. Oddly, we are refusing to talk about it. The United States should  concede the point and agree to binding limits on nuclear sea-launched cruise  missiles, or SLCMs.  </P> <P> SLCMs fly low, cool and quiet, making them hard to detect. They are meant to be  accurate to within 50 feet. Fired from ships close in, they would reach land  targets on short notice. They are thus able to penetrate and strike reliably.  </P> <P> They are also destabilizing, nearly impossible to verify in peacetime -- and  useless. Destabilizing, because they threaten a first strike from us and so  risk a preemptive strike from the other side. Hard to verify, because virtually  identical non-nuclear missiles could be distinguished from them only by highly  intrusive and unreliable means. Useless, because they merely add to an already  excessive number of nuclear weapons at a time when United States and the Soviet  Union alike seek deep cuts in strategic arsenals.  </P> <P> America plans to deploy 758 nuclear SLCMs on 200 vessels. These are nulear  war-fighting weapons at a time when it is absurd to contemplate fighting a  nuclear war. The Navy claims that SLCMs protect our ships by increasing the  number that the Soviets must target in a crisis. In reality, they simply make  more ships into platforms for global menace and thus increase the danger of  atomic war started by subordinates, or by mistake.  </P> <P> The only substantial argument for SLCMs is that we are technically ahead in  developing and deploying them. But the Soviets will catch up in due course, as  they have with other weapons.  </P> <P> Our goal should be to eliminate nuclear SLCMs altogether. Failing that, we  should at least negotiate the minimum possible number and get them off surface  ships where, unlike in submarines, they would act as magnets for a preemptive  or counter attack.  </P> <P> We should take heed of Ambassador Paul Nitze, the architect of the treaty on  intermediate-range nuclear forces, and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both have said in recent months that  they consider a verifiable ban on tactical nuclear warheads at sea to be  important enough for the United States to abandon the Navy's policy of never  identifying its nuclear-armed vessels -- and even to let Soviet inspectors  aboard our most advanced submarines.  </P> <P> Nitze relates that he arrived at that position after learning that Pentagon war  games show our otherwise superior Navy almost never wins once a conventional  battle escalates to nuclear weapons. Naval officers know this, and they don't  want to spend their careers as pawns in a game of deterrence.  </P></p>

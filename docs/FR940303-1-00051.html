			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS is considering proposing a requirement that the protein in boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids have a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent. This value is consistent with nutrition labeling requirements for protein in foods for children older than one but less than four years of age, as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7), which is cross-referenced in its final nutrition regulations (58 CFR 632) in 9 CFR 317.309(b). FSIS believes this value protects the young consumer from inadequate nutrition and from the use of poor quality protein (i.e., protein that does not meet the dietary needs for growth), and in turn, protects people other than young consumers. FSIS is also considering that it is appropriate to assure comparability of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids with poultry that is derived by hand-deboning in terms of the protein contributed to human dietary needs to maintain the quality and integrity of the poultry products supply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is proposing to permit an alternative measurement to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method, which requires a digestibility measurement in addition to an amino acid analysis, to control the cost of monitoring compliance with the protein quality requirement. FSIS is considering proposing that, for the purpose of measuring the protein quality of boneless poultry with 0.6 or less bone solids, an alternative measurement of protein quality would be allowed that is comparable to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. This measure would be based on a comparison between the ``essential amino acid content of boneless poultry'' and ``total amino acids present in boneless poultry.'' Essential amino acid content includes isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine content, and the total amino acids present including isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content. It is being considered that the essential amino acid content would be determined by methods given in the ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS believes that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids found to be in compliance by the proposed amino acid content measurement would have protein of high quality. This belief is supported by the 1982&hyph;83 evaluation of an Expert Work Group that was organized by the Department's Agricultural Research Service, in cooperation with the University of Maryland, to develop recommendations based on available scientific knowledge for consideration in policy decisions regarding the protein quality of meat, poultry, and their products. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``The Protein Nutritional Quality of Meat and Poultry Products: Scientific Basis for Regulation'' is the final report of the expert Working group, with accompanying background papers. C.E. Bodwell, ed., American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 40(3): 671&hyph;742, supplement, September 1984. A copy of the report is available for public inspection in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public should be aware that FSIS continues to have interest in investigations of protein quality which include among their objectives the identification of improved methods for determining protein quality. In evaluating the possible use of alternative approaches to assuring protein quality, FSIS will consider data and other comments submitted by the public. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

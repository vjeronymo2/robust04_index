			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURE GORE  </P> <P> Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wants to be Gore Vidal. Her profile on him screams it  from every pretentious line.  </P> <P> I personally am not an admirer of anyone -- Vidal or Harrison -- whose ego so  obviously exceeds his talent. Vidal's own utterances reveal him for what he is.  Harrison's rhetoric trivializes her own intentions.  </P> <P> I did, however, read to the end of the article, which tells you something about  me.  </P> <P> RACHEL BRYANT DRUTEN, South Pasadena  </P></p>

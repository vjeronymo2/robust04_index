			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of Social </F> Democracy of the Polish Republic, an SLD component, and chief of  the SLD Parliamentary Club, by Ewa Kaszuba; place and date not  given: "I Continue To Be Effective"]    [Excerpts] [Kaszuba] What happened to make the most  effective politician of last year, as you were described, begin  this year with conflict and defeat?    [Kwasniewski] I continue to be effective.    [Kaszuba] By losing to Prime Minister Pawlak?    [Kwasniewski] And what do you think I lost to him?    [Kaszuba] You lost influence over the cabinet, as well as  [former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski.    [Kwasniewski] So you think Pawlak won by letting Borowski  go?    [Kaszuba] No, I do not, but you lost in a double way.    [Kwasniewski] It is not the case that when you have a  coalition arrangement, some can win at the expense of others. A  coalition arrangement is a system of "joint vessels," it is a  concept which is either implemented together, or not.  Borowski's resignation constitutes a weakening of the cabinet  and it is also a bad message being sent to the public, both in  Poland and around the world: In Poland the message is: They  are arguing. The message around the world is: A man whose  economic ideas were beginning to be widely accepted, leaves  under strange circumstances. And that is more of a mistake by  the prime minister--it is he who is in charge of the team--than  it is mine because I made efforts for Borowski to stay. It is  wrong to look at this from the point of who wanted to spite  whom. I do not evaluate my efficiency by looking at disputes  with Pawlak, Walesa, or anybody else. The efficiency, both mine  and the government's, will first of all be measured by [Sejm]  approval of the budget in its current form. That budget is hard  to accept, but it is rational. Secondly, the efficiency will be  measured by the government's presentation over the next few  months of its strategies of action regarding the economy, social  policies, and international affairs. Third of all, that  efficiency will be measured by the world's acceptance of the  unique phenomenon of a Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant  Party [SLD-PSL] cabinet. And fourth of all, it will be measured  by the coalition's consistent behavior, one which would not mean  wasting time on fruitless disputes. If these things happen,  over the coming weeks or months, then it will turn out I am  effective. And it does not make sense to speak in terms of who  won over whom. I said from the very beginning that there is no  formula of a prime minister without portfolio--one makes  decisions and bears responsibility, while the other is the chief  of the parliamentary faction. That is why reports on my  political death are premature, just as reports about my enormous  power and influence were unjustified.    [Kaszuba] You have accused the prime minister of having  breached the coalition agreement. But the agreement is not any  kind of legal document, but a gentlemen's agreement. If there  is someone to commit a breach of such an agreement, then you  simply refuse to speak to that person anymore.    [Kwasniewski] Of course, the Constitution's importance is  superior in that regard, but there are different kinds of  agreements outside of the Constitution's scope, and every one of  these agreements has its own significance. Once we decide to  begin breaching these agreements, then we will be constantly  dealing will courts and attorneys. The coalition agreement is  not a gentlemen's agreement but a very significant document  which constitutes this cabinet's basis. The agreement must be  respected, and if there are problems with implementing any of  its provisions, then there must be a system of early warning,  for negotiating, renegotiating, and so forth.    [Kaszuba] And what if one of the parties commits a breach of  the agreement?    [Kwasniewski] Then a few harsh words must be exchanged, some  principles must be established, and then one must wait and see  what will happen next. Since the situation is new and not  everyone has matured enough to go through it, we must wait and  see what will happen over the next few weeks.    [Kaszuba] Dark clouds have been gathering over SLD for  some time now. Immediately after the coalition conflict, a  conflict with the president began, which came about in a not  very reasonable manner, to put it mildly, also by votes of SLD  Sejm deputies. You are responsible for the SLD Deputies' Club.    [Kwasniewski] I would not speak of dark clouds, even though  some centers of power have initiated measures against the  winners of the most recent elections; that is to say, against  us. I warned my colleagues many times that after the pleasant  part, problems would begin since many groups will not just let  us get away with our victory. This applies to the right wing,  which failed to get into parliament, and to "Solidarity" which  is largely responsible for what happened recently. It would be  hard to rely on special consideration on the part of the  president. There is the parliamentary opposition which, by  definition, cannot favor what we do. And also within PSL  itself, as we can recall from the previous term, the positions  on SLD were diversified: Some did not hesitate to be in contact  with us, whereas some others were looking for support inside the  church or in the right-wing camp. The fact that we are being  attacked today, is nothing strange. But society can quite  clearly see how straightforward the game really is: When  "Solidarity" attacks us during a demonstration but at the same  time they try to act with restraint toward PSL, then that has  political significance. When the president notes that an  overwhelming part of our deputies' club voted against his  initiative, and at the same time he fails to mention that the  PSL Deputies Club was also very predominantly against, then that  is also a kind of game. For some politicians who lost, the main  task is to set SLD aside again, and to achieve that, they divide  the coalition into two parts: Those in PSL with whom they could  possibly talk, and those in SLD who must be rejected. This is  the reaction to our victory, a slightly delayed reaction.    [Kaszuba] You are talking about everyone who dislikes SLD,  whereas I was asking about the president.    [Kwasniewski] I do not hide the fact that it was a mistake  to vote against his initiatives. We did not devote enough time  to the issue during a session of the deputies' club; if it were  not for that, then a motion for submitting [the presidential  initiatives] to the [appropriate Sejm] commission, would have  been approved (even though that would not have to mean the end  of the issue). Both the President's Office and the president  himself were not active enough on that, either.    [Kaszuba] The president admitted that he had not expected  this kind of response from the Sejm deputies, which he called  arrogance.    [Kwasniewski] But on the other hand, he must take into  account that when one reads the provisions suggested by him  relative to a constitutional referendum, it clearly follows from  those provisions that a dissolution of the Sejm and the Senate  is a result not only of a lost referendum but also--and Article  2 provides that--at the point in time when the referendum's  results are announced. True, this could be regarded as a  perverse joke by [presidential aide] Minister Falandysz, but  many a Sejm deputy thought that the net result of the  president's initiative will be that the Sejm's term of office  will terminate at the point when the new constitution is  adopted. In a way, I can sympathize with the position of those  Sejm deputies who thought that. But that does not change the  fact that I accept part of the responsibility. This was not a  fortunate vote--I voted in favor but the opposite view  prevailed. But that is just one side of the coin. The other  side is the escalation of events. The Sejm is being spoken of  in terms of being disavowed, in terms of being unrepresentative.  Some adjectives are being used that we have not heard for a  long time: decommunization, file-checking [lustracja], and  speaking about Stalin, the idol, which I regard as a very poor  joke. The president withdrew his representatives [from the  National Assembly's Constitutional Commission], which in my view  is not permissible under the current legal system. And finally,  a proposal was made--which is completely deprived of any legal  basis--that the president will prepare a constitution somewhere  on the side. It is not possible to do that. But I perceive the  most recent statements coming from the president as a  willingness to alleviate the dispute, and I think it is the  right thing to do. If there is anything I would expect from the  Polish Republic's president, it is that we will be able to act  peacefully in 1994, and that we will regard 1994 as a year of  hard work, not one of conflicts, election campaigns, and  infighting. That would be a beneficial thing for the president,  for the cabinet, for the entire state, and for all of us. I am  proposing that the year be devoted to talks within the  commission and to discussing the Constitution without much  publicity or tension. Both the cabinet and the president would  each do with their own thing. Poland deserves this kind of year  of tranquility. [passage omitted]    [Kaszuba] Looking back at the last four months and also  taking into account SLD's situation today, do you not think it  was a political mistake for you not to be included in the  government?    [Kwasniewski] No, I do not.    [Kaszuba] Do you exclude such a possibility [of joining  the cabinet] now that SLD is having problems finding a deputy  prime minister? Consider the following scenario: You become a  deputy prime minister, Marek Borowski becomes your chief  adviser, while the Finance Ministry is under the control of  someone who performs the role of the Republic's main accountant.    [Kwasniewski] That is not the issue. Not all the problems  which we have to solve, lie within governmental structures.  These problems also have their parliamentary dimension, an  extraparliamentary one, and so forth. Once a decision is made  that the chief of the runner-up party in the elections takes  control of the government, the presence of a leader of the  winning party would be an unnatural thing. That would be a  weird situation. I limited my expectations to parliamentary  actions and to chairing the Social Democracy of the Polish  Republic. That was a completely natural and effective  arrangement, with Borowski's participation.    [Kaszuba] But is it not strange that while a leader of the  winning party remains on the fringes of the government, he tries  to influence it, and he participates in conflicts which he wins  in some cases but loses in others?    [Kwasniewski] I do not win any conflicts; I am just trying  to do my job--that is, to assure support for this cabinet in the  kind of deputies' club where it is not easy to do so. Compared  with other countries, that is not a peculiar situation.    [Kaszuba] Perhaps the reason for that is that you can no  longer leave the deputies' club since none of the members of  parliament, who do not perform state functions, would be able to  tame the club?    [Kwasniewski] No.    [Kaszuba] Despite assurances that the situation both within  and around SLD is quite normal, my perception is that it is  extremely complicated. Perhaps you took too many  responsibilities upon yourself?    [Kwasniewski] I am just party chairman, the chairman of the  deputies' club, and the [Constitutional] Commission chief. How  can one compare that with the responsibilities which Prime  Minister Pawlak fulfills and bears so well--prime minister,  chairman of the faction, and party chairman? That is much more  difficult. You [journalists] have adopted the tactic of  fault-finding. And there is indeed some fault but not where you  are looking for it.    [Kaszuba] What do you mean?    [Kwasniewski] The government is going through its first true  test, that is the budget. Over the next few months, the  government must propose three very major programs which must  gain support from the coalition and from society at large.  These are: A program of economic strategies, a program of  reforms in social policies, and a step-by-step program for  joining the European Union. Some of the work has not progressed  very much and that is the main problem.    [Kaszuba] Are you not afraid of the possible results of the  first test you mentioned? The deputies' club has announced that  voting discipline will be enforced, but the Sejm deputies,  especially those from the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, may  not stand the discipline. If this budget becomes law, SLD can  face serious internal problems, and if it is not, then we all  can face serious problems.    [Kwasniewski] That is why one must choose the lesser  problems. First of all, the budget must be maintained--one must  understand that. I will reject arguments like: We know there  is no money, but the money must be found anyway. Secondly,  there is the political dimension: The deputies' club must  understand that the parliamentary arrangement has established a  coalition which set up the best government it could, and that  government in turn prepared the best budget it could. It is a  duty of this coalition to support a budget prepared by the  coalition's own government. Whoever refuses to understand that,  must draw conclusions. These may be: Either: I was wrong, I  give up my Sejm seat--that would be the most honest  attitude--or: I was wrong but I will wait for the moment, and I  will not take part in the club's proceedings. There is also a  third possible position: Even if I have doubts, I will always  decide in favor of the coalition and the government. Otherwise,  the public will have no idea of what we are up to. These  principles will be adopted prior to the vote and they will be  observed to the full extent. A third issue is that the public  must be told that this is not a budget of dreams but one of  economic realities; strategic programs must also be proposed. I  have been dealing with politics long enough to know that a  government that wants to verify its popularity everyday, must  lose, whereas a government which simply does its job and then  faces elections at the appropriate time--such a government wins.    [Kaszuba] When talking about positions which you expect SLD  Sejm deputies to take during the budget vote, you did not  mention one of them, which may in fact prevail: Namely, that  failure by the Sejm to adopt the budget will mean the Sejm's  dissolution, whereas a majority of deputies in that club have  practically no chance of being reelected for the next term.    [Kwasniewski] That is also a valid argument. It is not the  main one, but it does make some sense nevertheless.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Hirohisa Fujii retained  his post as finance minister determined to get the fiscal 1994  budget enacted and to press ahead with economic reform.    In the cabinet of Morihiro Hosokawa, Fujii championed a  national welfare tax that was later scrapped, while opposing a  proposal to introduce deficit-financing government bonds. The 7  percent welfare tax plan was intended to replace the current 3  percent consumption tax.    The plan met strong opposition from the Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] -- the largest force in the  Hosokawa coalition -- and was dumped the day after Hosokawa  announced it in early February.    As a compromise, the ruling parties agreed to implement  income tax cuts for one year only and financed by deficit bonds.  Further tax reform measures are scheduled before the end of the  year.    On the political front, Fujii faced tough questioning from  the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) over questionable political  donations from a salt wholesalers' association which falls under  the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. Because of this, it  had been expected that Fujii would be replaced.    Other lingering problems for Fujii include prolonged  economic  recession and trade friction with the United States. Fujii  recently said the economy is in a "delicate phase" and expressed  confidence that the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package  coupled with the fiscal 1994 budget will "greatly" help put the  economy on the path to full recovery.    While trying to take fiscal steps to boost domestic demand,  Fujii repeatedly has tried to convince the United States that  Japan intends to enact full-scale tax reform by the end of the  year. The coalition parties are to detail the year-end tax  reform package by June, fulfilling a government pledge in March.    Fujii, 61, won a seat in the lower House of Representatives  last year as a member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. He  defended the lower house seat once as a LDP member after moving  from his twice-elected seat in the upper House of Councillors.    Fujii is known as the right arm of Shinseito strategist  Ichiro Ozawa, with the left arm being International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai.    Born in Tokyo, Fujii served as a career Finance Ministry  bureaucrat after graduating from Tokyo University before  starting his political carrier.</p>

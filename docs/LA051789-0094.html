			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Accused mass-murderer David (Moochie) Welch was ejected from the courtroom as  his trial opened in Oakland on charges of shooting six sleeping people to  death. After warning Welch repeatedly to stop interrupting the proceedings with  objections, Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde ordered bailiffs to remove the  31-year-old defendant to a holding cell where he could watch the trial on  closed-circuit television. Welch is charged with the Dec. 8, 1986, slayings of  his former girlfriend, Dellane Mabrey, 17, who was the mother of his son, and  five others, including two men, a woman and two children, ages 2 and 3.  </P></p>

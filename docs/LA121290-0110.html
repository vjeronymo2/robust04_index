			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR MANY COMPANIES, THE PARTY'S OVER;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: WITH THE DOWNTURN AND THE EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, FIRMS ARE CUTTING  BACK ON THE HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS.  </P> <P> Call it what you want. A slowdown, a downturn or a slump. Even a recession.  </P> <P> Whatever ails America's economy this holiday season, the toll is dismally  clear: massive layoffs, faltering firms, tumbling retail sales, predictions of  even more dire trends.  </P> <P> Obviously, for many companies, especially those connected to the economically  battered construction industry in Orange County and other regions, it is not  business as usual this holiday seasons, a bleakness compounded by the anxieties  stemming from the Persian Gulf confrontation.  </P> <P> Consider one more spinoff trend of this spreading economic malaise: This  season's corporate-hosted employee parties are being cut back drastically by  many major firms. It seems a lot of conspicuous glitz and top-of-the-line  celebrating are on hold.  </P> <P> Some firms have canceled employee parties, except for a few speeches and  thank-you's at brief in-office gatherings, according to local party planners  and caterers. Mostly, though, firms are downscaling the events. These annual  events, usually held at hotels or in company headquarters, are based on tighter  budgets than in the past, planners said.  </P> <P> "A lot of companies are downplaying the scale, being more conservative this  year. It's basic foods now, not imported seafoods. It's disc jockeys or CD  players, not live bands," said party planner Hillary Harris of the Newport  Beach-based catering service, Cuisine/Cuisine Etc.  </P> <P> Added planner Alan Greeley of Golden Truffle Catering in Costa Mesa: "Even if  these firms can afford putting on (big employee) parties, they're still cutting  back. They don't want to appear lavish. It's the image factor."  </P> <P> Apparently, the William Lyon Co. falls into this category. The Newport  Beach-based company, the nation's leader in new home sales, canceled this  year's usual hotel dinner-dance for a simpler in-office buffet.  </P> <P> "We're still doing our annual employee donation drive (for the Orangewood  Children's Home)," explained Lyon Senior Vice President Richard Sherman.  </P> <P> "But when it came to doing a big employee party again, we felt it would not be  the sensible and appropriate thing to do, not now. Not with the (economic)  downturn and what's happening with Iraq."  </P> <P> The image of company parties -- as much a holiday institution for Yuletide  ho-ho-ho as it is for nurturing employee togetherness -- has been changing for  years.  </P> <P> The wilder aspects of the image has been tamed. Party planners maintained that  the old notoriety of hard drinking and high spirits -- the stereotypical,  legendary side of the office party -- is no longer prevalent.  </P> <P> Consumption of alcohol at such parties is far more moderate, a reflection,  planners said, of the anti-drunk-driving campaigns in the past decade.  </P> <P> And many such parties have become more familial, folksy and aimed at charitable  causes. Parties welcoming employees' spouses and children are as common as  parties tied to charitable food and toy drives.  </P> <P> Subdued or not, the larger corporate employee parties stayed at a conspicuous  level of lavishness through the mid-1980s, when the economic mood was one of  prosperity.  </P> <P> It was not unusual for the bigger companies to invite hundreds, or in some  cases more than a thousand guests, to elaborate festivities at hotel ballrooms,  country clubs, banquet halls and mansions. Or gathered on grand yachts or under  vast outdoor tents.  </P> <P> In Orange County, the most dazzling events cost well over a $100,000 apiece,  according to one longtime party planner, Golden Truffle's Greeley. The most  sumptuous settings boasted special themes, such as Dickensian or North Pole  wonderlands. Or Italian gardens, whirling carousels or Caribbean cruise ships.  </P> <P> One of the biggest parties last year was a $60,000 spectacle that party planner  Jan Parrott remembers fondly.  </P> <P> "It had everything -- charm, drama, eye-catching scale," said the Laguna  Beach-based consultant, whose Particular Parrott service handles a clientele  mostly of building industry companies.  </P> <P> Using a sprawling vacant office facility and drawing 500 people, the event came  complete with lighted trees, strolling singers and a rock dance band. The  buffet tables, overflowing with lamb, pasta and other goodies, were framed by  tableau-styled tributes to art masterworks of the Orient, Egypt, Italy and  France.  </P> <P> But the same client -- a builder -- isn't a repeat customer this year, said  Parrott, whose roster of large-scale parties at hotels and offices is down from  19 last year to eight this year -- most of the dropouts being  construction-industry companies.  </P> <P> "Things are pretty grim for a lot of firms out there hit very hard by the  downturn," Parrott said. "They saw the handwriting on the wall earlier this  year. They told me they were cutting the (party) budget or simply bowing out  completely this season."  </P> <P> Although Cuisine/Cuisine Etc.'s Harris said her firm's overall sales are higher  than in 1989, her corporate party business has dropped from 72 clients last  year to 50 this year.  </P> <P> The reasons are not difficult to find.  </P> <P> Announcements of layoffs in Southern California industries, from high-tech and  blue-collar manufacturers to major retailers, have become almost commonplace in  recent months. This fall, more than 10,000 aerospace workers were let go.  </P> <P> But it is Southern California's growing slump in the housing industry that  currently seems the most spectacular. In Orange County alone, new home sales  have plummeted by more than 20%; in home resales, more than 30%. This fall,  more than 1,000 of the county's construction workers were laid off.  </P> <P> Most of the companies that have deserted the usual hotel-and-club circuit are  still holding parties, but at their own offices, Harris and other planners  said. To reduce costs further, some are combining their annual parties for  business clients with their employee celebrations.  </P> <P> Many employee parties are drastically down-priced. According to local  professional party planners, the typical larger bashes, which once cost $50,000  to $75,000 apiece, are now down to $20,000 to $30,000.  </P> <P> "We're talking a recession menu, real basic foods like meat loaf and puddings.  Your Belgian truffles and New Zealand crab are out," said Parrott. "It's more  pass-the-tray munchies, rather than fancy (food) tables."  </P> <P> This new austerity was typified by a recent $3,000 party for about 150 guests  at the private Modern Museum of Art in Santa Ana. It was hosted by Sterling  Special Event Productions, a party planning service, and Bradford &amp; Ivy, a  marketing firm, for business clients.  </P> <P> While there were plenty of sparkling Christmas trees and an Ebenezer Scrooge  capering on the disco floor, planner Darrell Hames cut decor and food costs  with a "beach party" theme -- complete with patio tables and umbrellas and a  main buffet fare of burgers, pizza and fettuccine.  </P> <P> "That's one result of the belt-tightening going on among companies this year.  You have to be more creative in ways to meet the reduced budgets. You have to  find less expensive, more offbeat locations. All this and still have a lot of  fun," Hames, a Santa Ana-based party consultant, said.  </P> <P> Not all companies have abandoned the big employee parties on the regular  hotel-and-banquet hall circuit.  </P> <P> Consider just three Orange County-based companies that held their annual  dinner-dances last Saturday.  </P> <P> The Fieldstone Co., a home builder, brought its 400 guests to the Ritz-Carlton  in Dana Point. Avco Financial Services held its 1,500-guest party at an  exposition building on the Orange County Fairgrounds. And PacTel Cellular's  party for 1,000 was at the Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> Even so, the temper of the times was not forgotten. "Essentially, our party was  still large-scaled because our employee force is still growing," said event  coordinator Danee Miller for the Irvine-based PacTel Cellular.  </P> <P> But, she added, "we decided to cut out some of the extras. It's being aware of  the current mood and how other firms are being affected."  </P> <P> Cutbacks or not, the idea of abandoning the big employee parties would be  unthinkable, planners and others said.  </P> <P> "These parties have always been essential to (employee) morale and recognition.  It has always been our way of saying thank you to our employees," said  Fieldstone's Mary Hendrickson, event coordinator for the Newport  Beach-headquartered company.  </P> <P> Besides, company coordinators and professional party planners asserted, they  are counting on a rebound to the economy.  </P> <P> "Heavens knows, these things are cyclical," said corporate consultant Parrott.  "Next Christmas might be a whole brighter picture again."  </P></p>

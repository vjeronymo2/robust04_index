			<p>BFN     [Text] In joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program,  Kyrgyzstan hopes to receive assistance on the part of NATO  within the scope of the consultations on national security.  Kyrgyzstan also expects NATO to help it to work out a military  doctrine.    Speaking at a press conference in Bishkek today, Kyrgyz  President Askar Akayev commented on the results of his visit to  NATO headquarters. He underlined that within the scope of this  program NATO was ready to assist with drafting projects for  conversion of the Kyrgyz military industry. The parties could  also cooperate on environmental projects.    In particular, Bishkek wishes for NATO to provide practical  aid to overcome natural disasters which are a regular occurrence  in Kyrgyzstan.    Akayev pointed out that although Kyrgyzstan is a small  state,  the general situation in Central Asia and its interests in  stability and security mean that it must have its own army.</p>

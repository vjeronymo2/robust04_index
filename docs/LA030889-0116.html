			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GM Offers New Rebates: In an effort to boost its softening sales, General  Motors began four new incentive programs, offering 4.9% short-term car loans on  some top-selling models, such as the Corsica and Beretta. Analysts said the  rebate programs would likely help improve March sales, which have lagged behind  the strong pace of 1988. Ford and Chrysler also are offering 4.9% financing  rates, but their programs are not as extensive. GM's inventory of unsold cars  at the end of February was estimated at 85 days, while Ford's was 81 days and  Chrysler's 94 days. The industry considers a 65- to 70-day supply of cars  acceptable.  </P></p>

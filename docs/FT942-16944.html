			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: CMB posts 14% decline in profits for year CarnaudMetalbox (CMB), the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent fall in net profits to FFr835m (Dollars 143.22m) for 1993 and expressed caution about prospects for the current year. Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman, described 1993 as a tough year. 'In half of Europe, currency translations reduced our profits by about 10 per cent compared with 1992. In the other half, packaging markets suffered the worst decline in about 20 years. Pricing pressure was severe everywhere,' he said. Mr Hintz added that pressures on prices and volumes resulting from the impact of recession remained severe. As a result, he said, 'we have to remain cautious about projecting any meaningful profit improvement for the year, at this stage'. The group decided, however, to maintain the dividend at FFr4 per share. According to Mr Hintz, the decline in the group's performance in 1993 had been limited by cost-saving measures, restructuring and the benefits of acquisitions. These included Anchor Hocking, a US food packaging group, and food-can companies in Hungary and Finland. In the group's health and beauty division, the group acquired Zeller Plastik, a manufacturer of plastic closures. The acquisitions represented a 4 per cent contribution to last year's sales of FFr24.34bn, a 2 per cent decline on the 1992 figure. Excluding currency effects, sales rose by a similar proportion. The total cost of last year's acquisitions was FFr2.5bn, although the increase in group debts was limited to FFr982m through the disposal of non-strategic businesses and solid cash flow. Operating profits fell by 16 per cent, or by 10 per cent if currency effects are excluded. CarnaudMetalbox said the decline in profits was entirely the result of particular difficulties in the European beverage cans market, weak demand in Germany and specific problems in Asia.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading INTEREST in the derivatives markets was enlivened by heavy buying from a big overseas investor yesterday, the subsequent squeeze sending Footsie futures up sharply, writes Peter John. Overseas investors have been shifting funds into the UK via sterling and government bonds as they look for a safe haven for currencies that also offer a good return. However, if falling interest rates in Europe prompt a cut in the UK, the subsequent fall in bond yields will make the rate of return on the stock market more attractive. The contract on the FT-SE 100 for September delivery shot up to a strong premium to the cash market in the morning and was trading 24 points higher at one stage. This compares with a fair value, the premium that takes into account dividends and carrying costs, of 4 points. The effect of the buying was accentuated by a severe shortage of stock after a week of heavy investing which has pushed the futures and underlying cash market close to record highs in the past week. However, when the overseas buying finished, some of the steam went out of the rally and the spread between futures and cash narrowed. The premium had declined to 15 by the official close, with some 11,000 contracts dealt. The traded options market saw 32,000 lots transacted, with National Power the most actively traded stock option.</p>

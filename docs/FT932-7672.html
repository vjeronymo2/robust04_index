			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Outcry over life sentence for East Timor rebel leader AN Indonesian court yesterday sentenced Mr Xanana Gusmao, the East Timor rebel leader, to life imprisonment, provoking international criticism. Mr Gusmao, leader of the Fretilin movement which has been waging a guerrilla campaign for independence since 1975, was found guilty of separatism, rebellion and illegal possession of arms after a three-month trial. Portuguese President Mario Soares described the sentence as 'hard, violent and illegitimate'. Amnesty International, the human rights group, said Mr Gusmao had suffered a blatantly unfair trial in which he had been ordered to stop after reading two pages of his final 29-page defence plea because the judge said his remarks were 'irrelevant'. Indonesia invaded and annexed the island territory of East Timor after the Portuguese colonial administration withdrew in 1975. Relief organisations believe up to 200,000 East Timorese have died from disease, starvation and in fighting. Indonesian sovereignty is not recognised by the United Nations. International pressure over widespread allegations of human rights abuses in East Timor was stepped up after November 1991 when soldiers fired into a crowd of independence demonstrators. Witnesses said up to 180 people died. Indonesia accuses Mr Gusmao of backing the demonstration, which Jakarta says incited the troops to fire. The life sentence was sought by the prosecution. Judge Hieronymus Godang told the court in Dili, capital of East Timor: 'The reason the punishment is so heavy is that the defendant's actions disturbed stability in East Timor.' Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portuguese prime minister, said the sentence served to undermine the dialogue between the Lisbon and Jakarta governments aimed at reaching an internationally acceptable solution for East Timor. The countries' foreign ministers have been meeting under the auspices of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, to seek confidence-building measures to help reach a solution for East Timor. The next meeting is set for September in New York.</p>

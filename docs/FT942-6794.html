			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / BP fights to end ban on Alaska oil exports: The British company could benefit by Dollars 100m if allowed to sell crude to Japan The battle to lift a 20-year ban on exporting oil from Alaska is about to break out again. The ban was imposed by Congress in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, when the US was loathe to do anything that could increase its dependence on foreign oil. A repeal of the ban would improve revenues for both the state of Alaska and the main oil producers in the state, the biggest of which is British Petroleum. The Export Administration Act, one of four overlapping statutes that implement the ban, is due to expire at the end of June. Senators Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens of Alaska are expected to use the debate to try to persuade Congress to allow North Slope oil, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the US's 6.6m barrels a day oil output, to be shipped to Asia. Preliminary results of an Energy Department study, tend to support an end to the ban. The study reportedly shows a gain of 6,000 jobs in the Alaskan and Californian oil industries, largely by encouraging Californian producers who are now swamped by Alaskan oil. The study also shows an increase in federal royalties and taxes of Dollars 284m, and no significant impact on petrol prices in California. Although lifting the ban is likely to push up west coast crude prices by about Dollars 1 a barrel, officials believe Californian refiners, who enjoy wider margins than elsewhere in the US, would be able to absorb the increased cost. Another factor is the stance of the seafarers' trade union, a traditional supporter of the ban because the Alaskan oil must be carried in US built and flagged ships with US crews if it is shipped to another US state. The union is apparently ready to agree to a deal with BP as long as any exports are carried in US tankers, although they have yet to publicly announce this. BP, unlike Arco and Exxon, the two other major Alaskan producers, has no refinery on the US west coast, so it must either sell to independent refiners in the glutted California market, or face additional pipeline costs through Texas or across Panama to reach Gulf coast refineries. It would like to sell its Alaskan oil to Japan, or at least have that option to strengthen its hand in price negotiations with the Californian buyers. Analysts suggest BP could gain around Dollars 100m a year from the lifting of the ban, through a combination of lower transport costs and higher prices. It costs about Dollars 2 a barrel for BP to ship Alaskan oil to Gulf of Mexico refineries, compared with about Dollars 1.25 a barrel to the US west coast or Asia. Arguments about US energy security, strong when the ban was first imposed, have diminished, and the idea of making a dent in the US trade deficit with Japan remains appealing. BP is also likely to have argued that lifting the ban would encourage it to invest more in expanding Alaskan production. But the ban still has a strong coalition of supporters. Environmentalists were instrumental in the first ban, which was imposed as a quid pro quo in Congress's approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. They fear that allowing exports of North Slope oil could add to pressure to extract oil within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - although some energy officials argue that it might reduce pressure on ANWR by encouraging producers to invest more in existing fields. And although the seafarers appear to have been won over, not all maritime interests are in favour. Shipyards fear that tanker owners might repair their vessels in Asia, while the Maritime Administration of the Transportation Department disputes the analysis of job gains and losses in the Energy Department report. The opposition of independent refiners in California is reinforced by that of two of the principal outlets for the west coast oil surplus: the Trans-Panama pipeline, built to handle oil shipped to refineries along the Gulf coast, but now coping with just a fraction of its former throughput, and the Hess refinery in the US Virgin Islands, which receives about 100,000 barrels a day of North Slope crude. State Department officials have voiced concern at the protectionist implications of enshrining BP's deal with the seafarers union in law, while some Commerce officials are concerned about putting an avoidable hurdle in the way of the renewal of their Export Administration Act. If, however, the Energy Department study emerges more or less intact from the process of inter-agency review, it could lend powerful ammunition to the Alaskan senators in next month's battle.

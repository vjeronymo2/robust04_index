			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak </F> by announcer Jaroslaw Gugala--live]    [Text] [Gugala] We welcome to the studio Mr. Waldemar  Pawlak, chairman of the Council of Ministers.    [Pawlak] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.    [Gugala] Prime minister, you have said that decisions about  the situation in the coalition will depend on what your PSL  [Polish Peasant Party] colleagues would say. Has any decision  like this been made?    [Pawlak] This concerns not only PSL decisions but also  issues  connected with the future course of the economic policy and  future transformations in our country, and I think that today's  OPZZ [National Trade Union Alliance] proceedings show that these  disputes and divisions occur not so much between the parties  that make up the coalition but, rather, along various lines  within the very parliamentary groups that make up the coalition.  And this does not concern aspects of procedural matters; it  concerns fundamental matters. It is a question of how Poland is  going to be reformed from now on.    [Gugala] How is Poland going to be reformed from now on?  Will you accept the resignation of Mr. Marek Borowski, the  deputy prime minister and finance minister?    [Pawlak] Yes. I think that this decision by Mr. Borowski was  made with his full attention, his full consideration and  reflection, and that it how it should be treated.    I think that, at the moment, this dispute concerns not so  much procedural matters as an answer to the question of whether  we are going to proceed in the direction of this straight  forward liberal continuation, or, respecting the election  results, we are going to fashion a prosocial policy, open to the  needs of the economy and also the needs of the society.    And these are the questions asked by the people today  because, when we meet the voters, we do not hear questions about  procedure, about how the government proceeds. We hear questions  about what solutions we are implementing, whether, for instance,  we are changing policy principles, whether we are, for instance,  going toward solutions that stimulate the economy or going  toward solutions that shift benefits, social assistance, toward  the poorest groups. This concerns, for instance, family  benefits and housing benefits, and these are the kind of  solutions that are needed now.    [Gugala] Prime minister, are you not afraid that this  decision by you may bring about a very serious crisis inside the  coalition, that it may make it so that it will be difficult to  pursue any kind of policy whatsoever?    [Pawlak] I think the coalition is based on a jointly greed  program, and here the decision of the SdRP [Social Democracy of  the Polish Republic] Supreme Council also, first and foremost,  points to the programmatic solutions, and I think this is what  we are going to focus on. When we signed these coalition  agreements, we were talking about the tasks facing us and the  people's expectations and not about personalities, and that is  how I want to continue to pursue this issue.    [Gugala] Is it possible to reconcile people's expectations  with too short a blanket, which is what the state finances are?  Marek Borowski, the deputy prime minister and finance minister,  said that one could not conduct a policy separated from economic  realities because it would not yield anything good for the  people; on the contrary, it will cause greater inflation and  trouble for the people.    [Pawlak] We are in agreement here. I think there is no  controversy just here, but the question is whether we adopt a  policy directed only toward simple fiscal mechanisms and simple  mechanisms of distribution or take a direction toward searching  for active forms regarding effects on the economy and active  forms of receiving resources. Sometimes there were paradoxical  situations, where the ministry responsible for revenues voiced  doubts over ideas of different ministers aimed at revenue  increases.    [Gugala] Are you of the opinion that the Finance Ministry  failed in finding greater revenues?    [Pawlak] We are dealing here, first of all, with different  approaches toward the creation of the budget. It cannot be a  formula that we create a convenient budget, which could be  implemented easily and which could be easily balanced, but that  we create a budget that meets social expectations and focuses on  areas of particular importance from the viewpoint of the future.  Here one can give some thought to whether all resources were  used properly. The Sejm commissions, for example, draw attention  to the need for modifications in the budget. We will discuss  that tomorrow, and I think that many proposals by the  commissions can be taken into account as they point to some  sources for redistribution within the budget, for better use of  resources, and they point to income sources, which can  contribute to directing them toward indispensable and useful  goals.    [Gugala] Does it mean that your government will present a  new  draft budget?    [Pawlak] I do not think so. We are responsible for this  government proposal, and I think that not one single person is a  guarantor of the budget. Times have changed. There were times  in the past when personalities or parties guaranteed this or  that political order. Now the majority of the public clearly  supports democracy and a free market, so these guarantees are  not so obvious and necessary here.    This budget is a government proposal, and, as the  government,  we are going to put forward the solutions that are active and  that have received approval from the Sejm commissions.    I think that tomorrow, at the government meeting, we will  be able to talk about the modifications that were discussed in  the Sejm. Some of them will be accepted. There is also a fairly  large batch of proposals that simply have no chance of being  implemented because they have no basis in the present economic  realities.    [Gugala] Quite recently, Deputy Prime Minister Marek  Borowski  was one of our guests, and he said that the budget proposed by  the government was already a very optimistic budget, that there  were many areas there where the amounts assumed as state budget  revenues were in fact wishful thinking. Are you not afraid that  it will simply not be possible to get greater budget revenues?    [Pawlak] I think that, just as we said, both in the election  campaign and in the early months of the government, we have to  focus on actions that strive toward universal collection of  revenues, collection of taxes, collection of duties, and much  attention has to be devoted here to effective operation of these  mechanisms.    We need to pay much attention to the areas on which the  collection of taxes depends--that is, that the whole structure  of the treasury offices, the customs offices, is well equipped  so that the officials who decide about state revenues have  realistic possibilities for receiving the income, and then, in  the future, we can also think about reducing the tax rates once  they are universally paid.    I think it is important to concentrate these modest  resources  on actions of this kind; then we will have no problems as to  whether these views are well grounded, whether this budget is  realistic or highly optimistic. This budget is based on  realities, and, according to our appraisals and our opinions, it  is possible to implement it.    [Gugala] But are you not afraid, Prime Minister, that  tomorrow you will in fact receive no opportunity to talk about  the budget because you will simply have to talk about Marek  Borowski?    [Pawlak] I think we agreed to form the coalition to  implement  economic programs, to improve the economic situation in Poland,  and for this policy to have a human face and be directed both  toward people who are working in factories and enterprises and  toward all those who are jobless at the moment, and not through  allowances and benefits but through creating jobs.    The policy should also be directed toward those who worked  honestly and well and now live on old-age and disability  pensions. We have been going in this direction, and the first  results regarding old-age and disability pensions are visible.    There is still a lot to be done in social and health  insurance. A serious question is how to effectively overcome  unemployment and create jobs. This is a question of large  infrastructure programs--for example, the highway construction  program, the promotion of export, and....    [Gugala, interrupting] We could talk about this for a very  long time. Prime Minister, do you assume that the coalition  still exists, only without Mr. Marek Borowski?    [Pawlak] It is my conviction that the coalition still  exists.  While making decisions, every one of us should carefully  consider the consequences of these decisions, and I think we  have opportunities and possibilities to work for Poland in  different places. I think that the effects of our work are of  the utmost importance. If we are going to act like that, where  we do it is secondary.    [Gugala] When are you going to meet Mr. Aleksander  Kwasniewski?    [Pawlak] We have arranged to hold a coalition meeting  tomorrow [8 February], and I think we will discuss issues there,  what has to be done and how, and not procedural matters.    [Gugala] Thank you for visiting our studio.</p>

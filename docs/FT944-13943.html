			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved lower with turnover slumping to one of its lowest levels of the year, writes Jeffery Brown. At times the market traded at a discount to cash equities but with volume tailing away to little more than a third of Friday's level there was never any real weight of selling. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,030 at the official 4:10 close, down 12 points. At this level there was a one point premium to the cash market while the fair value premium was around 15 points. Traders said the low level of activity - there were 5,523 contracts, against 13,340 on Friday - was a clear reflection of the absence of directional leads. They pointed to the low status of the economic data due this week, and said that a number of the larger traders had decided to stay away for the schools half-term holiday. One trader described both stock index and option volume as 'wickedly low'. Activity in traded options was just 13,951 lots, down from 48,235 lots on Friday. Of this, FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just under 8,000 lots. The most active individual stock option was the Prudential with 757 lots followed by HSBC with 642 lots.</p>

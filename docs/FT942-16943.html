			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Novell appoints Frankenberg president Novell, the leading US computer networking software company, has appointed Mr Robert Frankenberg, a senior Hewlett-Packard executive, as president and chief executive to succeed Mr Raymond Noorda, who is retiring. The appointment puts to rest concerns about management succession at Novell. Mr Noorda, 69, had said last year that he planned to hand over the reins to a new chief executive, but seemed in no hurry. The issue became more pressing last month when Novell announced aggressive expansion plans with the acquisition of WordPerfect, a leading word processing software company, and Borland International's spreadsheet product division. The acquisitions will take Novell into the applications software market and place it head to head with Microsoft, the world's largest software company. Mr Frankenberg, 46, who has spent his 25-year career at Hewlett-Packard, most recently heading the company's personal computer group, is seen as a solid choice to lead Novell. His broad experience in software, information systems and personal computing makes him well suited to the task, analysts said. 'I have worked very closely with Novell over the past four or five years, at HP,' said Mr Frankenberg. 'I am very excited about the merger with WordPerfect. It was pivotal in my decision to join Novell, because it gives us the opportunity to create a new era of network applications and make those the natural way to use computing.' Mr Noorda, who has shaped Novell into one of the largest and most influential companies in the software industry over the past 12 years, said he would remain chairman. With the appointment of Mr Frankenberg, Novell has dissolved its 'office of the president'. The company's senior executives will now report to the new chief executive.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant Grampian TV rises to Pounds 3m GRAMPIAN Television yesterday reported on a year in which it increased profits against the general trend in a recession-hit industry. The Aberdeen-based ITV company lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 3.18m on the back of advertising revenue that rose by nearly 3 per cent in the 12 months to the end of February. In October the company held on to its north of Scotland franchise despite being outbid by two rivals who failed to make it over the quality threshold. As a result Grampian will have to pay the relatively modest sum of Pounds 720,000 a year for its franchise. 'This has been a most remarkable year for Grampian Television,' Sir Douglas Hardie, chairman, said yesterday. The profits increase reflected both the buoyant local economy and the impact of cost cutting, including the reduction in staff from a peak of 329 in 1987 to the present total of 185. Despite the job losses, achieved through greater flexibility and efficiency 'we increased the number of hours and the popularity of our local programming,' said Sir Douglas. Turnover at Pounds 20.4m was little changed from the 1991 figure of Pounds 20.7m. Earnings per share rose from 10.83p to 14.23p and the proposed final dividend of 4.5p raises the total to 5.5p (4.1p). An extraordinary item of Pounds 688,000 represented the cost of applying for a new 10-year licence. The shares advanced 9p to 164p.</p>

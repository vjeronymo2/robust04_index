			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Sony 'killed' album, singer says THE SINGER George Michael yesterday accused Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment company, of attempting to 'kill' his last album as a punishment for his refusal to appear in a promotional video. He told the High Court in London that Sony executives in the US had resisted his attempts to aim his music towards an older market and reduce his appeal to a younger, female audience. He is asking the court to declare his contract with Sony unenforceable because it represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and is in contravention of European Community competition law. The singer agreed with Mr Gordon Pollock QC, Sony's counsel, that the company had never tried to dictate what image he should have. He agreed that he had portrayed himself as a sex symbol in the early part of his career. He said that Mr Pollock had overstated the case when he described one of his early videos as 'soft-core porn' but said the first version had failed to make it past the censors. In a written statement he said he had decided to change his musical direction after the success of his album 'Faith'. He added: 'Although I had worked specifically to achieve the status of an American 'superstar', I found the results slightly overwhelming and felt I was losing control. More frightening to me than anything else was the feeling that I had become distant from people around me, even my closest friends.' He said he decided to appeal to a smaller, older audience in his next album, 'Listen Without Prejudice - Volume I'. He said he told Sony executives in the US that he would not appear in videos made to promote the album. He said the company failed to promote the album adequately in the US. He added: 'I gained the very strong impression that the album had been 'killed' in order to teach me a lesson.' Mr Pollock asked him why he could not appear in the video in such a way as to promote his new image. George Michael said his younger, female audience would view him in the old way, regardless of what he did in the video. He agreed with Mr Pollock that his contract had made him 'extraordinarily wealthy'. Mr Pollock said: 'You have got more money than you know what to do with. True?' George Michael answered: 'True.' Mr Pollock asked what his net worth was. With the agreement of the judge, Mr Justice Parker, George Michael wrote down a figure rather than stating the amount in court.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement of the Press Service of the Ministry of Defense </F> of Ukraine]    [Text] Russia's mass media, and in particular  Interfax and the newspaper Sedognya, have recently  been circulating reports about transports of nuclear warheads  leaving the territory of Ukraine to be handed over to the  Russian side in accordance with the international and legal  commitments assumed by Ukraine. In so doing, they also make  public information that is of a strictly confidential nature,  citing "informed sources in the Ministry of Defense of the  Russian Federation."    The ease with which some journalists, citing Russian  military  sources, are publicizing information about the timetables,  dates, and destinations of the transports of nuclear ammunition  is astonishing; especially as the Russian specialists cannot  help but be aware that such actions create a real threat to the  security of transporting nuclear warheads.    Apparently, certain circles in Russia are interested in  slowing down or even bringing to a total halt the planned  removal of nuclear armaments from the territory of Ukraine.  Obviously, were this to happen, Ukraine would again be accused  of exhibiting a lack of good faith and obstructing the process  of nuclear disarmament.    The Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine  hereby declares that such actions are provocatory and  intolerable, inasmuch as their aim is to turn up the tension  surrounding Ukraine's nuclear disarmament a notch higher.    Ukraine remains faithful to her commitment to remove nuclear  weapons from her territory. The specialists responsible for the  security of these transports are taking all the necessary steps  to safeguard this process from any unexpected eventualities.    At the same time, because of the indiscretion of Russia's  "informed sources," Ukraine is now forced to take additional  steps to alter the exact schedule and routes for transporting  nuclear warheads.</p>

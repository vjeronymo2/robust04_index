			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  Mongolian Parliament at night from 14 to 15 January considered  behind closed doors in the course of 6 hours the findings of the  working group on checking up of the information about  involvement of some state high officials in bribery and abuse of  official powers and postponed continuation of the hearing till  Monday, January 17. At the state Great Hural sitting, which was  held yesterday from 6 PM up to 2 AM today, besides lawmakers  present were the Mongolian president, the head of the  president's administration, the president's adviser on national  security issues, the head of the parliament chancellery, two of  its deputy heads, the head of the parliament press service, and  the head of the state security service.    Besides the findings of the working group, submitted was to  the parliament a strictly secret material on the scent of the  checkup work containing, seemingly, some concrete data and  facts, and also a statement of the lawmakers from the opposition  in the Parliament A. Ganbaatar, T. Elbegdorj, who worked in this  group [sentence as received]. The findings of the working  group, which carried out the checkup work from 28 December up to  12 January at the State Security Central Department and the  Central Police Department and which was set up on the initiative  of the Parliament opposition, contain a conclusion that the  statement made by the former head of the counterintelligence  service about involvement of the State Great Hural Chairman N.  Bagabandi, the Parliament Vice Chairman J. Gombojab, and the  Prime Minister P. Jasray in bribery and abuse of powers is  groundless and not confirmed. In this document appeared are for  the first time also names of the state Great Hural member,  leader of the biggest oppositional party Mongolian National  Democratic Party [MNDP] D. Ganbold, the [words indistinct]  member, and member of the MNDP S. Zorig. But, as it is pointed  out in the findings, also materials concerning D. Ganbold and S.  Zorig did not confirm their participation in abuse of powers.    In the statement made by the lawmakers from the Parliament  opposition A. Ganbaatar and T. Elbegdorj there is a disagreement  with the findings of the working group on the grounds that the  group has not given any assessment to a sudden removal of the  head of the State Security Service and has not stated reasons  for that. On the other hand, as it is said in the statement,  despite the presence of serious data and materials, concerning  the Parliament head, the deputy head and the prime minister, the  working group deviated from giving a true assessment, and what  is more was guided by concealment and intercession in its  actions.    At the end of the first day of hearing the working group the  head of the Mongolian State P. Ochirbat has taken a floor. He  expressed his position on this issue.    As it was decided to continue consideration of the findings  of the working group in Parliament next week, close of the State  Great Hural autumn session was also postponed.</p>

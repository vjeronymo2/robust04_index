			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No undertaking for Sunday trading ban KIRKLEES BOROUGH COUNCIL v WICKES BUILDING SUPPLIES LTD House of Lords (Lord Keith, Lord Ackner, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Lowry): June 25 1992 A LOCAL authority exercising its law enforcement functions can seek an injunction to restrain retailers from breach of the statutory prohibition on Sunday trading; and the court has a discretion whether or not to require it, as a condition of grant of the injunction, to undertake to make good any damage suffered by the retailer should the prohibition be invalid under EC law. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the Kirklees Borough Council from a Court of Appeal decision that it was required to give an undertaking in damages as a condition of its being granted an interlocutory injunction to restrain Wickes Building Supplies Ltd from Sunday trading. LORD GOFF said Sunday trading was prohibited by section 47 of the Shops Act 1950. The ineffectiveness of prosecution to deter large stores from Sunday opening had caused local authorities charged with enforcement of section 47 to search for a more effective remedy. They had resorted to seeking injunctions to restrain stores from infringing the section. Now stores were invoking EC law. The argument was that section 47 could not stand because, it was said, it was inconsistent with article 30 of the EC Treaty which was of direct effect and prohibited quantitive measures on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. On May 14 1990 the council obtained from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies an interlocutory injunction restraining Wickes until trial from using premises in the Kirklees area for Sunday trading. On the evidence before him Wickes had been trading on Sundays and intended to continue doing so unless restrained by the court. It was common ground that Wickes's Sunday trading was in breach of section 47 unless that section had been rendered ineffective by article 30 of the treaty. The judge, applying the principles in Hoffmann-La Roche (1975) AC 295, held that since the council was engaged in law enforcement duties, he had a discretion whether to require it to give an undertaking in damages. He exercised that discretion against requiring an undertaking. As a result of that decision many other local authorities obtained interlocutory injunctions restraining Sunday trading. The Court of Appeal decided that the judge had erred in not requiring the council to give an undertaking. The result was that large retail stores were trading on Sundays up and down the country, undeterred by the threat of criminal prosecution and unrestrained by injunction. Section 71(1) of the Shops Act 1950 provided that it was the duty of every local authority to enforce the provisions of the Act 'and for that purpose to institute and carry on such proceedings in respect of contraventions as may be necessary to secure observance thereof'. Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 provided that local authorities 'in the case of civil proceedings, may institute them in their own name'. On the face of those two statutory provisions it appeared that proceedings in its own name by way of injunction were open to a local authority in order to secure observance of section 47. The Court of Appeal required the council to give the undertaking because, first, it held that in English law the discretion to dispense with it was available only to give effect to a Crown privilege, and did not extend to local authorities exercising the function of law enforcement; and second, because under EC law an undertaking must be given where necessary to protect any EC law right of direct effect which might possibly be affected. In Hoffmann-La Roche the secretary of state claimed an injunction restraining Hoffmann-La Roche from charging prices for drugs in excess of those specified in an Order approved by Parliament. The House of Lords held he was not required to give an undertaking in damages to recompense Hoffmann-La Roche in the event of the Order being invalid. Previously it had been generally accepted that the requirement of an undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an interlocutory injunction did not apply in the case of the Crown. The origin of that rule lay in the fact that since the Crown was not liable in damages in the ordinary way, an undertaking requirement would be inconsistent with its immunity from liability. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 had removed the justification for the rule. The question in the present case was whether the Hoffmann-La Roche principle should apply in the case of public authorities other than the Crown charged with enforcement of the law. The majority in the Court of Appeal concluded that it should not apply. Lord Justice Dillon said it was 'a privilege of the Crown alone'. Hoffmann-La Roche did not confer a privilege on the Crown. On the contrary, it dismantled an old Crown privilege and substituted a principle on which, in certain limited circumstances, the court had a discretion. It was difficult to understand why the same principle should not in similar circumstances apply to other public authorities when exercising the function of law enforcer in the public interest. The breadth of section 71(1) of the 1950 Act was such as to embrace injunction proceedings brought under the power subsequently conferred by section 222 of the 1972 Act. There was no material difference between the council in the present case and the Crown in Hoffmann-La Roche. The court's discretion to require an undertaking applied to public authorities exercising the function of law enforcement in the circumstances specified in Hoffmann-La Roche. It followed that, apart from the question of the impact of EC law, such was the discretion which the courts should have exercised in the present case. The Court of Appeal majority held that the court was bound by EC law to require an undertaking in damages from the council if an interlocutory injunction was to be granted. That conclusion based on the premise inter alia that if Wickes was right that section 47 was incompatible with article 30, it had a current right to open its stores for Sunday trading and it was the national court's duty to protect that right. The question whether section 47 was inconsistent with article 30 had been referred to the European Court of Justice in Torfaen (1990) QB 19. In Stoke-on-Trent (1984) AC 754 Mr Justice Hoffmann, interpreting and applying Torfaen, granted an injunction. Matters changed after the Court of Appeal decision in the present case. By the time Stoke-on-Trent came before the House of Lords, Torfaen had been followed by Conforama (Case C 312/89) and Marchandise (Case C 332/89). The House felt compelled to make a reference to Europe. If the European Court should hold in Stoke-on-Trent that section 47 was invalid as being in conflict with article 30, the UK might be obliged to make good damage caused to individuals by the breach of article 30 for which it was responsible. It did not follow, however, that the council should be obliged to give an undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an injunction. That was because the obligation (if any) on the UK to make good any damage suffered by Wickes would arise irrespective of any undertaking in damages. In the circumstances, such an undertaking would be superfluous. Wickes's argument that the council should be required to give an undertaking in damages had no justification in EC law. For the council: Stuart Isaacs QC, Timothy Straker and Neil Calver (Sharpe Pritchard for MRG Vause, Huddersfield). For Wickes: Andrew Collins QC and Paul Lasok (Edwin Coe for Metcalfe Copeman Pettefar, Peterborough). For the Attorney General intervening: Stephen Richards and Nicholas Paines (Treasury Solicitor).</p>

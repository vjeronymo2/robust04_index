			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Banks rebuff protests on credit cards BANKS yesterday rounded on retailers for complaining about increased charges for processing credit-card payments. They challenged the retailers to stop taking credit cards if they were dissatisfied with the terms on offer. The Credit Card Research Group, a lobby group set up by the banks, said retailers' complaints were unreasonable. It claimed that they had come after three years in which charges had fallen by a third, saving Pounds 200m. 'They (the retailers) have squeezed the card companies so hard that they are now losing significant amounts of money on processing card transactions for the retailer,' said Ms Elizabeth Phillips, director of the group. 'Retailers have the option of refusing to take cards,' she added. 'But they should think carefully before doing so. There are many advantages to the retailer in taking cards.' She challenged the retailers to say whether or not they had passed on to their customers the benefits of price cuts in credit card charges over the last three years. 'There is no justification for them passing on the increases to their customers now,' she said.</p>

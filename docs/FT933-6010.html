			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (1): Sweet smell of success - For five years Malaysia's GDP has grown by more than 8 per cent a year as it switched to manufacturing from a commodities-based economy. But it is now proving much harder to capture overseas investment for its next phase of expansion THE earth movers and diggers are hard at work on the old racetrack in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. A new city centre is being built which will include what is being billed as one of the world's tallest buildings - a 450 metre twin tower complex which, when completed in 1996, will be higher than New York's World Trade Centre or the Sears Tower in Chicago. Critics say the city centre project is proof that the government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, is carried away by its own economic success, full of grandiose, ill conceived, schemes. To the government and its many supporters, the new city centre will be a monument to the new Malaysia, a country standing tall with its economy growing to join the ranks of industrialised nations. Even the critics cannot ignore the considerable progress made in Malaysia in recent years. Overall GDP has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years. Malaysia has been transformed from a commodity based to a manufacturing economy. In the mid 1960s tin and rubber accounted for nearly 80 per cent of export earnings. Last year the manufacturing sector accounted for 70 per cent of the value of exports. 'There is no doubt that had we remained with tin and rubber, we would be a basket case today,' said Dr Mahathir recently. 'Moving into manufacturing saved us.' Living standards have improved: per capita incomes have increased from Dollars 350 in 1970 to nearly Dollars 3,000 last year. Foreign investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Malaysia, attracted by the country's political stability and its generally low wage regime. The government's goal now - called 'Vision 2020' - is full industrialisation by the year 2020 - with an economic growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the next 27 years. There are few more compelling images of modern Malaysia than that of Dr Mahathir, sitting confidently in the back of his official limousine, a Malaysia made Proton car: the number plate on the car is 2020. But there are those who question whether Dr Mahathir's vision can be turned into reality. One of the key factors in Malaysia's recent success has been foreign investment. In 1990/91 foreign companies were investing about MDollars 17bn (Dollars 6.6bn) per year in Malaysia, representing well over half annual total investments. In the first six months of 1993 foreign investments were only MDollars 1.6bn. The continuing problems being faced by the industrialised countries is one reason for the decline in inward investment. But Malaysia is also in danger of losing out in the competitiveness stakes, particularly to the fast emerging economies in the region such as China and Vietnam. Recently productivity has not been keeping pace with wage rises. This not only deters investors - it also jeopardises Malaysia's export competitiveness. Dr Mahathir and his officials constantly preach the need to restrain wage increases. Union activity is strictly controlled. But having been told so often of their country's economic success, workers want to have a share of the benefits. The situation is exacerbated by growing labour shortages which, in many industries, have become a serious impediment to further growth. The short term solution is the government's tacit acceptance of about 1m illegal foreign workers in the country. But the long term presence of such a large group of foreigners could lead to serious social problems and upset Malaysia's delicate racial balance. The more lasting solution proposed by the government is to go into more capital intensive, sophisticated, value added industries - much as Singapore decided to do some years ago. But while Malaysia has developed expertise in a number of fields - mainly in the commodities sector - much of its industry still lacks depth and know how. The problems are well recognised. 'Malaysia is lamentably weak in research and the application of new technology,' says Dr Mahathir. Education is a problem area. For the next phase of its development Malaysia needs an ever bigger pool of highly qualified engineers, technicians and managers. But these are not being produced in anything like sufficient numbers. Government critics blame the New Economic Policy (NEP), introduced in the early 1970s, for many present problems. The NEP emphasised discrimination in favour of the Malays, the dominant racial group in the country. The Chinese, who make up about 35 per cent of the population, controlled most economic activity in the country. The idea was to give the Malays a greater share of the economic cake. The policy was a partial success. According to official figures Malays controlled about 20 per cent of corporate equity by 1990. But critics say the NEP gave rise to more problems than it solved. With Malays favoured in education, for jobs in both government and the private sector, a large measure of competitiveness was removed from the system and standards fell. Meanwhile the Chinese, Indians and other groups were made to feel like second class citizens. The NEP is also blamed for giving rise to an uncompetitive business culture. Dr Mahathir himself frequently berates the Malays for their 'get rich quick' attitude and their lack of entrepreneurial zeal. Government policy has now changed, emphasising growth rather than discrimination as the principal means of achieving a level of economic equality between the races. But the old ways live on. In business, political connections with the Malay dominated government are often more important than commercial competitiveness. In part economic success has helped alleviate some of the tensions between the races. But there is still a question mark over whether government policy has made Malaysia a more equal, less racially segregated society. The Chinese still control a large slice of the country's economic life and sit on a considerable pile of capital. That capital now needs to be invested in the country's future. The government speaks of the need to 'wean' the country off foreign investment and depend more on domestic capital resources. But many Chinese remain hesitant, still wondering about their place in Malaysian society. Last year domestic investment fell by more than 30 per cent and shows signs of an even steeper fall this year. Sensitivities about racial or political questions and a heavily government influenced media mean that there is little or no public debate on these issues. Government opponents accuse the government of sensing conspiracy in any criticism - even when things have gone obviously wrong. In March it was revealed that Bank Negara, the central bank, had incurred a 'paper loss' of about MDollars 12.8bn (Dollars 4bn) last year, most of it due to speculations on the foreign exchange markets. Dr Mahathir dismissed criticism of the bank's operations. Opposition calls for a full inquiry into the bank's activities were brushed aside. Yet there is no doubting the disquiet the issue caused in both the local and foreign financial community. Sensitivity to criticism is also evident in Malaysia's dealings with the outside world. Dr Mahathir has tilted at many windmills: he continues to attack the industrialised world, the US in particular, for what he considers to be double standards on human rights and environmental questions. Malaysia remains deeply suspicious of what it feels is a protectionist trade campaign directed against developing countries by the richer nations. Dr Mahathir continues to lobby hard for recognition of an 'East Asia Economic Caucus' (EAEC) - to counter the activities of perceived western trading blocs. Other nations in the region tend to feel Malaysia has, at times, a rather exaggerated view of its own importance and do not necessarily share Dr Mahathir's views. So far the EAEC has met with a only a guarded response. But, hubris or not, Malaysia marches on. Its economy seems likely to grow at close to 8 per cent again this year. Kuala Lumpur's new city centre project is going ahead full steam. Malaysia is still breathless from its first sprint up the economic ladder. But as it loses many of the competitive advantages it has enjoyed in the past, the upward climb will get considerably tougher.</p>

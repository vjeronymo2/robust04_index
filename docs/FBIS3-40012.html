			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Phillip Johnston, George Jones and Boris Johnson, </F> EC Correspondent in Brussels: "Holidays Vetoed as Tories Are Put  on Euro-Poll Stand-By"]    [Text] Cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs have been  warned not to book early summer holidays because they will be  needed for a Tory fightback in the run-up to the June 9  elections to the European Parliament [EP].    A report yesterday predicted that the Conservatives were  facing big losses in the Euro-elections -- a critical mid-term  test for Mr Major and his Government -- with the Liberal  Democrats set to win their first seats.    In an attempt to provide the maximum opportunities for  campaigning, the Government has decided to call a two-week  Commons Whit recess from May 27 to June 13. It will means  Parliament will not be sitting in the 10 days up to the  elections.    At a political session of the Cabinet yesterday, Sir Norman  Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said everybody from Cabinet  ministers to backbench MPs should get out and about in the  country during the recess and galvanise support.    Later, Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, attempted to distance  Tory  MEPs [member of the European Parliament] from their alliance  with Continental Euro-federalists, on the eve of today's  potentially embarrassing publication of the Christian Democrat  [CD] manifesto for the Euro-elections.    He has written to all Tory backbenchers, insisting on the  distinct Conservative status of the 32 MEPs, as their CD allies  announce commitments to the single currency, full  Euro-federalism, and the Social Chapter.    In his letter, Mr Hurd attempts to dismiss the alliance with  the European Peoples' Party [EPP] (Christian Democrats),  initiated after the fall of Lady Thatcher in 1990, as a mere  convenience.    He stresses that the MEPs' alliance with the EPP does not  imply membership of the party; though Euro-sceptics such as Lord  Tebbit have complained that Tories in Strasbourg, led by Sir  Christopher Prout, are listed as "EPP" in all handbooks.    Projected results for the European elections were published  yesterday by the Electoral Reform Society [ERS], based largely  on the outcome of last May's county council elections.    Predictions have been made difficult by the addition of six  seats and subsequent boundary revisions in many of the 84  constituencies.    The Conservatives fared badly when the European elections  were last fought on 78 constituencies in 1989, losing 13 seats  and ending up with 32 to Labour's 45.    On the new boundaries, the ERS expects the Tories to do even  worse, losing a further 12 seats and leaving them with 20.  Labour is predicted to gain eight to 53 and the Liberal  Democrats, who have no seats, to win 11.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGER STRIKER PERSISTS IN BID FOR AIDS MEASURE  </P> <P> Stuart McDonald is in the 36th day of a hunger strike that he has been told  could hasten his death from AIDS.  </P> <P> But the 33-year-old attorney, who suffers from AIDS-related complex, hopes his  fast will persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to ban discrimination against  homosexuals and people who are infected with the deadly virus.  </P> <P> At an emotional press conference in the Capitol on Monday, McDonald vowed to  continue his fast until the Republican governor reverses his stand and says he  will sign legislation prohibiting such discrimination.  </P> <P> "I am ready to continue this until he comes out and publicly supports and  agrees to sign that legislation," McDonald said. "If someone puts their life on  the line for this, just maybe the governor's heartstrings would be pulled a  tiny little bit. Maybe that would change his mind."  </P> <P> But Deukmejian, who has acquired a reputation for stubbornness in his dealings  with the Legislature, is not likely to be moved by McDonald's appeal, aides to  the governor said.  </P> <P> "We view it as rather unfortunate that Mr. McDonald would be injuring his own  health for such a misguided reason," said Deukmejian press secretary Kevin  Brett. "Instead of injuring his own health, he should be saluting the governor  because California has done more in the fight against AIDS than any other  state."  </P> <P> He noted that the governor has increased the annual AIDS budget from $3 million  to $103 million in the last six years.  </P> <P> Brett also said McDonald should file a complaint with the state Department of  Fair Employment and Housing if he believes he has been a victim of  discrimination. The agency, Brett said, investigates complaints of  discrimination against people who have been infected with the AIDS virus even  if they have no apparent handicap from the disease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for Work  </P> <P> McDonald told reporters that he had been unable to find a permanent job since  he tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus four years ago.  </P> <P> McDonald, who lives in San Francisco and was admitted to the California State  Bar in 1986, said he had sent out more than 1,000 letters and resumes in search  of work as an attorney, or even as a law clerk or paralegal.  </P> <P> In his letters, McDonald said he disclosed the fact that he suffers from  AIDS-related complex, which can sap his strength but still allows him to work a  40-hour week. The letters brought him two job interviews, but no offers.  </P> <P> "Yes, I did go out and tell employers, all of them, that I have physical  limitations," he said. "I was very honest about it."  </P> <P> McDonald, upset by his repeated rejection in the job market, began his fast  Jan. 2, he said. During the hunger strike, he said he has been drinking coffee,  herbal tea and Gatorade. He has lost 40 pounds.  </P> <P> "My doctor has told me that I will probably come down with AIDS as a result of  the fast," McDonald said. "I don't want to die. I'd rather be out eating pizza.  . . . (But) this is probably the most important thing I have ever done in my  entire life."  </P> <P> McDonald contends that he would not have had such difficulties in finding  employment if Deukmejian had signed legislation aimed at protecting people who  are in his predicament. Deukmejian vetoed legislation in 1984 that would have  prohibited discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing,  arguing that there was no compelling evidence of widespread discrimination  based on sexual orientation.  </P> <P> Last year, the governor vetoed a bill that would have banned discrimination  against people who have tested positive for the AIDS virus but have not  developed symptoms of the disease.  </P> <P> In refusing to sign the AIDS measure, Deukmejian said he was not convinced of  the need for such legislation.  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Planets with a different view Sir, Proof that journalists on the Spectator live on an entirely different planet from the rest of us, was conclusively provided by Dominic Lawson in his article, 'The angry young men who look back in yearning' (April 20). He appears to inhabit one in which the US government's approach to the Kurds is beyond all thought of reproach. Your readers live on one in which the administration in 1921 gave the nod to a carve-up of the Ottoman Empire that denied Kurds a homeland, and its successors have defended the sanctity of those borders to this day; in which US representatives opposed a UN resolution condemning the nerve-gassing of Kurds at Halabja in 1988; in which US aircraft were bombing Kurdish population centres in Iraq just a few weeks ago; in which it took a sustained worldwide outcry for the president to pull from his hat a five-figure solution to a seven-figure problem. Lest my anger be thought to be spilling into unreasoning anti-Americanism, we might note that the UK government was the prime mover in the 1921 partition, leaving Iraqi government in the hands of a clique drawn from a minority; if the Sunni ruling class were in any doubt as to how they were expected to retain control of the Kurds and Shias, the RAF's well-documented gassing of Kurdish villages in 1925 dispelled it effectively. And those angry young men? True, the myopic is now confused by the anger emanating from a variety of sexes, ages and temperaments. But the examples pictured Stuffing the Poll Tax with your article, 'Killed by a citizens' revolt' (March 16), would have been instantly recognisable. On our planet there are one or two people who might have preferred them to stick to writing plays. How about on Dominic Lawson's planet? Graham Chapman, 8 Nixon Road, Oxford</p>

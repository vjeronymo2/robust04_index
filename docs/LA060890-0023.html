			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> 3 REPUBLICANS BACK ABORTION FUNDS  </P> <P> Three Republican lawmakers said they would oppose GOP efforts to slash state  spending on abortions for poor women. State Sen. Rebecca Morgan of Los Altos  Hills, along with Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush of Santa Clara and Escondido  Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter, said it was illegal to cut funding for Medi-Cal  abortions and costly to defend the action in court.  </P> <P> Last year, the Legislature again defied the Supreme Court and refused to pay  for Medi-Cal abortions unless the mother was a victim of rape or incest, her  life was in danger, or the fetus was severely abnormal. A Republican  anti-abortion bloc and a handful of Democrats have cut funding for Medi-Cal  abortions every year since 1978, but the state Supreme Court has ordered the  money restored each time.  </P></p>

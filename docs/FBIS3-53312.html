The foreign secretaries have admitted  that they have not been able to narrow their differences on the  Kashmir issue. Pakistan has proposed a five-point formula to  resolve the dispute. Under this formula, Islamabad has asked  India to withdraw troops from occupied Kashmir; lift the siege  of the Hazratbal Shrine and allow the people to pray there;  improve the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir;  immediately release detained Kashmiri leaders; and allow  representatives of international organizations, the news media,  and diplomats to visit Kashmir so that the world is aware of the  actual situation there. In response to these Pakistani  proposals, India has displayed its traditional intransigence.  For the first time, it sat across the negotiating table  allegedly without any preparations and described the relevant UN  resolutions as outdated. In his news conference the Indian  foreign secretary reiterated that the UN resolutions have become  irrelevant and that India has repeated this position over and  over again. By this, the Indian foreign secretary meant to  convey that New Delhi considers Kashmir an integral part of  India. Only a day before the start of the current round of  negotiations, Indian Defense Minister Dinesh Singh also  reaffirmed this policy. In light of these statements, the  process of dialogue was nothing but a totally meaningless and  futile exercise.    The only salient feature, if there was any, of this dialogue  was that for the first time India accepted Kashmir as an item on  the agenda for discussion, but New Delhi maintained its usual  intransigence, showing no change in its attitude toward the  Kashmir issue.    It is, however, worth noting that the Indian foreign  secretary was given extraordinarily warm treatment. Both the  president and the prime minister spared time to meet him and the  Pakistani foreign secretary held a record two-hour one-on-one  meeting. On the other hand, the fact that the president went  hunting in his ancestral district of Rajanpur and the prime  minister left Islamabad and convened a meeting of her Cabinet in  Karachi, some 1,000 miles away, reflects how serious they were  about these negotiations. It is only the government that can  understand the logic of this contradictory attitude -- the  flurry of publicity on one hand and the leaders' apathy on the  other -- toward these talks.    Nonetheless, the fact that the talks would fail was no  secret. With India describing Kashmir as an integral part,  there was no room for any dialogue and no meaning in conducting  that futile exercise. If Pakistan knew all this in advance,  then why did it agree to hold the dialogue? Was it intended to  please India or did it not have the courage to resist U.S.  pressure? Had we created a national consensus on this extremely  sensitive national issue by mobilizing the support of all  opposition parties and political and national leaders before the  talks and then faced the Indian delegation at the negotiating  table from a position of strength, it would have served us well.  Earlier, in the hope of promoting goodwill, Pakistan also  withdrew its resolution [on Kashmir] from the UN General  Assembly, thereby failing to gain the advantages it could have  by introducing it in the international body.    Now, after the conclusion of the dialogue, the government  has  announced that there will be no further talks with India, but  none of the authorities, including the foreign secretary,  foreign minister, prime minister or president have taken the  trouble to tell the people what their policy is for at least  resolving the Kashmir dispute, or -- God forbid -- they have  decided to leave the oppressed and helpless Muslims of the Jammu  and Kashmir valley to the mercy of the Indian beasts. We hope  such thinking does not exist at any level of the government.  Wisdom demands that a national policy on the Kashmir cause be  adopted, rising above partisan prejudices. For this purpose,  the government should convene an all-party conference which  should emphasize the need for resolving the Kashmir dispute only  on the basis of the UN resolutions. Later, efforts should also  be made to form a strong Islamic bloc at the global level to  place the Islamic community on a single platform to help resolve  all serious problems, like Bosnia, Palestine, and Kashmir.  Several Muslim countries call Pakistan "brother" and India  "friend," and are not ready to displease the "friend" for the  sake of pleasing the "brother." So long as the Islamic  community is not persuaded to enforce an economic and political  boycott of India, nothing good can be expected from New Delhi.  As the proverb -- a nod for the wise and a rod for the fool --  goes, we need to increase our strength to deal with India.</p>

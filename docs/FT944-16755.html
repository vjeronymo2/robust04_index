			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Jobs to be lost at BR Unions expect to be told next week that more than 1,500 white-collar workers will lose their jobs at British Rail Infrastructure Services over the next six months as it is split into 20 separate companies prior to privatisation. British Rail yesterday admitted there would be job losses but refused to confirm the figure. Unions believe the main victims will be managerial and administrative staff. BRIS is subcontracted by Railtrack to maintain track and signalling work.</p>

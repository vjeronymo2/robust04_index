			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / NatWest ends market-making in up to 300 small companies THE MARKET for shares in smaller UK companies suffered another blow yesterday with the news that County NatWest, part of National Westminster Bank, is to stop making markets in between 200 and 300 companies. County's retrenchment follows a similar move by Warburg Securities, another leading securities house, which dropped 360 small company stocks a fortnight ago. Others, such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, have also trimmed their operations, though on a smaller scale. The cuts leave a growing number of companies without at least two market-makers willing to quote prices in their shares, making it impossible for normal stock market trading to continue. Even before the Warburg and County moves, some 130 companies had been forced on to the London Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board, an electronic system in which brokers post 'buy' or 'sell' orders in small company shares. The exchange said its domestic equity market committee would meet next week to consider ways of improving the Bulletin Board. The system has been criticised by brokers, who say it does little to encourage trading. The move by County, which has yet to decide exactly which companies it will drop, was part of a decision to disband its small companies team, with the departure of two analysts and two salespeople. Analysts specialising in particular sectors would now be responsible for researching small companies, said Mr Philip Augar, head of equities. While most market-makers have pulled back from small companies, two  - Smith New Court and Winterflood Securities  - this week said they planned to extend the range of companies they covered. The deterioration of the market in small company shares is causing growing concern among the companies involved, who fear it will become more difficult to trade their shares and raise money on the stock market. 'They have paid large amounts for listing fees and they've been relegated to the position of second-class citizens,' said Mr Brian Winterflood of Winterflood Securities. County said it had made 15 to 20 people redundant last week out of a total of 120 to 130 in its equity department.</p>

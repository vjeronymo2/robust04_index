Ford has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgement concerning the merits of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January 26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab vehicles. These windows were labeled ``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.'' Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows have been used in vehicle production or provided to aftermarket distributors for service replacement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and S3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of Ford, described above.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui, protesting  Washington's redesignation of Seoul in the Priority Watch List  (PWL) for intellectual property rights (IPR) violations,  yesterday vowed to stamp out offenders through continued  inspections.    The government amended four IPR-related laws last year and  enacted a new law protecting the semiconductor industry, Kim  told the seventh session of the Korea-U.S. Business Council that  opened for a two-day session. The opening ceremony was held at  the Inter-Continental Hotel in southern Seoul.    "To strengthen IPR protection, our government basically aims  at instituting a foundation against infringement by promulgating  and revising relevant laws and regulations, by vigorously  enforcing such laws nationwide until IPR infringements are  completely eradicated, and by establishing greater public  awareness of IPR protection," said the justice minister.    As a result of Seoul's tightened enforcement, the number of  detected IPR violators was 2.2 times higher in 1993 than the  previous year, he said.    "...We were disappointed to find that notwithstanding the  (Korea-U.S. business) council's efforts, the American government  has once again placed Korea on the PWL in its recent evaluation  of the IPR protection of individual countries," he said.    Kim was one of the early speakers at the council session,  divided into committees on manufacturing, technology and service  and a subcommittee on IPR.</p>

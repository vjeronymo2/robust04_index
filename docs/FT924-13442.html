			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Conflicting signals from the Danes - Denmark's Maastricht sceptics seem to have hardened their line EUROPEAN governments trying to analyse Denmark's efforts to overcome its Maastricht predicament will need to show formidable mental agility. A set of reflecting mirrors might come in handy too. In coming weeks, the Danish government will be sending two sets of messages  -one for external consumption, and one for an internal audience - to try to resolve the imbroglio left by the Danish No to Maastricht in June. Denmark faces two fundamental dilemmas. First, to make the treaty palatable to a sceptical Danish electorate, the minority conservative-liberal government of Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, has to propose important changes. Above all, it wants to block any obligatory Danish participation either in Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) or in a common European defence. Some of these changes would be difficult to swallow for other European governments which want to keep the Maastricht treaty basically intact - above all, in order to avoid a painful renegotiation process next year. Second, no-one can be precisely sure why a small majority of Danes voted against the treaty 4 1/2 months ago. According to one theory, if the treaty's proponents had described Europe's future using the Danish word 'sammenslutning' ('binding together') instead of the foreign-sounding 'union', the people would have voted Yes. Another thesis is that Danish voters misread the treaty's proposals on a 'social chapter' as inferring that the country's generous social security entitlements would be cut. Summing up the convoluted path Denmark must follow to come up with its Maastricht proposals, Mr Henning Dyremose, the finance minister, says: 'It has to be a different solution for us. 'But, for the others (in the EC), it must not be a different solution.' Mr Dyremose is fully aware of the difficulties posed by the need to reach simultaneous agreement both internally and with its EC partners. 'The challenge for us is the double decision-making process. We have to link (the two processes) together at exactly the right point in time.' Denmark already built into the original treaty last December a clause making participation in Emu subject to a further referendum later in the 1990s. The government now, however, seems likely to press for a much stronger form of monetary 'opt out' clause, perhaps modelled on the exemption Britain obtained at the Maastricht summit. In fields like Emu, a majority of parties in the Folketing (parliament) is now talking of changes to the treaty substantial enough to require some form of renegotiation. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), says he is seeking changes affecting above all defence and monetary union, as well as in the treaty's applicability to policies on citizenship and immigration. He also wants a stronger definition of the application of 'subsidiarity' - making decisions at the lowest level of government. 'If the new basis (sought for the treaty) is only a gentleman's agreement, then it will not be credible. 'A new model for Denmark will have to have binding consequences for other countries too,' he said. Mr Rasmussen points out that extension of 'subsidiarity', although necessary in some fields, is by no means a panacea. In environment policy, Denmark wants the Community to set tough minimum standards which would be in force throughout the 12. Views like this from Denmark's opposition parties will be crucial. All the parties in the Folketing need to find a consensus on an amended treaty before it can be resubmitted to the electorate, either next summer or, possibly, in the autumn. The SDP leadership campaigned in favour of the treaty before the June referendum, but 60 per cent of party members voted against the document  - making the next referendum a vital test of the party's credibility. Emboldened by opposition elsewhere in the Community to the goal of European union, Denmark's Maastricht sceptics seem to have hardened their line since the summer. One diplomat in Copenhagen says the Danes will want to build in a number of additional safeguards - through extra protocols and clauses - in order to 'over-insure' against the risk that the treaty will again be rejected. The left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP), which campaigned against the treaty this summer, is clearly in electoral competition to pick up disenchanted SDP voters. Mr Holger Nielsen, the SPP leader, could play a pivotal role in the new prospective referendum campaign. He says he would like to vote Yes next time round. But, first, amendments will have to be decided which will imply some form of renegotiation elsewhere in the EC. Mr Nielsen declares: 'It's important to tell others that we want co-operation - but we don't want a European federation.'</p>

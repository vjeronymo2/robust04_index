			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chip demand pushes Dow Jones to record Wall Street STRONG DEMAND for blue chips and an influx of available funds helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average reach a record high, writes Karen Zagor in New York. At the close the Dow was 38.69 stronger at 3,272.81, edging the index above its previous all-time peak of 3,272.14 registered on January 28. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was moderately heavy at 232.3m shares. Advancing issues outpaced those declining by 1083 to 632. On Monday, the Dow added 10.73 to close at 3,234.12. Among other market indices, the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 4.32 higher at 413.85. The Dow Jones Utilities index, which lost ground through most of the day, turned higher in the last half hour of trading to close at 209, up 0.12. Mr Laszlo Birinyi, a Wall Street strategist at Birinyi Associates, said the rally was helped by good, solid leadership of big stocks, such as Merck, which did well during the day. The strong bond market performance also helped stocks. Testimony from Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, provided no surprises about the US economy or economic policy. He described recent economic performance as disappointing. However, he did not foresee significant economic contraction in the short-term. Positive comments from Mr George Salem, an analyst at Prudential Securities, helped the banking sector. Citicorp gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 , BankAmerica rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 5/8 and Chemical Banking added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29, although Mr Salem was less than bullish on Citicorp and BankAmerica. Predictions of improved car sales for January helped shares in the big three US automobile makers post gains. Chrysler jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 16 3/8 , its 52-week high, in active trading. Ford firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 and General Motors improved Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35. A number of issues moved on the back of corporate results. Sears edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 39 7/8 after posting fourth quarter net income of Dollars 513.1m or Dollars 1.48 a share including an accounting change. Pepsico, which turned in fourth quarter earnings of 41 cents a share, excluding charges of 7 cents a share, rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 . Control Data rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the company unveiled a fourth quarter loss of 36 cents a share, against 56 cents a year earlier. Beckman Instruments climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 on news that a group including two of the Bass Brothers had taken a 5.3 per cent stake in Beckman. Disappointing results from Kemper, which posted fourth quarter earnings of 91 cents a share from 98 cents a year earlier, depressed the company's share price, which tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 36 3/4 . The secondary market also hit a record high, with the Nasdaq composite quoted 7.57 higher at 631. Canada TORONTO stocks ended higher on solid volume, led by a jump in the real estate and construction sector. The composite index gained 23.67 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at 3,618.07, with advancing issues leading decliners 320 to 246. Volume was 30.8m shares worth CDollars 348.3m against the previous 24.9m shares worth CDollars 272.7m. Imperial Oil, whose shares moved up  3/4 to 42, announced a major corporate restructuring which will reduce its workforce by about 1,700 and its number of service stations by 1,000 over the next few years.</p>

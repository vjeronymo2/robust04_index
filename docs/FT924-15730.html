			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: Nigeria fully committed to Opec Sir, Neil Buckley ('Once again Opec shoots itself in the foot', Commodities and Agriculture, September 22) refers to a suggestion by Mr Vahan Zanoyan that 'larger producers such as Nigeria and Venezuela might also be tempted to follow Ecuador' ostensibly out of Opec. This could not be further from the truth. Nigeria does not see itself as a 'weak and uninfluential member of Opec who just turns up, takes a lot of abuse from the Gulf countries and goes home'. Having provided the Opec conference president for 11 of the last 15 terms, Nigeria has played a leadership role. The Nigerian minister of petroleum and mineral resources, Dr Chu S P Okongwu, stresses that Nigeria remains fully committed to Opec, its objectives and its strategies. He says that at no time did Nigeria consider changing its status within Opec, much less withdrawing. Taiwo Idemudia, national representative to Opec, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, 1-9 Warwick Row, London SW1E 5ER</p>

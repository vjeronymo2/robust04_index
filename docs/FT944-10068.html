			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Markets move with due understanding Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, November 3) neatly summarises the problems the UK monetary authorities face in looking at a multitude of economic signals, not all of which are flashing the same colour at the same time. But his comment that 'the financial markets did not immediately realise the Bank was trying to signal the need for a bias towards higher interest rates' is simply wrong. As far as changes in interest rates are concerned, the markets are concerned with three simple factors: direction, timing and size. I know of no one who is forecasting the next move in base rates to be down. Indeed, the short sterling futures market immediately prior to the inflation report was discounting UK interest rates of 8.5 per cent by next September. The sharp rally in the markets was not due to any misinterpretation of the direction, nor the timing of future base rate changes. Rather, on the basis of a swift and detailed reading of the report itself - rather than the off-the-record briefing given exclusively to journalists - the market concluded that the size of the rate rises would be less than previously expected. It is easy to criticise financial markets. It is easier still to mock their 'ex-post rationalisation' of news and events. But, in this particular case, the market reaction was correct. Interest rates are going up, whether this week, next week, next month or next year. The sharp rally since publication of the inflation report came not because the market misunderstood the Bank of England, but because it understood it all too well.

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Nigeria to float naira as part of economic shake-up NIGERIA'S central bank last night announced an effective float of the naira as part of the most radical economic initiative since the government launched its structural adjustment programme in 1986. The decision will help restore the faith of Nigeria's creditors in what has been a flagging reform policy, resolve a major policy difference with the International Monetary Fund and lead to a shake-up of the banking sector. But as the impact of what is expected to be a devaluation of 30 per cent of more sinks in, President Ibrahim Babangida may face strong domestic criticism. In a nationwide broadcast, Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of the central bank, said that the value of the naira would be determined by 'going market rates'. Currently there is an 80 per cent spread between the official and parallel rates for the naira, bought and sold under a complex multi-tier system. Bankers said the impact of what they described as a decision to float the naira depended in part on the effectiveness of the liquidity squeeze and promised curbs in government spending. But they expected an effective devaluation of at least 30 per cent. The broadcast comes as negotiations for a new stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund get under way. Nigeria is hoping to renew an 18-month SDR319m facility and pave the way to further rescheduling of its Dollars 34bn external debt later this year. The announcement ends two days of uncertainty and speculation about the president's commitment to the country's structural adjustment programme, undermined by an unrealistic exchange rate and government overspending. The uncertainty began when last Wednesday's weekly foreign exchange auction conducted by the central bank, now to be discontinued, ended without the customary declaration of the official rate. Although called an auction, the rate was in fact set through informal consultations in the banking sector. Nearly all applicants received a share of the foreign exchange made available. Many of the country's smaller banks have made substantial profits by doing little more than sell their quota at considerable premiums. The governor criticised this abuse. The quota system now ends, although the central bank will meet last Wednesday's applications. Banks will be free to buy foreign exchange from any source, and sell within a margin of 1 per cent.</p>

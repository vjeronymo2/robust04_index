			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The problems of growing up: As its economy matures, Taiwan has to make the switch from low-cost to high-tech industry A DECADE of growth at more than 8 per cent a year turned Taiwan into one of the richest places in Asia. Helped by rising trade surpluses, the island's central bank has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 88bn, the largest in the world. And, this year, despite the world recession, growth is likely to reach 7 per cent and unemployment remain below 2 per cent. However, growing wealth has led to new problems. As the economy has matured, the pillars which supported rapid industrial growth have been undermined. Strong, centralised government has had to make way to popular calls for more democracy. Once low-cost manufacturing is no longer competitive. And budgetary restraint has been overlooked as the island embarks on a Dollars 306bn six-year National Development plan to improve its infrastructure and quality of life. There is a consensus that these policy changes were needed, but their implementation will decide whether Taiwan can successfully move to the next stage of industrial development. Political reform, instigated by President Lee Teng-hui since 1987, has so far been relatively smooth. In December Taiwan holds its first fully representative election for the Legislative Yuan, or parliament. The ruling Kuomintang party (KMT) is expected to win a comfortable majority. It has been prepared to adopt populist platforms espoused by its poorly organised opposition, the Democratic Progressive Party. KMT control of the media, Taiwan's rising wages, low unemployment and a generally egalitarian education system have helped stability. But the greatest test for Taiwan lies in upgrading its industry. Since the late 1980s rising land costs and annual wage increases of 10 per cent, combined with a 50 per cent appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against its US counterpart between 1986 and 1989, have undermined profits for capital intensive industries and forced many low cost manufacturers overseas or out of business. Heavy industrial output fell from double to single digit growth from 1988 and was almost flat in 1990. Light industrial output fell for three successive years, before recovering in 1991. According to government figures, manufacturing profit margins fell to below 4 per cent in 1989. Declining profitability seems to have contributed to an 8 per cent fall in private investment in 1990. Export growth was also constrained, but has risen again since last year as exchange rates stabilised. But imports have grown even faster, fuelled by consumer demand and machinery purchases for infrastructure spending. Worried by these trends, the government has been urging companies to upgrade technology, invest in automation, research and design. In strategic industries like aerospace, it has been willing to help finance acquisitions of advanced foreign technology. Most of these initiatives have been inserted into the government's six-year National Development plan, launched last year. The plan's budget will largely be spent on infrastructure projects, such as transport, energy and environmental improvements, which were neglected during the 1980s. Although the plan is widely criticised for being poorly researched and leading to inflation, set to rise to 4-5 per cent, it will guarantee growth. Mr Jiang Ping-kun, vice minister of economics, said: 'Taiwan depends on industrial development. We have to upgrade from relying on labour intensive industries to high-tech, and that needs investment both by the government and the private sector. Results have been mixed so far, although some of the measures have only just taken effect. The government claims this year's increase in exports shows companies are becoming more competitive. But critics argue that the rise in exports is temporary and manufacturers will again face squeezed margins if, as expected, the currency continues to appreciate next year. Companies being asked to upgrade have one good reason, and one good excuse, not to do so. The good reason is China. By moving across the Taiwan Straits, light industrial companies, which still account for more than 40 per cent of exports, can take advantage of the low wages and land prices they used to enjoy in Taiwan. Restrictions on investing in China started to ease in 1987. Since then Taiwanese companies are estimated to have invested at least Dollars 3bn in the mainland, and anecdotal evidence suggests the trend is rising. However, there are no precise figures because companies hide their identities for political reasons. Taiwan's trade with China through Hong Kong has grown rapidly since 1987 and increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn for the first seven months of the year. If other indirect trade and smuggling is included, total trade could near Dollars 10bn this year. Exports from Taiwan are mostly destined for processing in new Taiwanese factories on the mainland. The good excuse is that most Taiwan companies are small, and often family run, so lack resources to upgrade technology. Nearly 70 per cent of the island's manufacturing companies employ less than 20 people. Taiwan has 352 pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, for example, but less than 30 have capital bases of Dollars 4m or more. Growth through acquisition is difficult because owners are unwilling to sell family businesses.</p>

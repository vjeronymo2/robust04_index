			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JACKSON GETS 51, LSU STALLS TEXAS, 124-113  </P> <P> Chris Jackson scored a season-high 51 points as 11th-ranked Louisiana State  held off a second-half Texas rally for a 124-113 victory Tuesday night at  Houston.  </P> <P> Jackson scored eight points in the first 3:29 as the Tigers (7-1), raced to a  16-3 lead and had a halftime margin of 63-49.  </P> <P> Texas (7-2) cut the deficit to 84-83, but never took the lead. Jackson made  eight of LSU's next 10 points to put the Tigers back in command.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of talent on this team, and I think we're capable of playing  like this every night," Jackson said.  </P> <P> The Tigers got inside help from Shaquille O'Neal, who had a Southeastern  Conference record 10 blocked shots, and from Stanley Roberts, who scored a  career-high 26 points.  </P> <P> Lance Blanks scored Texas' first eight points of the second half and led the  Longhorns with 32 points, and Travis Mays added 30.  </P> <P> "This is truly one of the greatest college basketball games I've ever been  involved in," LSU Coach Dale Brown said. "We got off to a slow start. I don't  think I lifted the team enough."  </P> <P> Jackson's total tied Southern Methodist's Gene Phillips for the most points  ever scored against the Longhorns. Phillips scored 51 against Texas on March 2,  1971.  </P> <P> Last season, Jackson set an NCAA Division-I freshman scoring record with 55  points in one game. His previous high this season was 37 points against  Southern Mississippi.  </P> <P> No. 3 Georgetown 83, Boston College 53 -- Dwayne Bryant, Alonzo Mourning and  Mark Tillmon led the Hoyas in their Big East Conference opener at Boston.  </P> <P> Georgetown (10-0, 1-0) led, 43-16, at halftime. The closest Boston College  (6-5, 0-2) came in the second half was 54-28, with 13:29 remaining.  </P> <P> Tillmon scored 18 points, Mourning 17 and Bryant a season-high 16.

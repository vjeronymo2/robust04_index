			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Office believes that the division of distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories provides an efficient manner for conducting such proceedings, and therefore will retain the use of the categories. In dividing distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories, we will look to Tribunal precedent for guidance, as well as the exigencies of each individual case. For these reasons, we do not believe that it is necessary to adopt separate procedures for Phase I and Phase II proceedings, as is suggested by Copyright Owners. The Copyright Royalty Tribunal functioned for fifteen years without separate rules for each type of proceeding, and exercised its discretion to divide each distribution into Phase I and Phase II categories on a case-by-case basis. The procedural rules of the subchapter applicable to distribution proceedings apply with equal basis to each controversy, regardless of whether it is Phase I or Phase II, and therefore do not require separate sets of rules. Furthermore, it is the Librarian who shall determine the number and category of controversies in each distribution proceeding, and submit each controversy or controversies to one or more CARPs as is appropriate. Copyright Owners are therefore correct in their assertion,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  comments at 14&hyph;15, that the nature and extent of controversies in one royalty distribution proceeding may require the convocation of more than one CARP for resolution. Thus, for example, a CARP may be convened to resolve controversies in Phase I, and another may be required at a later date to resolve controversies in Phase II. The only way to make such determinations is on a case-by-case basis, as was done by the former Tribunal, and the Office therefore heeds the advice of Copyright Owners by declining to adopt rules governing the identification and classification of Phase I/Phase II procedures which could ``create unnecessary rigidity that would fail to accommodate changing conditions.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Copyright Office also accepts Copyright Owners' suggestion of allowing parties to a proceeding to stipulate the definitions of Phase I categories and programs to the arbitrators in that proceeding. In order to allow arbitrators a sufficient amount of time to become familiar with the definitions, the Librarian will, in the notice establishing the 45-day precontroversy discovery period, instruct the parties to the proceeding to stipulate a complete set of definitions by the end of the precontroversy discovery period. If the parties are unable to reach agreement by that date, the Copyright Office will, in accordance with our authority to provide support to the CARPs under 17 U.S.C. 801(d), provide the arbitrators with the necessary definitions of Phase I categories and programs to allow them to accomplish their task.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Paper proceedings. Section 251.41(b) permits the parties to a proceeding to petition the Librarian to have their controversy decided solely on the submission of written pleadings. The petition may be granted if ``(1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, or (2) all parties to the controversy agree with the petition.'' 59 FR 23976 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copyright Owners believe that &sect;251.41(b)(2) is in need of clarification. They note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As currently drafted, Section 251.41(b)(2) allows rulings only in uncontested cases where ``all parties to the controversy agree with the petition.'' Of course, if all parties agree with the petition, then there would be no need for a ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copyright Owners believe that Section 251.41(b)(2) was intended to allow ruling where all parties agree  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> with the request  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> that the issue be decided by petition, regardless of whether they agree with the merits of the petition.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright Owners, comments at 31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright Owners' point is well taken. The intention of the rule is to allow the parties to a proceeding to petition the Librarian and dispense with formal proceedings. The CARP panel would then decide the controversy or rate adjustment on the basis of written pleadings only, i.e., a ``paper'' proceeding. In deciding whether to allow a paper proceeding before a CARP, the petition must demonstrate that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact involved in the proceeding (not the petition), or else 2) the parties unamimously agree that they wish to have a paper proceeding. If either one of these factors is properly represented in the petition, the Librarian may (not must) grant the petition, or can designate the issue of whether a paper proceeding would be proper to the CARP. Section 251.41(b)(2) is only intended to allow the Librarian to decide if a paper proceeding before a CARP would be appropriate; it is not designed to allow the Librarian to decide the merits of a paper proceeding or the case. To clarify the intention of the rule, we are amending it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Conduct of hearings: Role of arbitrators. Section 251.46(b) provides that ``Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or counsel as provided in this chapter, shall question witnesses.'' James Cannings argues that the rule, as drafted, precludes parties from appearing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro se  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> before the CARPs, since only the CARPs and ``counsel'' can question witnesses. Cannings, comments at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

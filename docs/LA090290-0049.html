			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HORSES AWAITING AIR TRANSPORT ARE SURELY MISSING THE BOAT  </P> <P> Trotters and pacers scheduled to run at Los Alamitos continue to get bumped . .  . from their flights west.  </P> <P> Morning Briefing recently noted pacing mare Time For Toni's stand-by status,  which arose when her cargo plane from New York was rerouted to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Since then, three more horses have had to wait because their planes were used  for military transport to the Middle East. One trotter had to be scratched from  a $15,000 event last Tuesday but will go to the post Tuesday.  </P> <P> The trotter's name: I Envy Noah.  </P> <P> Trivia time: In 1989-90, Michael Jordan won his fourth consecutive NBA scoring  championship, moving closer to Wilt Chamberlain, who won seven in a row from  1960-66. Which four players won three in a row?  </P> <P> "A Rison in the Sun": The Atlanta Journal keeps asking for it. Not satisfied  with the 1,168 responses to its request for new Falcon slogans, the paper  recently ran a contest to name wide receiver Andre Rison's touchdown dance.  </P> <P> Sorry, the deadline was Sept. 1.  </P> <P> First prize was two Falcon season tickets. And no wisecracks about second prize  being four.  </P> <P> No Bo, no Boz, no Boss: In its list of the 100 most influential Americans of  the 20th Century, a special issue of Life magazine includes four from the world  of sport: Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Jackie Robinson and Babe Ruth.  </P> <P> The magazine consulted with a group of 60 historians and other experts. Albert  Einstein was one of the 17 choices from science and medicine, and Elvis Presley  was one of seven musicians, along with Louis Armstrong, Irving Berlin, Leonard  Bernstein, Bing Crosby, Bob Dylan and Richard Rodgers.  </P> <P> Said Mary Steinbauer, editor of the special issue: "It's a list of the most  influential people of the past 100 years, not the most famous. In making our  selections we looked at how our lives would be different if each of our  honorees didn't live."  </P> <P> Call it the 4-and-7: Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle recently  previewed the 1990 Texas Christian football team. He asked quarterback Matt  Vogler, who is challenging Leon Clay for the starting job, to describe Coach  Jim Wacker's offense.  </P> <P> Said Vogler: "Well, it's . . . uh . . . well, it's sort of a wide-open,  controlled thing. It used to be a run-and-shoot with a veer, but we don't  really use the veer part anymore, so we're not a 'triple shoot' anymore. But  we're not a run-and-shoot, either. Not at all. But we are, sort of. . . . Well,  let's put it this way, we're a passing offense."  </P> <P> Add TCU offense: Feigen got this answer from starting quarterback Clay: "Well,  uh, that's a hard question. It's sort of an offbeat run-and-shoot. Sort of."  </P> <P> Last add TCU offense: Feigen then went to freshman Tim Schade, the third-team  quarterback and Coach Wacker's nephew.  </P> <P> Said Schade: "I don't know what to call it. I like it, though."  </P> <P> Two-way Patriot: New England Patriot linebacker Ed Reynolds, a member of the  Army Reserve, recently was promoted to captain in a ceremony before an  exhibition game against Cincinnati in Foxboro Stadium.  </P> <P> Although the Patriots would not have to pay him, and although he said that he  would be willing to forgo his $265,000 salary, team officials announced last  week that Reynolds would continue to receive his football checks if his unit  were called to duty.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: George Mikan, Neil Johnston, Bob McAdoo and George Gervin.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka, explaining why he didn't plan to  visit his own exhibit at the Pro Football Hall of Fame: "Somebody's probably  whitewashed my bust."

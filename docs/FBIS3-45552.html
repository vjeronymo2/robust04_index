To end a freeze in relations that was costing French firms  the opportunity to bid on large contracts in China, France was  forced to promise Wednesday not to sell the Nationalist island  any arms in future. China had imposed the freeze after the  French sold Taiwan jet fighters in 1992.    Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told his weekly press  conference that Beijing "has always attached importance" to its  relationship with France. "In recent years, however, the  authorisation by the previous French government of the sale of  arms has inflicted serious damage to Sino-French relations," he  said. "We believe that as long as the two sides strictly abide  by the principle underlying the estblishment of diplomatic ties  and the relevant principles elaborated in the joint communique,  Sino-French relations will be able gradually to improve and  develop," Wu said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["War Hysterics Carried Into Extremes" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The command of the U.S.  Forces occupying South Korea staged an "operation demonstration"  of a Patriot missile battery and the U.S. aircraft carriers  participating in the Rimpac joint manoeuvres will soon head for  the waters of the Korean peninsula. Commenting on this, NODONG  SINMUN today says the moves will drive the situation on the  Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. This indicates  that the United States intends to escalate threat to the DPRK  and, furthermore, commit a military adventure, the analyst says,  and continues:    In staging the Rimpac manoeuvres with our Republic as the  target of attack, the United States pursues the criminal scheme  to facilitate the combat actions of the "multinational forces"  against the DPRK in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula.    It is intensifying the reactionary offensive to stifle our  Republic with strength under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion  against the North" and even openly crying for "a preemptive  strike" at it.    It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets have taken the criminal road of carrying  into practice the already worked out "New Operation Plan 5027",  a war scenario against the North.    We are following with heightened vigilance the reckless  moves  of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to  unleash a nuclear war against our Republic at any cost.    War is by no means what we want.    If the South Korean puppets think they will get scot-free  after provoking a nuclear war against fellow countrymen, in  league with foreign forces, it is the height of folly.</p>

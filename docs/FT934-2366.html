			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pirelli to float up to half of Australian unit Pirelli, the Italian cables and tyres group, is to float up to half its Australian cables subsidiary to raise cash in the recession. The company will sell up to 50 per cent of Sydney-based Pirelli Cables Australia, which employs about 600 people and expects sales of ADollars 135m (USDollars 88.2m) this year. Pirelli, the world's second biggest cables maker, is joining a growing queue of companies taking advantage of local circumstances to float their Australian operations. The company did not indicate precise timing, but said the deal would take place within the next six months. Pirelli justified the decision, in which it is being advised by Baring Brothers, under a strategy to establish a local profile for the operation and provide access to domestic sources of equity. The Asian telecommunications market is growing extremely fast, and an Australian listing could help to raise additional funds.</p>

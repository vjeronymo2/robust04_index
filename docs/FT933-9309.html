Yesterday's fall was triggered by a US fund unwinding buying contracts late on Monday, traders said. The volume was 'hefty' and caused a knock-on effect in early LME trading. Cash copper closed Dollars 20.50 down at Dollars 1,937 a tonne, while three-months metal was Dollars 1,896.50, down Dollars 41. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said the near-term outlook for copper had deteriorated recently. This was reflected in a further increase in LME copper stocks yesterday to 471,900 tonnes, a 15-year peak. He said: 'If the squeeze is maintained, prices could move higher as the September options declaration approaches. But, if our assessment of the fundamentals is correct, a very sharp reversal could be in prospect.'</p>

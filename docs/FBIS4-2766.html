			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- In the first quarter  of this year, China's no. 1 railway construction project, the  Beijing-Kowloon (Jing-Jiu) line, used up an investment of 2.365  billion yuan, with 163 km of tracks laid.    Sources from the office for construction of the Jing-Jiu  railway said that by the end of last month, the project, which  was started in 1992, has applied a total investment of 10.696  billion yuan, with 626 km of tracks laid.    Statistics show that 76 percent of the total designed amount  of earth and stone for the whole line's railbed has been put  into place, while 62 percent of the bridges and 33 percent of  the tunnels have been finished.    The 2,370 km-long Jing-Jiu line goes through nine provinces  and municipalities from north to south. Originally, it was  scheduled for completion in 1997. However, to help ease the  present "jammed" conditions of the country's rail transport, the  government decided early last year to shorten the construction  term and finish the project by the end of 1995.    This year the Chinese Ministry of Railways plans to sink  11.3  billion yuan into the Jing-Jiu line, and 80-90 percent of the  project will have been finished by the end of the year.    An official from the ministry said that if the present  construction speed is maintained, the whole Jing-Jiu line will  be able to start operation by the end of 1995.</p>

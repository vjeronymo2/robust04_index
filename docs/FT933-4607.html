			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Deal gives S African blacks government role: Multiracial council will oversee transition SOUTH AFRICA's constitutional negotiators last night reached a milestone deal to bring blacks into central government for the first time, by agreeing to establish a multiparty Transitional Executive Council to oversee the transfer to democracy. The authority of the council will be limited, not least by the fact that the ruling National party is likely to be able to block the council's decisions in the most important areas. But the council marks the end of 45 years of exclusive National party rule, and represents a big psychological victory for black liberation movements - especially the African National Congress, which has fought apartheid for decades. The council, which will include one member from each of about 20 parties negotiating a new constitution, marks the first step towards full multiracial government. It is the first sign of concrete progress from constitutional talks that have dragged on for months. It may ease frustrations in South Africa's black townships, where patience with the process is wearing thin, and will lead to the lifting of remaining international economic sanctions apart from oil and arms embargoes. Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, said last night that the decision represented 'another step' towards lifting sanctions, adding that he expected the ANC to call for their removal later this month. The TEC will take office only when agreement has been reached on a new constitution - which might still take weeks or months. Equally, its installation might provoke a further surge in violence, with the ultra-right Conservative party and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi vowing to oppose it. The Conservative party said at the weekend that it would regard the installation of the TEC as a declaration of civil war, and Inkatha has said it will not respect the TEC's authority in the KwaZulu black homeland, which it controls. Other homeland governments have also rejected the council, although most - including Chief Buthelezi - are leaving open the option of joining the council later if the new constitution meets their demands. The TEC will have legally binding powers to act, but only in areas directly affecting the forthcoming multiracial elections, planned for April 27 next year. Its authority will be further circumscribed by the fact that the South Arican government (one of the parties to the council) will have what amounts to a veto over its decisions, which must be taken by majorities ranging from 65 per cent to 80 per cent. Government officials believe Pretoria and its allies could muster the votes necessary to block TEC decisions. Pretoria veto, Page 4</p>

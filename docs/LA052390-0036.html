			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Judge to View Mapplethorpe Photos: A judge said Tuesday he will view the  controversial Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibition before it closes at  Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center this weekend. Hamilton County Municipal  Judge David Albanese, scheduled to be the trial judge in an obscenity case  concerning the photos, said he will keep the date and time of his visit a  secret in order to prevent his tour from becoming a media circus. Attorneys for  both the prosecution and defense had requested that the judge look at the  exhibit before it leaves Cincinnati for Boston. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Elderly or Disabled_7 CFR 271.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 350 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 added three categories to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of elderly or disabled persons. These categories are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Recipients of interim assistance benefits pending the receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of supplemental security income (SSI); (2) recipients of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability-related medical assistance benefits under title XIX of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Social Security Act (SSA); and (3) recipients of disability-based State general assistance benefits. Recipients of any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these benefits must be treated as disabled persons for food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes provided the eligibility to receive these benefits is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon disability or blindness criteria which are at least as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent as those under title XVI of the SSA. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in the interim rulemaking to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received several comments suggesting changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim rule language. One commenter stated that it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unclear in the rule language that receipt of interim assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is involved in only the first of the three new categories of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled member. The Department shares the commenter's concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in this rulemaking to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly indicate that receipt of interim assistance as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of being defined as disabled for food stamp purposes is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only required for those persons who are interim recipients of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter stated that it is unclear in the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language if it is only disability-based State general assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (GA) that must be based upon disability or blindness criteria at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least as stringent as title XVI of the SSA, or whether the ``at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least as stringent'' requirement applies to all three types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits. The Department interprets the law to require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``at least as stringent'' criteria apply to all three types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits. The regulatory language at 7 CFR 271.2 is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter pointed out that the definition of elderly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled persons in 7 CFR 271.2 needs to be revised to clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that it is State programs, not individual cases, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be measured by the ``at least as stringent criteria as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under title XVI of the Social Security Act'' requirement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter argued that the regulation, as it is written in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, appears to state that the decision as to whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GA program is based on criteria as stringent as those under title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> XVI of the Social Security Act can be made on a case-by-case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. The commenter argued, however, that the intent of Public Law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100&hyph;435 was for this decision to be made on a State-by-State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, not case-by-case. The Department agrees with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to further emphasize that State disability programs will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be measured by criteria at least as stringent as those under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title XVI, the Department has decided to further amend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``Elderly or disabled member'' in this final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include in paragraph (11) of the definition the specific citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the SSA regulations interpreting title XVI of the SSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Including this citation will provide State and local agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the information necessary to determine if an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for food stamps meets the definition of elderly/disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person as set forth in the Food Stamp Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

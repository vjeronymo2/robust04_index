			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- The chief of a Japanese  construction industry group Wednesday [2 March] criticized  another construction industry group's request that member  companies refrain from "dumping" in their bids for public works  contracts.    Taira Shibata, chairman of the Japan Civil Engineering  Contractors Association and president of Nishimatsu Construction  Co., told reporters the proposal to curb bids of less than fair  value could restrict bid value and contravene the Antimonopoly  Law.    His comments were made in response to the request by Kenji  Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction  Contractors and president of Maeda Corp., on February 21.    Shibata said fair value is difficult to define, since  contractors sometimes cut their bids through active  cost-reduction efforts.    Low bids also mean more competitive bidding through measures  to restrict the practice of bid rigging, Shibata said.</p>

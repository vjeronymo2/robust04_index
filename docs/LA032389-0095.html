			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States said it has sent a high-level delegation to Iraq to press for  compensation that Baghdad promised to families of American sailors killed in  the 1987 attack on the frigate Stark. State Department spokesman Charles Redman  said the delegation was led by Abraham D. Sofaer, the department's legal  adviser, to persuade the Iraqis to pay the claims. After an Iraqi warplane  fired two Exocet missiles at the Stark in the Persian Gulf on May 17, 1987,  Baghdad promised to pay compensation to the families of the 37 sailors killed.  The U.S. government presented its claims last April, asking Iraq to pay each  victim's family $800,000.  </P></p>

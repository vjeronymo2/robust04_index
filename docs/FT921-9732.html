			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Stasi chief goes on trial MR ERICH MIELKE, the 84-year-old head of the former Stasi, East Germany's feared security police, yesterday became the most senior member of the Communist leadership to be placed on trial. He was charged with murdering two policemen in 1931 as a young Communist seeking revenge for the murder of a Party member. Only later is Mr Mielke to be tried for crimes he allegedly committed against east Germans - including an order to shoot would-be escapees to the West - after becoming Stasi chief in 1956. Mr Mielke, hunched under a brown leather hat and clutching a cane, was carried on a chair into the Berlin courtroom where he proclaimed that he was 'feeling rotten.' He has been held for nearly two years in a hospital cell of an adjoining prison. Mr Hubert Dreyling, his lawyer, demanded that the trial be called off because he claimed that the crimes happened too long ago and that prosecutors' evidence was inadmissible and sometimes forged. The defence also argued that the evidence relied on the Nazi regime's 1934 trial of Mr Mielke's party accomplices, many of whom were tortured by the SS militia or Gestapo security police. Mr Mielke and a colleague were subsequently found guilty of first degree murder but fled to the Soviet Union. As Minister of State Security, a post he held for 33 years, he hid the investigation findings and a 1934 order for his arrest at his home, where they were found on his arrest. The court proceedings were interrupted at one point when a young man leapt to his feet and cried out that the trial was 'pure fascism.' He was ejected from the courtroom. Outside, members of leftist groups protested against the trial. The Berlin state prosecution, however, believes it has its strongest case in the 1931 killings.</p>

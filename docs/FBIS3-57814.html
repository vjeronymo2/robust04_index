			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Armand De Decker, president of the Liberal </F> Group in the Assembly of the Western European Union: "The  Summit of Errors"]    [Text] The Atlantic alliance is at a crossroads.  Disoriented by the implosion of the USSR and the dismantling of  the Warsaw Pact, it is trying to get its breath -- so far  without success.    Yet the challenges are many. Europe has never known such a  threatening period, one so laden with risks since the time when,  in the face of Stalinist imperialism, it decided to create the  WEU [Western European Union] and then, in 1949, to join NATO.    It is true, however, that the great ideological battle  between communism and capitalism is dead, more because of the  resounding failure of the former than the victory of the latter.    Many Western governments, including that of the United  States, have unfortunately made the mistake of believing that  the disappearance of this opposition of two blocs would  necessarily lead to the dawn of an era of peace and the  disappearance of the risk of a major conflict in Europe.    Nothing could be further from the truth!    The death of the great dragon of communism allowed the  reappearance of the old demons of nationalism, racism, religious  fanaticism, intolerance, and populism, which, in interaction,  could just as surely lead to widespread war in Europe.    Yet the United States has withdrawn more than 200,000  soldiers from Europe, leaving just a symbolic contingent of  100,000 men, which certain congressmen would like to reduce even  further.    The countries of West Europe, hard hit by an unprecedented  structural crisis, are also blindly reducing their military  budgets and staff, even though the American disengagement should  make them more responsible for their own security.    Of course the WEU has been revitalized and was officially  assigned in Maastricht to become the military wing of the  European Union, but its budgets and resources remain  ridiculously insignificant.    In this context, the NATO summit to be held in Brussels on  10  January will take on special importance.    Either the allies will recover their self-control, define  priorities, and give NATO a new mission, or we risk seriously  compromising the capacity of the Western democratic world for  managing crises which will surely rock Europe in the near future.    The main challenge to be taken up by the alliance in the  short term is to respond to the pathetic appeal of the countries  of Central Europe that are seeking protection and security.    Czech President Vaclav Havel has explained better than  anyone  else why his country wanted -- legitimately -- to join NATO.    NATO exists to defend democracies in Europe -- even new ones  -- wishing to live in liberty and a rule of law state.    The Iron Curtain did not fall so that we could take the  states that were victims of Soviet totalitarianism for more than  40 years and toss them into the insecurity created by their  Russian neighbors. If that was the desire of the governments of  the alliance, the Brussels summit would just as shamefully take  its place in history as did the sadly famous Munich accords, and  even the Yalta accords.    And yet, under the influence of the hesitant diplomacy of  the  Clinton Administration, the member countries of the alliance are  preparing -- in response to applications for membership from  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary -- to propose  a bogus form of membership called Partnership for Peace, which,  in the eyes of the candidate countries, will soon look like a  blunt refusal.    Indeed, like in Cold War times -- not wanting to collide  with  the large and still powerful Russia -- the United States, which  naively thinks that we can still trust the Russian leaders and  Boris Yeltsin in particular, is preparing to obey the veto that  Moscow has put on any expansion of the alliance.    What a mistake!  <H5>  A Window of Freedom That Risks Being Closed Again </H5>   The implosion of the USSR and the fall of the Iron Curtain  have opened up a window of freedom to the East that risks being  closed again very soon.    Russia is in the midst of an anarchy that is preparing the  ground for a new dictatorship. With every day, the Army is  regaining more of the power it temporarily lost, while fascist  forces are trying to take power via elections. We have already  seen this somewhere else....    In this context, it is normal that the instability being  experienced in the USSR, just like the traditional imperialism  of the greater Russia, should frighten her neighbors.    It is our duty to respond to this generously, firmly, and  clearly!    Not to do so would risk costing us very dearly in the long  term.    History constantly reminds us that peace and freedom must be  earned every day.    Have we fallen so deep into the cowardice and blind egoism  which are already sadly guiding our steps in the former  Yugoslavia?    Have we lost so much moral sense that we are no longer  capable of defending our primary interest: peace in liberty?</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Analysis service launched MAID SYSTEMS, a privately owned electronic publisher, has secured deals with six large corporate information groups to establish a screen-based service in financial intelligence. The service, Companyline, will provide information from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Disclosure, Moody's, Extel Financial, ICC and Hemmington Scott, publisher of the Hambro Company Guide. Maid - Market Analysis and Information Database - says Companyline will provide access on computer screens to the financial results and reports of 4.5m companies in 40 countries, plus credit ratings, brokers' analyses and directors' curricula vitae. The new service will be in direct competition with Profile, owned by the Financial Times group, and with the Swiss company DataStar as well as Mead Data Central and Dialogue of the US. It will also compete with Reuter, the world's largest electronic publisher. Maid Systems was founded by Mr Wagner in 1985. Its existing services are Researchline and Newsline. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 470,000 on sales of about Pounds 3.4m.</p>

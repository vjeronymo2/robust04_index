[Cavallo] This pressure are gradually decreasing. I believe  the government is becoming increasingly consistent. It has  learned to work more as a team, to show more solidarity.    [LA NACION] Yet the impression remains that someone is  interested in pitting you against the president, more to affect  your image than to destabilize your policies.    [Cavallo] Not from within the government. The problem in  Argentina is that press informers and journalists are used as  instruments in the political struggle. [passage omitted]    [LA NACION] Do you believe a political struggle is at the  root of the problem?    [Cavallo] Undoubtedly, I repeat: I am not attacking the  media. I have a very good opinion of CLARIN and LA NACION  newspapers. I mention them because they are undoubtedly the  prestigious and independent media. But I ask myself: Why is the  press used to lie?    [LA NACION] And what is your answer?    [Cavallo] It stirs up the system. It makes the solution of  any problem and the balance of conflictive interests more  difficult. It can be compared with inflation within the  economy. It disturbs everything. I am aware this type of  conflict exists in any nation. When the system of communications  enables citizens to be informed in a sincere way, it resembles a  stabilized economy. It is more honest. [passage omitted]    [LA NACION] If the president is reelected, will you be his  economy minister?    [Cavallo] I cannot answer that. Only the president can  answer that. I have demonstrated my vocation to work with him.    [LA NACION] And then?    [Cavallo] I can say that unless the president fires me, I  will not abandon him. Those who believe I may leave, slamming  the door, or threaten to leave are mistaken. This is at odds  with my personal behavior. I feel extremely responsible as  Menem's economy minister and I will not jeopardize the success  of my task over petty or insignificant personal differences that  I may have to endure.    [LA NACION] How is Brazil's proposal applicable to the  integration of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the  entry into NAFTA?    [Cavallo] It is a very intelligent proposal. If we merely  stick with Mercosur and do not join larger free trade zones or  negotiate broader free trade agreements, we will be at a  disadvantage, for example, with Mexico.    Brazil's proposal has a significant practical meaning: We  can  negotiate free trade agreements using the methods agreed upon  with other countries.    [LA NACION] Would this include a strategy to join NAFTA if  we  are unilaterally eligible?    [Cavallo] We must always agree on methods of negotiation  with  our Mercosur partners. At least, I imagine each country will  inform its partners.    [LA NACION] What will be Argentina's strategy toward NAFTA?    [Cavallo] I will not comment on this issue. I may have my  opinion, but the government must decide. It requires  negotiation and an exchange of information with the other  Mercosur partners.    [LA NACION] How do you view [Brazilian Finance] Minister  [Fernando Henrique] Cardoso's economic program?    [Cavallo] I concur with it. I believe it represents the best  way for Brazil to achieve, in the short term, a certain degree  of stability of its economy and fully regain its growth rate.    [LA NACION] Cardoso proposed zero inflation by the end of  the  year. Is this possible?    [Cavallo] Of course it is possible. In December 1991, after  just eight months of implementing its economic program,  Argentina achieved a 0.4-percent inflation rate, that's nearly  zero inflation. If Argentina achieved this, why not Brazil?    It must also be borne in mind that Brazil has achieved  significant progress in fiscal matters.    [Passage omitted] [LA NACION] Will the UCR [Radical Civic  Union] continue to be the main opposition force?    [Cavallo] I believe the UCR will continue to be the main  opposition party despite its crisis. The UCR's great problem is  that, following its wise stance on the constitutional reform  issue, it must explain its change of position.    I believe the UCR will overcome this situation. I believe  Argentina will basically be a bipartisan country with rotating  governments. One of the parties, namely the Justicialist Party  [PJ] of the future, will have a more social-Christian, a more  liberal approach in economic matters. The other party, namely  the UCR, will have a more social-democratic approach.    [LA NACION] What will be the term for this rotation?    [Cavallo] Well, Argentina has struck lucky. The UCR, which  is truly conservative and has great resistance to change, will  again govern our country when changes are no longer necessary  because we will already have the appropriate rules and be  functioning well in political, economic, and social fields. So,  there is nothing better than a conservative stance like that of  the UCR to keep things functioning well. Right now a courageous  party like the PJ, with someone like Menem -- who has a  straightforward relationship with the people -- is required.    Yet when great changes are no longer required, just marginal  touch-ups, it will probably be time for a more conservative  force with greater reluctance toward changes and risks -- like  the UCR. [passage omitted]    [LA NACION] There is talk of impending measures to reduce  costs and encourage exports. What is the plan?    [Cavallo] We announced the most significant measures at the  very beginning and complemented them in early 1991. Since then,  we merely implemented the announced policies.    By 1 March, most agricultural, livestock, industrial,  mining,  and construction sectors and part of the tourism sector will  have received their full tax deductions on payrolls.    Within the next few days we will announce details of the car  imports system for the next five years. This system was devised  in 1991. It will run for eight years, until 1999 when the  general rules and regulations will be implemented. We announced  the import quotas for 1991, 1992, and 1993. We will now  announce the quotas as of this year.    We must accurately determine the repercussions of those car  companies that did not balance their imports -- under the  special 2- percent tariff -- with their exports of finished  vehicles or parts, within the first three years as specified.    [LA NACION] The problems are there. What will be done about  them?    [Cavallo] There will be a deficit in compensation  accumulated  until mid-1993. This problem has been stopped because we  authorize the car companies to import under the 2-percent tariff  only on the basis of their real exports for the preceding month.  The problem lies in reconciling excessive imports under the  2-percent tariff against accumulated exports which, in  principle, the companies are allowed to use in their calculation  until the end of the year.

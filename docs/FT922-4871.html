			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Danes say No to Maastricht: Narrow vote against treaty blocks pact on European political and monetary union DANISH VOTERS last night threw into confusion the future plans of the European Community by rejecting the Maastricht Treaty and thereby blocking the current EC accord on European political and monetary union. The surprise result - by the narrowest of margins in a referendum - will force the other 11 EC states to renegotiate the accord if, as seems likely, a modified form of the treaty is to go ahead. The painstakingly-negotiated treaty, requiring unanimous agreement, was intended to become the EC's new constitution, replacing the 34-year-old founding Treaty of Rome. It was to have led to a single currency by 1999, the gradual building of a common foreign and security policy, and eventually to a common defence policy. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, current holder of the EC presidency, expressed deep disappointment at the Danish vote, which is binding on the Copenhagen government. EC foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting in Oslo tomorrow, on the sidelines of scheduled Nato talks, to discuss the implications. Mr Poul Schluter, Danish prime minister, said: 'I am convinced that the other 11 members will carry out the Maastricht treaty, so it is up to us to get as much out of the situation as possible.' In London, the vote was being assessed by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Downing Street pointed out that the UK government had yet to hear officially what the Danish administration planned to do. The outcome of the referendum was welcomed by vocal critics at Westminster of the Maastricht accord. Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will today discuss the matter, which could have a significant impact on the UK presidency of the Community, which starts at the beginning of next month. The Danish vote also throws into doubt the aim of Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds for a strong Yes vote in his country's referendum in two weeks' time. Mr Dick Spring, Irish opposition Labour party leader, said last night that Ireland should consider postponing its vote. In yesterday's referendum, 50.7 per cent voted against the treaty, with 49.3 per cent voting in favour. Turnout was 82.9 per cent. In rejecting the Maastricht treaty, the voters ignored the advice of the political establishment, both sides of industry and an almost unanimous press. The referendum cannot be overturned by the Folketing (parliament). Financial markets, which had counted on a Yes vote, were also surprised by the outcome, which confounded the opinion pollsters, whose surveys in the past few days had pointed to a narrow victory for Maastricht. Other EC governments including the UK, Germany and France, have said in recent weeks that a Danish No vote would not stop them from implementing European political union. But a senior EC official said last night: 'There is an insurmountable requirement that if any of the 12 member states does not ratify it, Maastricht goes down the drain. We have made no contingency planning for a rejection.' Currency and bond markets reacted cautiously to early indications of the Danish vote. Dealers reported buying interest in other member currencies of the European Monetary System, pushing the Danish krone down a little. The Danish government benchmark 10-year bond fell two points to 99.80 in inter-bank trading in Copenhagen. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, who fought hard to persuade voters to accept the treaty, said: 'We face a very difficult time. We must now think things through very carefully.' He said it was too early to say whether the government might consider trying to reverse last night's vote in a new referendum. The Danish vote may have a significant effect on opinion in the other Nordic countries, such as Sweden and Finland, which have already applied for EC membership. Danes say No, Page 3 Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: Pools of plenty in a parched land - Namibia's water holes are a magnet for all forms of wildlife PEOPLE LINED the walls three deep, murmuring to one another with the hushed reverence of a religious ceremony, the anticipation of a theatre audience and the suppressed excitement of a rock concert. Floodlights bathed the stage and yet we did not know who would star, what the performance would be, or even if the show was to go on. Then, soundlessly, a hook-lipped rhino cow entered the light followed by her calf. Silence fell at the sight of these rare beasts - followed almost at once by a restrained gasp, for they were trailed by a lion and a lioness. Then, to the rescue, came a male rhino, and the lions backed off. But, like all the best dramas, the hero's motives were far from pure: the rhino was more interested in having sex with the female than in saving the calf. Meanwhile, enter stage right a grinning jackal, head held high with a guinea fowl grasped in its jaws, before exiting stage left. Okaukuejo's water hole on a Saturday night is certainly the place for action. This is the largest of Etosha National Park's three rest camps, and its floodlit water hole is a perfect way for people to enjoy exciting African mammals without being confined to a vehicle. Namibia's vast distances mean many hours on the road, and Okaukuejo came as a welcome break. Etosha is best known for its immense white pan - acres of dried mud with a far-off glitter, as if from an incoming tide. It floods rarely, though, and then with water twice as salty as the sea. The wildlife is attracted to the many perennial springs along the pan's southern shore, and there is constant activity at these shrinking pools. Elephant families wash and drink with abandon, nervous kudu approach with infinite caution, and groups of ostriches drink alternately, their heads smoothly lifting and falling like the well-oiled parts of a machine, some scooping water while others swallow, watching for danger. Once, an observant giraffe, staring from on high, located a skulking leopard slinking through the bushes on the far side of the water. France-sized and with about 1m inhabitants, Namibia is still wild enough to have significant numbers of game outside its parks, and any water in this parched country draws animals like moths to a candle. We watched rare desert elephants pad in to drink at Palmwag and stay to browse the well watered grounds of the rest camp through the night. Many hundred miles south, in the Fish River Canyon, a distant pair of olive klipspringers on ballet points danced nimbly down the smooth rocks to drink from one of the remaining pools on the canyon floor. Prior booking and a doctor's certificate are required to walk this canyon, which is second only to the Grand Canyon in size. Walkers complete their five-day trek at Ai-Ais, a hot spring resort in the midst of the stony desert where the outdoor pool, as warm as a bath, discourages all but the laziest of strokes, while the two whirlpool baths are almost too hot for anything but a tentative toe. Not all of the Namib is stony, though, and the Sossusvlei area boasts the highest dunes in the world. Lofty, and with dramatic peaks, their sandy faces are sheets of colour which, in the changing light, take on the pinks, creams, oranges and greens of ice cream, a strange sight for a desert. The long ridges beg to be climbed and, labouring upwards over the shifting sand, I was suddenly aware of a profound silence. Conversations on a neighbouring dune over half-a-mile away were easy to hear. The ranges of sand roll away in all directions, apparently without life, although an occasional oryx with ribs showing through corrugated flanks somehow ekes out a living in this barren land. Awesome though it is, this giant sand pit is also fun, and suddenly we were running and tumbling down the steepest face, though not with quite the same whooping abandon as the two Frenchwomen who followed us. Diamonds were found among the sand grains on the surface of the Namib during the last century, and the mining town of Kolmanskop was established in the midst of the desert. For a time it flourished, its communal hall seeing plays and gymnastic displays put on by the fit young German immigrants living there. As the diamonds failed and the focus of interest moved towards the sea, the town fell into disrepair and is even now being drowned by waves of sand. Another town which reflects Namibia's German colonial past is Swakopmund but, far from becoming a ghost town, it has just celebrated its centenary. Regarded as the country's premier holiday resort, it attracts the residents of a summer-baked Windhoek to enjoy its coolness and even its cloud. The chilling Benguela Current brings thick mists rolling in from the Atlantic to moisten the air; in the past, it also brought numerous ships to founder on the rocky western shore. Swakopmund is almost more German than Germany itself. Its colonial architecture has been lovingly preserved and, after the rigours of the desert, the pastries in its cafes and the Teutonic dishes to be enjoyed in its restaurants seem luxury indeed. Although distances are great and the roads long, dusty and ruler-straight to the horizon, possibly 30 miles away, one of the joys of driving yourself in Namibia is the chance to stay on its guest farms. Unimpressive in appearance, Otjitambo turned out to be a gem. We dined on fresh produce, home-made bread and game shot on the farm, overlooked by a set of oryx heads collected specifically for the odd twists and turns to their normally slightly curved horns. At dawn, we climbed a nearby kopje of rounded granite boulders adorned with grey-barked ghost trees to watch the sun rise; in the evening, we soaked the dust away in a deep bath fed by one of the two hot springs in northern Namibia. We stayed just one night, but a week would not have been too long. Michael Woods was a guest of Air Namibia and Namibia Tourism, which share a London office (tel: 081-543-2122; fax: 081-543-3398). Air Namibia flies directly from Heathrow to Windhoek, Namibia's capital. Companies offering fly-drives to Namibia include: Sunvil Holidays (tel: 081-568-4499); Southern Africa Travel (0904-692469); Art of Travel (071-738-2038). Driving on Namibia's tarred roads is easy. There is little traffic and driving is on the left. Great care is advised on dirt roads, however, and a maximum 50mph is recommended. You should carry water, extra fuel and at least one sound spare tyre. Living is cheap with fuel at 30p a litre (cash only), restaurant meals with wine about Pounds 10 a head, and full-board accommodation Pounds 30 a night or less. Camping is simple with plenty of good facilities; equipment can be hired.</p>

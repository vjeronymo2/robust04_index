			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 15% profit rise for Inishtech Inishtech, the diversified Irish-based group, recorded a 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profit for the opening half of 1992. It rose from IPounds 3.09m to IPounds 3.56m, or Pounds 3.36m, as turnover climbed 29 per cent to IPounds 24.2m. Earnings per share were 18.3p (16p). Group activities cover the manufacture of disposable hygiene products, protective packaging, industrial design and printing, and self adhesive labels. Since acquisition Douthwaites Florists Sundries had performed up to expectations. In 1991 its pre-tax profit margin was 11 per cent and that will have the effect of somewhat reducing the group's overall margin.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rumbold campaigns on animal rights ANIMAL WELFARE seemed an odd issue for the Conservatives to highlight on a day when Tory strategists were desperate to close the opinion poll gap on Labour, but Mrs Angela Rumbold had a go. The formidable Home Office minister insisted at a London news conference that the Conservatives had a much better record on animal welfare than any other party. Animal welfare is a particularly sensitive issue for the Tories because of the vehemence of views on bloodsports and factory farming. Mrs Rumbold pledged a Conservative government would oppose a resumption of the trade in ivory or elephant products, urge Britain's EC partners to bring welfare standards up to UK levels, and press for higher EC standards for keeping battery hens. She seized on reports that Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, had promised a ban on foxhunting as 'possibly another instance of Labour being unable to hold to their manifesto pledges.' The Tories believed the issue was one for individual conscience. Dr David Clark, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said later animal welfare would be a high priority for a Labour government, and measures would include banning the testing of beauty aids on animals. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, promised a watchdog body, the Animal Protection Commission.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading for Capital Radio Capital Radio, the independent radio broadcaster for London, saw its pre-tax profit for the six months to March 31 fall 18 per cent from Pounds 5.01m to Pounds 4.11m in continuing difficult trading conditions. Operating costs increased by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 11.1m as a result of a planned increase in spending on audience promotional activities and costs relating to independent radio's dispute over royalty rates to record companies. Turnover advanced 3 per cent to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 15.7m). Earnings per share were 3.9p (5p) but the interim dividend has been maintained at 1.75p. There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 1.58m from the sale of the Duke of York's Theatre.</p>

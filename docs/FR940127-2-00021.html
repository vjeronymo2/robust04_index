In creating the Act Congress stated, ``what is needed is a partnership between the Federal Government, domestic manufacturers, marketers, and potential users of renewable energy *&blank;*&blank;* technologies.'' Without this partnership, the availability of these technologies for domestic industry could be substantially delayed.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As defined in the Act, an emerging RE technology is one that has already been proven to work, but which has not been commercialized or has been limited to sub-commercial demonstration or quantities, to restricted or controlled operation, or to only selected applications. Awards under the solicitation will be Grants or Cooperative Agreements (depending on the scope of the project and need for substantial DOE involvement) administered in accordance with 10 CFR 600, DOE's Financial Assistance Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following are RE areas that DOE will consider for financial assistance under the solicitation: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Demonstration of the market readiness of an emerging technology in a new application or environment or at a sufficient scale or size likely to encourage private investment in commercial facilities or systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Market introduction activities of a product or service having potentially high energy payoff and/or high replication value by other users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Financial support that will reduce risk for, or otherwise enable, private financing of a new venture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Financial assistance that will enable private sector investment in new RE manufacturing, evaluation and test, or quality control facilities leading to commercial product introduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects may include those for the production or delivery of electricity, thermal energy, or other forms of energy using renewable energy technology; or, improvements in, or expansion of, facilities for the manufacture of renewable energy technologies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects selected are expected to include, but are not limited to, the following specific areas of renewable energy technology: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

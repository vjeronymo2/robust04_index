			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (7): Mixing business with pleasure - Focus on the island republic of Cyprus TRAVELLERS with Cyprus Airways are left with few doubts about how many see the republic's vocation. The current issue of the airline's Sunjet in-flight magazine contains five-and-a-half pages of advertising from accountancy firms and several more pages from banks, insurers and business management services, reports David Lane. This year nearly two million tourists will have enjoyed the sun, sea and sand of Cyprus's resorts, and perhaps discovered some of the island's other attractions. Those holidaymakers willing to mix business with pleasure, or looking for entrepreneurial opportunities, are urged by Deloitte &amp; Touche to discover financial Cyprus. And Grant Thornton member Costouris Michaelides tells Sunjet readers that 'nobody gets closer to offshore clients.' Offshore operations is an important and growing sector of the economy - 'last year, the Central Bank issued permits for the registration of 2,039 offshore enterprises, a record number,' says George Georgiou, an official with the International Division. By the end of last year more than 10,000 had been issued, about 4,000 of which were in the past three years. 'Not all the licences are active. But over 1,000 companies have offices, while between 400 and 500 are brass plate operations,' adds Mr Georgiou. Gross foreign exchange revenues from offshore enterprises have doubled during the past five years, reaching CYP95m last year - 'this was about 6 per cent of foreign exchange earnings,' he adds. The Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part of the island in 1974 was a stimulus for turning Cyprus into an international business centre. The first incentives were introduced in 1975 with enactment of legislation on income tax and exchange controls. Corporate profits are taxed at 4.25 per cent and expatriate employees working for offshore enterprises enjoy tax privileges. Pointing to the republic's 19 double taxation treaties, Mr Georgiou emphasises that Cyprus is not a tax haven - 'the authorities vet applications carefully. Reporting requirements and administrative procedures are strict, and good corporate conduct is a condition for permit renewal. Scandal-avoidance is the watchword.' What types of business chose Cyprus? General trading, marketing, distribution, regional management and consultancies are high on the list. Coca Cola, re-locating its Near East offices from Cairo, is an example. Journalists and news agencies whose Cyprus bureaux cover the Near and Middle East, are another. However, shipping is particularly important. There were nearly 100 ship management and maritime services companies operating in Cyprus at the end of last year, and they accounted for about one fifth of the total of 4,100 staff employed by the Republic's offshore enterprises. With 1,700 ocean-going vessels (totalling about 23m gross tons registered under the Cypriot flag), Cyprus is near the head of global shipping rankings. Mr Serghios Serghiou, director of the Department of Merchant Shipping, notes that Cyprus was historically a maritime power. Indeed, its ships are mentioned in the Iliad. However, today's position owes little to tradition. 'When Cyprus became independent in 1960, the government looked for sectors of relative advantage that should be developed, and shipping was identified. 'The republic's first merchant shipping laws were enacted in 1963 and, like subsequent legislation, were modelled on UK laws,' says Mr Serghiou. DEVELOPMENTS at the end of the 1970s underlie Cyprus's rise in the international shipping league. After incidents involving Cypriot-flagged vessels, the authorities acted to strengthen regulation of the shipping sector, Mr Serghiou's Department being established in 1980. 'Our 16 surveyors and maritime offices in Piraeus, London and New York demonstrate the authorities' determination that Cyprus should be a flag of prestige, not of convenience. 'Enhancement of safety standards is an objective. Though operating an open registry, Cypriot regulations aim for best maritime practice in vessels carrying its flag,' says Mr Serghiou. The republic's favourable tax regime is the determining factor for shipowners and for third-party ship management companies. But there are other reasons why Cyprus has been chosen by the shipping industry and by many companies in other sectors. The island's position at the junction of Europe and Asia, and close to the Suez Canal, gives a strong geographical advantage. Good air connections and excellent telecommunications also draw business. Competitive rents and costs of labour and services earn points for Cyprus when location decisions are being made. And a population with a high level of education, plus an efficient civil service, have also helped to consolidate Cyprus's popularity as an international business centre. Though it has been successful in establishing itself as an offshore and shipping centre, Cyprus has difficulty in attracting investment for manufacturing. Restrictions on foreign ownership are a handicap. But there is an exempt Industrial Free Zone in Larnaca for manufacturing for export, and derogations can be made for some inward investment projects - 'our need for a more diversified economy and for technological upgrading in manufacturing has been highlighted by the slowdown in growth,' says Mr Andreas Charalambous, of the planning bureau. He mentions that the government established the Institute of Technology last year with the aim of raising the technological content of goods manufactured in the republic. 'We are squeezed between developing and developed countries. We need to shift to higher added value in manufacturing, and to compete on quality rather than cost,' says Mr Charalambous. Like other officials, he underlines the republic's commitment to an open, free market economy. RELATIONS with the EC, whose members currently take 60 per cent of Cypriot exports and with whom a customs union will be completed by 1997, are a central priority. Cyprus has applied for membership and the Commission gave a generally positive opinion this summer. Meanwhile, the republic's economic indicators outshine many EC states. Growth has been strong, and the current account generally in equilibrium. Though the budget deficit and debt service ratios are low by EC standards, the government is nevertheless planning to strengthen the fiscal accounts - 'this will permit liberalisation of commercial bank lending rates which are currently subject to a 9 per cent ceiling,' says Mr Charalambous. Removing this constraint should help the authorities to check inflation, which has been on a steadily upward trend, albeit still only 6.5 per cent last year. With per capita GDP of Dollars 11,281, Cyprus has a key indicator in-line with EC aspirations. But there are reservations among future EC partners about the political situation. Since the Turkish invasion, the island has been divided by the 'Green Line,' policed by UN troops. The EC would like a return to normality; however, the division has not been a deterrent to the many foreign businesses that have chosen the island republic. Concerns about security, large or small scale, appear to weigh lightly on businessmen. Notwithstanding the UN peacekeepers, the social climate is relaxed - and the fact that street crime is not a problem is evidenced by the local practice of leaving cars unlocked. In a corner of the Mediterranean that has been characterised by conflict, lack of infrastructure and inefficiency, Cyprus offers a haven of tranquillity and functionality.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for 1992 (with projections for 1993 in brackets): Real GDP growth: 8.5 per cent; (1.0 per cent).

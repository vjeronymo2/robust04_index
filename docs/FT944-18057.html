			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Upton considers fund raising Shares in Upton &amp; Southern slipped  1/2 p yesterday to 7p when the department store group announced it was considering raising additional equity capital. In February, it bought Reject Shop, the furniture and household goods chain, for Pounds 2.5m in an all-paper deal. In August, Upton announced that the financial and trading position of Reject Shop was materially worse than had been represented at the time of the recommended offer, resulting in a Pounds 2.75m cash shortfall. About one third of the stock Upton expected in Reject Shop was found not to be there. It said it was considering legal action not only against some former directors of the Reject Shop, but also against its own financial advisers.</p>

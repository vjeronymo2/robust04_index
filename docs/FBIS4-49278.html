			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 30 (XINHUA) -- President Farooq  Leghari today highly praised the Chinese experts working in  Saindak project for their efforts to complete the project six  months ahead of schedule.    Leghari, who visited the project near Pak-Iran border in  Balochistan province today, said that the Saindak project would  help further cement the already friendly ties between Pakistan  and China.    He said the completion of the Saindak project would usher in  new era of prosperity and progress in Balochistan province.    The project, under construction of Chinese engineers, is  expected to yield for 19 years an average annual production of  15,810 tons of copper, 1.47 tons of gold and 2.76 tons of silver.    The products will be exported to China, Japan and the United  Kingdom and other European countries at international prices.    The project will also result in creating 1,288 direct and  11,000 indirect jobs, mostly for people of Balochistan.    Saindak is about 700 kilometres from Quetta, capital of  Balochistan province.    Saindak project, one of the biggest project in the mineral  sector in Pakistan, would be completed in February 1995, six  months ahead of the schedule, resulting in savings of about 30  million U.S. dollars in the project cost.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Barlow quits PA MR Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has resigned from the board of the Press Association, the domestic UK news agency. Mr Barlow had been expected to become the next chairman of the organisation in succession to Sir Richard Storey. The resignation follows the involvement of Westminster Press, also part of Pearson, in setting up a rival to PA. PA made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.5m last year against Pounds 3.55m in 1991.</p>

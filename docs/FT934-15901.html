			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Central bank acts on Ferruzzi deadlock THE Bank of Italy is attempting to help break the deadlock between the administrators of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group and the creditor banks over proposals to call a temporary moratorium on debt service payments. Debts service payments are reportedly in the region of L130bn (Dollars 81.81m) a month. Mr Guido Rossi, the chief administrator of Ferruzzi-Montedison, is seeking a moratorium of at least until the end of the year in order to launch a rescue plan for Italy's second largest private group. This is being opposed strongly by the 100-odd foreign banks. Without an agreement there is a risk of one or several of the banks pressing for bankruptcy proceedings. At the end of last May the Ferruzzi group had outstanding debts of L28,000bn. Of this sum foreign banks account for L6,500bn. Representatives of the 300 foreign and Italian banks are due to meet at the Bank of Italy in Rome today. This is likely to be one of the last opportunities to hammer out a common approach to rescuing Ferruzzi-Montedison in advance of October 14. Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the principal holding company, is then due to approve its half-year results. These results were not approved at a board meeting on September 30 because the extent of losses was liable to alter substantially, depending on the nature of the agreement with the creditor banks. The Bank of Italy yesterday was careful to point out it had not formally called the meeting but was merely acting as a neutral host. However, a senior Italian banker said the central bank would be deploying its powers of 'moral persuasion'. Previously the Bank of Italy had hosted a meeting between the creditors and Ferruzzi-Montedison at its Milan offices. The choice of Rome underlines the venue's importance.</p>

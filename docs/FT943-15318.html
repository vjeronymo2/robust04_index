			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Motoring: Rover's BMW appeal - Stuart Marshall test drives an estate-cum-tourer When Rover was still controlled by British Aerospace, its executives told anyone who would listen that one day it would be Britain's BMW and its products would be as good as BMW's 3-Series and 5-Series. The take-over earlier this year must have been the last thing they had in mind. So we have a piquant situation because the first new Rover car to emerge since control passed to BMW earlier this year is a compact, up-market estate, appealing to exactly the kind of buyer who now drives a BMW 3-Series Touring. Even the name is more or less the same. BMW calls the dual-purpose, load carrying versions of the 3-Series and 5-Series 'Tourings', not estates. (It thinks estate cars are rather middle-aged and boring, not youthful and sporting.) And what does Rover call its 400 Series estate car? You have, of course, guessed. The 400 Tourer. Just like its BMW counterpart, the Rover 400 Tourer is hardly the sort of estate car that will carry worn-out washing machines to the council tip. Which is just as well. They would be very difficult to hump aboard as the load floor is quite a bit lower than the rear sill and this is narrowed by the tail lights, though not so severely as the current, soon-to-be-replaced, BMW 3-Series Touring's. The Rover Tourer is more of a Fortnum's hamper to Glyndebourne, children to pre-prep schools, kind of estate. One could visualise it standing alongside a Range Rover Vogue when many a remotely-controlled double garage door is raised. There are three versions. The poshest one is the 136 horsepower 420 GSi, which costs Pounds 15,995 and is pitched at users who expect an estate car to be sporty as well as practical. As it has far more muscle than the 88 horsepower 418 SLD Turbo (Pounds 14,695) or 111 horsepower 416 SLi Tourer (Pounds 14,495), it has firmer suspension and bigger wheels and tyres. The leather and cloth trimmed interior is grander, too. But all the 400 Tourers are proper Rovers inside. They have drivers' airbags, split-fold rear seats and neat covers to prevent opportunist thieves from seeing what is in the load space. The only one I have driven so far is the 418 SLD Turbo, powered by an 88 horsepower, 1.8-litre turbocharged diesel bought in from PSA (Peugeot-Citroen Group). This is slightly less powerful than the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel used in current Citroens and Peugeots because PSA has always made a point of selling rivals its second-best diesels, not the latest ones. Diesel buff that I am, I thought the 418 SLD Turbo's performance and refinement entirely satisfactory on the open road. It would not satisfy a thrusting driver who must always be at the head of the queue and it did sound gruffer than a Citroen Xantia or Peugeot 306 - both with the later 1.9-litre turbo-diesel engine - when accelerating through the gears. Rover's own figures suggest the Pounds 200 price premium of the 418 SLD Turbo over the 1.6-litre petrol-engined 416 SLi would soon be recovered through better fuel economy. The diesel's urban cycle consumption - a good guide to any car's real world fuel consumption - is 42.8mpg (6.6 l/100km) compared with the 416 SLi's 28.8mpg (9.81 l/100 km) and the 420 GSi's 26.3mpg (10.74 l/100 km). Two other new Rovers I sampled briefly last week were the 620ti and Vitesse Sport, both with a 200 horsepower, turbocharged two-litre, four-cylinder T-series engine and five-speed manual gearbox - there is no automatic option. Surrey's leafy lanes and the busy M3 motorway are not the best places to explore handling or performance potential. I will say only that I am confident either car would appeal to business motorists who always drive as though their professional lives depended on getting to meetings for which they are running very late. Prices are Pounds 19,995 for the 620ti, Pounds 20,995 for the Vitesse Sport.</p>

In an exclusive statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal said a joint  Palestinian-Egyptian committee met in September and decided to  hold the count to guarantee the right of return for the  Palestinian refugees. This step is a prelude to the meetings of  the Palestinian-Israeli ministerial follow-up committee, which  will discuss the Palestinian refugees problem, Kamal added.    The Palestine ambassador in Cairo said the count will not  revoke the Palestinian citizen's right to live and work in  Egypt. He noted that special forms have been prepared and will  be distributed among the Palestinian refugees from 15 January at  the al-Tahiri compound in Cairo and Egyptian consulates abroad.  He said that these forms are optional, not compulsory, noting  that the count would serve the interest of the Palestinian  citizen. It also aims to find jobs for unemployed Palestinians  within the framework of development programs sponsored by the  Palestinian authority, Sa'id Kamal added.    In his statement, the Palestinian ambassador said that Faruq  Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, has instructed  the Palestinian embassies in Arab and foreign countries to  coordinate with the Egyptian consulates in charge of the count.</p>

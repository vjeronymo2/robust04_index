			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  observes the 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban  revolution.    Noting that the victory of the Cuban revolution was an  epoch-making event that terminated domination and subjugation,  backwardness and poverty on the land of Cuba and opened a way of  socialism guaranteeing sovereignty and independence, creation  and prosperity, the editorial article says:    The 35 years covered by the Cuban people after the victory  of  the revolution have been a course of constant confrontation and  struggle with the imperialist reactionaries and days in which  they decorated their history with creation and innovation. The  socialist changes and the victorious progress of the revolution  in those years clearly indicate that no force on earth can block  the road of socialism of the heroic Cuban people.    The Korean people note with high appreciation that the Cuban  people are defending the country's sovereignty and national  dignity and accelerating socialist construction, not yielding to  any adversity.    The militant comradeship and unity between the peoples of  Korea and Cuba have been further consolidated and developed in  the course of overcoming trials together and struggling hand in  hand for the common cause.    Friendship and unity between Korea and Cuba are an excellent  model of comradely relations between the peoples of  revolutionary countries.    The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every  possible effort to strengthen and fully develop their friendship  and unity with the Cuban people.    The just cause of the Cuban people will certainly end in  victory.</p>

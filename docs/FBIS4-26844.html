			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Kim Yong-sun was  named today as the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea's (DPRK) delegation to the forthcoming pre-Korean summit  talks at the truce village of Panmunjom.    Kim, chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the  Supreme People's Assembly, will be accompanied at the June 28  meeting by An Pyong-su, vice-chairman of the committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun,  chief councillor of the DPRK Administration Council (cabinet).    Details of the delegation membership were given to South  Korean Premier Yi Yong-tok by the DPRK Prime Minister Kang  Song-san today.    The meeting was proposed by Kang on June 20 as a means of  organizing detailed arrangements for a North-South summit. The  DPRK accepted the proposal two days later.    Meanwhile, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said the  outstanding questions between the DPRK and the U.S., including  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and other issues,  could be resolved in a package deal at the third-round DPRK-U.S.  talks.    Officials from the two countries will meet in Geneva in the  first week of July for talks over a wide range of political and  economic issues.    However, the spokesman also criticized Japan and South Korea  following their public outcry calling for a "special inspection"  of the DPRK's military facilities.</p>

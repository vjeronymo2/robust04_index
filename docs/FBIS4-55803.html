			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F> Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, MSZOSZ, by Gabor Karsai;  place and date not given: "Pragmatism Instead of Liberalism? --  Pact Psychology -- Interview With MSZOSZ Chairman Sandor Nagy,  Member of the New, Probably Government Party MSZP Parliamentary  Group"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karsai] In the autumn of  1993 you considered it possible to form an election alliance  with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the Republic Party, the  National Democratic Federation [NDSZ], and the Agrarian  Federation, but not with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ],  the MSZP's probable coalition partner. How will you find your  place in the coalition of the two government parties that  advocate a liberal economic policy?    [Nagy] I can only tell you my personal opinion, which does  not -- and should not -- influence the MSZP's decision in  choosing its partner.    As a trade union leader, I would not be happy if it was  possible to describe the government's economic policy with one  attribute, namely liberalism, because, in a simplified way, this  would mean that the strong remain functioning while the weak  fail. It would lead to conflicts if all this was even amplified  by shock therapy ideas. As a matter of fact, in my view, the  MSZP's economic policy is characterized by pragmatism rather  than liberalism.    [Karsai] I assume that the acceptance of the MSZP's  nevertheless liberal-type economic policy concept prepared by  Laszlo Bekesi was a condition of you becoming a deputy candidate.    [Nagy] I have said many times that this program can be  welcomed by the trade unions -- naturally, together with the  employment, welfare policy, and other programs linked to it. At  the same time, no one asked me to countersign every line of this  program for the trade unions, as if giving a blank check to the  future government.    [Karsai] The MSZP finally accepted the fifth version of the  Bekesi program. To what extent are the amendments a result of  the agreement made with the National Federation of Trade Unions  in Hungary [MSZOSZ]?    [Nagy] We did not participate in the detailed preparation of  the program, but, naturally, our views were known to the MSZP's  leaders. During the debates within the MSZP, the formulations  that are more attractive to us were included in the program.  For example, the final version is more socially sensitive to  the problems of the groups of society that are in the worst  position and it sees the reduction of unemployment as a direct  goal. [passage omitted]    [Karsai] Do you agree with Bekesi's statement that it is  impossible to give social democratic answers to the problems  under the circumstances of the current crisis?    [Nagy] I do. This period is not good for social democratic  values; nevertheless, they have to be represented. The most  serious social problems have to be remedied.    [Karsai] Do you accept that the main goal of the next few  years is to stop the deterioration of the financial balance and  then to improve it?    [Nagy] It is possible that we have to say this because of  the timing of the tasks. However, it is more attractive for me  to say that we have to strive for establishing the conditions  for a financial balance and a boom, for improving the  employment, reducing inflation, and handling the social  problems. More precisely, for optimizing these partially  contradictory goals.    [Karsai] According to Bekesi, the reform if state finances  will attract an annual 4 to 5 percent reduction of real incomes,  and some half of this could be compensated for. What do these  figures mean to you?    [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program, for  the majority of society, the reform of state finances has to be  accompanied by full compensation. If the government does not  consider this feasible, then it will have to discuss this with  the trade unions. It would be too early to talk about numbers.  It is certain that, in our view, it is indispensable to stop  the reduction of the real value of incomes within a foreseeable  time and to increase the real value of the lowest pensions.  [passage omitted]    [Karsai] In the autumn of 1993, the MSZOSZ published a  statement on privatization in which it primarily emphasized the  need for a more marked regard for employment considerations. Do  you really feel that unemployment within the doors has already  ceased to exist in the case of enterprises facing privatization,  and they now structurally match the market requirements, in  other words, further dismissals are unavoidable?    [Nagy] We are against the current privatization practice  that strives for maximizing the -- later actually wasted --  revenue, ignoring the future fate of the enterprises.  Therefore, in our view, buyers who guarantee an employment  level and the increase of capital should be given preference.    [Karsai] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers  paying cash are generally not interested in the efficient future  operation of the enterprises. On the other hand, the broader  access of employees to ownership, which you also require,  contradicts your concern about the future of the enterprises.  The employees usually do not have any money to invest, and the  delay of possibly necessary dismissals might lead to the  bankruptcy of the whole enterprise.    [Nagy] It is a misunderstanding to conclude that we are in  favor of dominant ownership by the employees just because we  support the employees' share program. In our view, it is more  important for the enterprise to be in good hands and for the  people to get well-paid jobs than for them to become owners. At  the same time, we would find it expedient if the relevant  industry's trade union representatives could be present at  privatization decisions. Many misunderstandings could be  avoided purely by exchanging information. [passage omitted]    [Karsai] In recent months the current opposition parties  and the MSZOSZ have advocated an economic-social pact. In your  view, is there any difference in the issues the various trade  unions wish to agree on?    [Nagy] At the moment we can only talk about initial and  rather fluid intentions. Obviously, the economic problems we  have already mentioned -- namely nominal wages and pensions,  inflation, taxes, the burdens of the reform of state  administration, welfare benefits, and a predictable real value  of incomes for many years -- will all be topics.

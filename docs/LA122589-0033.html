			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. ROMANIANS VOICE SUPPORT AT VIGIL  </P> <P> About 300 Romanian protesters held a candlelight vigil Sunday night outside Los  Angeles City Hall, calling for military and economic support to revolutionary  troops fighting the security forces of ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "We need support now, not a week later," said Ionela Opran, a spokeswoman for  the Romanian Faith and Freedom Coalition, which organized the protest.  </P> <P> Opran said the coalition was also calling for the Romanian Embassy in  Washington to make public the files kept by Ceausescu's security agents on  Romanian dissidents in the United States. About 40,000 Romanians live in  Southern California.  </P> <P> The demonstrators sang "Rise up Romanian," a popular protest song, and the  Romanian national anthem. Others raised clenched fists and chanted slogans in  support of the Romanian army, which has played an important role in the  overthrow of Ceausescu and continues to battle members of a secret police force  loyal to the dictator.  </P> <P> Nicolae Suciu, 22, was one of several Romanian exiles at the demonstration who  said they were prepared to travel to their homeland to fight as volunteers for  the provisional revolutionary government.  </P> <P> "I'm a married man with two children," he said. "But I'm ready to go fight with  my friends, my brothers, my cousins, who are standing up to the killers in  Ceausescu's secret police."  </P> <P> Suciu called on the United States to provide military support to the  revolutionaries in Romania.  </P> <P> "We need someone to give us armaments, munitions, guns. We need M-1 rifles,  bazookas, everything," said Suciu, who wore a sash made of red, blue and yellow  ribbons, the colors of the Romanian flag.  </P> <P> Suciu said he had spoken by telephone with eyewitnesses to the fighting in the  provincial cities of Medias and Sibiu. But most of the protesters said they  have had little or no contact with their relatives in Romania since the  fighting began last week in the provincial town of Timisoara.  </P> <P> Bruno Nastasescu, 55, said the only information he had about the events in his  native country was from television news reports, which showed scenes of  fighting in Bucharest and the unearthing of mass graves in Timisoara.  </P> <P> "I am watching the television and I am crying all the time," he said.  </P></p>

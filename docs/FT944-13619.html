			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Challenge to Russian democracy on the waterfront: John Lloyd reports from the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where both organised crime and the local governor appear out of control They drive through the streets in Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles, groups of tough young men with cropped hair and leather jackets - the uniform of the gang enforcers. Welcome to Vladivostok, Russia's famed port on the Pacific, where organised crime gangs are hugely powerful and are battling it out for control of port facilities, companies and retail outlets. In the elegantly restored Versailles Hotel, in the town centre, visiting businessmen speak of all deals having to go through one or other of the local crime families: of nightly shootings; of a wholly corrupt police force. This is the menacing setting for a drama of great importance in the development of Russian democracy. The governor of the Primorye region, of which Vladivostok is the capital, Mr Evgeny Nazdratenko, has been accused of corrupt and dictatorial rule - by local people, by those claiming to be his victims and by external experts. These claims have not, however, been tested in court: they remain a vast, but unproven, indictment of the effectiveness of Russian regional and central government. On one night last week, Mr Alexander Sviridov, whose Sab corporation was about to open a diamond exchange in the city, was killed in what the Interfax news agency said was probably a mafia killing. Earlier on the same day, Mr Vladimir Cherepkov, son of Mr Victor Cherepkov, Vladivostok's former mayor, was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of a computer from his school. According to opponents to his rule, these disparate events are connected to the central actor in the drama of Vladivostok, Governor Nazdratenko. Mr Nazdratenko was to have stood for election as governor on October 7 (he is presently appointed by President Boris Yeltsin): but the vote was cancelled by a decree issued by Mr Yeltsin last month. The vote was called off immediately after the receipt of a report, written by experts from the Russia's Choice party (led by Mr Yegor Gaidar) which said that Primorye was 'in the grip of fear'; it alleged that Mr Nazdratenko had terrorised political opponents, closed opposition newspapers, taken shares with associates in the bulk of the privatised enterprises and - in his vendetta against former Mayor Cherepkov - trumped up the theft charges against his son after dismissing the father from office on false charges of accepting bribes. According to Mr Igor Sanachev, a former official under Mr Cherepkov, 'Nazdratenko had all the means to ensure that he won the election'. This is a judgment shared by others who would not give their names. This assumption of intended ballot-rigging or intimidation was the reason the opposition pressed for a postponement of the election for governor. Mr Sanachev goes further: cancelling the election deprived Mr Nazdratenko of his only chance to survive - the chance of gaining the people's mandate. Now, he believes: 'He has served his purpose and he has to go.' That purpose, according to Mr Sanachev and the Russia's Choice report, was to provide an administration which would allow the directors of the large plants to get rich through privatisation and through misuse of government funds. For the past three years, according to Mr Sanachev and the Russia's Choice investigators, Mr Nazdratenko and his allies in a group named 'PAKT', had so dominated the privatisation process as to ensure that the largest single portion of shares came to them as directors of the enterprises privatised. The investigators claimed the 'PAKT' group had also gained control of the regional administration and systematically suppressed opposition; had, through the administration, threatened to declare 'autonomy' as a Far Eastern Republic in order to cajole more support out of Moscow; and diverted and misused state funding so efficiently that services are only sporadically provided and workers go up to six months without pay. Mr Nazdratenko was too ill to be interviewed: his deputy governor, Mr Nikolai Pimenov, insisted that corruption was not a problem in the administration and that 'autonomy' was simply a desire to agree with Moscow on a special economic status for the region, of the type other regions and republics enjoyed. But according to the former mayor, Mr Cherepkov, the administration is ruthless. Elected as mayor last year on an anti-Nazdratenko ticket, he was physically removed from his office in May and a substitute mayor put in his place. His son was arrested and charged with the theft. Last Friday, he received seven years' jail - a savage punishment which, his father said, 'all agree was a punishment not for him but for the Cherepkov family'. Mr Cherepkov says that the judge is a close ally of Mr Nazdratenko and squarely blames the governor for manipulating the case. He is, however, fighting back. He has already collected 20,000 signatures in protest against the sentence and says he will take the case to Moscow, to President Yeltsin. But among the crime, corruption and violence, business grows. Mr Sergei Frank is the finance director of Fesco, a privatised shipping line which operates a fleet of more than 160 merchant ships. He oversees a company which, he says, is 'free of debt with the capacity to improve the quality of the fleet and the efficiency of our operations'. Its shares trade at Dollars 90, giving it a market capitalisation of Dollars 146m (compared with an implied valuation when first privatised of Dollars 4.4m), and he expects a net profit of around Dollars 90m this year. Some 15 per cent of his company is now held by foreign investors, of which Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and Citibank are the largest: CSFB's research note on the company says its prospects are 'inspiring'. Mr Frank will not be drawn too far into comments on the region's administration: by most accounts, Fesco has remained free of the 'PAKT' network and of the organised crime groups. 'The mafia is concerned with cash businesses: we work with bank accounts. The administration, I would say, is neither very competent nor incompetent: we pay taxes, it doesn't interfere.' Mr Frank's cautious view that the administration allows business to develop is confirmed by Mr Andrew Fox, a young British financier who came to the region two years ago. He has created two investment funds, set up a company which trades on the stock exchange and is investing his own and his partners' money in local enterprises. 'There are some extremely profitable companies here whose shares are increasing in value very rapidly indeed,' he says, citing a huge cement plant whose output is greater than that of Australia's. Mr Fox acknowledges the pervasiveness of the mafia and of violence but, making the same point as Mr Frank, says he runs a cashless business and avoids trouble. 'People tell me we could make a lot of money opening restaurants or laundries. We could, but then you're in the mafia territory.' Mr Nazdratenko's continued rule in the region may now be in doubt: the members of 'PAKT', bosses of the big local enterprises, are now mainly rich men though many of their workers have no work and little wages and the organisation is riven with infighting. In the short term, however, disillusion with democracy, perhaps even encouraged by Mr Nazdratenko's hold over the region, may further empower him. Last weekend an election to the Primorye parliament failed when not enough people turned out to vote. Only 20 deputies were elected to the 39-seat parliament, six fewer than the quorum required. Now, Mr Nazdratenko will be able to run the region without a legislature until new parliamentary elections, probably next year.</p>

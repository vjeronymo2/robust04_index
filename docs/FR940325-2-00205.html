(``Charter Oak'') and COE Development Corporation (``COE Development'') (collectively, ``Applicants''), each located at 107 Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut, 06037&hyph;1616, have filed a further post-effective amendment under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 13(b), 32, and 33 of the Act and rules 45, 53, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder to their application-declaration filed under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and rules 45, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By order dated January 24, 1994 (HCAR. 25977) (``January 1994 Order'') Charter Oak and COE Development were authorized to engage in preliminary development activities and make investments in and finance the acquisition of exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') in the amount of $100 million through December 30, 1994. The January 1994 Order also authorized the Applicants to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary companies for preliminary development activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants now propose to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary companies for development activities, including construction and permanent financing, and contingent liabilities subsequent to operation with regard to those EWG and FUCO projects that do not require advance approval from the Commission for the Applicants to acquire an interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants have found that on occasion such guarantees and assumptions of liability may provide them with opportunities to participate in private power opportunities on a favorable basis without expending funds. The full contingent amount of any guarantees or assumptions of liabilities would be counted as part of the authorized development activities limit of $100 million authorized in the January 1994 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants also propose to use Charter Oak or other system company employees within a de minimis  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;limit to render services to affiliated EWGs and FUCOs.

In the event Rule 50 is rescinded, CNG requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell the Securities under competitive bidding including the alternative procedures without prior Commission approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Indenture differs from CNG's current indenture (``1971 Indenture'') in eight substantial ways: (1) Setting of terms; (2) form of security; (3) lien restrictions; (4) sale and leaseback restrictions; (5) additional debt incurrence limitations; (6) issue and sale of subsidiaries' stock; (7) limitation of dividends; and (8) defeasance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: How Lloyd's aims to boost its Names / Examining far-reaching proposals intended to unlock the value of London's hard-hit insurance market The Lloyd's insurance market this week published an exciting blueprint for giving Names - individual underwriting members - 'sitting tenant' rights which they may be able to sell eventually for cash or securities. This is the first time Lloyd's has admitted that Names have built up any right to a continuing stake in the enterprise. Assuming a series of complex legal, regulatory and tax hurdles can be overcome, the proposal could mean that: Members who wanted to get out of the market could get some cash in return for giving up their place. They could swap their existing places in specialist syndicates for units in a wider pooled scheme, or shares in a corporate syndicate. Robert Hiscox, the market's deputy chairman, says: 'Nobody has ever said how much a Lloyd's syndicate is worth. The whole objective is to unlock the value we have in the business.' The reforms could be far-reaching, although there is little comfort for Names who have been forced out of the market already by their losses. And, in order to benefit, even Names who continue to trade must be solvent and have paid any outstanding cash calls by July 29 this year. The basic idea behind the reform is simple. Theoretically, the 179 syndicates trading at Lloyd's are annual joint ventures. They are made up of many individual Names, trade on the back of their guarantees, and dissolve at the end of each year when they distribute the profits or call in the losses relating to that year's trading. The interest of Names at present is confined to these profits or losses. In practice, though, Lloyd's syndicates are businesses which - like insurance companies - have long-term plans and often insure many of the same customers year after year. Good syndicates can command considerable customer loyalty. Like any continuing business enterprise, ownership of a syndicate is worth money. The larger, more respected and more profitable it is, the greater its value. Lloyd's is now trying to devise a system under which Names can acquire a portion of this long-term value. There are two stages to its plan. First, it must be sure that certain syndicate rights, which turn Names into quasi-shareholders, are vested in them. Then, it has to create a market in which those rights can be traded, swapped or cashed in. But this will be a long-term process, and the outcome is far from clear. Creating value This week, Lloyd's announced the first stage of its plan; the basic measures, to be implemented in 1995, are pre-conditions for establishing a market in membership rights. In essence, these reforms - which will be introduced in 1995 and 1996 - make 'syndicate participation' more solid and durable. So, it becomes a valuable asset to the Name. Members would have far more security of tenure. If the agent running a syndicate attempted to sack individual Names, they could appeal to Lloyd's council. The plan would also give them pre-emption rights over their syndicate participations. This means that if a syndicate decided to increase its capacity (the amount of business it underwrites), the Names would have the right to increase their share of the extra business in proportion to their stake. Take a Name underwriting a Pounds 10,000 share in a Pounds 1m syndicate: he would be able to increase his share to Pounds 11,000 if the syndicate increased its capacity by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.1m. Names would also have more control over decisions by their syndicates to increase capacity, and would have to approve any increase in capacity of more than 15 per cent. This is important, because syndicates would find it harder to dilute the stake of existing Names by increasing capacity so much that the Names could not afford to take up their pre-emption rights. Allocating capital Lloyd's intends to play a more active role in making sure that capital is allocated more efficiently. It will do this by introducing risk weighting so that the amount of capital required to support a syndicate increases in line with the riskiness of its underlying business. Syndicates underwriting high-risk business (such as catastrophe re-insurance) would need more capital; those writing relatively low-risk business, such as motors, correspondingly less. So, individual Names would not find themselves in syndicates where future claims might be beyond their means. Lloyd's is less definite, however, about a series of other measures which are geared in one way or another to establish a market place in which syndicate participations can be bought and sold. Transferring value The central issue here is whether Names can 'assign' their participations on syndicates - effectively, transferring or selling them to another Name or to a corporate investor. Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, argues that assignment is 'likely to be the fundamental building block for any system of value'. But Lloyd's concedes that 'a number of important issues need to be resolved before assignment can be brought into effect'. Realising value The report describes three possible mechanisms: A market administered by Lloyd's. Options include a 'matched bargain system' in which sellers are matched with buyers; or a fully fledged market-making system in which a professional market-maker is required to quote prices for all syndicates in which he deals. The report concludes that a one-off, auction-based tender system, in which all sellers of a particular syndicate get the same price, is the most likely option in the short term. It says that the trading volumes would probably be too low to support a cost-efficient market-making mechanism. Corporate pooling in which Names would 'assign' their future syndicate participations to a corporate member in exchange for shares, securities or cash. This type of arrangement would allow Names to spread their investments across a number of syndicates, as they do now in members' agency pooling arrangements, or Mapa - a kind of unit trust. With the new corporate arrangements, though, Names would enjoy the additional advantage of having limited liability. Corporate syndicates in which members would assign future participations to a corporate member, again in exchange for shares, other securities or cash. Corporate Names account for about 15 per cent of Lloyd's capacity this year following the successful introduction last year of corporate funds. But corporate Names are restricted from providing any more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity, while syndicates can obtain no more than 50 per cent of their capital from corporate Names. The new corporate syndicates would, effectively, be insurance companies operating within a Lloyd's framework.  -----------------------------------------------------------              TURNING LLOYD'S MEMBERSHIP INTO CASH  ----------------------------------------------------------- Creating value for members  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Strengthening members' rights  -Giving members first refusal of additional   underwriting at their syndicates  -Standardising agents' fees and commissions  ----------------------------------------------------------- Allocating capital more efficiently  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Risk weighting different types of insurance   business  -Controlling the total amount of insurance   done at Lloyd's  ----------------------------------------------------------- Transferring value  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Creating a mechanism which enables members   to transfer their syndicate rights  ----------------------------------------------------------- Realising value  ----------------------------------------------------------- Three possible ways of cashing in  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Creating a market in syndicate rights  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Allowing individual members to sell their   syndicate rights to a corporate member   and running a Lloyd's 'unit trust'  -----------------------------------------------------------  -Allowing members to sell syndicate rights   to a corporate syndicate in exchange for   cash or securities  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

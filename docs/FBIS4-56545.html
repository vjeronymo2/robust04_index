			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tandil, 4 May (NA) -- In this city today  President Carlos Menem presided over the ceremony commemorating  the 12th anniversary of the Air Force's baptism by fire in the  South Atlantic conflict, and once again harshly criticized  "those who want to create a confrontation between the public and  the Armed Forces."    In an impromptu news conference that he gave at the end of  the ceremony, Menem emphasized that "certain interests" are  trying to create a confrontation between the military and  civilians.    He also insisted on stressing that "we have never had better  relations with the United States" and said he believes that  country will not apply sanctions if the pharmaceutical patents  law is not approved.    In this respect he stressed that a measure of that kind  "would not be suitable either for the United States or for  Argentina."    In addition, the chief of state again criticized the mothers  of Plaza de Mayo, saying: "I respect them about as much as they  respect the president of the nation," and immediately asking:  "Who is financing the many trips they make?"    Menem presided over the Air Force ceremony, which was held  at  the 6th Air Brigade based in this city, together with Army Chief  of Staff General Martin Balza. [passage omitted]</p>

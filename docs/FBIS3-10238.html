The former commander of the  Cavalry Academy, which in 1987 assumed control of the Justice  Palace during the bloody takeover by the 19 April Movement, said  the guerrillas are holding contacts with candidates through  third parties to finance their campaigns.    [Begin recording] [Plazas] I am talking about candidates for  governor and candidates for mayor in the municipalities of  Yopal, Tauramena, and Aguazul.    [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] I do not believe the  guerrillas have that kind of power in the political campaigns in  Casanare. I am not aware that they are trying to exert  influence on the political development of the region.    [Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] If that were the  case, it must be condemned. [end recording]    According to Col. Plazas, the guerrillas are extorting  businessmen by means of this system in Casanare.    [Begin Plazas recording] They are threatening candidates and  asking them for allowances and if the allowances are not given  they are included on a list of future kidnap victims in order to  get the money anyway. [end recording]    Plazas Vega said that to solve the problem in Casanare, it  is  necessary to appoint military governors and mayors in that  region of the country.</p>

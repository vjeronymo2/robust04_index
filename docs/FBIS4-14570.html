			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "Cooperation" rubric: "Russia </F> and NATO Are Equal Partners. Vladimir Lukin on How One Should  Join the `Partnership for Peace' Program"]    [Text] Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma  International Affairs Committee, at a press conference in the  lower chamber of the Russian parliament yesterday suggested that  a number of terms on Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for  Peace" [PFP] program should be included in the presentation  document now being prepared.    The parliamentarian thinks that Russia can take part in the  NATO decisionmaking mechanism only as an equal partner of the  North Atlantic Treaty.    Lukin is also convinced that the process of formalizing the  "Partnership for Peace" program should take into account  Russia's obligations in connection with the creation of a  collective security system of CIS countries. It should also be  specified how peacekeeping operations are going to be carried  through, in what way processes are going to be coordinated, and  what is the role of the Russian command.    On the questions of standardization of armaments under the  "Partnership for Peace" program, Mr. Lukin thought that these  problems should be solved "with both sides' interests being  taken into consideration."    The parliamentarian suggests a phased system to finance the  program because, according to him, Russia now would hardly be  able to participate fully in its financing.    Mr. Lukin also underlined that Russia would have to persuade  China that "we are not joining any military bloc against them."  Besides, he pointed out, as a Eurasian country, Russia should  "talk with China about the creation of a security system" which  is to be bilateral or with the six countries taking part --  China, Japan, Russia, two Korean states, and the United States.</p>

The disparity in the parties' North Korean  policies is likely to become a sensitive issue for the coalition  government.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is calling for following  the  international community if the UN Security Council [UNSC]  decides on sanctions against North Korea. But some quarters in  the coalition government are demonstrating a negative attitude  toward "sanctions." In addition to the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ], which has long taken a pro-DPRK stand, some  conservative coalition leaders such as Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and hajime Ishii of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], chairman of the lower house Special Committee on  Political Reform, are prudent on this issue because they have  been leading efforts to normalize Japan-DPRK relations.    In a 22 March news conference, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama expressed a prudent attitude toward a hardline policy  against North Korea in stressing the need for a settlement of  the nuclear issue through peaceful talks. He said: "The issue  must be settled between the United States and North Korea, for  as long as this is a possibility. I think we should do  everything we can to reach a settlement through consultations,  rather than through immediate sanctions."    In contrast, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa said  on  22 March: "In line with the concept of the Constitution, Japan  must secure its own peace, security, and presence under the  global peace realized by the UN centrism. If we do not take  actions according to this principle, the international community  will not trust Japan." Thus, Ozawa noted his policy of  following the UN decision even if it is an embargo.    Senior Shinseito officials are expressing concern about the  internal discord in the coalition, saying, "We are not sure if  the coalition can reach an accord when economic sanctions  against North Korea become inevitable." However, a senior  Komeito official is optimistic about this and says that the  coalition parties will eventually get together on this issue. He  noted, "Some SDPJ members will actually oppose sanctions against  North Korea, but the party cannot withdraw from the coalition  over this particular issue."    The coalition parties, however, have not had thorough  internal discussions on their courses of action on the policy  toward the DPRK. They will face difficult choices when  "sanctions" become a reality.</p>

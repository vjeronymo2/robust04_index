			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Changes to Proposed Rule for Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments received, EPA has made the following changes to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the final rule. First, the final rule establishes one definition of ``new'' that applies equally to domestically manufactured and imported vehicles and engines. Second, the definition of ``new'' applies to all nonroad engines other than locomotives and engines used in locomotives. EPA will define ``new'' locomotives and ``new'' engines used in locomotives in its locomotive standards promulgated under section 213 of the Act. Third, in the final rule EPA defines the word ``commercial,'' as used in the definitions of ``farm equipment'' and ``construction equipment.'' Fourth, EPA makes minor modifications to the definitions of ``construction equipment'' and ``locomotive.'' Fifth, the proposed federal labeling requirement is deleted. Sixth, EPA changes its interpretation of section 209(e) so that California may adopt, but not enforce, nonroad standards prior to EPA authorization. Seventh, EPA changes the standard of review of California's primary use determination to a preponderance of the evidence standard. Finally, EPA changes its interpretation of ``consistent with this section'' in section 209(e)(2)(A)(iii) to include section 209(b)(1)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Nonroad Engines and Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA acknowledged that at some point it would be necessary to clarify whether certain internal combustion engines, such as those used in movable pumps, generators, and compressors, are stationary sources and therefore subject to regulations under Title I of the Act or are mobile sources and therefore potentially subject to nonroad regulations under Title II of the Act. The issue is complex. The definitions of ``stationary source'' in sections 111(3) and 302(z) of the Act and of ``nonroad engine'' in section 216(10) of the Act do not make clear under which Title certain internal combustion engines belong. The engines in question are those used in equipment for reasons other than propulsion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ingersoll-Rand, the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), among others, commented that EPA should determine in this rulemaking that both self-propelled and transportable equipment are mobile sources. This would clarify to manufacturers that transportable farm and construction equipment are exempted from state regulation for purposes of control of emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees that the above issue needs to be addressed and has resolved this issue in a rulemaking implementing section 213 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Section 213 requires EPA to ``conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles to determine if such emissions cause, or significantly contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' The section further provides that if the Administrator determines that nonroad emissions are ``significant contributors'' in more than one ozone or carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment area, the Administrator shall promulgate standards for such nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On June 17, 1994 a final rule was published (59 FR 31306) for nonroad engines 37 kilowatts (50 horsepower) which provides a definition of nonroad engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA studied nonroad emissions and issued a report in November 1991. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In the June 17, 1994 rulemaking EPA determined, based on the study data and the docket of the rulemaking (A&hyph;91&hyph;24), that emissions from nonroad sources are significant contributors to ozone and CO in more than one nonattainment area. EPA's final rule also includes regulations that set forth emission standards for CO, hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and smoke emissions from large new nonroad compression-ignition engines at or above 37 kilowatts in power, with the exclusion for certain types of engines. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Within EPA's 37 kilowatt and above nonroad rule a definition of nonroad engine is provided. Section 89.2 of the 37 kilowatt and above rule provides the following definition:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study, EPA publication number 21A&hyph;2001, November, 1991.

Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Li Luye, the  spokesman, said that the second session of the CPPCC Eighth  National Committee to be opened tomorrow will be convened at a  time when the country witnesses a robust economic development,  political stability, unity of all nationalities and social  progress.    Reviewing the work of the National Committee over the past  year, Li said that CPPCC has played an important role in  promoting exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, steps toward the  reunification of China.    Answering a question on the ongoing anti-corruption drive in  China, Li said that CPPCC has spared no effort to support and  participate in the anticorruption drive launched by the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State  Council.    Members of the CPPCC National Committee formed six groups,  which conducted corruption-related investigations together with  relevant departments of the State Council, the spokesman said.    Zhao Weizhi, deputy secretary-general of the National  Committee, answered a question about revision of the CPPCC  Constitution. Revision of the existing Constitution, which was  adopted in 1982, is being guided by the spirit of the 14th  National Congress of the Communist Party of China and aims at  its convergence with the amended Constitution of the People's  Republic of China, he said.</p>

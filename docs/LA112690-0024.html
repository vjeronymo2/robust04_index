			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> A COMEDY WHOSE TIME HAS PASSED  </P> <P> "Working Trash," starring George Carlin and Ben Stiller as a pair of Wall  Street janitors turned crafty inside traders, is a dubiously timed comedy about  the stock market, airing at 8 tonight, Channels 11 and 6.  </P> <P> The Fox Broadcasting Co.'s first original TV movie, launching "Fox Night at the  Movies," is a feckless romance about love and money and the little guys  outwitting the big guys.  </P> <P> But in the wake of a decade of scandals on Wall Street, the gaudy spree  depicted in this story looks quaintly dated.  </P> <P> This is a comedy for the greedy '80s that has the ill-gotten luck to come out  in the '90s. Real-life events have robbed the movie of its bite. There is one  timely image, though, of a pair of crooked brokers (the dastardly Jack Blessing  and Dan Castellaneta) pushing brooms in a jail.  </P> <P> Buddy Ebsen's corporate snoozer, Leslie Hope's vivid broker and Michael J.  Pollard's quirky shoeshine man (a performance that veers on the comatose) lend  support. Carlin (who is testament to a theory which holds that older men look  silly in ponytails) and especially Spiller are affable.  </P> <P> But the pleasant discovery, a character who stands out and steals the show even  though she's only on camera for a few scenes, is the nervous, loopy, tall  brunette (Lisa Montgomery) who plays Ebsen's secretary. She's delicious, the  quintessential not-so-airy airhead. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

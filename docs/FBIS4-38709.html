			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- "Kuwait is prepared to change  its legislation and adopt new laws if necessary to promote the  development of larger-scale and long-term cooperation with  Russia", Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, speaker of the Kuwaiti  National Assembly, who leads a parliamentary delegation, told  Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets here on Wednesday.  Mr. Sa'dun expressed gratitude to the Russian Federation for  its support to Kuwait in upholding its independence.    Soskovets, having expressed appreciation of Kuwait's desire  to strengthen its defence capacity, emphasised that high  technologies in the Russian military industry would help resolve  many a matter concerning Russian-Kuwaiti cooperation in this  respect.    "But it is up to your parliament to decide on whether to  endorse or turn down funds necessary for the purchase of this  technology which we could sell to you", Soskovets added.    Russia would welcome Kuwaiti investments in various branches  of the Russian economy to promote economic reform, Soskovets  pointed out.</p>

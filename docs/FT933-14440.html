			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dutch bank finds a second home - ABN Amro's dollars 500m acquisition of Cragin Federal, a Chicago-based savings bank, will make it Illinois' second-largest retail bank. Roland van de Krol reports from Amsterdam on ABN's 14-year-pold strategy A similarity between the Netherlands and the US Midwest is the flatness of the terrain. Another, less visible link, is the prominent role played by ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, in the state of Illinois and its capital, Chicago. Last week, the bank announced that it would be putting the finishing touches to a 14-year-old strategy of carving out a second home market in this important region of the Midwest. ABN Amro's planned Dollars 500m acquisition of Cragin Federal, a savings bank with roots in Chicago's wealthy north-western suburbs, marks its biggest foreign acquisition in value terms. The move lifts its local offices by 27 to 90 and raises its savings and deposits in Illinois to Dollars 2bn, making ABN Amro the state's second-largest retail bank after home-grown First Chicago. The acquisition, due to take place early next year, is the latest in a Dollars 1.6bn series of purchases in Illinois since 1979. Earlier acquisitions have included LaSalle National, Lane Financial, Exchange Bancorp and Talman Home Federal. Besides this local operation, the Dutch group maintains 10 ABN Amro offices in the US and Canada from which it serves top corporate customers. It owns European American Bank on New York's Long Island. Mr Jan Kalff, the board member responsible for ABN Amro's push into Illinois for the past nine years, says he has no designs on further acquisitions in Illinois. 'We'll leave it at this for the time being,' he says. 'We are not looking any further in the Chicago area.' He acknowledges that ABN Amro has said this before, most recently after the Talman acquisition in 1992. The fact that the Dutch bank has returned once again to the familiar territory of Chicago testifies to the region's economic resilience, the fragmentation of its banking market and the prospect of achieving savings on operating costs at Cragin. ABN Amro plans to farm out Cragin's administrative operations to a service centre run by its LaSalle group of banks near Chicago's O'Hare airport. This, plus a cut in staff at headquarters, should help ABN Amro realise the 30 per cent reduction in costs that is regarded as a rule of thumb in US banking acquisitions. 'If that happens at Cragin, and we'll have to wait and see, that would mean savings of Dollars 12m to Dollars 15m,' Mr Kalff says. Another lure for ABN Amro was the strength of the economy in and around Chicago. The region has escaped the deep recession that has scarred the north-east and California, exhibiting steady growth rather than a boom-and-bust cycle. ABN Amro's decision in 1979 to focus on Chicago was due in part to the fiercer competition among foreign banks in New York and California, and also in part to admiration for the Midwest's economy. Looking back on the LaSalle acquisition, Mr Kalff notes, 'In retrospect, it was a fortunate move, not only because the bank itself was attractive but the entire region is very attractive.' Financing for Cragin is easy to arrange as ABN Amro will be paying one-third to one-half of the Dollars 500m acquisition price in dollar-denominated preferred stock issued by LaSalle, just as it did for Lane, Exchange and Talman. Dividends on these instruments are low as they are linked to US interest rates, and the dollar funding means that the parent bank does not run any currency risk. A final reason to return to Chicago was the sense that regional banks such as Banc One and National Bank of Detroit will be stepping up their involvement in Illinois, whose splintered banking market numbers more than 1,000 banks. Most of the rest are small, but Cragin represented the second-largest independent savings bank after the leader, St Paul. 'I wanted to be ahead of the others,' Mr Kalff says. ABN Amro's concerted expansion since the late 1970s has left it with a significant critical mass in the local market, creating important economies of scale. This is a situation which the bank would find difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in EAB's home market on Long Island, which is dominated by five or six of New York's biggest banks. Similarly, Europe poses very different challenges. ABN Amro, which has a network of offices in each of the European Community states, is searching for local acquisitions in France, Belgium and Germany, but the power of domestic banks and the prices commanded by acquisition targets are barriers to success. One solution may be to take a regional approach in a country such as Germany. 'It could well be that you buy something in North Rhine-Westphalia or in the north around Hamburg or in the south, where we'd at least be able to create a strong local base without necessarily covering all of Germany from the very start,' Mr Kalff says. Still, any acquisition in a European state is bound to take longer to pay off financially than the most recent one in the state of Illinois. 'In Europe and elsewhere in the world, it is extremely difficult to buy something which immediately contributes to results in the first year,' he says.</p>

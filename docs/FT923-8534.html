			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Tough year for airlines EUROPE'S airlines face a tough second half, with the recovery from last year's Gulf war-induced fall in passenger numbers slowing, the 23-member Association of European Airlines (AEA), warned yesterday. The improvement over 1991 would drop from 18.4 per cent in the first six months to 7.5 per cent over the second half of the year. Traffic to South America and the Middle East continued to grow in the first half; that to Africa and Asia remained static at 1990 levels.</p>

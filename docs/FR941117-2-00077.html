			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Response to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Comments That Do Not Relate to Violations Charged in the Complaint <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three of the five comments received related to conduct not charged in the Complaint. As discussed in more detail  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> review under the Tunney Act is confined to the terms of the proposed decree and their adequacy as remedies for the violations alleged in the Complaint. Public comments and the Court's review are designed to ensure that the Department has fashioned relief to the violations alleged in the Complaint that it reasonably believes will further the public interest. Public comments that relate to conduct that the Department has determined not to prosecute are beyond the scope of the Tunney Act review procedure, for the reasons and under the law set forth fully at section III, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issues raised by the following three comments therefore are not relevant to the Tunney Act determination of whether the proposed decree is in the ``public interest.'' Nevertheless, the Department herewith provides an explanation to interested members of the public on the issues raised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Comment of Anne E. Bogoch, Chan &amp; Jodziewicz <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Anne E. Bogoch, an attorney in the firm Chan &amp; Jodziewicz, submitted a comment on behalf of small computer companies who claim to have been unlawfully excluded from both the hardware and software computer market by Microsoft's monopolization of the personal operating system software market. The comment objects to two related Microsoft practices: (1) ``Microsoft's tying or bundling of the sale of MS&hyph;DOS to the purchase of hardware systems'' and (2) Microsoft's ``purported licensure to restrict the resale of copies of MS&hyph;DOS.'' The comment attacks these practices as illegal under two theories. The first relies on copyright law, arguing that under the First Sale Doctrine, Microsoft cannot restrict the ability of purchases of MS&hyph;DOS to resell that MS&hyph;DOS in any manner they see fit. The fact that Microsoft is writing license agreements that purport to restrict resale is alleged to be an abuse of the copyright and therefore an antitrust violation. Second, the comment argues that Microsoft has engaged in illegal tying, by conditioning the purchase of the typing product, MS&hyph;DOS, on the purchase of personal computers: customers are prevented from buying MS&hyph;DOS without a personal computer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This comment apparently refers to Microsoft's practice of licensing the use of its copyrighted software (Microsoft) to OEMs only for distribution with the personal computers sold by those OEMs, and subject to license restrictions that prohibit the OEMs from reselling the software as a stand-alone product. Microsoft has used this licensing policy for many years, and has initiated legal action against a number of its licensees alleging that by distributing copies of MS&hyph;DOS that were not sold in conjunction with a computer, the licensee had violated the terms of its license and infringed Microsoft's copyrights. In a number of these cases, Microsoft has apparently received favorable results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, a firm does not violate the antitrust laws merely by enforcing its legitimate intellectual property rights. Thus, to the extent that Microsoft's conduct is an instance of legitimately exploiting its copyright, there is little reason to challenge that conduct as violative of the Sherman Act. Based on the facts that were uncovered through its inquiry, the Department did not find a basis for challenging under the Sherman Act this aspect of Microsoft's conduct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also has not sought to challenge this alleged conduct as an illegal tying arrangement under the antitrust laws. Microsoft does not sell the allegedly tied product (personal computers). This situation does not, therefore, come with the framework for illegal tying arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Comment of Micro System Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A comment from Micro System Options complaints that the developers toolkit for Microsoft's Windows NT 3.5 contains a new, attractive feature to create three dimensional images within software applications. It expresses concern that Microsoft's next release of Windows will include the same feature. Micro System Options apparently makes a software product called 3d Graphic Tools which performs functions similar to those of the new feature in Microsoft's software product(s), and Micro System Options is concerned that the inclusion of this new feature in Microsoft software products will reduce demand for its own software product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's Complaint does not challenge as violations of the antitrust laws Microsoft's inclusion of new software features in its operating system products. Over the past fourteen years, Microsoft has developed and soft numerous successive versions of its operating system products, each more advanced and containing more software features than the previous one. Whenever Microsoft adds an attractive software feature to its operating system products, it reduces the demand for software products sold by third parties as a complement to the Microsoft product that performed similar functions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Fungi business at Claridge's THE RAIN falling constantly for the past fortnight has caused considerable damage in the UK, washed out fields of salad crops and vegetables and confined fishing boats to harbour - thereby pushing up the price of fish. But there is a silver lining, particularly if you like early morning walking in wet woodlands with a bag and a small, sharp knife. This is the time of the year for ceps. These magnificent mushrooms are, because of a damp spring followed by a warm summer and then a wet autumn, better and more plentiful than for years. Ten days ago I was stopped by a friend who was clutching a bag en route to Antonio Carluccio's shop in Covent Garden, central London. Inside were 4lb to 5lb of delicious ceps that had been collected on Hampstead Heath, in north London. He wanted to verify that they were all fit for human consumption. (If in doubt always check with a book or a local chef). When Marjan Lesnik, executive chef at Claridge's, walked into his kitchens on Monday morning there were 30lb (about 14 kilos) of ceps waiting for his inspection. They had been picked over the weekend by various members of the hotel's kitchen and waiting staff, mainly Italians, who had earned some useful pocket money through their weekend foraging. The wholesale prices of ceps ranges from Pounds 4 to Pounds 8 per lb for the very best according to Michael Hyams, fruit and veg supplier to London's top restaurants. This season's weather is producing edible wild mushrooms that even he has not seen before. On Tuesday he had been shown 60lbs of a mushroom called Deceiver, fresh from the New Forest and in top condition. And they are easy to cook. Having cleaned, washed and patted them dry cut them into thick slices, marinate for 30 minutes in olive oil and grill. As an accompaniment to almost any main course, slice them more thinly and saute in olive oil with garlic and parsley. Or you can try and emulate the professionals. In his new book Keep it Simple (Octopus, Pounds 18.99, 192 pages) Alastair Little gives the recipe for a wild mushroom tart he is currently serving at his Frith Street restaurant in central London. At La Tante Claire Pierre Koffmann has created a new, and currently unnamed, first course which comprises, on one side of the plate, thin slices of seasoned raw cep, sprinkled with olive oil, while the other is taken up with thinly sliced, raw scallops marinated in olive oil, topped with a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Also worthwhile is the newly published Mushrooms on the Menu by John Midgeley (Aurum Press, Pounds 8.95, 120 pages). The cep season should last another three weeks unless early frosts or eager pickers strike first.</p>

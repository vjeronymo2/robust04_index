			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. M. Muzafarov, V. D. Myakushev, V. V. </F> Kazakova, N. A. Tebeneyeva, O. B. Gorbatsevich, and Ye. A.  Rebrov, Synthetic Polymers Institute; UDC667.6:621.792:678.84]    [Abstract] Hydrolytic copolycondensation of various  organosilanes forms the basis for production of silicon-organic  film formers for lacquers and enamels. Although this process has  been used to produce an entire series of industrial paints  varnishes, these products are somewhat inadequate in physical  mechanical properties and resistance to organic solvents. These  shortcomings are commonly overcome by modifying the  silicon-organic film formers with organic polymers. Although  this improves the physical mechanical properties, it also  reduces the heat resistance of the products. Other ways to  overcome this problem include improving structural ordering in  the synthesized silicon-organic film formers by heterofunctional  condensation of structurally organized oligomers, although this  had limited success. In the present work a study was made of the  synthesis of silicon-organic film formers using sodium  oxyorganoalkoxysiloxanes. These universal reagents provide a new  level for ordering structural organization of oligomers. This  new approach may be used to develop production of a new  generation of silicon-organic film formers. Figures 2;  references 8 (Russian).</p>

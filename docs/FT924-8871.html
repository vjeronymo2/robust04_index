			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Spending dilemmas A GOVERNMENT that aims to achieve credibility by sticking to pre-announced targets is doomed to discomfort. Either it abandons its targets, which makes it look ridiculous, or its sticks to them, which makes it look dogmatic. In the case of the often-repeated commitment to the ERM, the UK government now looks ridiculous. By all accounts, this week's Autumn Statement on public spending will make it look dogmatic. Yet dogmatism would be better than succumbing to the now pervasive sense of panic. In an all too familiar volte face, erstwhile emulators of the Germans have switched unblushingly to 'go go' economics. What the chancellor of the exchequer needs to do is ignore the panic and elaborate, instead, his still sketchy medium- term framework for policy. With the loss of government's main economic policy and the economy teetering between recovery and depression, the details of Mr Lamont's spending proposals are a second-order issue. What matters most is to get the right relationship between fiscal and other policies and to put forward credible proposals for dealing with the dismal long-term prospects for the public finances. In resisting a fiscal splurge, the chancellor should stress once more the substantial easing of monetary policy that has occurred since September 16. In all probability, a further easing of monetary policy would be more appropriate than the fiscal alternatives. It is too early to argue that further monetary loosening will, in Keynes' famous phrase, be like pushing on a string. Deficit danger Mr Lamont should also stress the link between inflation, pay, devaluation and the prospects for sustained recovery. Particularly after a devaluation which is now 13 per cent on the trade weighted effective exchange rate, inflation cannot be assumed to be a thing of the past. The devaluation will also fail to provide an enduring improvement in competitiveness if the rate of growth of real wages does not fall and profitability in the production of tradable goods does not rise. Where does fiscal policy and public spending fit into the picture? The main point here is the dire prospects for public finances in the longer term. The public sector borrowing requirement this year may be about Pounds 35bn (5 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product) and well over Pounds 40bn next year (6 to 7 per cent of GDP). That looks bad, but oceans of red ink can be tolerated in a slump. More worryingly, such deficits could become structural, partly because of the permanent increase in the interest bill (some Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn for each year of such deficits), but still more because of what has been happening to the economy. Inaccurate forecasts In March 1990, the Treasury believed that real GDP in 1993-94 would be 8 to 9 per cent larger than now seems likely. Unless the UK enjoys a long recovery at a faster rate than the 2 3/4 per cent a year that the Treasury then thought to be the trend, the economy will remain almost 10 per cent smaller than was expected only 2 1/2 years ago. Self-evidently, the UK will also be unable to afford the public spending plans of that time, let alone increases that are more than cyclical. Even the increase in unemployment does not, it should be noted, necessarily fall into the cyclical category. The question for the government, part political and part economic, is how much of the pain to impose now and how much in future years. Higher taxes and spending cuts would seem inevitable, though now does not look like the ideal time for either. But that is not what the government is proposing. Its planning total of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94 represents a real increase of around 4 per cent. Provided it delivers the needed monetary loosening, that target should be met. Yet failure to do so would not be the end of the fiscal world. An enfeebled government must be careful not to lay itself open to the accusation of starving poor widows and orphans. Maintaining existing investment projects must also be sensible. Even control over public-sector pay cannot be isolated from what is happening elsewhere in the economy. Mr Major inherited a strong fiscal position. His challenge is to use the fiscal flexibility he has now, while putting forward a credible plan for reducing the scale of borrowing in the future.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: BCE tunes into a multi-media future / Examining the Canadian Telecom's investment plan Many companies in the fast-evolving telecommunications business are bigger than Canada's BCE. However, in the scramble for a toehold in the converging worlds of telephones, cable television and entertainment, only a handful have managed to leave their footprints in as many places. With its plan to buy an initial 30 per cent stake in Colorado-based Jones Intercable, BCE is now about to secure a significant presence in one of the pioneering parts of the business - the US cable-TV industry. 'We're not finished,' says Mr Derek Burney, chairman of BCE Telecom International, a wholly-owned unit through which BCE is channelling its international expansion. BCE Telecom's mandate, Mr Burney says, is 'to make investments internationally covering the full range of telecommunications in areas where we either have expertise to offer or where our expertise will complement that of our partner in a way that we both benefit'. Mr Burney, who until last year was Canada's ambassador in Washington, says BCE is especially seeking opportunities in Latin America and Asia. BCE's telecom interests now stretch from stakes in Canadian, UK and New Zealand telephone companies, to a 52 per cent interest in Northern Telecom, the telephone equipment maker. It also has interests in cable-TV franchises, telephone directories, and cellular and mobile phone systems. The decision to focus on telecommunications marks an about-turn from BCE's strategy a decade ago. Then, the prospect that its offshoot, Bell Canada, would not maintain its stranglehold on Canada's domestic telephone market led BCE into an ambitious - and costly - diversification. However, Mr Raymond Cyr, architect of BCE's entry into financial services, pipelines, computer services, printing and property development, made way in 1990 for Mr Red Wilson, former head of Tate &amp; Lyle's Canadian subsidiary. The unflappable Mr Wilson, 53, has often said that the survival of any serious player in the telecommunications business depended on its ability to deliver a wide range of services. The last of the non-telecom businesses, comprising financial services group Montreal Trustco and property developer Brookfield Development, were sold last week. A CDollars 750m (USDollars 564.3m) loss on these investments will be charged to BCE's fourth-quarter earnings. The Montreal Trustco sale has left BCE with a stake of almost 5 per cent in Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-biggest bank. BCE's latest purchase is one of the US's lesser-known but more innovative cable-TV companies. Mr Glenn Jones, chairman and controlling shareholder of Jones Intercable, 'is considered one of the industry's visionaries,' says Mr George King, analyst at Canseco Capital Management in Indianapolis. Jones Intercable is among the pioneers in bringing school and university courses to cable-TV subscribers - a service which has yet to catch on. It also has several interests in the entertainment business, among them a subsidiary which provides programmes to 600 US radio stations. BCE and Jones became acquainted through their joint ownership of Encom Cable, which owns six contiguous franchises in London. Besides cable-TV, Encom offers voice and data services in its franchise area, a model which North American telephone and cable companies are seeking to emulate. Jones is the seventh-biggest US cable operator. However, its strength is not so much the cable systems which it owns, as those which it manages on behalf of about 20 limited partnerships. The partnerships are typically liquidated after between five and seven years, leaving Jones with an interest in the residual value and an obvious route for expansion. Much of the Dollars 400m which BCE has committed to invest in Jones is likely to be earmarked for purchases of systems owned by defunct partnerships, as well as outside systems. BCE has an option to lift its 30 per cent stake in Jones to a controlling one. While BCE's diversification drive in the 1980s proved to have been an indisputable mistake, its telecommunications investments have not been trouble-free either. Northern Telecom is in the middle of a painful restructuring, having lost Dollars 989m in the first nine months of this year. Bell Canada, BCE's cash cow, is also in transition, hobbled on the one hand by growing competition in Canada's long-distance telephone market, and on the other, by continuing regulation of its monopoly on local services in Ontario and Quebec. BCE's challenge, like that of other companies trying to bring the strands of the telecommunications and cable-TV businesses together, is to demonstrate that a stable of diverse investments can produce more innovation and a better return for shareholders than each company operating by itself. BCE's consulting arm, Bell Canada International, will be integrated with BCE Telecom next month as part of the effort to promote exchanges between the companies in which BCE is a shareholder. Mr Burney says: 'We're not looking to some grand international alliance where all the pieces come together.' However, he points to the cable-cum-telephone partnership with Jones in the UK, and says: 'We do see complements.' BCE and Mercury Communications, the UK telephone company in which BCE bought a 20 per cent stake earlier this year, have begun to tap into each other's resources. About half-a-dozen Bell Canada managers have been parachuted into senior positions at Mercury, while several Mercury employees have been seconded to Bell. BCE and Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, are meeting in the UK this week to discuss further co-operation. Similarly, Jones has commissioned Bell-Northern Research, Canada's biggest privately-owned research group, to help on a systems integration project. 'We would expect that the full range of the family's expertise could be brought to bear in some shape or form in this investment, as it has in others,' Mr Burney says.</p>

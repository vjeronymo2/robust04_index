			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / EC energy plan 'could save millions' EC ENERGY users could save 'tens of millions of ecus' on their annual gas and electricity bills, the European Commission said yesterday, if member states approve its plans to introduce a genuine internal market in energy. The draft directives, which Brussels agreed on yesterday, aim to open up the gas and electricity networks to greater competition from the beginning of next year. They would enable the largest energy users - steel and aluminium plants, large construction sites, chemical, glass and fertiliser factories - to buy their gas and electricity from suppliers anywhere in the Community from January 1, 1993. At the same time, energy distributors would be able to club together to gain access to the whole network, passing on the savings to smaller consumers. Assuming the legislation is successful, the same principles will be extended to smaller users from January 1, 1996, but before then these directives will have to overcome fierce opposition from most EC gas and energy producers and a number of member states. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, said yesterday that in some cases the infrastructure needed for the cross-border transport of energy was not in place, but the directives would allow new companies to build gas and electricity lines. Access to the network would be available to some 400-500 large industrial users of electricity, each of which consumes more than 100GW hours of electricity annually, and to consumers of more than 25m cubic metres of gas a year. Distributors which account for 3 per cent or more of electricity, or 1 per cent of gas consumption in an individual member state, would also be entitled to shop around for better prices. Last October, Mr Cardoso e Cunha dropped more aggressive plans to break up energy monopolies using the Commission's special legal powers, when it became clear that some member states - in particular the Netherlands, Germany and France - would block such an approach. The Commission has not abandoned those powers, but Mr Cardoso e Cunha hopes the gradual approach will prove more acceptable to member states.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Waiting for Greenspan to hit the brakes - Wall Street In spite of the Federal Reserve's decision this week not to put up interest rates again, Wall Street analysts are convinced that it is now a question of when, not if, the central bank will next tighten monetary policy to slow down the economy. Although share prices posted solid gains for three consecutives days after the Fed's open market committee meeting on Tuesday closed without a rate increase, few investors, analysts or dealers believe that policy will stay on hold for very long. Judging by the most recent data, the economy is still growing too strongly for the Fed's liking. Looking back, it now seems that the only reason the FOMC did not sanction a rate rise at its meeting was that its members had no inkling of how strong Thursday's gross domestic product and home sales statistics were going to be. If they had known - or guessed - that second quarter GDP growth would be revised upwards from 3.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent, and that sales of single-family homes would jump by 9.1 per cent in August, then they would probably have given Fed chairman Alan Greenspan an immediate green light to raise interest rates by another 25 or 50 basis points. The Fed's goal is to choke inflationary pressures in the economy by slowing the rate of annual growth to about 2.5 per cent. The difference between 2.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent is just too great to be ignored, even if the data on prices have yet to show signs of resurgent inflation. This means that investors in stock and bond markets will have to play a waiting game. The FOMC is not scheduled to sit again until November 15, and although on four of the five occasions that the Fed has raised rates this year it has done so immediately following an FOMC summit, there is nothing to stop Greenspan from initiating a rate increase before the next FOMC meeting. After the Fed left policy unchanged after the July 6 FOMC gathering, it was revealed that the committee had decided at the time to grant the Fed chairman the freedom to raise rates in the period between FOMC meetings if he felt it was necessary. Analysts believe that on Tuesday, Greenspan was given similar discretionary powers. The only question is: will the rate increase come at the end of next week, after the September employment report is released, or will the Fed hold its fire until the week after, when figures on inflation, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation are all due to be released? A majority of analysts are betting that the Fed will wait until the inflation figures are released, although very strong jobs data could trigger an early tightening. Either way, trading on the stock market is likely to be overshadowed in coming weeks by fear of a rate increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been stuck between 3,800 and 3,900 for more than a month, and it is difficult to see how blue-chip stocks can break up and out of that range. It is easier to imagine a decisive, downward shift in prices, particularly if the bond market pre-empts another Fed rate increase by sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond - the most widely-followed measure of long-term interest rates - above 8 per cent. The 30-year yield closed this week at just over 7.8 per cent, its highest level since June, 1992. A stronger-than-expected September jobs report would probably push the yield up over 7.9 per cent, with signs of rising inflation in the producer and consumer prices data, and an accompanying rate increase from the Fed, likely to shove it through the 8 per cent mark. At that point, sentiment in the equity market could turn nasty. An overheating economy, a fresh tightening of monetary policy, and rising long-term interest rates would be an unpleasant combination for stocks. This gloomy scenario, however, does not take into account one factor that should have a positive impact upon share prices in the next few weeks - corporate earnings. The third quarter reporting season will begin in earnest soon, and every indication suggests that it will be a good one for US companies. Sustained emphasis upon cost containment and improved efficiency, rising consumer spending, the strong domestic economy and resurgent economies overseas should have bolstered corporate earnings during the third three months of the year, and are likely to do so into the final quarter. Rate increase or no rate increase, US companies are making money, and providing a welcome safety net for investors fearful of a large market slide.  ---------------------------------------- Monday         3849.24   +   17.49 Tuesday        3863.04   +   13.80 Wednesday      3875.18   +   15.14 Thursday       3854.63   -   23.55 Friday         3843.19   -   11.44  ----------------------------------------</p>

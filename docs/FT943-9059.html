			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G Ventures trust will invest in MBOs Legal &amp; General Ventures, the venture capital group, yesterday announced it was creating an investment trust which would invest primarily in companies recently floated by management buy-out and buy-in teams. Legal &amp; General is focusing on this set of companies because research suggests former MBO and MBI companies have out-performed the stock market since 1987. The new vehicle will be the first investment trust to focus almost exclusively on former MBO and MBI companies. Earlier this year L&amp;G Ventures launched the first trust exclusively investing mezzanine finance in unquoted companies. To create the new vehicle, L&amp;G Ventures is taking over the management of an existing investment trust, Group Development Capital Trust, which invested in unquoted companies but now has most of its assets in cash and gilts. The new investment policy will direct 75 per cent of Group Development's assets into listed MBOs and MBIs and the other 25 per cent into unlisted MBO and MBI companies which are likely to float. Mr Charles Peal, managing director of L&amp;G Ventures, said recently floated MBOs and MBIs were attractive investments because typically they were focused businesses with strong leadership and strict financial controls. SG Warburg is making a cash offer to shareholders of Group Development. The cash offer will give shareholders 97.5 per cent of the value of Group Development's assets. At the same time, L&amp;G Ventures hopes to raise up to Pounds 25m through a placing and offer of subscription units which will give the right to be allotted new ordinary shares and warrants. The placing and offer for subscription are conditional on a minimum subscription of Pounds 10m being achieved. If this level is not reached, L&amp;G Ventures will still take over Group Development. Mr Peal said using an existing investment trust was a much cheaper way of raising capital. Legal &amp; General Assurance Society already holds 26.5 per cent of Group Development.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ON MEDICINE;  </P> <P> INFORMATION LAPSE SLOWS WORD ON AIDS TREATMENTS  </P> <P> The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsors a  substantial proportion of U.S. AIDS research, has an annual budget of more than  $900 million, including about $950,000 for its communications office.  </P> <P> But not one cent is specifically allocated to inform physicians about treatment  advances against AIDS or other deadly diseases.  </P> <P> This startling fact came to light earlier this month as the federal institute  responded to a newspaper story stating that it had delayed publicizing its  recommendations for the use of a potentially life-saving treatment advance  against a common AIDS-related pneumonia.  </P> <P> The story, which appeared in the New York Times, turned out to be overstated.  But it did focus attention on the real problems, including budgets, that plague  the NIAID's efforts to keep physicians informed of state-of-the-art therapies.  </P> <P> "We don't have funds budgeted for this sort of information dissemination" to  physicians, said Elaine Baldwin, chief of information projects in NIAID's  office of communications. "We recognize that we don't have a good system."  </P> <P> Baldwin said the institute has "relied on drug companies who have had an  interest in getting information out on a particular (AIDS) study" to send  letters, at the drug company's expense, to physicians who are on their mailing  lists. Such mailings typically reach only a small percentage of physicians.  That method also raises questions about the propriety of the federal  government's reliance on pharmaceutical manufacturers who profit from increased  sales of their products.  </P> <P> Ideally, physicians and patients should be fully informed about new treatments  for serious illnesses as soon as they are proved effective. While instantaneous  access to valid medical information is not realistic, many believe that the  federal government could do a far better job in getting the word out.  </P> <P> The new federal recommendations for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia were written by a panel of 17 AIDS experts, including nine from  California. After reviewing five clinical trials, the experts called for the  use of the steroid drug prednisone in addition to standard antibiotics to treat  moderate to severe cases of the pneumonia. Pneumocystis infection is one of the  most common causes of death in AIDS patients.  </P> <P> The news that steroids were a promising addition to the standard pneumonia  treatment is nothing new. It has been publicized frequently in recent months --  for example, in a presentation by a UC San Diego physician at the international  AIDS conference in June, which was reported in the Los Angeles Times, and in an  article and an editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine in July.  </P> <P> However, the federal government's endorsement of the use of steroids has  received relatively little attention until this month. Authoritative government  recommendations, on diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to AIDS, can  be crucial in encouraging physicians to change the way they practice medicine.  </P> <P> The federal AIDS treatment recommendations were made final in August and  discussed at AIDS meetings and on cable television shows aimed at physicians.  The report was not made public until last week, when it was published, along  with two of the five studies reviewed by the expert panel, in the New England  Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> During the intervening three months, some physicians may have failed to  prescribe steroids for AIDS patients who needed them because they were unaware  of the expert panel's conclusions. Baldwin and Dr. Henry Masur, the National  Institutes of Health official who chaired the panel, acknowledged in interviews  that little was done to directly inform physicians or the public of the  recommendations, despite the permission the government received from the New  England Journal of Medicine in September to do so.  </P> <P> The NIAID communications office had prepared a three-page "note to physicians"  summarizing the "important information on the clinical benefit" of steroids.  </P> <P> On Oct. 10, the summary was sent by LyphoMed/Fujisawa, which manufactures a  drug used to treat pneumocystis, to 2,500 physicians on its mailing list. This  is fewer than 0.5% of the approximately 600,000 physicians in the United  States.  </P> <P> Some newsletters specializing in AIDS treatments also were notified, as was a  U.S. Public Health Service toll-free number that provides AIDS information.  </P> <P> NIAID never released its own statement to the public, the news media, hospital  intensive care unit directors or leading medical organizations, such as the  American Medical Assn., so that they might have notified their members.  </P> <P> In the Public Health Service, "no one takes responsibility for unusual  circumstances such as this," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe of the Washington-based  Health Research Group, which has repeatedly called for federal health officials  to establish a mechanism to swiftly inform physicians of major therapeutic  advances in their fields.  </P> <P> "In the future, we may come up with a multi-pronged plan of action," said  Baldwin, of the NIAID. "I think it would be a very good idea."  </P></p>

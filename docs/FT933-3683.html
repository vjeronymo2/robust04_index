			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / German engineers set pay target Germany's engineering workers will be calling for a wage rise next year limited to the rate of inflation, plus any increase in productivity, according to Mr Klaus Zwickel, acting leader of IG Metall, the country's largest trade union, Quentin Peel writes. The move is seen as a clear indication by the union of the need for wage restraint because of the downturn in the German economy. But it still falls well short of the employers' insistence on a 'zero round' in next year's most important wage round.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Rome to host peace negotiations MIDDLE EAST peace negotiations will move to Rome after the next round of talks, which are scheduled to open in Washington on Monday, the US State Department announced yesterday. The new venue represents a modest step forward in resolving the procedural difficulties which have delayed consideration of substantive issues. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian delegation had strongly resisted Israel's efforts to site the talks closer to the Middle East. They felt it was to their advantage to hold the early bilateral sessions in the US where pressure from the administration and the attention of the media worked to their advantage. In order to break the deadlock, the State Department asked each delegation to submit a list of acceptable venues. Rome was common to the five lists. No date has been set for the first meeting in Italy and may have to await the outcome of the general election in Israel on June 23.</p>

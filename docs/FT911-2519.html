			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Why Welsh farmers are saying 'cheese' - Rural enterprise: Adding value at source The 80 acres of Welsh hill pasture which drop steeply away from Tony and Pam Craske's hill-top cottage above Pontypool could, in return for a lot of hard work, produce an annual income of Pounds 5,000. But the Craskes have rejected sheep as a means of boosting Tony Craske's retirement pension, opting instead to produce a variety of goats' and cows' milk cheeses in the farm buildings alongside their home. Abergavenny Fine Foods now combines cheese-making with a distribution business used by other farmers to bring their cheese to market. In the space of nine years the Craskes have created acompany which employs eight people and has annual sales of nearly Pounds 500,000. 'None of the other farms around here employs anyone outside the farmer's family,' says Tony Craske. Although the Craskes are not of farming stock - theycame to Pant-Ysgawn Farm after Tony retired from a management career with ICI - they illustrate an important shift taking place in the farming sector. Pressure on agricultural incomes is concentrating the minds of those who run farm-based businesses on attempts to add more value to products at source, instead of shipping the raw materials to distant food processing plants which cream off the larger share of profits. Tony and Pam Craske came into the business of making cheese when they wanted to use up surplus milk from the small herd of goats they had bought to meet their own needs. They made their first sales in nearby Abergavenny market but began supplying Sainsbury's and other large supermarket chains as the result of a cheese promotion campaign run by the Welsh Development Agency (WDA). It soon became apparent that the Craskes had insufficient space in their farm buildings both to keep goats and to make the cheese so the goat-keeping was subcontracted out to a farmer in west Wales. The milk is now frozen on that farm and brought to Pant-Ysgawn once a week for processing. The help which the Craskes received from the WDA came under a programme known as the Welsh Food Initiative, established in 1986 to help food producers diversify and add value. This programme has in turn become part of the recently createdWelsh Food Promotions campaign set up to market local produce. Foodstuffs might appear a relatively simple product group compared with say, high technology electronics, but the growing complexity of hygiene legislation means that a high degree of sophistication is required, says Tim Lacy- Halbot, food development executive for the WDA and Gwent County Council. One of the main problems facing the rural food producer is that of scale. Few farmers are in a position to produce enough to be able to afford to market their product professionally or to create a business of any worthwhile size. In an attempt to overcomethis problem Tony Craske is involved in a WDA-backed initiative to process and market a cow's milk cheese called St David's. The idea is for selected farmers to supply 'blanks' of raw cheese to a central processing plant where they will be matured, packed and distributed. At present one local farmer is providing the raw cheese for processing at Pant-Ysgawn but this operation will be moved to a larger unit in Abergavenny within a few weeks and more farmers are being lined up to supply the cheese 'blanks'. Craske hopes to sell Pounds 130,000 worth of St David's in the first year, rising to Pounds 500,000 within three years. Asimilar leap in scale has been made by David Morgan (right), founder of the Welsh Venison Centre at Bwlch near Brecon. Morgan began rearing deer six years ago for sale as breeding stock and three years ago moved into producing his own venison. Limited to just 20 acres on his father's 229-acre farm, he soon found that demand for venison had outstripped his own ability to supply. Morgan still rears his own deer and he hopes to double the acreage available but he buys inthree-quarters of his requirements from other breeders. The rest of the farm acreage is taken up by sheep, pigs and daffodils. He sees great potential for venison, a low fat meat which has been growing in popularity. Deer are more efficient at converting grass into meat than cattle and the gross profit margin per acre from deer is nearly twice as high. At present breeding and selling deer accounts for about half of the Welsh Venison Centre's Pounds 200,000 annual turnover but venison is due to increase its 30 per cent share. The remainder of sales are accounted for by the manufacture and installation of fences, gates andother equipment needed for handling deer. But Morgan is motivated not just by a desire to increase the revenues of the farm, which must support his father, his brother and himself. Equally important are a wish to escape from what hesees as the farmer's weak position in the commercial hierarchy and a desire fora more varied life than on an ordinary farm. 'I hated going to market and grovelling to buyers who couldn't jump over a fence,' he says. Handling the marketing of his venison takes him to hotels and restaurants in a 30 mile radiusfrom his farm and, more recently, to Birmingham. Buying in deer for slaughter from other farmers has allowed Morgan to expand his business to the pointwhere he employs a local butcher on a part-time basis. He is now hoping to takeon a full-time butcher as well as someone to do the metal fabrication work for the deer- handling equipment. Growth at Abergavenny Fine Foods and the Welsh Venison Centre has been steady rather than spectacular. Tynant Spring Water,in contrast, has mushroomed in size over the past two years and is forecasting further spectacular growth. There could be few more graphic examples of how clever marketing has turned a low-value commodity into a premium product. Geoff and Gwenllian Lockwood decided to diversify their business activities in 1984by bottling for sale the water which bubbled out of a spring by their hillside cottage some 12 miles from Lampeter. Initially the water was put into plastic bottles and sold locally. The growth in the public's demand for bottled water convinced the Lockwoods that they could build a bigger business so they teamed up with two local investors, one of whom had a background in the hotel and catering industry. He persuaded them that there was an unmet demand for an upmarketbottled water. 'We felt there was a gap in the market for a fine looking bottle to sit on the table alongside a bottle of wine,' says Gwenllian Lockwood. The Lockwoods dropped the clear plastic bottle they had been using in favourof a specially designed glass bottle in brilliant blue. Production was moved from the hillside down to a small industrial estate in Lampeter in 1989 and sales took off. Lockwood refuses to discuss turnover but expects to be able to sell the company's entire 8m capacity of the bottling line this year. But tougher food legislation is having an impact on Tynant. The Lockwoods expect European legislation will require all waters to be bottled at source  -Tynant is broughtby tanker to Lampeter  - so they are planning to shift the bottling plant back to the spring. When the new bottling plant is open Tynant will double itspresent workforce to 60 with a further increase to more than 80 expected shortly after. A preliminary meeting with the local planning authority was favourable so they are hopeful of getting planning permission. Tony Craske has been less successful in his attempts to expand. He has been unable to gain permissionto expand the buildings on his land because he is in the Brecon Beacons National Park. 'If I wanted to keep pigs I could put the building up but I can't get permission for cheese-making,' he says. The result is that his business will shortly be moving to Abergavenny into one of a cluster of units specially built to house food companies. The rules which have been drawn up to protect the rural landscape sometimes run counter to attempts to breathe new economic life into the country.</p>

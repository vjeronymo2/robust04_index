			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Write-downs set back Ambroveneto BANCO Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's largest private-sector bank, has announced that net parent company profits last year had fallen 23 per cent to L131bn (Dollars 104.8m) following write-downs on the book value of two subsidiaries. However, gross profits rose 8 per cent to L605bn, prompting a L10-a-share dividend increase to L150 for ordinary shares and L170 for savings shares. Preliminary figures for the group showed net earnings would rise by more than 20 per cent to L230bn in 1991. The write-downs involved the bank's Naples-based Ambroveneto Sud subsidiary, bought last year from Citibank, and Fiscambi, a financial services subsidiary. Ambroveneto wrote down Ambroveneto Sud's book value by L170bn, and that of Fiscambi by L23bn. Overall provisions, write-downs and transfers to risk funds amounted to L359bn. Ambroveneto Sud lost L38.7bn in 1991 against net profits of L4.3bn the previous year. However, the swing largely stemmed from a huge increase in provisions and transfers to risk funds, which jumped to L64.6bn from L24.2bn the previous year. The rise in Ambroveneto's gross profits stemmed from a 12.4 per cent increase in interest income to L1,228bn, while fee earnings climbed 8.5 per cent to L364bn. However, costs grew 13.6 per cent to L993bn, swollen by the opening of 46 new branches. The bank proposed a share-swap to buy out remaining minority shareholders in Ambroveneto Sud, who hold around 8 per cent of the stock. Shareholders will be offered 13 Ambroveneto ordinary shares for every 10 shares they own in Ambroveneto Sud.</p>

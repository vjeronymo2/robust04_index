			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Regulators struggle to control a wild market - Thailand's attempts to enforce rules on its stock exchange Moves by the Stock Exchange of Thailand to introduce more rigorous rules for disclosure of information by listed companies are being criticised by stockbrokers as clumsy and unrealistic. The exchange sent an awkwardly-worded 17-page document to listed companies requiring that all significant information be 'disclosed to general investors, and not to a specific group of people'. It did not consult them in advance, and it did not send copies of the new rules to stockbroking firms. Although the thrust of rules appeared uncontroversial, requiring timely release of important information and barring companies from passing privileged information, some brokers said they were a triumph of form over substance in a market were many company controllers still believed they could do what they wished. Brokers are upset by private hints from listed companies that they may be forced to be less forthcoming under the new regime, and that therefore it was likely to do little to lessen insider trading. The irritation of international brokers was all the greater because of the absence of official English language copies of the rules. Mr Peter Schiefelbein, chief representative for Standard Chartered Securities Asia, said: 'The regulators have tried very hard but they lack the experience of western authorities who pursue the principle but realise the practical. It is bad to make rules that cannot or will not be enforced. 'The speed they are going and the extent to which they are adopting unrealistic approaches is a little bit worrying. It is not easy to turn back  -how do you relax disclosure rules? - yet it would be a tragedy if they end up with the stifling Singaporean situation.' Mr George Morgan, country manager for HG Asia Investment Research, said: 'It's bizarre. It will make it harder for people who are not insiders to get information about a company. Foreign investors who already have doubts about quality of information will not be impressed.' Mr Russell Kopp, a senior analyst at Baring Research, said: 'The regulators have to move a little slower. Grand concepts are fine but the reality is this market has been pretty wild for a very long time - many still think 'until I'm caught its not illegal''. He said rules about timely release of important corporate information without either definition or legal precedent were 'just a joke'. Stock exchange officials said they were mystified by suggestions that analysts would have reduced access to information. Mr Chaipat Sahasakul, senior vice-president said the exchange 'has a policy of full disclosure. Our intention is that companies give out more, not less. We just want to make sure they use price sensitive information in a proper manner'. The controversy followed another attempt by the Thai authorities to crack down on stock-market irregularities, when the Securities and Exchange Commission asked in April for the prosecution of 30 investors suspected of rigging share prices. Hardly had the investors had a chance to contemplate the biggest legal action in the market's history when the names of 123 more suspects were leaked to the local press. Police investigations into 30 cases continued, and prosecutions against some are expected. No legal proceedings are expected against the 123 people whose names were leaked. Investors whose nerves had been frayed by earlier round-ups of suspected market manipulators suddenly had to contend with rumours about how far the regulators might go. The index plunged 6.2 per cent in five days - it has since fallen a further 1.6 per cent. The leak cast a shadow over what should have been a success for the commission. The naming of the 30 people was the culmination of seven months of action against four groups suspected of being big-time share manipulators. Mr Ekkamol Kiriwat, the commission's secretary-general said tough action had been inevitable. 'We were in a dilemma: everybody knew the market was being manipulated - it was discussed openly in the newspapers. You cannot have a perfect level playing field but it must be respectable or how can we ask anyone to invest?' Mr Schiefelbein said the authorities may have been too ambitious. 'In an emerging market the most important thing is for a company to be able to raise money through equities without resorting to debt. I think the Thai market could have handled being a cowboy one for a few more years,' he said. However, Mr Francis Middlehurst, head of research for Crosby Research (Thailand), was more generous. 'Considering the market was regularly ramped and manipulated by some extraordinarily powerful and well-connected people I think (the SEC) got a good result. If the exchange has also found it difficult to write insider trading rules then I'm not surprised - it's very difficult. It is part of the maturing process.' The Thai market has grown in the past five years. The number of listed companies has risen to 323 this month from 141 at the end of 1988, with market capitalisation climbing to nearly Dollars 60bn from Dollars 9bn in 1988. But the prevalence of unusual price movements was underlined recently when a number of shares showed unusual life shortly before first-quarter results. However, analysts believe that once teething troubles have been overcome, Thailand's cleaner stock market will become a more attractive destination for investment.</p>

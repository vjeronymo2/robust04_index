(70&hyph;8433) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary company CSW Energy, Inc. (``Energy''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202, and its proposed nonutility subsidiary, Energy Sub (``Energy Sub'') (together, ``Applicants''), have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6, 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 32 of the Act and Rules 43, 45 and 54 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSW and Energy propose to form and invest in Energy Sub, a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Energy, in connection with the purchase from Texasgulf, Inc. (``Texasgulf''), a nonassociate corporation, of an approximately 85 megawatt natural gas fired generation facility, including approximately 40 acres of land (``Project'') located in or near Wharton County, Texas. Energy Sub will develop the Project such that it will qualify as an exempt wholesale generator, as defined in Section 32(e) of the Act (``EWG''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Sub will be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock, each without par value. Energy will subscribe to all of Energy Sub's common stock at a subscription price of $1.00 per share. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further proposed that Energy Sub will purchase the Project from Texasgulf, the sole owner of the Project, for a purchase price in an amount not to exceed $11 million (``Purchase Price'') at financial closing of the purchase of the Project (``Purchase Closing''). The Purchase Closing is anticipated to occur promptly after the Commission's approval of the proposed transactions, expected to be in July 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Purchase Price, Energy Sub anticipates incurring costs to develop the Project. The aggregate of such development costs will not exceed $5 million (``Development Costs''). CSW and Energy propose to fund the Purchase Price and the Development Costs by capital contributions, loans or open account advances from CSW to Energy and from Energy to Energy Sub. All such loans or open account advances from CSW to Energy and from Energy to Energy Sub would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess of CSW's weighted cost of capital and would have a final maturity not to exceed five years.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

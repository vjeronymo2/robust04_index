			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO-WHEELERS A BIG DEAL;  </P> <P> BICYCLING: MORE COUNTY RIDERS ARE HITTING THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS FOR FITNESS,  FREEDOM AND FUN.  </P> <P> Remember when you got your first driver's license and swore you'd never pedal  your bike another inch? Remember when even the 10-year-old family station wagon  had more status than the most expensive Italian racing bicycle?  </P> <P> But now when you're spending too much time behind the wheel, and you spot a  lean cyclist on the road with the wind blowing in his face, the lowly bicycle  -- that vehicle you once thought was the quintessential symbol of immaturity --  somehow has risen in stature. It now represents physical and mental fitness,  self-discipline and, even freedom.  </P> <P> For an ever-increasing number of Southern Californians, cycling means more than  just another idle promise to lose a few pounds. More and more people are  cycling to regain a portion of their youth and lose a portion -- the one  hanging over their belt -- of their adulthood.  </P> <P> And it seems that once they've made the commitment to give cycling a try, many  are turning into fanatics.  </P> <P> Unless, of course, you don't find a 100-mile jaunt to San Diego for the day  fanatical. And if you don't, that probably means you're among the growing  number of serious "recreational" cyclists who curse their busy schedules  because sometimes they can only get in a 100 miles a week.  </P> <P> "As recently as four or five years ago, you could ride the Santiago Canyon Road  (connecting El Toro and Orange) and you'd see two or three other groups of  cyclists," said Ed Everett, a 24-year-old from Orange who recently opened a  bicycle shop in Mission Viejo. "Now on Saturdays and Sundays, it's just one  long, constant stream. It's unbelievable."  </P> <P> It's not as if these people are riding around the block a couple of times and  calling it a workout, either. A number of California centuries (100-mile  rides), such as the Solvang Century scheduled Saturday in Solvang, draw more  than 3,000 cyclists.  </P> <P> What's the fascination? Why are so many people spending every spare minute  riding the thin line between pleasure and pain?  </P> <P> Bill Leach, an Olympic kayaker and former All-American in water polo at UC  Irvine who is now one of the world's top-ranked master triathletes, provides a  number of reasons . . . some of them somewhat contradictory.  </P> <P> "Personally, I like the freedom and the speed of bicycling," he said. "It's a  great outlet for stress and frustrations and, of course, there's the fitness  aspect. But you can't underestimate the aspect of solitude. It gives you time  to be with yourself and enjoy your surroundings.  </P> <P> "Of course, there's the social part, too. It's a great way to see things with  your family or spend time with friends."  </P> <P> Most cyclists prefer not to ride alone and, as a result, clubs are flourishing.  The Capistrano Ciclistas, one of many Orange County clubs, was formed in the  mid-1970s during the last cycling resurgence. It remained active with a few  die-hard members through the doldrums of the early '80s, but its roster has  increased in recent years to 80 members.  </P> <P> Peter Neville of San Clemente joined Capistrano Ciclistas when he decided  bicycling would be a good way to reverse the effects of smoking two packs of  cigarettes a day for 30 years.  </P> <P> "Cycling is an endorphin popper," he said. "It brings you in tune with  yourself, with your abilities. The mechanical application is also intriguing.  The bicycle is a beautiful piece of equipment."  </P> <P> Neville, who quit his job and began his own business as an advertising and  marketing consultant specializing in cycling, pedals at least 130 miles a week.  </P> <P> But he still curses his old habits when pushing his way up a tough hill. "Peter  can be very bad-tempered on hills," said Rock Kendall, of Dana Point, smiling.  "You don't want to talk to him on hills."  </P> <P> Kendall, who started cycling as a training regimen when he was racing  catamarans, says he now rides more than he sails. He believes most noncyclists  believe the misconception that long-distance riding is a form of torture.  </P> <P> "You don't have to exert yourself to the point of pain," Kendall said. "You  gradually work your way up. I'm riding in my first century this weekend, my  last hurrah before I turn 40 this June, but I don't expect it to hurt. I hate  pain.  </P> <P> "We like to ride so much because it's fun. You're outside in the sun with your  friends. The camaraderie is the best part of it."  </P> <P> And being outdoors seems to add to the calming effect of all that exercise.  When cyclists talk about health clubs, they cringe at the thought of gulping  air conditioning when you can work out with fresh air filling your lungs.  </P> <P> Even a few whiffs of exhaust fumes won't change their minds.  </P> <P> "There are still lots of places in Orange County where you can ride without  traffic or signals, especially down by the beach," said Larry Keller, a  computer consultant from Huntington Beach. "I don't mind riding alone, either.  I have a lot of pressure in my job and this is a great release. Who needs a  psychiatrist when you've got a bike?"  </P> <P> Alone or in groups, cyclists share a common fear: accidents. They are not  uncommon and they are often serious.  </P> <P> "Anyone who's been on a bike more than a few hours can tell you about  situations where they could have been really hurt," Leach said. "I really think  that's one of the attractions for some people, the thrill that comes with  taking chances, with testing oneself.  </P> <P> "Of course, I still see people who don't wear helmets and that's just plain  stupid . . . or insane."  </P> <P> Leach's wife, Julie, teaches a recreational cycling class at Irvine Valley  College. She starts by showing her students how to change a tire and works her  way to effective gearing techniques. But she stresses defensive riding and  safety, and helmets are mandatory.  </P> <P> "The new hard-shell helmets are so cool, comfortable and light that there's  absolutely no excuse not to wear one," she said. "You can't even tell it's on  after a while."  </P> <P> Serious cyclists won't downplay the risks, but they invariably will tell you  that the benefits far outweigh the liabilities.  </P> <P> "Everyone I know has been hurt except me," said Pam Weiss of San Juan  Capistrano, pointing to the raspberry on the knee of companion David Swerdlin,  who had recently been caught in a squeeze play between a truck and a curb. "And  no, I don't get any excitement from the danger.  </P> <P> Weiss says she is aware that only 12% of cycling accidents involve a car and  that road debris and other cyclists cause more mishaps. Still, she would rather  deal with a stray beer bottle than a straying Buick.  </P> <P> "I worry more about cars than trash," she said. "I'm pretty confident I can  survive an accident caused by road debris."  </P> <P> Eighty-eight million Americans ride bicycles, but only 5 million to 10 million  do it on a weekly basis. Are they lazy or afraid of traffic?  </P> <P> "I suppose it would be safer to ride a stationary bike, if you can stand the  health-club scene," said Ron Klefbeck, president of the Capistrano Ciclistas,  "but there's no downhills and I wouldn't be riding if it wasn't for the  downhills.  </P> <P> "And I don't care what kind of fancy TV monitor you've got in front of you,  riding a stationary bike is boring."  </P> <P> OK, so you've decided to pedal away your frustrations, worries, stress and  excess pounds.  </P> <P> Now what? Get out the checkbook.  </P> <P> You'll need a bike ($250 to ($1,800), a helmet ($30-$100), biking shorts  ($30-$150), gloves ($10-$30), road cleats ($60-$300) and sunglasses (Oakley  Factory Pilots look cool for about $70, but almost any pair will do).  </P> <P> A tire repair kit, frame-mounted pump and water bottle are also near-mandatory  items.  </P> <P> All of these cycling accessories do more than make you look the part. The  shorts prevent chafing; gloves add comfort and reduce abrasions in a fall;  shoes enhance comfort and efficiency, and the sunglasses reduce the effects of  ultraviolet rays while providing protection from airborne debris.  </P> <P> It's also advisable to buy your bike from a bicycle shop because fitting is  important. An ill-fitting bike can result in any number of aches and pains and  even cause numbness in the hands.  </P> <P> Most cyclists who pedal long distances prefer the regular road frame (what used  to be called a "10-speed"), but the newer mountain-bike style is growing in  popularity because the rider sits more upright, which many find more  comfortable than the hunched over style of the road cyclist.  </P> <P> Some hybrid cycles, merging the road and mountain-bike designs, are on the  market.  </P> <P> "You can get a quality, entry-level bike for $400," said Tracy Sledge, a  salesman in a Laguna Beach bike shop. "And get a helmet the same day. Shorts  should probably be next, and make sure you get a pair with a good liner that  will keep the moisture away from your body. After that you can add gloves and  shoes."  </P> <P> For many, however, investing the money will be less painful than investing the  time.  </P> <P> "You want to start easy and keep it fun, but I see more and more people  sticking to it," said Julie Leach. "I think people are more motivated now  because they're more health conscious. Things I was learning in college, like  the impact of cholesterol levels, are common knowledge now.  </P> <P> "I think people are getting bored with health clubs and what's more healthy  than fresh air? And cycling is a lot more comfortable than running."  </P> <P> This time of the year, cyclists all over the country are looking out windows at  snow drifts. But here in the Southland, the rolling masses are chalking up  hundreds of miles each week.  </P> <P> And every day, more decide to go along for the ride.  </P></p>

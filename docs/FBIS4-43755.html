			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 20 (A.A) -- Sedat Yurtdas, expelled  from Parliament last Thursday [16 June], said today that they  will not leave the Parliament building, because of the order  given by the chief prosecutor to detain them.    As the Constitutional Court last Thursday decided to ban the  Democracy Party [DEP] and strip its 13 members from Parliament  membership, Ankara State Security Court Chief Prosecutor Nusret  Demiral ordered the detention of Sedat Yurtdas and Selim Sadak,  the two remaining DEP members.    After learning that they will be detained, the two deputies  received a call from Deputy Parliament Speaker Kamer Genc who  told them that he will not allow the police to enter the  premises and will take action before the High Board of Judges  and Prosecutors to protect the deputies.    He added that Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk and  Demiral disagreed on their detention.</p>

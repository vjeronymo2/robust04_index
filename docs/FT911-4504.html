			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Leading French companies face tax crackdown FRENCH TAX authorities have launched a belated crackdown on companies which exploited a loophole in investment tax law, government officials said yesterday. The Finance Ministry is considering heavy fines, thought to exceed FFr1bn (Pounds 100m), against 'several dozen' leading companies accused of setting up investment funds with the sole purpose of generating tax credits on dividend payments. Mr Michel Charasse, the budget minister, told the national assembly this week that an inquiry was under way, though he gave no precise figures or names in answer to a parliamentary question. He did not deny French press reports that the tax directorate had sent a FFr600m demand for unpaid tax, relating to the 1987 fiscal year, to 157 companies and was negotiating substantial fines on top of that figure. The inquiry comes at a potentially helpful moment for the government, which is looking around for new measures to hold the line on a budget deficit now in danger of growing because of the drop in tax revenues caused by the recession. Mr Michel Rocard, the prime minister, has recently suffered a parliamentary setback and there is increasing speculation that a government reshuffle may be in the offing. His colleagues are looking for ways to pass the buck on unpopular spending cuts. Clearly, they would all welcome a corporate tax revenue windfall. The Association Francaise des Banques is attempting to negotiate a reduction in the likely fines on behalf of its members, some of which set up investment funds to help corporate clients minimise their tax bills. The government closed the loophole in question in 1989, but it was not until recently that the tax directorate took action against companies that had made use of it before then. It is an example of several grey areas that still exist in France's surprisingly flexible tax laws, said Mr Patrick de Freminet, director of tax affairs for Paribas, which has not made use of this loophole. 'In French tax law there are some things which, although not forbidden, are . . . in any case not advisable,' he explained.</p>

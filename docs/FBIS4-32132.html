			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Balazs Pocs: "No Political Cleanup Planned in </F> the Foreign Ministry"]    [Text] The chapter of the government program on foreign  and security policy and defense has been drawn up, it was  announced at a news conference on 16 June at which a report was  presented on the three-day work of the coalition committee of  foreign affairs experts.    The negotiating delegations were led by Laszlo Kovacs for  the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi for the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. There are no fundamental  differences between the ideas of the two parties, Kovacs said.  He added that the three main directions of foreign political  activities -- Euratlantic integration, forming good-neighborly  relations, and supporting the justified efforts of the Hungarian  minorities living beyond the border -- are closely related and  equally important, and they need to be handled in parallel with  one another.    It is especially important for Hungary to become part of the  European Union [EU] as soon as possible and on the best possible  conditions, Kovacs emphasized. Until membership is achieved, we  have to make the most of the options provided by the Association  Agreement, and we have to make use of the opportunities to  develop the agreement and to amend it if necessary. However,  this does not mean that the agreement will be renegotiated. He  added that the talks on membership have to be started already in  this parliamentary cycle, and then a referendum has to be called  on the issue.    The views of the two parties differ somewhat on the issue of  NATO membership. The MSZP is in favor of holding a referendum  on this issue after the talks on membership are completed.  Although the SZDSZ would not oppose a referendum initiated by  the public, it does not consider it absolutely necessary.    Without normalizing relations with the neighboring  countries,  there is no chance of an improvement in the situation of  Hungarians living there, and the establishment of  good-neighborly relations is also important for Hungary's image  and integration, Kovacs said. The document prepared by the  experts committee makes special mention of Hungarian-Slovak and  Hungarian-Romanian relations, and emphasizes the importance of  the next government showing a willingness to have talks on the  [bilateral] basic agreements. These agreements will have to  contain a mutual renunciation of territorial demands,  recognition of current borders, and obligations to respect  national minority rights in accordance with the norms of the  Council of Europe and the CSCE.    The two parties agreed that it is the government's  constitutional, political, and moral obligation to support the  interests of Hungarians living beyond the border; this includes  national minority rights, the economic development of  Hungarians, and their local social self-organization.    Szent-Ivanyi said that views on the Foreign Ministry's  structure were not included in the committee's documents because  this will be the responsibility of the party that runs this  ministry. However, they agreed that it has become necessary to  modernize the Foreign Ministry's structure, to reduce  compartmenalization, increase the efficiency of the flow of  information, and to rationalize its budget. If possible the  ministry's staff has to be reduced.    Talking about personnel policy, Szent-Ivanyi said that  preference will be given to professional considerations and the  Foreign Ministry will not have any kind of political cleanup.    In reply to a question, Kovacs said that appointing the  foreign minister or deciding whether the ministry should belong  to a single party do not fall within the competence of the  experts committee. He added that, in the committee's view, the  structure of the Foreign Ministry will also have to reflect the  tasks resulting from the changed governmental structure.    In reply to our question, Szent-Ivanyi said that the SZDSZ  is  proposing the establishment of a ministry or office responsible  for European affairs because, in the interest of Hungary's  membership, it would be more favorable to concentrate the  related issues in one hand. He added that it would be expedient  also to jointly handle the issues of national minorities living  over the border and within the country.    Emphasizing that this was his personal view, Kovacs said  that  the assignment of the ambassadors is for two to six years. It  will be a task for the new foreign minister to examine which  ambassadors' work is absolutely necessary and to ask them to  stay on if possible.    In reaction to Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's remarks  (regarding the resignation of Pal Tar, ambassador to the United  States], Kovacs said that it is indeed a basic citizens' right  to run in the elections on the Hungarian Democratic Forum's  list, but to be an ambassador is not such a right; the two  issues cannot be linked. It is doubtful that a person who had  demonstrated his commitment to a foreign policy attitude based  on a belief in historical mission and ideological antipathies  and sympathies would be able to serve a foreign policy not based  on these, Kovacs said.    Talking about defense, Imre Mecs (SZDSZ) and Gyorgy Keleti  (MSZP) said that they consider it essential to maintain armed  forces that could guarantee the country's security. The  committee considers it necessary to continue to reduce the size  of the armed forces and to draw up a long-term development plan.  The draft reform plan of the armed forces has to be submitted  to Parliament in 1995. The experts committee would like to see  rescinded the government decree that planned to unite the  Defense Ministry and the Army headquarters.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Music Two of Britain's best-known 'musicians' musicians' release new albums this week. Nick Lowe, one of the unsung heroes of the punk/new wave movement and crucial to the development of figures such as Elvis Costello, has indulged himself with a very pleasant collection of country songs. The Impossible Bird (Demon) has a laid-back, authentic feel to it, which is more difficult to achieve than it sounds, but Lowe always allows his characteristic humour to shine through the potentially maudlin nature of his material. Jools Holland has assembled an impressive 12-piece orchestra for Live Performance (Beautiful Records), a highly polished set of boogie, rock and roll and jive standards which sounds as though band and audience had a great time. The CD even comes with an 'interactive' sleeve; it can be assembled to create a Victorian puppet theatre.                           *      *      * It is not often that movie soundtracks stand up as musical works on their own, but Zbigniew Preisner's score for Krzysztof Kieslowski's haunting Three Colours trilogy is an exception. Latest in the series is Red (Virgin), newly-released in Britain and every bit as good as its predecessors, which can be bought on its own or in a triple box set.                           *      *      * Yet again, a television commercial leads the way for a compilation album from a virtually forgotten figure: this time, Louis Armstrong (right), whose 'We Have All The Time In The World' spearheaded the latest Guinness campaign. The Pure Genius of Louis Armstrong (EMI) includes 'What a Wonderful World', 'Hello Dolly' and 'Georgia On My Mind'.                           *      *      * The latest new releases from Sony's 'Digital Club' series are both highly recommendable: Stefan Vladar plays Mozart's Piano Concertos 25 and 20 with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields; and organist Nicholas Danby plays a selection of Bach chorale preludes and fugues.</p>

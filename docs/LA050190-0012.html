			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD TACKLES CUTS TO BALANCE BUDGET  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board on Monday began the process of settling on more  than $30 million in administrative cuts needed to balance next year's budget.  </P> <P> As part of its effort to cut approximately $200 million from the district's  almost $4-billion annual budget, the board last month directed Supt.  </P> <P> Leonard Britton to find ways to cut 15% of the district's central and regional  administrative budgets.  </P> <P> Britton has recommended cuts that trim up to 25% from some departments for a  total of more than $36 million in reductions, including the loss of more than  600 positions. The board debated the recommendations for nearly three hours  Monday and will vote on a revised version on May 14.  </P> <P> Most of the cuts are of clerical and support services, but many -- such as cuts  in the bilingual program, the reduction of substitute hours and the loss of  specialists in fields such as art, health education and agriculture -- will no  doubt reach into the classroom.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER YEARS ON BRINK, NRBQ PERCHED FOR BIG TIME;  </P> <P> POP: THE BAND, APPEARING TONIGHT AT THE COACH HOUSE, HAS ITS FIRST ALBUM IN  FIVE YEARS AND THE MUSCLE OF A MAJOR LABEL BEHIND IT.  </P> <P> They've been touring and recording for nearly a quarter of a century. Their  songs have been covered by a wealth of other artists, including Hank Williams  Jr., Bonnie Raitt, Dave Edmunds, the Box Tops and the Carpenters.  </P> <P> Columbia Records once hyped them as the "new Beatles," and their peer-group  admirers include Keith Richards and R.E.M., with whom they spent two months on  the road last year.  </P> <P> Yet the members of NRBQ have never even come close to having a hit record, and  their live appearances as headliners are still confined to nightclubs,  including tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> With the recent release of the album "Wild Weekend," however, Terry Adams --  the group's co-founder, lead singer and keyboard player -- believes that NRBQ's  long-awaited commercial breakthrough is finally at hand.  </P> <P> "I just think our time has come," he said. "It's our first studio album in five  years, we've got a major label (Virgin Records) behind us, and I have a feeling  people are going to pick up on it."  </P> <P> If NRBQ does make it big, it won't be because of any shift in musical  direction. It's still playing the same eclectic mix of rock 'n' roll, country,  jazz and rhythm and blues it has always played.  </P> <P> "Our sound hasn't changed; it's just gotten better," Adams said. "We're not  going to change to suit somebody else's idea of what's in; we believe in  playing (for) ourselves and waiting for people to catch on.  </P> <P> "We're all natural musicians; it's the only job we've ever had, and none of us  has ever held down a regular job. This is what we do -- we're out there  together, playing our sound."  </P> <P> The unique NRBQ sound is based on segregation rather than integration, Adams  said.  </P> <P> "When you take something like fusion, you get neither jazz nor rock 'n' roll,"  he said. "And to me, that's no fun -- I'd rather hear someone play a jazz tune  right and then a rock 'n' roll tune right.  </P> <P> "It's like, if you're a painter, and you take all your colors and dump them  into one thing, you get dull gray. It's better to reserve the right color for  the right moment.  </P> <P> "We use every color that God gave us, whenever we feel like it, but instead of  mixing everything together, we play everything pure -- the songs on our albums  are mainly rock, but we might throw in a country tune or a jazz tune just to  keep it interesting."  </P> <P> NRBQ stands for New Rhythm and Blues Quintet, though the group today has four  members. It was formed in 1967, when Adams and a fellow Kentucky native,  guitarist Steve Ferguson, met Bronx-born bassist Joey Spampinato in Miami.  </P> <P> With singer Frank Gadler and drummer Tom Staley, they began playing together in  Miami nightclubs and gradually made their way north to New Jersey, where blues  man Slim Harpo saw them in 1968.  </P> <P> Harpo got them booked into New York's prestigious Scene, and within months they  were signed by Columbia Records, which in 1969 released the band's debut album.  </P> <P> NRBQ's 1970 follow-up, "Boppin' the Blues," was a collaboration with rockabilly  legend Carl Perkins; like the group's first album, it was a critical triumph  but a commercial bomb.  </P> <P> Columbia subsequently dropped NRBQ, and the group recorded its next two albums  for Kama Sutra Records. After a three-year sabbatical, NRBQ resurfaced in 1977  with "All Hopped Up" on its own Red Rooster label; since then, it's released  several more albums -- on Mercury, Rounder and Bearsville -- and toured  incessantly, averaging upward of 180 gigs a year. (Al Anderson joined the group  in 1971, and Ferguson and Gadler later quit. Tom Ardolino replaced Staley.)  </P> <P> "We literally live on the road," Adams said. "None of the band members live in  the same state, and when we do go home, it's to pick up our mail and change  socks.  </P> <P> "Touring not only keeps us young and healthy -- whenever I come to California,  the first thing I do is go to the Beverly Hills Juice Club and grab some  wheatgrass juice -- but that's how we get the music out there."  </P> <P> Occasionally, NRBQ members have called time out to pursue individual projects.  </P> <P> In 1977, Adams toured Europe with Carla Bley. Two years later, he compiled  Thelonious Monk's "Always Know" album. And bassist Spampinato was a member of  the "dream band" that Keith Richards assembled for the Chuck Berry tribute  film, "Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll."  </P> <P> But since 1987, when a protracted legal battle with Bearsville Records was  finally resolved, the emphasis has been on collective activities.  </P> <P> "As soon as we got out (of the Bearsville contract), we did two live albums,  and then we began working on our new studio album for Virgin," Adams said.  </P> <P> "And now that our Virgin album is out, we're supporting it the best way we know  how -- through touring, touring and more touring."  </P> <P>  NRBQ will play tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan  Capistrano. Show time: 8 p.m. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

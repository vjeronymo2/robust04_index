			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK coal undercuts its competitors An invitation issued by National Power of the UK for price quotes for 600,000 tonnes of imported coal has produced the least expected result - most of the tonnage has been won by UK producers. Except for six vessels ordered from South African producers, who appear to have priced their coal well below international levels, the bulk of the tonnage has been awarded either to British Coal or private UK miners. The UK prices have surprised even the National Power buyers with bids as low as 85p a gigajoule, compared with over Pounds 1.47 in the British Coal contracts with the generators. The success of the new UK coal industry in straight competition with importers has not been limited to the internal market, however. Two sales have been made to Finnish buyers, one by a private producer and the other by British Coal. The British Coal sale, of about 130,000 tonnes from Selby stocks, while priced at only 55.6p a gigajoule is likely to have been higher than BC's valuation of its 13m tonne stockpile. The private mine sale - from Coal Investments' Silverdale and Hem Heath collieries - is priced even lower and it is difficult to see how it could have brought the operators any meaningful return. That the sales have been possible is as much an illustration of the imagination of the new coal industry as the dearth of coal on international markets and consequent strengthening of prices. The Finns, in particular, have been in the market, having been let down badly by both their Russian and Polish suppliers and are seeking immediate tonnage for delivery ahead of a rise in carbon taxes in the new year. Elsewhere contracts been been signed for 1995 that see rise of Dollars 6 a tonne on 1994 levels. Many expect that in some markets these rise will prove to be modest. In Denmark, traditionally the graveyard for optimism among coal salesman, rises from contracts struck this year at around Dollars 20 a tonne from South Africa to around Dollars 30, FOB Richards Bay, are expected. The coal shortage, which affects coking coal as well as steam coal, albeit to a lesser extent, is unlikely to be cured in the short term. Strong demand  -in particular from the US, for low sulphur South American coal, and from Asian power companies with new power plant coming into operation - is not being matched by new supply. In Asia, too, India is emerging as a significant and totally expected buyer. Although it seems likely at the higher international price levels now emerging that the new British Coal successor companies will be able to dump their excess stocks into the European market or into National Power, it is difficult to see it as long-term business. A return of less than 60 pence a gigajoule at the mine may be welcome as a bit of additional cash flow, but in terms of continuing business it is simply not viable.</p>

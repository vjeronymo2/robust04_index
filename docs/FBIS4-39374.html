			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- So far not a single subunit of the  CIS or the UN peacekeeping forces has entered Abkhaz territory.  Some media reports that such subunits have started to arrive at  the Georgian-Abkhaz line of confrontation are not true. The  ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this at the press office of  the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet today.    As everyone knows, the legislative bodies of the CIS states  have not yet made any decision on the introduction of  peacekeeping forces into the zone of conflict.    In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements on a  cease-fire and separation of the forces, which were signed in  Moscow on 14 May, the peacekeeping forces will be deployed in  the 12-kilometer-long strip of the security zone. The agreement  also provides for the opposing sides to deploy armed formations,  except for heavy combat machinery, in the zone where a limited  range of arms is permitted. The peacekeeping forces will be  expected to patrol the Kodor gorge as well.    As the press office has noted, following the arrival of the  peacekeeping forces, the UN observers can leave the security  zone, if necessary, provided they agree on this with the leaders  of the opposing sides.    [Tbilisi CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY in Russian at 1310 GMT  on  7 June carries a similar report stating the following: "Russian  mass media reported today, quoting Abkhaz sources, that the  deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone in  Abkhazia has already begun. However, this was not confirmed by  the Georgian Defense Ministry."]</p>

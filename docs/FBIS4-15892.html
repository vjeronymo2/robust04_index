			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli believes the  creation of a single monetary system of the members of the CIS  Economic Union is senseless. In an interview with INTERFAX in  Kishinev [Chisinau] he called the ruble zone "a bluff" and  categorically objected to Moldova's entry to it.    In his opinion, "today it is unrealistic to talk about the  unification of monetary systems. On the contrary, it is  necessary to accelerate the process of stabilization of national  currencies in all former Soviet Republics."    Sangheli pointed out that the rate of the Moldovan national  currency, the lei, thanks to financial support from the IMF and  the World Bank, is sufficiently stable, and its fall from 3.85  to 4.12 lei to $1 in the past five months was due to inflation.  According to preliminary estimates, the level of inflation in  March reached 20 percent.</p>

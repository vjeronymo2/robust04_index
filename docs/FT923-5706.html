			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (12): Labour shortage is employers' main problem / State profile of Johor JOHOR, THE southernmost state in peninsular Malaysia, has set itself some ambitious targets for the next 13 years. Not content merely with the national vision of an industrialised Malaysia by the year 2020, Johor's leaders want their state capital, Johor Bahru, to become a modern 'technopolis' by the year 2005. By then they hope to have attracted a further 1,600 manufacturing projects to the state, worth MDollars 26.6bn in new private sector investment. Seen from the fish stalls and fruit counters of the Johor Bahru's central market, where some of the Chinese traders still use the abacus to calculate their accounts, the technopolis seems a distant prospect. Johor, however, is already well on the way to industrialised modernity. Financed largely by investment from the neighbouring island of Singapore - just over a kilometre from Johor Bahru across the causeway  - and from the multinationals based there, Johor has moved rapidly along the classical economic development path, from dependence on primary commodities such as palm oil to food processing factories and on to export-oriented manufacturing and heavy industry. The state government is now trying to encourage chemical companies to come to Johor, and is attempting to regain the interest of Taiwan's China Steel, which had considered establishing an MDollars 8bn plant near the port of Pasir Gudang. With labour increasingly expensive and hard to find, the next step (as in the other fast-growing regions of Malaysia) is to focus on high-technology industries and services, a policy vigorously publicised and pursued by Mr Muhyiddin Yassin, the chief minister, and other state officials. 'To do all this, we definitely need infrastructural projects to support our industrial development programme,' Mr Muhyiddin told a conference in Johor, in June. 'We plan to spend MDollars 2bn in the next five years to develop industrial estates to cater to growing needs, especially for capital intensive and high-tech industries.' Johor - again like other parts of Malaysia and south-east Asia - is struggling to catch up with its own startling economic growth of the last few years, and to improve its overloaded infrastructure. Real annual gross domestic product growth has reached 8 or 9 per cent overall in Johor, but manufacturing GDP has been growing at about 14 per cent a year. Among the projects designed to alleviate traffic congestion and promote economic development are a proposed MDollars 460m bridge - the second link to Singapore - which should be completed within three years, and the continuing construction of the national north-south highway. Water supply and electricity generating capacity are being expanded, and the Senai airport's cargo facilities are being upgraded. Work has begun on the expansion of the port of Pasir Gudang, and the authorities are considering the building of a second Johor port as well. In the meantime, the ties between Johor and Singapore remain essential to the economic well-being of both sides, although the relationship is occasionally a prickly one. About 30,000 people from Johor work in Singapore each day, and the island's port handles about 60 per cent of Johor's exports. 'Our concept is not to compete with Singapore, but to make use of what they have,' says Mr Abdul Latif bin Shaari, director of the Malaysia Industrial Development Authority office in Johor. 'Our selling point is to enjoy the same facilities as Singapore with one third of the cost.' The Johor state government officially supports the Singapore-sponsored idea of the Growth Triangle, which is supposed to link the services and high-technology expertise of Singapore to the intermediate industry of Johor and the cheap labour available on the nearby Indonesian island of Batam. In private, however, some Malaysian officials regard it as a meaningless catch-phrase which legitimises land-hungry Singapore's use of Johor and Batam and has no effect one way or the other on Singaporean investments in Johor. Businesses in Johor are more concerned about Singapore's effect on the labour market than about the pros and cons of the Growth Triangle or a simmering territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the tiny island known as Pedra Branca or Batu Puteh. Factory workers are hard enough to find anywhere in Malaysia, but the lure of higher wages in Singapore makes the labour shortage a particularly severe problem for the electronics manufacturers and other employers of Johor, especially in southern Johor where most of them are concentrated. 'There's really not one company in Johor that isn't looking for labour,' says one factory manager. Mr Jaafar Yusoff, who heads the industrial development division of the Johor State Economic Development Corporation, believes there are more than 100,000 potential workers stranded by poor communications in remote Johor villages, but he acknowledges that Singapore does attract workers away from Johor. 'Because of our nearness to Singapore, we have this frontier town syndrome, like in Mexico,' he says, 'and people tend to go where the pasture is greener.' There are few bus services to Johor's industrial zones, and investors have responded to the labour shortage by recruiting and bussing in workers at their own expense from ever larger - and increasingly overlapping - catchment areas. They also complain of power cuts in certain areas of Johor, apparently the result of load-shedding caused by insufficient generating capacity. Only recently have the central government and the local officials of Tenaga Nasional, the electricity company, begun to acknowledge the problem publicly. Such difficulties, although frustrating for businessmen, are no worse and probably much less severe than the infrastructural bottlenecks being experienced in other developing south-east Asian economies. As for the locals, they complain bitterly about rises in everything from house rents and taxi fares to the cost of a drink of sugar cane juice. They blame the price increases, and the appearance of pornographic videos, on heavy demand from the Singaporeans who, armed with a stronger currency, pour across the causeway from their own expensive technopolis each day to do their shopping. If Johor Bahru becomes a technopolis, too, perhaps these problems will disappear.  --------------------------------------------------------------------       JOHOR: FOREIGN EQUITY APPROVALS (MAJOR SOURCES) 1981-91  --------------------------------------------------------------------                             No of projects      Foreign equity Country                           approved    approved (MDollars m)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Singapore                          540              1,429.6 Taiwan                             141              1,119.5 Japan                              141              1,156.6 South Korea                         17                426.1 US                                  40                360.5 Australia/New Zealand               21                347.6 Hong Kong                           67                217.8 UK                                  34                186.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Malaysian Industrial Development Authority  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

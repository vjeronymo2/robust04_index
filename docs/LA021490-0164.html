			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE DECLARES MAPLE LEAFS BALLARD TO BE INCOMPETENT  </P> <P> Harold Ballard, the ailing owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and once one of the  key figures in the NHL, was ruled to be mentally incompetent by a district  court judge today.  </P> <P> Judge Donna Haley made her decision after reviewing reports from two doctors  and two psychiatrists who examined the 86-year-old Ballard in his hospital room  in Miami.  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Harold Ballard should be declared  incompetent," she said of the multimillionaire, who also owns Maple Leaf  Gardens, his team's home arena.  </P> <P> The judge backed an application by his three children, Bill, Harold and Mary  Elizabeth Flynn, that a guardian be appointed to manage his personal affairs.  </P> <P> The Flynns' lawyer, Charles Scott, recommended in court that Ballard's longtime  companion, Yolanda Ballard, should not have any control over him.  </P> <P> The Maple Leafs owner checked in to a hospital in the Cayman Islands last month  and was later transferred to Miami Baptist Hospital suffering from kidney  failure.  </P> <P> A Florida court appointed a guardian last month to handle Ballard's affairs  until he is well enough to return to Toronto.  </P></p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Congress wounds but dares not strike THE Russian Congress, which today enters its fifth hectic day, has trembled before the prospect of directly challenging Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. It has wounded in its rhetoric, and forced Mr Yeltsin to defend economic reform personally, but it has not yet dared to strike. It has become plain that the conservative forces in the parliament are stronger than at first supposed. Of more than 1,000 deputies, 653 are described as against the government, 483 of these being radicals. A further 266 are 'only partial supporters,' while the core supporters number only 136. This arithmetic has forced retreat on the central issue of economic reform. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, yesterday told the deputies the government would further soften its position. Further ministerial sacrifices have been prepared, and may have to be made. In turn, a resolution calling for Mr Yeltsin's resignation from his post as prime minister had been softened to one of condemnation of the government's economic course. How far that course will now be trimmed, and under whose effective command, is unclear; how the government can continue to fund and increase programmes and subsidies which are already breaking the budget is more clear, since its only resort is to print money. The view yesterday was that the government and reform would survive, but badly weakened. The second big issue is the constitution, which could come up at the congress this weekend with a still more dramatic denouement. The central issue is how much power to give the president and parliament. Mr Yeltsin has it in mind to dissolve parliament and seek a referendum vote of confidence if the presidential-style constitution fails. Here the lines are less clear: radical democrats and extreme nationalists and communists (the last two having made a pact) are united in their dislike of a presidential constitution. The atmosphere is tense and Mr Yeltsin is not by nature a compromiser. Efforts by centrist deputies to get him to bend a little towards his opponents have met with a grudging response, and at any moment he may choose to pull cut out of a forum he regards as invalid and appeal to the people.</p>

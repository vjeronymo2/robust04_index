			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Honolulu, March 18 KYODO -- Pacific Rim finance  ministers kicked off a two-day conference in Hawaii on Friday  [18 March] to look for ways to maintain the dynamic pace of  economic growth in the region through more enlightened financial  policies.    The meeting, hosted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen, marked the first attempt by the fledgling Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to tackle high finance and  other banking issues as a backstop to economic growth.    U.S. Officials said the APEC ministers will stay clear of  trade-related issues such as removing barriers to financial  markets in Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries. "This is not  a forum for discussing financial services issues," U.S.  Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said.    Finance ministers also appeared eager not to oversell their  mission as they assembled at a scenic beachfront hotel for a  series of multilateral meetings and bilateral consultations.  Professed cooperation and friendly dialogue, rather than  confrontation and tough rhetoric, appeared to be the order of  the day.    "I don't plan to go in and twist arms and bully people  around," Bentsen said during a stopover in Los Angeles en route  to Honolulu.    Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii appeared equally  emphatic on the need for consensus-building among the fast  growing but diverse economies in the Asia-Pacific region.  "Cooperation is the single most important thing for the  economies in this region," Fujii told reporters on arrival in  Honolulu.    Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said the APEC  countries were not in Hawaii to look for specific solutions.    "This is the first time that we meet. We are here to  exchange our views on economic achievements and problems and  issues," Tsang said.    The issues on the agenda, Tsang and other APEC ministers  said, center on ways to smooth capital investments and financial  flows within the region. "We all have very different regimes on  these matters, so it would not be a bad idea for us to share  with others our respective strengths and weaknesses," Tsang said.    Prior to a daylong multilateral session among the APEC  ministers Saturday, the ministers held an informal,  getting-acquainted reception Friday evening that marked the  opening of the two-day meeting.    The APEC ministers also took the occasion to hold a series  of  bilateral meetings, including a brief meeting Friday afternoon  between Fujii and Bentsen. Fujii and Bentsen dealt mostly on  ways to promote "a spirit of cooperation" in the APEC process,  which Fujii presented as an example of how the two countries  should handle their bilateral trade disputes, Japanese officials  said.    APEC -- which brings together 17 member countries in the  Asia-Pacific region -- represents the world's fastest growing  economic region, with some economies such as China's expanding  at close to two-digit growth rates.    The market potential of the region, which accounts for 50  percent of the global output and 40 percent of worldwide trade,  is underscored by estimates that APEC member nations will spend  1 trillion dollars in infrastructure alone over the next 10  years. "They need phone lines, power plants, ports, water  treatment facilities, airports and highways," Bentsen said in  Los Angeles in urging American businesses to "look West" -- to  the growing markets in Asia.    APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong,  Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua-New  Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,  Thailand and the United States. Chile, due to join APEC this  fall, was also invited to the finance ministers' meeting.</p>

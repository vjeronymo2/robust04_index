			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Manchester shopping development in doubt THE FUTURE of Manchester's plans to develop valuable land owned by Manchester Ship Canal were yesterday thrown into confusion by the government. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, stalled further on planning permission for the 1m sq ft Trafford shopping and leisure centre at Dumplington, Greater Manchester. The centre is planned for 300 acres of land which was at the heart of the bitter takeover battle for Manchester Ship Canal in 1985-87. Dumplington is in one corner of the big cross formed where the M63 motorway bridges the canal. However, the motorway's ability to cope with rising traffic after 1996 has now been seriously questioned by the Department of Transport. The DoT says its latest forecasts suggest that the northbound carriageway of the M63 would have to be widened to four lanes over 1 1/4 miles of Barton Bridge - which carries the motorway over the canal - if vehicles leaving the centre are to merge safely with traffic on the motorway. Mr Heseltine's officials said that was new evidence. Manchester Ship Canal and rivals bidding to build the regional retail centre on a nearby site now have 21 days to respond or to ask for a public inquiry to be reopened. The inquiry sat for five months to February 1988 and recommended Dumplington, which the government still says is the best site for the centre. The government has just spent Pounds 24m on widening the bridge.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Canberra out to sweeten voters: Parties compete for crucial sugar belt backing in election AUSTRALIA'S conservative opposition parties reached deep into the pork barrel yesterday to shore up electoral support in the politically important sugar belt. The sugar industry emerged as an issue in the March 13 federal election when the Labor government announced a three-year freeze on protective tariffs, which are being reduced for most other industries. The freeze was designed to help Labor's prospects in seven marginal seats in Queensland and northern New South Wales, six of which are held by government MPs with majorities of less than 5 per cent. In a counter-offer to sugar farmers, the conservative Liberal/National party coalition said it would go ahead with plans to abolish tariffs by the year 2000 but would set aside ADollars 145m (Pounds 67.7m) to compensate growers. The coalition said its plan would ensure that consumers and industries that use sugar would benefit from lower prices without re-ducing the incomes of sugar producers. Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader in Canberra, said the package would maintain the integrity of the coalition's tariff reduction policy while ensuring that 'the taxpayer picks up the tab for only a limited period of time'. Mr Harry Bonano, the chairman of the Queensland canegrowers' association, said there was 'very little difference' between the competing offers. Ironically, sugar production is one of Australia's most efficient industries, mainly because growers export about 80 per cent of production at world prices. But the conservative package will give a further boost to the coalition, which believes its electoral momentum is increasing after Mr Hewson's strong performance in a televised debate on Sunday. The coalition also threw the government on the defensive by challenging claims by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, that Labor would eliminate the federal budget deficit by 1996-97. The undertaking contrasted sharply with Mr Keating's economic statement last week, which forecast a budget deficit equivalent to one per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97.</p>

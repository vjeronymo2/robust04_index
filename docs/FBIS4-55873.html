			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tirana--At a news conference in Tirana yesterday  the leaders of the minority organization "Omonoia" denounced the  violation of Greek minority rights stemming from the Albanian  Constitution.    They denounced both the ongoing detention of the  organization's leading members, on which the intervention of  Albanian President Sali Berisha has been requested, and the ban  on the functioning of its offices in Gjirokaster as well as  repeated break-ins at homes by members of the secret police ShIK.    Omonoia describes these actions as a violation of human  rights and points out that they hurt relations between the  Albanian people and the Greek minority. It recalls that the  minority was banned from celebrating the 25 March anniversary  and also leveled serious charges about the operation of minority  schools. According to these charges, 200 children of the lower  school grades are prevented from attending classes in Greek.    On the organization's claims regarding language, Omonoia  demands recognition of the right to education, the right to  perform religious functions, and the broadcasting of radio and  television programs in Greek, which is used along with Albanian.  [passage omitted]    On political rights, Omonoia demands that the minority  population get the chance of being hired on every level of  administration, having their cultural inheritance protected, and  given freedom to be free to determine their national identity.    In its national claims, Omonoia includes recognition of the  right to establish national parties and the possibility of using  Greek national symbols along with Albanian national symbols on  official holidays and anniversaries.    Omonoia believes that all its demands are within the limits  stipulated by the Albanian Constitution and the law "on  fundamental human rights and freedoms," which has been passed by  the Albanian Parliament.    The organization points out that despite the Albanian  president's statement, Albania's stance toward the minority has  not changed and repeated attempts were made to indirectly  involve the minority in criminal actions at Peshkepi, which,  together with any use of violence and arbitrariness, is  denounced by the organization.    Omonoia stresses that friendly Albanian-Greek relations are  essential for peace and stability in the Balkans. [passage  omitted]</p>

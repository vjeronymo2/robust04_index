			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Japan benefits in first quarter The broader the brush, the better the picture emerges for investors who followed the advice of global investment strategists at the end of 1993. They had seen a strong year for equity performance, with the FT-Actuaries World Index up 17.6 per cent in local currency terms, and an outstanding final quarter for emerging markets, mainly in south east Asia, as US investors put their money abroad. However, most of the top advisers were worried that the outflow of US investment funds could reverse itself, given the prospect of a tightening of the US economy. The main lines of advice were to buy Japan, sell south east Asia and to tinker with European portfolios. Most of this has paid off. Three months in Japanese equities this year would have produced a gain of 7.3 per cent in local currency, or 16.6 per cent via the weakening dollar; this compares with losses either side of 18 per cent in the Pacific Basin, ex-Japan. In Europe, matters have been less clear-cut. January went according to plan, with strength in France and weakness in what was generally accepted to be the overvalued German equity market; elsewhere on the Continent, there was the expected outperformance in Italy, up 9.2 per cent, and in Spain, 10.1 per cent ahead. The fact that some Nordic markets had done even better was seen as a side issue. Unfortunately, the throttling of liquidity imposed by the US Federal Reserve's increases in short-term interest rates, in February and March, was no respecter of opinions. France has fallen, in February and March, faster than Germany, where indications are that economic recovery will bring more vigorous expansion than expected; so France ends the quarter with a fall of 6.5 per cent, slightly worse than Germany's 5.9 per cent. The outstanding European performer has been Italy, up 19.4 per cent after severe underperformance in the last quarter of 1993. James Capel, in a strategy note subtitled 'Berlusconi's plastic revolution', retains an in-line recommendation on Italy within a European portfolio, primarily on the grounds of an improving macroeconomic position and respectable corporate earnings growth this year and next. However, it also notes: 'The unstable composition of the right-wing alliance makes the policy outlook more, rather than less, confused, introducing a higher level of risk for the equity market.'</p>

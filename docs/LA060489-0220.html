			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENJOYS HIS READING  </P> <P> This letter is simply to let you and your staff know that I truly enjoy reading  the Real Estate section. As a homeowner, I find the tips on house maintenance  and repair to be quite useful, and I especially look forward to the Q &amp; A  section on buying and selling real estate. This section always has a wealth of  information for anyone who wishes to purchase or sell his own home.  </P> <P> My wife and I own only our house, and we appreciate that the majority of your  section is devoted to average homeowners like us rather than to wealthy real  estate developers (as are most real estate sections). Perhaps in the future you  could provide information on selecting general contractors for remodeling  projects. Maybe even a "Consumer's Report"-style ratings approach.  </P> <P> JOEL FIERBERG  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

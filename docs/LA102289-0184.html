The state Environmental Management Department said  the four firms involved in carting the trash lacked a permit allowing garbage  to be transferred from railroad cars to dump trucks. The cars headed back after  the state obtained a restraining order against the dumping and threatened to  fine the companies $25,000 for each day the garbage was parked at a rail yard.  </P></p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Hochtief plans to increase stake in rival Holzmann Hochtief, the German construction company, yesterday said it intended to increase its stake in its rival Philipp Holzmann, fuelling speculation about a possible takeover. The purchase of a further 10 per cent would make Hochtief the biggest shareholder in Holzmann lifting its stake to 28.7 per cent. Hochtief, Germany's second biggest building group, said the purchase was designed to increase co-operation between the companies on the international market. Holzmann said it would co-operate with Hochtief, especially on foreign contracts, but warned it would do everything it could to remain independent. Hochtief's bid must be approved by the monopolies authorities who warned that the companies could have a dominant position in several niche markets like bridge building. The Berlin cartel office said it would need 'a few months' to evaluate the purchase. Deutsche Bank is the second biggest Holzmann shareholder with 25.9 per cent and there was speculation yesterday that Hochtief may buy some of the bank's holding to further increase its stake. Deutsche and other leading banks are coming under increasing pressure to reduce their intricate web of cross-shareholdings in German companies because they create a closed market. The bank did not to participate in a Holzmann rights issue last year, hinting that it was not interested in a long-term investment. Earlier this year Deutsche said it wanted to run down shareholdings in some industrial companies but yesterday denied immediate intentions to sell Holzmann shares. Hochtief has held about 20 per cent of Philipp Holzmann since 1981. It plans to buy the further 10 per cent from BfG Bank, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais. Hochtief and Holzmann would have a combined turnover of around DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) but Hochtief is considerably more profitable, reporting a 1993 profit of DM122m on a turnover of DM8bn. Holzmann earned DM106m on a turnover of DM12.4bn. If German banks reduced their industrial shareholdings this would ensure greater transparency on the stock markets. However, a source at Holzmann warned that reforms would not be served if Hochtief, which is owned by RWE, Germany's largest utility, was allowed to increase its stake. Lex, Page 22</p>

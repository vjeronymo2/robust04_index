			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: 'TOON TALK  </P> <P> Garry Trudeau has withdrawn a series of "Doonesbury" cartoons about the student  protests in China because of last weekend's massacre. Last week, the strip was  set in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where students had been protesting since  April. Trudeau said the weekend's events, in which hundreds were killed, made  the cartoons obsolete and inappropriate. The strips sent out as substitutes are  tied in with the Alaska oil spill. Trudeau told New York Newsday that the  premise of the substitute strips "is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a  whole week's worth of strips." He told the newspaper that the second week of  strips on China was "predicated on a peaceful resolution." "That was a very bad  miscalculation . . . and now obviously inappropriate," he said.

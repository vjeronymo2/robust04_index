After the release of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we adopted on our own motion an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order on Reconsideration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which made two changes to our competitive bidding rules for broadband PCS concerning our attribution and affiliation requirements. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, we exempted from entrepreneurs' block affiliation rules, entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations. We also decided to permit nonattributable investors in a corporate applicant to own up to 15 percent of the corporation's voting stock, provided that the applicant's control group retains at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock. We applied this change to investors in both publicly-traded corporate applicants and applicants that are not publicly traded. Most recently, however, we adopted a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in this docket, in which we addressed issues raised in petitions for reconsideration of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that involve our broadband PCS competitive bidding rules governing auction methodology, application and payment procedures, and regulatory safeguards to prevent anticompetitive practices among bidders. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  In the instant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we resolve remaining matters in the petitions for reconsideration concerning our entrepreneurs' block rules, including our provisions for designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Order on Reconsideration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;217 (released Aug. 15, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;246, 59 Fed. Reg. 53364 (released Oct. 19, 1994). On November 17, 1994, we released an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> which modified certain aspects of our stopping and anti-collusion rules, and preserved the right to change the timing of the entrepreneurs' block auctions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;295 (released Nov. 17, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Concept of Entrepreneurs' Blocks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Authority and Amount of Spectrum <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission designated a portion of the broadband PCS spectrum available at auction for qualified entrepreneurs. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Eligible entrepreneurs can bid on BTA licenses in the C (30 MHz) and F (10 MHz) blocks. In addition, entrepreneurs who fall within one of the four statutory ``designated entity'' categories ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> small business, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women) are eligible for additional benefits to enable them to acquire broadband PCS licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FCC 94&hyph;178 at  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=6 f=1 --> &para;&para; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 118&hyph;129. An applicant's eligibility to participate in the entrepreneurs' blocks is based on its size as measured by specified financial caps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) contends that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority in establishing the entrepreneurs' block because they potentially benefit entities that fall outside of the four designated entity groups enumerated by Congress. AIDE maintains that the entrepreneurs' blocks reduce meaningful opportunities for smaller designated entities to participate in PCS by forcing them to bid against ``entrepreneurs'' that may not qualify as designated entities. AIDE further argues that the Commission impermissibly restricted the availability of financial incentives to designated entities for use only in Blocks C and F. Instead, AIDE requests that the Commission make its financial incentives for designated entities available for every auctionable broadband PCS license. The United States Interactive &amp; Microwave Television Association and the United States Independent Personal Communication Association (USIMTA/USIPCA) (filing jointly) support the entrepreneurs' block concept, but encourage the Commission to provide additional broadband PCS spectrum exclusively for designated entities. Citing Congress' concern about the historical impediments that small, minority and women-owned businesses have encountered, USIMTA/USIPCA maintain that ``it would not be unreasonable'' to set aside up to one-half of the available PCS spectrum. Finally, GTE Service Corporation (GTE) requests the Commission eliminate the entrepreneurs' blocks and instead allow designated entities to ``partner'' with major investors and be eligible for more generous bidding credits. Additionally, GTE contends that our entrepreneurs' block scheme unduly restricts the ability of cellular carriers to participate in the provision of PCS. Specifically, GTE contends that this scheme, combined with the PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, will effectively limit eligibility for many cellular operators to 20 MHz of spectrum on the D and E blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Contrary to AIDE's contention, it is within our statutory authority to establish the entrepreneurs' blocks, for which parties other than designated entities are eligible to apply for or invest in, and we believe that this scheme will provide meaningful opportunities for designated entities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS. Accordingly, we will retain the entrepreneurs' block structure set forth in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In establishing a competitive bidding process for the provision of spectrum-based services, Congress gave the Commission broad authority to adopt bidding procedures and policies, so long as certain objectives are fulfilled. Specifically, Congress mandated that the Commission ``promot[e] economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). Thus, the language of the statute allows us to consider other entities in order to ensure that licenses are widely dispersed among a variety of licensees, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  so long as we also, among other statutory objectives, ensure that designated entities are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We believe the term ``including'' used in Section 309(j)(3)(B) of the Communications Act is a term of enlargement, not limitation, intended to convey that other entities are includable together with, rather than excluded from the categories of designated entities so long as legislative intent is satisfied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction &sect;47.23 (4th ed. 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. The entrepreneurs' blocks approach adopted in our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> achieves the statute's objectives by creating significant opportunities for designated entities and other entrepreneurs to ensure that licenses are widely disbursed to entities that can rapidly deploy broadband PCS services. We are making additional changes to our rules (including eliminating the personal net worth cap and liberalizing our affiliation rules for individual minority investors) to help designated entities overcome particularly intractable historic difficulties in accessing capital. To satisfy Congress' directive, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks in conjunction with a package of benefits that are narrowly tailored to provide significant opportunities to designated entities and those entrepreneurs that lack access to capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. We disagree with USIMTA/USIPCA who requests that the Commission provide additional spectrum for entrepreneurs' blocks. Our existing allotment, which comprises one-third of the total amount of licensed broadband PCS spectrum, is sufficient to ensure that designated entities and other entrepreneurs have significant opportunities to participate in the PCS marketplace. We therefore deny petitioners' various requests for modification to our entrepreneurs' block provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

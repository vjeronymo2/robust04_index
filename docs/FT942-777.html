			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Opposition parties flounder in bid to form government Japan's two main opposition groups were floundering in their attempt to agree on a new government yesterday, so raising the possibility that the coalition of Mr Tsutomu Hata could return to power. The implications of the intervening political chaos on Japan's efforts to curb its massive trade surplus contributed to a fresh surge of the yen to a record post-war trading high of Y99.5 against the dollar in Tokyo. It eased slightly, after heavy Bank of Japan intervention, to close at Y99.93. Share prices plunged, leaving the Nikkei index down 465.79 points, or 2.24 per cent, at 20,300.96. 'If the yen's steep rise is not checked, not only export-related firms but the whole of our country's industry will be forced to a standstill,' warned Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. Mr Hata has kept a low profile ever since he announced on Saturday that would resign rather than risk losing a no-confidence vote proposed by the Liberal Democratic party, with Social Democratic party support. Political observers believe he plans to let opposition parties' attempts to form a pact reach impasse before reopening negotiations with potential partners for a new government. 'He is being quite clever,' said Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. Talks yesterday between Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the left-wing SDP, and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the conservative LDP, were inconclusive. A day earlier, the SDP and LDP said they were considering an alliance, but in the event they merely agreed on the need to form a new government by the end of today, without specifying how. Separately, the SDP and New Harbinger party, a former LDP splinter group, agreed on joint policy guidelines, calling for maintenance of Japan's pacifist constitution. A coalition of the SDP, NHP and LDP is possible, but less likely than the SDP's return to Mr Hata's coalition, said political analysts. A three-way alliance would be even less stable than the Mr Hata's two-month minority administration, since the LDP and SDP, long-time enemies, are far apart on most important policies. The pressure on the SDP to rejoin Mr Hata's camp increased yesterday when its most influential backer, the Rengo trade union federation, called for the establishment of a government modelled on the recent coalition of former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, in which the SDP was the largest party. Normally, the SDP takes Rengo's advice, but the party may hesitate this time because it is split. A faction loyal to the SDP's Mr Murayama is inclined to join hands with the LDP, and call a snap general election - anathema to Japan's business community, which fears an election campaign could hamper economic recovery. Mr Wataru Kubo, SDP secretary general, prefers siding with the coalition and supports its plan for an election late this year under a new electoral system, which could pave the way for more stable government.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Sweden to spend SKr11bn on refugees THE SWEDISH government is to spend SKr11.7bn (Dollars 1.48bn) in the current budget year to cope with some 75,000 refugees, mainly from former Yugoslavia, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The mounting cost has bloated the country's already-large budget deficit. Sweden has taken in more ex-Yugoslav refugees than any European country after Germany, Switzerland and Austria. But the government has decided it will now take fewer because of the rising cost and mounting political pressures at home. Prime minister Carl Bildt last week called at the Council of Europe summit in Vienna for other states to carry a larger share of the burden. Failure to do so 'means turning your back on the joint European responsibility that we all have.' Sweden has taken in more than 65,000 ex-Yugoslavs in the past two years. , In June, it agreed to give 42,000 refugees from Bosnia Hercegovina the right of permanent residence. The cases of thousands more are still being considered. The Swedish government estimates that up to 30,000 relatives will join those offered residency and has provided for a further influx of 6,000 refugees, most from former Yugoslavia, in the year to June 1994. The cost of coping with such numbers has been one of the factors preventing the government getting on top of a growing budget deficit, which is set to hit SKr215bn, or 15 per cent of GDP, in the 1993-94 budget year. This year's SKr11.7bn allocation for refugees follows SKr10.5bn spent last year and is almost double the total three years ago. The influx of refugees has also provoked an increasing debate over immigration. Until the latest wave, Sweden had accepted 250,000 political refugees over the previous 30 years, many from South America and the Middle East. But the recent surge has coincided with the country's worst recession in 50 years and unprecedented levels of unemployment, prompting occasional outbursts by small right-wing groups. Mr Bildt's government wants to move those granted residence out of temporary housing into local community accommodation as quickly as possible. But local authorities, burdened by housing shortages and unemployment averaging 13 per cent, are hesitant. The government has recently announced a scheme to pay local councils SKr24,000 per refugee on top of the costs it is already bearing, to encourage quicker acceptance of the newcomers.</p>

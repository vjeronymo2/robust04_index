			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Order Formats <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Exchange proposes to offer the ability to request quotes and receive quotes in terms of a percentage of the underlying currency in addition to the present unit of currency format ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , cents per unit of the underlying currency). Percentage quoting would be offered on all FCOs available through the proposed customized FCO facility. The Exchange represents that many users of FCOs have requested this quotation method and the Exchange believes it is appropriate to offer it in this limited fashion through the proposed customized FCO facility. Unit of currency quotations will also still be available for the proposed customized FCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange states that the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market has traditionally given its users the ability to customize FCO contracts by allowing them to designate many if not all of the terms of the FCO contracts. The participants in the OTC market, according to the Exchange, are typically institutional investors, corporations, and banks, who buy and sell FCOs in large size transactions in order to hedge risks relating to fluctuating exchange rates. By trading in the OTC market, these users do not benefit from the advantages offered by an organized exchange, such as, transparency, margin and collateral, and secondary market liquidity. The Exchange is now proposing to give these users the flexibility of the OTC market by allowing them to trade and quote FCO contracts tailored to their specifications but within the confines of an exchange environment. By having the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') as the issuer and guarantor of the customized FCOs, it will eliminate concern over contra-party creditworthiness and assure performance upon exercise of the customized FCOs. Finally, the Exchange believes that transparency will be achieved by the real time dissemination of the quotes, requests for quotes, and last sale information through the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability of Existing Exchange Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs would be subject to all Exchange rules and regulations regarding surveillance and sales practice. Unless specifically exempted, all floor trading procedures will also be adhered to. Examples of different procedures for the proposed European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs include no continuous quoting, no opening or closing rotations, size restrictions as to exercise, new minimum fractional changes, and new maximum quote spread parameters. Position and exercise limits for European-term customized FCOs would be the same as those applicable to FCOs on the same foreign currency and positions in these options will be aggregated with existing FCOs in calculating position and exercise limits. For example, U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark FCOs will be aggregated with Deutsche mark/U.S. dollar FCO positions. The Exchange will establish separate position limits for the cross-rate customized FCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The minimum quote and transaction sizes that the Exchange proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 for customized strike FCOs will also apply to customized European-term and cross-rate FCOs. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, quotes may not be requested and trades may not be executed in a series with no open interest for less than 300 contracts. Responsive quotes for series with no open interest must be at least 300 contracts for assigned ROTs and 100 contracts for non-assigned ROTs. Responsive quotes and transactions in currently opened series may be the lesser of 100 contracts or the remaining number of contracts for all participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Financial Responsibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Exchange will impose higher net capital requirements for ROTs trading in customized FCOs. Assigned ROTs will be subject to a $1 million minimum net liquid assets requirement and all other ROTs will be subject to a $250,000 minimum net liquid assets requirement. European-term customized FCOs will be margined in the same fashion as existing FCO contracts. The Exchange proposes to allow spread margin treatment for European-term contracts offset against corresponding standardized contracts in instances in which the long notional value of either the European-term or standardized contract equals or exceeds the short national value of the other side. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cross-rate customized FCOs will be margined using a three tier system. The Exchange will look at the correlation coefficients between any two currency combinations for each of the 28 possible (non-U.S. dollar) cross-rates in order to determine whether the two currencies have high, low, or negative correlations. Margin levels will be set by using a tier system based upon the degree of correlation between the different currencies. Historically, for example, the Exchange states that there has been a very high correlation between the French franc, Swiss franc, Deutsche mark, and the European Currency Unit (Tier I). Thus, the margin levels necessary for a cross-rate based on any two of these currencies should, the Exchange believes, be low. The correlations between any Tier I currency and either the British pound or the Japanese yen (Tier II) are, according to the Exchange, slightly lower and would, therefore, require higher margin levels. Finally, the Exchange states that the correlations between any of the currencies in Tiers I or II and either the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar (Tier III) are extremely low or negative, thereby requiring a higher margin level than the other two. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to establish margin levels of 2% for cross-rate FCOs based upon any two currencies within Tier 1; 4% for cross-rate FCOs based on one Tier I currency and one Tier II currency or two Tier II currencies; and 6% for FCOs based on one Tier III currency and one Tier I or Tier II currency or two Tier III currencies. After the cross-rate customized FCOs are trading, the Exchange will review the correlations quarterly to see if any of the currencies are eligible for placement in another tier based upon the correlation over the prior quarter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

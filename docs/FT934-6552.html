			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National increases UK retail deposit share Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, said yesterday that its share of UK retail deposits had 'increased substantially' in the third quarter of the year. It gave the estimate in its first quarterly business report. Abbey said its share of new mortgage lending had fallen from the 27 per cent achieved in the first half as a result of competitive response to its marketing of fixed rate products in the six months to June 30. There had been some narrowing of the retail net interest margin, but this was offset by lower bad debt charges resulting from further cuts in mortgage arrears and repossessions. Mortgage accounts more than six months in arrears fell to 21,100 at the end of September, against 22,800 at the end of June. The stock of repossessed properties has fallen by one third this year to 6,189 at the end of September. Abbey's shares closed 2p down at 401p.</p>

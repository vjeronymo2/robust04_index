Kutlu Esendemir and Recep Ozturk had been preparing a  television program in the region for the past week, TGRT  official Erdal Celebi said.    The pair last contacted the network on Wednesday, when they  left the Sulak police post in the Sirnak region, near the Iraqi  border, heading toward Guclukonak, in the same region, Celebi  said.    Celebi blamed the kidnapping on the Kurdistan Workers Party,  the separatist movement which launched an armed rebellion  against the Turkish government in 1984.</p>

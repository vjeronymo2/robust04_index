			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 YOUTHS ACCUSED OF DESECRATION, IMPLICATING JEWS  </P> <P> Three skinheads, wearing masks to conceal their identities, were charged in  court Friday with desecrating about 100 graves at a Roman Catholic cemetery and  trying to make it appear that Jews committed the crime.  </P> <P> Police said the three wanted people to believe the vandalism Wednesday night in  Nantes was committed in revenge for the gruesome desecration last week at a  Jewish cemetery in Carpentras.  </P> <P> A corpse there was dug up and impaled on an umbrella handle.  </P> <P> Police said the suspects apparently decided to carry out the desecration to  protest the detention of right-wing extremists during the investigation of the  Carpentras incident.  </P> <P> The suspects, who did not enter pleas, face sentences of up to two years if  convicted on the charges of vandalism and provoking racial hatred.  </P> <P> Legal sources described them as skinheads -- youths whose close-cropped hair is  an emblem of extreme right-wing views. The sources said they had admitted  desecrating the cemetery to whip up anti-Semitism.  </P> <P> Fearing possible reprisals against the youths or their families, police  outfitted them with masks for their appearance at Nantes' courthouse.  </P> <P> As of late Friday, the Carpentras case remained unsolved. The government said  it was considering posting a reward, a step rarely taken in France.  </P></p>

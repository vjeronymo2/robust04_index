			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: DAP gives lift to Wassall WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, reported a 73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 after a first full 12 month contribution from DAP, a US supplier of DIY products. Profits rose from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 17.8m on increased sales of Pounds 251.1m (Pounds 165.2m). DAP, which was acquired in August 1991, contributed Pounds 8.9m to operating profit of Pounds 20.6m. Margins increased from 5 to 8 per cent, just below the group's average of 8.2. The US company's diverse product range was rationalised, leading to the elimination of 500 stock-keeping units, accounting for Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) of sales. This was more than recouped by aggressive marketing of DAP's more profitable products. The number of plants is being slimmed down from 9 to 7, which Wassall expects to lead to more opportunities to increase margins. With the conglomerate's other businesses reporting a 17 per cent increase in operating profits from Pounds 10m to Pounds 11.7m, Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, believes he is under no pressure to make another takeover. However, he said: 'People invest in us to do deals and we are already looking at various opportunities.' In the light of its failed bid for Evode, the chemicals and plastic group, Mr Miller said: 'We have learnt the lessons that there will always be a big risk of a white knight when targeting a good company.' Laporte, the chemicals group, won the battle for Evode earlier this year, easily outbidding Wassall with a recommended Pounds 129.4m bid. Wassall covered the costs of its bid by selling its 3.5 per cent stake in Evode for Pounds 1m. Consumer products, which includes DAP, reported operating profits of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 3.99m); Closures, the bottle top maker, made Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 8m), and industrial and commercial activities turned in Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 800,000). Earnings per share increased to 10p (8.7p). The final dividend rises to 1.7p making an increased total of 2.5p (2p). COMMENT Good companies at rock-bottom prices are hard to find, which is why some conglomerates may turn out to be bigger sellers than buyers this year. Not so Wassall. After failing to win its hotly contested bid for Evode, it is back on the takeover trail. The next target is more likely to be private than publicly quoted. This is partly because Wassall does not want to find itself in a bidding war and partly because private companies like doing business with people who have cash. With interest rates at record lows on both sides of the Atlantic there are not many arguments in favour of keeping Pounds 31m in the bank. With forecast earnings of Pounds 25.5m the shares are on a prospective multiple of 20.7. As long as it can find another acquisition which can repeat DAP's success, its high rating continues to be justified.</p>

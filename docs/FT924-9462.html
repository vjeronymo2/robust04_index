			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Executives land in back seats with air-fare curb BUSINESS TRAVELLERS are getting a taste of life at the back of the aircraft as companies cut their spending on air fares in the struggle to control costs, according to a survey by Mori for the Wagons-lits travel group. But many senior executives have held on to their travel privileges - and they rarely come back with gifts for the secretaries who book their flights and hotels. Nearly half the 400 senior executives and secretaries surveyed said their companies were instructing travellers to use cheaper hotels and flights. One traveller complained about 'the party of ball-bearing salesmen who are always checking in in front of me'. Another said: 'I am dying to find out what anything other than baggage class is like on any aeroplane.' Some companies did their best to soften the blow. A senior executive said: 'We amended our air travel policy - except if you had a bad back, then you could still be in first. We had an amazing number of people with a bad back.' About 30 per cent of businesses surveyed said everyone travelled in the same class, regardless of their position, but in most organisations the recognition of status had survived the recession. Nearly 60 per cent said status in the organisation dictated class of travel. Those who travel first class and stay in the best hotels have only a hazy notion of how their travel is organised. Most of the details are handled by secretaries. Nearly two thirds of the secretaries influence their company's choice of travel agent. One senior manager said: 'I've got secretaries who will sit there and say 'I don't want to use these people' and then we won't use them. It's as simple as that.' Another executive said: 'My secretary organises it all. She will ensure I get whatever I want at whatever time I want it.' More than 80 per cent of travellers relied on secretaries to check their travel details, yet only 7 per cent of the secretaries said their bosses regularly returned with a gift. Half said they had never received anything.</p>

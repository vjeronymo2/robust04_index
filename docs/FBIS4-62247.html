			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 12 May TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament voted  today to reject mandates to two of the 338 newly-elected  deputies, president of the international foundation "Ukraine's  Business Diaspora" Vladimir Grinev and president of the concern  "Blasko -- Black Sea Shipping Lines" Pavel Kudyukin.    The parliament decision can be described as highly  controversial and leaving many questions open. Actually, the  two deputies sort of fell a victim to the imperfect election law  which, in particular, stipulates that elections should be held  on an alternative basis. In case in question, Grinev's and  Kudyukin's rivals, who polled less votes in the first round of  parliamentary elections, withdrew three days before the second  round. Nevertheless, the Central Election Committee authorized  the second round, which brought both deputies into Ukraine's  parliament. But the Credentials Committee qualified the case as  an irregularity, and the parliamentary session voted to deny  deputy's mandates to the two candidates.    On the face of it, the parliament decision cannot be  questioned. However, two more deputies found themselves in a  similar situation. These are Ivan Vasyura, head of the  collective agricultural enterprise in the Cherkasy region, and  Oleg Panasovskiy, director of the Uglegorsk thermal plant.  Describing them as "good lads," the session approved their  deputy's mandates.    Such a different approach can be accounted for by Grinev's  and Kudyukin's "naughtiness."    Grinev is known to be a prominent reformer. Earlier, he  stepped down as deputy parliament speaker because he could not  agree with the line pursued by the parliament. As a co-chairman  of the inter-regional reform bloc, he criticized the government  and parliament, accusing them of being incapable of pulling the  country out of crisis. Certainly, far from everybody liked  this, including many current lawmakers.    Black-sea trouble-maker Pavel Kudyukin is notorious for the  much- spoken-about "Blasco" scandal. Lawmakers remember  numerous inspections of the activities of the shipping lines  management, which was accused of wasting the fleet's assets and  embezzling large sums in hard currency. However, the case was  not brought to court.    Thus, Ukrainian lawmakers were guided today by personal  considerations rather than by law. But what should voters do in  this situation?</p>

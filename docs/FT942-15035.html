			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / IMF predicts world growth of 3% in 1994 The International Monetary Fund is forecasting world economic growth of around 3 per cent this year, with a stronger recovery to between 3 1/2 and 4 per cent growth in 1995. In its world economic outlook, due to be published on Wednesday just before the twice-yearly meeting of finance ministers on the IMF's interim committee, the IMF predicts that global growth this year will approach the average level it achieved in 1976-85, before moving above the average next year. Growth in the developing countries is expected to remain 'remarkably steady', according to a senior IMF official, while in the industrialised world only the US, Canada, the UK and the Nordic countries have pulled out of recession. 'We are still below average in the industrialised countries, because we still have only one or two engines working, while the others are struggling,' a senior IMF official said. IMF economists believe that the Japanese economy has bottomed out, and that with normal output in continental Europe the world economy should produce growth well above its historic trends next year. 'Globally speaking, the economy is well into the growth phase of its cycle,' an official said. The IMF believes the big industrialised countries have followed many of the prescriptions that the Washington institution laid out at last year's spring interim committee meeting: completion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, efforts to tackle the budget deficit in the US, lower interest rates in Europe and an attempt at fiscal stimulus in Japan. Nevertheless, they warn that the current recovery carries an extremely negative overtone, because it has not been accompanied, particularly in Europe, by any appreciable recovery in employment. 'The risk is that the level of structural unemployment establishes itself somewhere above where it was at the end of the last recession,' a senior official said. This unemployment problem was tackled by ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Detroit last month, and is expected to be on the agenda for the full G7 summit of presidents and prime ministers in Naples in July.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus told journalists on Wednesday [16 March] he could  see no immediate reason to talk to Slovak Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik.    But he added that important negotiations on exports and  imports of goods, particularly food, were to take place by the  end of March. The talks need not have to be conducted by the  premiers. They can be conducted by agriculture ministers or  within the Customs Union Council, Klaus said.    On Czech Television tonight, Industry and Trade Minister  Vladimir Dlouhy expressed interest in the new Slovak Government  to be stable. He said he hoped the Czech and Slovak parties  would find a common language at the March 28 session of the  Customs Union Council in Bratislava and would succeed in finding  ways of removing unnecessary technical obstacles to bilateral  trade.</p>

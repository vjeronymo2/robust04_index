			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: French call to ease stance on oilseeds FRENCH oilseed growers were told yesterday they must accept provisionally the production restraint negotiated by the European Commission and the US last autumn, but rejected by France's previous Socialist government. Mr Jean-Claude Sabin, president of the Federation des Producteurs Oleagineux et Protagineux (FOP), said he was ready to accept the limit of 5.128m hectares for EC oilseed cultivation, provisionally agreed by EC and US negotiators in Washington last November. The French government had complained that this was incompatible with Brussels' predictions that the internal Community farm policy reform would leave oilseed growers with 5.4m hectares to cultivate. But Mr Sabin said acceptance of the overall deal was dependent on the US dropping two other aspects: a minimum 10 per cent set-aside, and a 1m tonne limit on the growing of oilseeds for industrial use. It was not acceptable that Europe should be committed to a 10 per cent set-aside on oilseeds, without the flexibility to alter the amount of land taken out of production as foreseen for other crops in the EC's own farm reform. He also insisted that the growing of oilseeds to produce motor fuels - an increasingly promising prospect in Europe as well as in the US - would have no effect on world agricultural markets, and therefore should not be subject to any limit. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's new government has indicated that while it would maintain France's firm resistance to the provisional EC-US accord on subsidised exports, it is ready to be flexible on oilseeds, where the EC had twice had its present support criticised within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

The appraisers will then determine the total indemnity payable and give Us a written report of their agreement. You will also get a copy of the report. The Indemnity they agree on will constitute the appraisal award which will be the total indemnity payable to You. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. If the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable time, they will give the umpire a statement of their differences. Then the umpire will join in the procedure. A written agreement signed by any two of the three will constitute the appraisal award which will be the total indemnity payable to You. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> You will pay Your appraiser and We will pay Ours. The unpire's fee and any other appraisal expenses will be shared equally by You and Us.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Accidents cast pall over South Korea contractors: Corruption and cost pressures in the construction industry The recent collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge has exposed the problems affecting domestic public infrastructure projects caused by corruption and low bid prices in a huge construction industry that accounts for almost 12 per cent of South Korea's gross national product. Contractors for public works projects are allegedly forced to take short-cuts in construction if they want to achieve profits. There are few apparent problems in the private construction sector, where higher prices are paid. The accident, in which 32 people were killed, has cast a pall over South Korean contractors and foreign construction companies will, as a result, 'have a much better chance than before of winning public sector orders' once barriers to the domestic market are removed in 1997, according to Mr Hwang Bong-mok, construction analyst at W I Carr Securities in Seoul. Investigators are still trying to determine whether substandard construction by Dong-ah Construction, the Songsu bridge's builder, or poor maintenance by city authorities was the main cause for the collapse of the 15-year-old structure. But the incident follows accidents involving other infrastructure projects, including the collapse of seven other bridges over the past decade. Contractors confront severe cost pressures in accepting government orders. One reason for this is that contract prices are low, with government estimates for labour and material costs often below market prices. Alleged demands for kickbacks by government officials further reduce profit margins. The chairmen of the Daewoo industrial group and Dong-ah, for example, were charged in August with giving kickbacks to a former president of Korea Electric Power, the state-owned electricity monopoly, in return for winning nuclear power plant construction contracts. 'Corruption in the construction industry is widespread worldwide, but in Korea it is more severe than elsewhere. Bribery is a common practice,' said Mr Don Lee, construction analyst for BZW Securities in Seoul. Nonetheless, construction companies are eager to gain public sector orders as the cash flow is favourable; the government pays at least 20 per cent of the project cost in advance and provides the balance throughout the construction period. Infrastructure projects are also becoming more important for the industry, due to a slowdown in house building which dominated growth in the past five years. Public sector orders will account for Won14,700bn (Pounds 11.2bn) of the estimated Won40,000bn in domestic construction orders this year. In an attempt to increase profit margins on public projects, construction companies have frequently resorted to measures that appear to undermine the quality of their work. Design specifications are frequently changed and schedules accelerated. Contractors are accused of using inferior materials to save costs. The subcontracting of work at low rates has also become common. The hazards of this became apparent last year when a subcontractor for Samsung Engineering and Construction caused one of the nation's worst train accidents when a railbed collapsed during excavation work. Faulty construction is often undetected as inspection procedures are lax, with contractors allegedly bribing government inspectors to grant project approval. The Songsu bridge collapse has renewed concern about the safety of the country's infrastructure, particularly when the government is planning to invest Dollars 100bn (Pounds 63.2bn) on projects over the next eight years. The government has announced several measures to eliminate substandard construction. Pre-screening procedures will be strengthened, with the lowest bid system abolished in favour of selection on technical capability. The government will also increase estimates for labour and wage costs in construction proposals. Subcontracting will be more tightly regulated, while the warranty period for construction projects will be increased from five years to 10-20 years after completion. Inspection procedures will be improved, including allowing foreign construction inspectors to operate in South Korea from next year. The measures, however, 'will increase construction costs to meet the higher standards,' said Mr Hwang. The costly domestic regulation is likely to encourage South Korean construction companies to seek more orders abroad. Overseas orders will account for only 12 per cent of total orders for the Korean construction industry this year - in sharp contrast to 15 years ago when orders from the Middle East provided the bulk of business for Korean contractors. The decline in Middle East oil income that fuelled the building boom has forced Korean companies to concentrate on winning domestic orders, while shifting their overseas activity to southern Asia and China.</p>

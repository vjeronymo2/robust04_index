			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Grip relaxes on French flagship: Paris still has effective control at Rhone-Poulenc THE Paris government's announcement that it will sell a stake in Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship of the French chemicals sector, marks a significant step in the gradual relaxation of the state's grip on industry over the past decade. The sale, expected by the prime minister's office to take place this year, will be the first time the Socialist government has let its direct shareholding in a public sector company fall from a majority to a minority. Its direct voting rights in the group will fall from 77.5 per cent to around 45 per cent as a result of the sale and the dilution of state voting rights caused by the related decision to enfranchise Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shareholders. Yet the government will still exercise effective majority control because the shares owned by Credit Lyonnais and AGF, the state-owned bank and insurance company, will bring the total public sector stake up to around 65 per cent, after the operation. The state expects to collect around FFr4bn (Pounds 477m) from the sale, said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister. That would bring total public sector share sales this year to FFr14bn, including stakes in the oil groups Total and Elf Aquitaine, and the bank Credit Local de France, just short of the government's FFr15bn target. As with the rest, the proceeds from the Rhone-Poulenc sale will be used to fund job creation measures and to pump capital back into other state companies. The Rhone-Poulenc move was being seen by analysts yesterday as a step towards full privatisation for the chemicals group and possibly others. The right-wing opposition, likely to win legislative elections in March, has an ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's chairman, is well placed to ensure Rhone-Poulenc, which needs fresh capital, benefits. He was picked for the job by the former Gaullist government and is close to former French president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the centre-right UDF. Even if the right fails to win the election, the Socialist administration has already said it is prepared to start selling majority stakes in state industry from next spring. The other important feature of this sell-off is that Rhone-Poulenc's existing non-voting shareholders - just over a quarter of the total - are to be given votes for free. This will surprise and possibly delight non-voting shareholders in other public sector companies, such as BNP and Credit Lyonnais, the first and second largest state banks, and the aluminium group Pechiney. Like Rhone-Poulenc, these companies issued large amounts of non-voting certificats d'investissement (CIs) and a range of quasi-equity instruments before the government last year relaxed its freeze on the issue of ordinary equity in public sector companies to the private sector. These investors will now expect, like their counterparts at Rhone-Poulenc, to be enfranchised for nothing. On the surface, the enfranchisement of Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shareholders looks like another stage in the government's policy of getting state companies to behave as much as possible like their private sector competitors, against which they compete for scarce finance on world capital markets. However, some analysts point out that the implication of allowing non-voting shares to acquire votes at no charge is that voting rights in French public sector companies are worthless. They argue that the state will always hold the whip hand, even if it only has a minority stake, as it does, for example, at the oil group Total, where the government retains the right to nominate the chairman and vet important international accords. This could also be the case in full sell-offs, in line with the previous - and possibly future - Gaullist administration's tactic of trying to leave privatised companies with a decisive 'hard core' of institutional shareholders loyal to government policies. Mr Fourtou, for one, is a keen advocate of a hard core for Rhone-Poulenc, on the grounds that it insulates the management from the search for short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy. This is a classic concern of industry policy on both sides of French politics.</p>

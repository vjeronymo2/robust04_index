			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WAN RESPONSE TO USERS' TAX  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates residents expressed little interest Tuesday in supporting  a 5% utility users' tax to purchase undeveloped land that would be retained as  open space.  </P> <P> The City Council is considering whether to place the tax measure on the  November ballot, but only six residents addressed the council Tuesday, at the  first of two public hearings on the matter. All spoke in favor of retaining  open space, but only two said they were willing to pay for its preservation  with a utility users' tax.  </P> <P> The idea was proposed by a blue-ribbon committee organized in May at the  council's request to examine options for purchasing undeveloped land in the  city. The committee said the tax, lasting five or 10 years, should be put on  the ballot if there is public support for it. The measure would require  approval by two-thirds of the voters to become law.  </P> <P> The proposal stems from controversy two years ago over the closed Dapplegray  Intermediate School. Some residents criticized the council for not moving to  acquire the site, which has an estimated market value of $5 million. The  council said the city could not afford it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> POINDEXTER DEFENSE RESTS CASE WITHOUT CALLING HIM TO TESTIFY  </P> <P> The defense rested its case today in the Iran-Contra cover-up trial of former  national security adviser John M. Poindexter, after 5 1/2 days of testimony.  </P> <P> The case drew to a close without any testimony from Poindexter, who is accused  of concealing from Congress the U.S. role in a November, 1985, Iran arms  shipment and Oliver L. North's secret military assistance to the Contras.  </P> <P> Among the final witnesses for Poindexter was Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden  Grove), who testified that there were frequent meetings between North and up to  30 congressmen during the period of a congressional ban on military aid to the  Contras.  </P> <P> At the meetings, North was told by the congressmen that "we don't think you are  limited" by the ban and that it was permissible for North to help raise money  for the Contras, Dornan testified.  </P> <P> Since the defense opened its case March 20, Poindexter's lawyers have sought to  portray the ex-national security adviser as a White House official who never  lied to Congress.  </P></p>

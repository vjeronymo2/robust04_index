			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing propeller pitch control is normally monitored by a governor which senses propeller speed and adjusts the pitch to absorb the engine power and thus keeps the propeller at the correct RPM. When the primary governor fails, the propeller pitch is controlled by an overspeed governor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This type of system is conventional and its airworthiness considerations are addressed by part 35 of the FAR's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hamilton Standard requests special conditions to install an electronic propeller and pitch control in place of the primary governor control and synchrophaser unit for the Model 247F propeller. This control is designed to operate with existing mechanical and hydraulic interface of the engine and propeller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electronic propeller and pitch controls introduce potential failures that can result in unsafe conditions. These types of failures are not addressed by the requirements of part 35. These failures can lead to the following possible unsafe conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Loss of control of the propeller <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Instability of a critical function <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Unwanted change in propeller pitch causing improper thrust/overspeed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Unwanted action of a critical control function resulting in propeller flat pitch or reverse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification issues that must be addressed are possible loss of aircraft-supplied electrical power, aircraft supplied data, failure modes, environmental effects including lightning strikes and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) and software design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA finds that under the provisions of &sect;21.16 of the FAR, additional safety standards must be applied to the Hamilton Standard electronic propeller control for Model 247F propellers to demonstrate that it is capable of acceptable operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Type Certification Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of &sect;21.17 of the FAR, Hamilton Standard must show that the Model 247F propeller meets the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those FAR's are &sect;21.21 and part 35, effective February 1, 1965, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 35, as amended, do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Model 247F propeller. Therefore, the Administrator proposes special conditions under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR's after public notice and opportunity for comment, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Novel or Unusual Design Features <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the unusual design features of the Hamilton Standard 247F propeller with electronic propeller and pitch control, the FAA proposes special conditions under &sect;21.16 of the FAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action affects only the Hamilton Standard Model 247F propeller with a new system of electronic propeller and pitch control. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the propeller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 35 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for these special conditions continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C.

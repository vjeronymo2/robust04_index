			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Ukraine's deficit takes off UKRAINE's budget deficit, which has grown to 44 per cent of gross domestic product, has pushed the country into hyperinflation, the government's senior economic minister said yesterday. Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and the architect of Ukraine's reform program, said the deficit had more than tripled since the summer. But price liberalisation and rapid privatisation measures were being delayed by conservatives in the cabinet, he said. The cabinet may decide tomorrow on a decree freeing prices in the Ukraine and reformers are cautiously optimistic it will be signed. Monetary financing of the budget deficit has produced accelerating inflation and contributed to the collapse in the value of the Ukrainian currency in recent months. 'We have not yet managed to stop hyper-inflation,' Mr Pynzenyk said, 'but the central bank is no longer issuing credits'. Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the government's top economic advisor, estimates that the underlying monthly inflation rate was 60 per cent in November and expects it to rise to 100 per cent this month. The Ukrainian coupon, which, in effect, became a separate currency when Ukraine left the rouble zone a fortnight ago, is trading at 730 coupons to the dollar, a near 300 per cent depreciation since August.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The villages of Qabrikha, Majdal Silm, Tulin, and  al-Suwwanah came under a concentrated Israel artillery barrage  this morning. The shelling continued intermittently at the rate  of one round per minute until 0500 today, prompting residents  inhabitants to seek protection in shelters and the innermost  rooms of their homes. The bombardment was accompanied by  intensive overflights by Israeli helicopters, which fired flares  and raked the area. Retaliating for the continuing enemy acts of  aggression, which left three dead and dozens wounded in Sidon,  resistance groups shelled several Israeli settlements,  concentrating on the Galilee panhandle. The enemy admitted that  rockets landed in the area but denied any casualties.    The Israeli enemy sent in many vehicles and reinforcements,  which were spotted traveling along the international highway  near Tallat al-'Abbad. These reinforcements have deployed in  the al-Tayyibah- al-Qantarah-'Alman triangle.</p>

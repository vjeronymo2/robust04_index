			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Metsec improves in second half Metsec staged an improvement to finish 1991 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 257,000, after recording Pounds 285,000 in the opening half. The dividend is held at 6.4p as directors feel that prospects are good. The loss came from turnover of Pounds 79.8m, and compared with a profit of Pounds 4.15m on sales of Pounds 83.2m previously. USM-traded Metsec, which serves the building products, electronic products, engineering and construction industries, started 1992 with an upward trend in order books and increasing profitability in overall performance, reported Mr Keith Hirst, chairman. The loss-making businesses of 1991 had either been closed or were operating at break-even or better this year. They would only be maintained where present performance could be improved during 1992 and good recovery potential was present. Losses per share were 2.07p (earnings 17.18p). The proposed final dividend is 3.7p.</p>

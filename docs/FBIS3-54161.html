To this list should be added a large number of political  analysts from various countries of the world acting on behalf of  many leaders and especially regional statesmen.    When the two heads of state appeared in front of the cameras  for their news conference, many thought that they would utter  explicit and frank words about the future of the peace process  the United States has in mind. But neither of them did.    Al-Asad, as the leader of a country that sometimes acts  hastily, stressed his country's former stances but in new terms,  and promised that by next week he would send his foreign  minister to Washington for a serious study of views.    Meanwhile, Clinton expressed satisfaction over his  discussions with the Syrian leader. Reports from Geneva  explicitly show that, contrary to their press communique, the  two sides held frank discussions; and al-Asad's explicit  statement that a partial peace in the Middle East is doomed to  fail was an especially overt reference to the Camp David pact  and to the Gaza-Jericho accord.    Thus, it is clear that Syria envisages its role as going  beyond solely speaking for itself, so that the United States and  Israel will not discuss the issue of the Golan Height alone.    The Syrians realize that if they discuss only the return of  the Golan Heights, they can regain just a part of it and they  will have to recognize Israel's existence. Thus, they have  gathered together the various Palestinian groups and have taken  the banner of struggle in their hands so that they can force the  Americans to put pressure on Israel to withdraw from Golan.    Clinton, who has a trump card in his hands with the  Gaza-Jericho accord, is hopeful about his future foreign policy  in the Middle East, especially since he has full political  accord with political leaders there. The factor that hindered  Carter was that he had to cooperate with the extremist  Likkudists, who traditionally incline toward the Republicans in  the United States, while Clinton is dealing with Laborites.    Therefore, the current leaders in Israel trust the  Democratic  President of the United States. In view of this understanding  between the two sides, Clinton hopes that he will be able to  create a viable axis for Syria's entry into the Middle East  compromise talks. While al-Asad has specifically put forth his  country's conditions for participating in these talks, he  prefers to continue the Washington talks in order to stabilize  and at the same time strengthen his political situation.    What can be gleaned from the views expressed by the Syrian,  American, and Israeli officials is that if al-Asad is prepared  to accept peace, he will get the price he wants--and this is  nothing less than the Golan Heights.    But the conclusion that Clinton drew from his meeting with  al-Asad in Geneva was that the Syrian leader is a shrewd  diplomat who is aware of his weak and strong points more than  any other person. And probably the young U.S. President has  expressed hopes that al-Asad will help him to succeed, hence the  Syrian leader's remark that having hope is not a sin for the  young, even if he is a president.</p>

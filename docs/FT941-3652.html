			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Research costs leave Scotia loss at Pounds 6.35m Scotia Holdings, the drugs company built on sales of evening primrose oil, yesterday reported buoyant demand for existing products along with its first figures since its October flotation. Sales for the year to December 31 rose 9 per cent to Pounds 15.2m in 1993, boosted by a new UK distribution agreement and the re-entry of its nutritional products into the US market. Operating profit slipped 8 per cent to Pounds 5.92m before research and development spending of Pounds 8.52m, up 11 per cent. After a net Pounds 3.8m exceptional debit, covering items referred to in the prospectus, there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.35m, up from Pounds 839,000 in 1992. Scotia's research focuses on lipids, important constituents of the membranes which surround cells, an area which has been largely ignored by the pharmaceuticals industry. However Mr David Horrobin, founder and chief executive, said the level of interest in lipid technology was increasing very quickly. He pointed to the fact that 22 hospitals around the world had now applied to enrol patients in phase III trials of Scotia's EF13 compound for use in treatment of pancreatic cancer. 'Everyone seems to want to join the trial and there is a feeling that something very exciting is happening.' Scotia's most advanced product, for complications of diabetes, is in phase III trials with 700 patients. Last year's flotation raised a net Pounds 37m, rather more than originally planned, and Mr Horrobin said this had enabled the company to push ahead faster than expected with some of its less advanced products. These include compounds aimed at rheumatoid arthritis and angioplasty, which have just started phase III trials. There was a loss per share of 12.5p. The shares, which were offered at 290p, reached a high of 323p shortly after the flotation before falling back below the issue price. Yesterday they added 10p to 255p. COMMENT Despite the initial enthusiasm which accompanied its flotation, Scotia has since received relatively little serious attention in the City. This may stem partly from its maverick focus on lipid technology and the 'new age' aura which surrounds its evening primrose products. But the recent trial results, particularly in inoperable pancreatic cancer, suggest it is on to something and if some of its new products do make it to market its pioneering status makes the potential upside all the greater. It has a very powerful patent position and most of its products are aimed at diseases for which there is little or no existing drug treatment. Its compounds also tend to show few side effects which lessens the chance of them failing the phase III trials. The shares are clearly speculative but they have a more attractive mix of risk and reward than many in the sector.</p>

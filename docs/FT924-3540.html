			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Market rallies on signs of recovery CONVENTIONAL bond market psychology was stood on its head on Friday, when the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue staged a powerful rally on the back of a series of encouraging macro-economic statistics that appeared to signal a strengthening of the US recovery. Normally, investors in the bond market take flight when the economy looks better, on the grounds that good news means the Federal Reserve is less likely to make further cuts in interest rates. But last Friday's jobs data - showing the US unemployment rate for November down from 7.4 per cent to 7.2 per cent - caused a   25/32 rise in the price of the 30-year Treasury bond, with bond investors apparently as enthusiastic as their counterparts in the equity market. The yield on 30-year paper declined from 7.55 per cent to 7.48 per cent on Friday. The bond market's unusual reaction to the jobs data, which followed other encouraging signs, can be explained in part as a function of investor expectations about the likely fiscal measures planned by the incoming administration. The logic of bond investors was that if the economy's recovery is shown to be more buoyant than was thought to be the case, then President Clinton might reduce the size of his job-creation and other spending measures aimed at stimulating the economy. A more modest package of fiscal stimuli would appeal to investors concerned that too much new spending would worsen the deficit and have a broadly inflationary impact. That in turn could require the government to issue more Treasury paper to pay for the stimuli, creating a greater supply in the market and depressing bond prices generally. Some US economists were remarkably bullish on Friday. 'The economy is up and running; we're out of the rut,' said Mr Allen Sinai, an economist at Boston Co Economic Advisers. Yet sceptics abound. Salomon Brothers, for example, noted that the new jobs data confirmed the US economy was 'ending its long flirtation with recession,' though the investment bank reckoned that the signs of recovery were still insufficient to convince fiscal policy makers to abandon plans for fresh stimuli. Salomon summed up its cautious view by saying that while 'the US job engine has shifted from reverse to forward, it remains in first gear', while analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette termed the fledgling economic improvement 'far from robust.' Mr Phillip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities in New York, was even more bearish. 'The strength of recent economic reports is largely explained away by special factors. The economy remains stagnant, requiring fiscal stimulus and Fed easing.' This week's economic data will include the release of November producer price numbers on Thursday, with a 0.1 per cent rise forecast by many, and consumer price figures for last month on Friday, with a consensus forecast of a 0.2 per cent increase.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung said that a 22-hour interrogation  by security agents failed to implicate him in an unauthorized trip last year to  Communist North Korea by National Assembly member Suh Kyung Won, who was  arrested June 28 and charged with espionage. Kim told a news conference at the  headquarters of his Party for Peace and Democracy that he was cleared of any  suspicion, and he charged that his questioning by authorities was an effort to  undermine his party's image. Suh was expelled from Kim's party after his  arrest. Government security officials said that since questioning was legally  limited to 24 hours and Kim issued "adamant denials," they simply ran out of  time.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LITTLE GIRL MUST FACE A NEW DADDY IN HER LIFE  </P> <P> How's a kid to cope when Mom plans to remarry? That's the subject of today's  animated "Wonderworks" offering for young children, "Two Daddies?" (7 p.m. on  Channels 28 and 50, 8 p.m. on Channel 15).  </P> <P> A sequel to "Happily Ever After," a 1985 "Wonderworks" about Molly, a little  girl whose mom and dad divorce, this low-key parenting primer catches up with  Molly a year later, tentatively adjusted to her new way of life. But when Mom  starts dating and then announces plans to marry Michael, Molly's world is  shaken again.  </P> <P> Animator Bill Melendez, of TV's "Peanuts" cartoons, created the talking-head  "Peanuts"-like characters here, given voices by Danny DeVito, Carrie Fisher,  Richard Masur, Rhea Perlman, Henry Winkler (who was also the program's  executive producer) and, as Molly, Christina Lange.  </P> <P> Children unfamiliar with the situation in which Molly finds herself may not  want to go the whole 60 minutes. It's not Saturday morning cartoon time; the  message is the thing.  </P> <P> But children and parents whose concerns are targeted, tune in. Written by Ron  Friedman, Mal Malmorstein and Linda Balahoutis, this thoughtful hour shows how,  even in ideal circumstances -- ex-spouses behaving as friends and a wise  stepfather-to-be -- children of divorce have special anxieties that need to be  addressed.

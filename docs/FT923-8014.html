			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Separatist bomb in Thailand A bomb, allegedly planted by Moslem separatists, exploded at Hat Yai railway station, not far from the Malaysian border, in southern Thailand yesterday, killing three and injuring more than 70, Peter Ungphakorn writes from Bangkok. Police said they found at the site a letter identified as coming from the Pattani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), an outlawed group seeking independence for Thailand's four southern-most provinces. Moslems are a minority in largely Buddhist Thailand, living mainly in southern and central provinces. Most are fairly well assimilated but resentment against the majority is felt particularly strongly in the deep south, where Malay nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists have been agitating for years for independence.</p>

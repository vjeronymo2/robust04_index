			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart sets forth REA policies and procedures with regard to loans and loan guarantees to REA borrowers for the purpose of implementing their demand side management (DSM) plans, energy conservation programs, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems. The Administrator reserves the right to determine if loans for purposes under this subpart will be made to a borrower in default under its mortgage and loan contract. As is the case with all other REA loans, loans for purposes under this subpart will not be made to individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.351  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General policy; renewable energy systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Off-grid renewable energy systems will be considered the same as DSM activities and will qualify for either insured loans or loan guarantees pursuant to &sect;1710.102. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) On-grid renewable energy systems will be treated as a generation resource and will be eligible only for loan guarantees pursuant to &sect;1710.102. Existing REA policy with respect to generation resources shall generally apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) REA loans for renewable energy systems will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and commercially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.352  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General policy; energy resource conservation programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart does not replace the energy resource conservation program financed by deferments of loan principal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.353  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General policy; demand side management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) REA will make loans for the purpose of assisting electric borrowers to implement REA approved demand side management plans. For the purposes of this regulation energy conservation programs are included as a DSM activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) REA will treat demand-side and supply-side resources on an equal basis. All requirements applicable to loans for traditional electric facilities will apply to loans for DSM. In addition the requirements set forth in this subpart will apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) DSM will be considered a distribution loan purpose, eligible for either insured loans or loan guarantees pursuant to &sect;1710.102. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) REA will conduct its own evaluation, as specified in this subpart, of a borrower's DSM activities before making a determination on the disposition of a borrower's loan application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) REA loans for DSM activities will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and commercially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) In general, REA will require pilot project testing of DSM activities new to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) If the borrower's IRP, DSM plan, project construction and/or financing, and/or rate recovery is subject to the approval of state authorities, the borrower must obtain such approvals before REA will approve a loan for any purpose for which an REA approved DSM plan or IRP is required under this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

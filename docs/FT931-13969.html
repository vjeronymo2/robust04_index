			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / France criticises US cruise missile attack on Baghdad FRANCE complained yesterday that the US had exceeded its United Nations mandate on Sunday when it launched cruise missiles against an industrial complex south of Baghdad. The first serious rift between the western Gulf war allies emerged as US aircraft flew routine patrols over the northern and southern air exclusion zones of Iraq in the wake of President Saddam Hussein's offer of a ceasefire to mark the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. UN weapons inspectors waiting in Bahrain for more than two weeks are due to leave today for Baghdad. Iraq had refused to allow the UN team to return, then put conditions on flight plans which the UN said were unacceptable. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, yesterday briefed the French cabinet in frank terms. He spelt out 'the reasons for France's non-participation in the military action on the Baghdad suburbs, considering that it exceeded Security Council resolutions', the government spokesman said. France only made its displeasure public on the day that Mr George Bush left office. It evidently did not want to offend a US president with whom it has generally got on well. Many in Paris however felt that US relations with Iraq had turned into a personal vendetta with President Saddam. France said it hoped that a new president in the White House would 'open a new phase' in relations with Iraq. As the March elections in France draw nearer, the Socialist government may also wish to dispel any impression given by participation in two allied raids against Iraq that it was slavishly following America's lead. In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, called the bombardment wholly justified. He rejected French criticism and said France was consulted beforehand: 'This was a raid made by the US rather than the allies because they had the equipment in site to do it,' Mr Major told reporters in Downing Street. Mr Bush urged governments around the world to support efforts to oust Mr Saddam, and the outgoing president's top security aide admitted that Washington had backed coup attempts against the Iraqi leader. In a five-page report to Congress released only hours before Mr Clinton took over, Mr Bush said Mr Saddam continued to defy terms of the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire. He urged leaders to support opposition groups trying to topple the Iraqi leader. Mr Brent Scowcroft, Mr Bush's national security adviser, admitted in an interview published yesterday that the administration had backed coup attempts against Mr Saddam and came 'pretty close' to succeeding.

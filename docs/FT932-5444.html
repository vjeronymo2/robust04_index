			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Home sales boost the dollar THE DOLLAR made a strong comeback against the D-Mark yesterday in the wake of strong US economic indicators and a new bout of weakness for the German currency in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. In early morning trading in Europe, the dollar was lingering around the DM1.5810 level against the D-Mark, still reeling from last Friday's huge downward revision in the first quarter GDP figures. However, a remarkable increase in the new home sales figure for May took dealers by surprise: the sales were up 22.7 per cent on the month at 751,000, their best performance since September 1986 and dwarfing market expectations of a 642,000 rise. The indicator helped to push the dollar up to a close of DM1.5975 from a previous DM1.5920. Compounding the dollar's strength was a new day of weakness for the D-Mark in Europe. The D-Mark ought to have remained firm after the Bundesbank announced that there would be no change in the repo rate, still at 7.60 per cent - but the decision appears to have been discounted by many dealers. According to Mr Mike Gallagher of IDEA, the market information group, the source of D-Mark weakness was the peseta's powerful performance in the ERM with only four days before the Spanish general election. Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the opposition Partido Popular, underpinned the peseta by stating that, if elected, he would only introduce interest rate cuts after taking the currency's value into account. A more significant factor helping the currency was the strong performance by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, in a live tv debate with Mr Aznar on Monday night. Mr Gallagher said: 'The performance was good enough to raise speculation that, as in the UK, the governing party could snatch victory at the last moment in the general election.' The peseta closed at Pta78.24 from a previous Pta78.91. The unwinding of short peseta positions contributed to general D-Mark weakness. The Italian lira closed at L913.9 from a previous L923.9, and the French franc at FFr3.369 from a previous FFr3.376. The single exception was sterling which closed  3/4 of a pfennig down on the day, at DM2.4625, on expectations that the UK authorities could cut base rates again. Yesterday's money supply figures provided further evidence that the UK recovery is slowing. Rate cut flames were also fanned by the Bank of England's decision to offer a repo rate for only two weeks, at a date that falls just after Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Mansion House Speech. Some dealers think that a two-week repo is an unusually short date for an instrument, and that the Bank might be planning change of policy afterwards.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Were it not for Brookside (Channel 4, 8.30pm) you could tonight happily part-exchange the TV for a take-away pizza. Will Mandy Jordache finally confess she has stabbed her husband to death? Can the producers find such a good plot-line again? Measure For Measure (BBC2, 9.30pm) is an excellent programme dealing with an off-beat subject - measurement - but even it is not good enough to keep this viewer tuned into Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10pm), which has definitely lost the spark of the previous series. Paul Merton is terribly funny but seems bored with it all; Ian Hislop is now just smug; pretty-boy Angus Deayton probably no longer needs the money. You need to sit up till midnight for the good stuff. Rock Docs: Three Steps to Heaven (BBC2, 12.10am) is a repeat of an Arena documentary on rock 'n roller Eddie Cochran. Five minutes later there is The Quatermass Experiment (Channel 4, 12.15am), a vintage Hammer movie. For insomniacs who went to work, Cricket: One-Day International (BBC1, 12.20am) reviews highlights.</p>

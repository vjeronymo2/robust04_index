			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow volatile as derivatives contracts close Wall Street US SHARE prices ended mixed to firmer yesterday as the expiration of key stock index options made for a volatile trading session, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.24 at 3,271.12, well below its high of 3,285.18. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.21 higher at 437.15, while the Amex composite finished up 2.59 at 403.65, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.68 at 698.38, another record close. Trading volume on the NYSE was heavy at 308m shares. The Dow opened slightly weaker, moved to a double-digit gain by mid-morning and then dropped back to unchanged levels around midday. The index continued to fluctuate during the afternoon, gaining 17 points before falling sharply in the last 90 minutes. After an initial decline similar to the Dow's, and despite weakness in the key technology sector, secondary stocks posted solid gains throughout the day before losing ground in the final hour. Traders said the volatility was linked to the morning expiration in the Chicago derivatives markets of S&amp;P 500 options and S&amp;P Midcap options, and the afternoon expiration of options on other indices and on some individual equities. The day's most important economic figures were broadly positive for market sentiment. The Labor department announced that consumer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in December, a smaller increase than forecast, although slightly offset by a weaker than expected rise in industrial output. Among individual stocks, Westinghouse Electric slumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 13 3/4 in turnover of 3.5m shares on news that discussions between the company and General Electric about GE buying Westinghouse's credit unit had been terminated. The news left GE Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 84 3/4 . IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 1/4 after Standard &amp; Poor's slashed its rating for the computer group's senior debt. IBM is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Wall Street is expecting a small operating loss for the period, not including the large restructuring charge already announced. Other big technology stocks were mostly weaker as investors took profits after Thursday's gains. Hewlett-Packard dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 7/8 , Texas Instruments eased Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 and Digital Equipment slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/4 . On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 after announcing fiscal first-quarter profits of Dollars 161.3m, down slightly from a year ago. Microsoft, which reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 236m late on Thursday, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 89 3/4 . Canada TORONTO ended steady for the fourth day this week, in continued active trading. The TSE-300 index ended 2.74 points higher at 3,306.58 in volume of 45.9m shares valued at CDollars 443m, according to preliminary data. Advances edged declines by 306 to 305. Among the sub-indices, mining posted a modest increase, financial services, consumer products and golds were flat and energy and industrial products declined.</p>

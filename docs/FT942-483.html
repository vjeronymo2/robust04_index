			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Oxford colleges change names Two Oxford University colleges yesterday voted to change their names in honour of prominent benefactors. Manchester College, which does not yet have full collegiate status within the university, is to be The Manchester Academy and Harris College, in recognition of support from Sir Philip Harris, former chairman of Harris Queensway. Rewley House, which caters for mature and part-time students, becomes Kellogg College in recognition of donations from the WK Kellogg Foundation, a US charitable body.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER HITS THE PRIME TIME WITH VIDEO CAMERA  </P> <P> For the last 14 months, Don Carlos Jackson has kept a video camera close at  hand as part of a campaign that has made him, possibly, the most hated cop in  squad rooms around Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Whether driving his Corvette through Marina del Rey on the way home from a date  or sitting in a van with friends in Watts, Jackson has been ready to tape  fellow police officers in action.  </P> <P> By his own estimate, he has stopped as many as 300 times to watch police as  they question others. And sometimes he has used himself as bait, driving  through neighborhoods where he suspects a 30-year-old black man might draw some  attention from authorities.  </P> <P> Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave, calls his patrols a  "litmus test" of how Los Angeles-area law enforcement agencies treat black  people. And in most cases, he admits, the police have passed the test --  officers have acted with restraint even when he pestered them to justify why  they arrested someone or to explain what law empowered them to ask a car's  passengers for identification.  </P> <P> As a result, most of his "stings" were unspectacular and his tapes drew dust on  the shelf.  </P> <P> But this week Jackson hit prime time.  </P> <P> With an NBC television camera capturing the action, two Long Beach police  officers stopped him and a friend for allegedly weaving across traffic lanes.  Audiences nationwide watched as Jackson got out of the car, hesitated before  putting his hands over his head and argued with Officer Mark Dickey, who then,  with a stream of obscenities, apparently pushed Jackson's face into a plate  glass window.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tactics Debated  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI have begun  investigations of the Saturday night incident. And Jackson's tactics have been  debated from the opinion pages of newspapers to the Los Angeles barber shop he  uses. Some have questioned his actions, while others have asked: Who is Don  Jackson and what is he trying to prove?  </P> <P> Jackson said in an interview that he did not welcome the violent confrontation  that made him a celebrity, but neither was he displeased by the reverberations  of the Long Beach officer's action.  </P> <P> "As I was sitting in the back of the police car," he said, "as much pain as I  was in, I had a slight smile on my face. I said to myself, 'This guy has done  all the work for me.' "  </P> <P> But in the close-knit fraternity of law enforcement, the incident only  solidified the feeling of most that Jackson is an enemy of the officer on the  beat. Police officials in a number of departments had already cautioned their  troops to be on the alert for the off-duty Hawthorne sergeant. Jackson himself  said he had heard of his photograph being used as a squad room dart board.  </P> <P> "He's not one of us," one Hawthorne officer said. "He's not a cop anymore."  </P> <P> Yet Jackson is a man born into the police fraternity and one who knows  firsthand what it feels like to have to defend yourself against brutality  complaints.  </P> <P> The son of a career sheriff's deputy, his life was built on a bedrock of  conformity and assimilation, at least until it was remade by the troubling  issue of race.  </P> <P> Jackson was bused from Los Angeles' inner city to mostly white Birmingham High  School in the San Fernando Valley during the late 1970s. There he followed the  advice of his father, Woodrow, who retired in 1984 after 29 years with the  Sheriff's Department, and who said he taught his son to prove himself with hard  work, "not with free promotions or affirmative action or anything else."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Student  </P> <P> Elected captain of Birmingham's wrestling and football teams, Don Jackson "was  one of the most popular kids on campus," recalled the school's athletic  director, Louis Ramirez. "He was a hard worker who never gave up."  </P> <P> But Jackson said his high school years left him with some bitter memories as  well -- such as the racial taunts of a white student who had a neighboring  locker.  </P> <P> He portrays himself as an intense teen-ager who kept his emotions inside.  </P> <P> "I was completely by myself, and that has been consistent in my life," he said.  "You can't afford to fight all the time, so you just go about your business."  </P> <P> He added, however, "I always felt, it's got to stop somewhere."  </P> <P> After graduating from California Lutheran College, Jackson joined the Ventura  County Sheriff's Department as a deputy in the County Jail. About 1 1/2 years  later, in 1982, he was hired by the Hawthorne Police Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Good Qualities  </P> <P> Colleagues who would later criticize his public campaigns admitted that Jackson  was a good officer. One superior, Capt. David Barnes, described him as an "an  intelligent, articulate, good-looking guy."  </P> <P> But like many law enforcement officers, Jackson found that the people he dealt  with sometimes questioned the force he used.  </P> <P> Court records show that Hawthorne was sued in 1982 by a man named Gilberto  Campos, who alleged that Jackson assaulted him without provocation outside  Hawthorne Community Hospital.  </P> <P> Jackson said that he merely defended himself from Campos, whose elbow was  dislocated as he was wrestled to the ground.  </P> <P> Although Campos was convicted in Inglewood Municipal Court of battery on a  police officer, the city eventually agreed to pay him $3,500, Hawthorne City  Atty. Michael Adamson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not the First Complaint  </P> <P> Jackson also acknowledged that he was the target of two minor complaints from  prisoners in Ventura County Jail but said he had "never been found guilty of  excessive force."  </P> <P> Jackson portrayed such complaints as a price of certain professions.  </P> <P> "Doctors, lawyers and police officers are all vulnerable to people who believe  that their conduct" is not proper, he said.  </P> <P> The complaints did not hold back his career. He was promoted to sergeant in  December, 1986.  </P> <P> But Jackson said his work in Hawthorne, where 86% of the department's officers  are white, was marred when some of his colleagues called him and other blacks  "nigger."  </P> <P> He said he was also subjected to racist jokes, such as the time a white officer  waved a white-female doll in his face and said, "Come on Jackson, I know you  want a white woman."  </P> <P> "After two years I said, 'I'm not gaining anything by being quiet,' " he  recalled. "I felt I was less of a man when I was putting up with that all the  time, when it was totally disrespectful to me."  </P> <P> Other Hawthorne officers say that Jackson overreacted to minor taunts that once  seemed not to bother him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relations Strained  </P> <P> Clearly, relations were strained, and department officials were relieved when  he was placed on stress disability in April, 1987. Jackson also filed a  lawsuit, still pending, accusing the Police Department of racial  discrimination.  </P> <P> He currently receives $224 a week, about one-fourth of his pay when he was on  regular duty.  </P> <P> Jackson will not be granted a disability retirement until city officials  determine that his stress condition is "permanent and stationary," said Doug  Gates, Hawthorne's employee relations officer.  </P> <P> Jackson said he makes due on his scant salary by "eating less" and living in  his father's Inglewood condominium. His grandmother loaned him $4,000 to buy  his video equipment, he said.  </P> <P> Jackson said he resolved to begin his public fight because of an incident soon  after he left active duty.  </P> <P> Woodrow Jackson, 61, was driving home from a family gathering when he was  stopped by police in Pomona. The elder Jackson subsequently filed a $50,000  claim against that city, alleging that without provocation, two white officers  grabbed him and slammed him to the ground.  </P> <P> The experience made his "very strong" father cry, Jackson said, adding, "For me  to see him crying was the ultimate injury."  </P> <P> Pomona officials would not release details of the case, but said they expect to  reject Jackson's claim within the next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formed a Group  </P> <P> Soon after, Jackson formed Law Enforcement Officers for Justice, eventually  recruiting about 60 other police officers, most of them black, from around Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The group publicly supported complaints of officers and citizens of racism and  misconduct in several police departments, including those in Santa Monica and  Torrance.  </P> <P> By the end of 1987, Jackson was also carting around his video camera looking  for evidence.  </P> <P> He said he went to a series of communities -- including Beverly Hills, El  Segundo, Glendale, Manhattan Beach and Torrance -- to test the response of  police. In each case, officers confronted him without using excessive force, he  said.  </P> <P> Jackson said he believes most police officers "are good guys and they are just  trying to do their jobs."  </P> <P> "But you have 10%, 15% or 20% who are making everybody's life miserable because  they are brutalizing people and then making other people react with antagonism  toward police," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Westwood Incident  </P> <P> Jackson has drawn more than his share of antagonism as well, much of it after  he drove six black youths to Westwood last February and then videotaped Los  Angeles police as they questioned and searched the youths. He said the  experiment showed that the officers were stopping blacks indiscriminately.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, in an videotaped speech played at  police roll calls soon after, said Jackson was guilty of "a crazy, crazy,  stupid, idiotic act."  </P> <P> "You got cops out there who are already stressed out," said Inglewood Police  Chief Ray Johnson, whose officers got into an argument with Jackson when he  videotaped them making an arrest. "They are terrified. And now what do they do?  Do they back off, or do they continue to do their jobs?  </P> <P> "I think (Jackson) is trying to become a martyr. He is going way, way beyond  what he has to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Be Admired  </P> <P> But Garland Hardeman, a Los Angeles policeman who is a friend and adviser to  Jackson, said other officers should admire him.  </P> <P> "What he has done is an obligation that we all should take," said Hardeman "No  organization that has the power police do can (operate) on internal monitoring  alone."  </P> <P> Jackson said the NBC producers approached him about demonstrating one of his  "stings" for television, leading him to Long Beach.  </P> <P> To one of his former Hawthorne colleagues, who asked to remain anonymous, it  was a case of Jackson using his police experience to "push all the right  buttons" to provoke a confrontation once his car was pulled over. He noted that  Jackson did not remain seated, as most motorists would when approached by a  policeman.  </P> <P> Jackson admitted that he may have frightened Long Beach Officer Dickey.  </P> <P> "But you can't bait a good cop," he said. "I'm giving police what they see all  the time -- both law-abiding black people and non-law-abiding black people. And  they are not taking the time to discern which is which. . . ."  </P> <P> "He (Dickey) went from giving me a command (to raise his hands) to using  maximum force, which was more than was necessary," Jackson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drinking Suspected  </P> <P> But Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, said Jackson was under suspicion of  drunk driving because his car was weaving and that Dickey used "proper police  tactics" in pushing the uncooperative Jackson up against a building. The  breaking of the window was an "unfortunate" accident, he said.  </P> <P> Jackson has been a busy man in the days since the incident, besieged by  requests for interviews and feelers from movie producers.  </P> <P> He said he knows, however, that agitating other policemen is an avocation that  could be dangerous.  </P> <P> "I wake up at night sometimes, sweating," he said. "I have a dream that I have  been shot or I get hurt. But I don't let (fear) take over."  </P> <P> He also knows that policemen are not the only people who question what he does.  </P> <P> When he slipped into a Los Angeles barber shop this week for a quick trim  between television interviews, Jackson found several black men discussing "that  Hawthorne guy."  </P> <P> He said the customers did not recognize him, as one declared: "That guy is too  damn radical. He's running around stirring up trouble all over the place. . . .  The police are just trying to do their job."  </P> <P> Jackson asked the man if "that guy" might be trying to point out a pattern of  police abuse.  </P> <P> According to Jackson, the man bellowed, "Why, he ain't got no way of proving  that!"  </P> <P> Jackson and his father laughed at the story.  </P> <P> "What I'm up against," Jackson concluded later, "is that even blacks side with  the police. There is a presumption that the police are doing their job, and  you've got to overcome that by giving people clear evidence."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Gerald Faris, David Freed, Jesse Katz, and Chris Woodyard  also contributed to this article.  </P></p>

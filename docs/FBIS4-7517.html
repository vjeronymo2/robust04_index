			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>   [Text] At a news conference held immediately upon the  Krajina negotiating team's return from the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb, it was stressed that the essence of the agreement signed  this morning is contained in its title -- cessation of all armed  hostilities. Unlike the present, that is, the two-year long  situation on the ground, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  will be deployed between the two, until now, warring sides.    The signing of the cease-fire agreement was preceded by a  detailed analysis of maps indicating the existing situation by  all the parties to the negotiations. According to the Krajina  side, the cease-fire agreement also means that Kasici and other  villages in Ravni Kotari have been returned to the republic of  Serbian Krajina, which the Croatian Army occupied 14 months ago,  and that the population of the Obrovac region -- a region which  during the same Croatian aggression found itself in those parts  of the Serbian Krajina that were the least safe -- will have a  more peaceful life.    We learned at the news conference that the region of Velebit  -- including its Obrovac part -- was the cause of the fiercest  debate, or disagreement, that is, during the negotiations  yesterday and overnight. The text of the cease-fire agreement  is today the most sought-after written document and is being  xeroxed and copied in Knin. The first date set in the document  is 4 April. AT 0900 [0700 GMT] on that day, the cease-fire will  enter into force on the front lines, while in the following 24  hours -- so the agreement stipulates -- all indirect weaponry  will be moved away [razmjesteno]: mortars and antiaircraft guns  to a distance of at least 10 km, artillery and tanks to a  distance of at least 20 km from the demarcation lines.    By 0900 at the latest on 8 April, all units on the  demarcation lines will be disengaged in order to prevent mutual  targeting with direct weapons. The cease-fire will be monitored  by international observers. The agreement also confirms an  agreement on the establishment of a joint commission with the  aim of maintaining the cease-fire.</p>

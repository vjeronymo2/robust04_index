			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Triton Europe at Pounds 3.89m TRITON EUROPE, the indep-endent oil and gas exploration and production group, announced after-tax profits of Pounds 3.89m for the year to May 31. Last time net profits amounted to Pounds 31.4m after an exceptional gain of Pounds 34.8m arising from the sale of the company's North Sea assets. At the pre-tax level there were losses of Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 45.1m profits) reflecting a decline in the average oil price to Dollars 20.48 (Dollars 26.78) per barrel. The results also included an additional depreciation charge of Pounds 1.3m reflecting a reduction in the estimates of reserves at Villeperdue, the company's principal source of production. However, changes were to be made in the operating structure of the field which Mr Tom Graves, the chairman, said should result in 'meaningful savings and improved profitability'. On the current year he said that trading conditions in the first three months were in accordance with company expectations. Triton's financial position remained strong with net assets of Pounds 65.2m, indebtedness of Pounds 500,000 and about Pounds 5m in cash. Turnover fell from Pounds 29.7m to Pounds 21.7m and gross profits to Pounds 4.32m (Pounds 12.7m). Net interest receivable amounted to Pounds 677,000 against Pounds 66,000 but there were exchange losses of Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 1.3m gains). Earnings per share came through at 4.71p (38.05p) but there is no dividend payment for the year.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Rabuka wins second term in Fijian election Mr Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a military coup in Fiji seven years ago, is set to be sworn in for a second term as the country's prime minister after Fiji's week-long general election left his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party with an increased number of parliamentary seats. The SVT won one extra seat in the election, taking its tally to 31. While this is not a majority in the 70-seat parliament, the General Voters party, which was the SVT's main coalition partner in the last government, took four seats, compared with five previously. With support from a couple of independent MPs, Mr Rabuka is expected to command a slim majority in parliament and be in a position to govern. In Suva, Mr Rabuka said he expected to visit President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara todayUnder the constitution, the president appoints the person whom he judges to have majority support among MPs as prime minister. The result is a severe blow for the Fijian Association, the new party formed by SVT dissidents whose decision to vote down the 1994 budget triggered the election. The FA won only five seats, against pre-election expectations that it might gain a dozen. Its leader and guiding light, Mr Jovesata Kamikamica, lost his own seat in the Tailevu constituency, which immediately raised questions about the party's future. Mr Rabuka first became prime minister as a result of the 1992 elections, five years after leading two military coups which overthrew an Indian-dominated coalition government. The 1992 election represented a return to partial democracy in Fiji, although under the 1990 constitution, Fijians are guaranteed 37 seats in the parliament, while the Indian population gets only 27. Also, only about the half the islands' 760,000 population are deemed eligible to vote. On the Indian side, the latest election results were also a triumph for Mr Jai Ram Reddy's National Federation party (NFP), which won 20 seats, up from 14 previously. The gains came at the expense of the Fiji Labour party (FLP), which was left with just seven seats, down from 13. The NFP favours a more moderate approach than the FLP, although both parties are committed to an overhaul of the racially-biased constitution. On the fraught racial issue, Mr Rabuka said yesterday his party would this year consider inviting Indians to join a so-called government of national unity: 'That is still a possibility.' But he warned that no big changes could be expected to government policies discriminating against Indians in favour of Fijians. The relatively clear outcome of the election may come as a relief to the business community. The country has been operating without a budget for the current year and there had been worries that, if the election results had led to long coalition negotiations, the economy would be left floundering. Some Suva residents also feared a backlash against the economically dominant Indian community if Mr Rabuka and the SVT lost significant ground.</p>

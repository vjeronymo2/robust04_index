			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- In the first  quarter of this year, industrial output grew by 9 percent  compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly  registered in the manufacturing industry. Energy consumption  fell by 5 to 6 percent as compared to the corresponding period  last year, according to the Finance Ministry's most recent  report on the economy's first quarter performance.    Exports increased more slowly than imports, but the gap is  gradually narrowing. According to preliminary customs figures,  Hungarian companies exported products to a value of $2.9 billion  by the end of April, 4.7 percent up on the same period last  year. Imports amounted to $4 billion, which shows a 7 percent  increase as compared to the first four months in 1993. With the  increase in imports falling from month to month, the ministry  projects a slower increase in imports for the year. Food  industry accounted for most of the increase in exports. Exports  of machines were moderate, while their import significantly  increased. According to ministry analysts the drop in machine  exports and the growth in machine imports indicate that domestic  investment demand is on the rise, which should contribute to  long-term growth in the economy.    In the first quarter, enterprises spent 65 billion forints  on  investments, 59 percent up on the same period of last year at  current prices. The ministry's report predicts a 5 to 10  percent increase in the volume of investments for 1994.  However, analysts are cautious about drawing conclusions from  these figures.</p>

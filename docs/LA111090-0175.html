			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INTERIOR DESIGN;  </P> <P> DO-IT-YOURSELF DECORATORS LEARN SOME TRICKS FROM AN EXPERT;  </P> <P> 'VIRTUOSO PIECES' -- AN ARMOIRE AND A BED -- BECAME 'THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE  ROOM' THAT TOOK SHAPE DURING A DEPARTMENT STORE SEMINAR.  </P> <P> To many do-it-yourself decorators, creating the kinds of perfect rooms seen in  the slick pictures of home magazines remains a mystery known only to interior  designers.  </P> <P> At Bullock's in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, home decorators recently had a  chance to observe an interior design project from bare walls to a  picture-perfect finish at the "Start With an Empty Room" decorating seminar  presented by Metropolitan Home magazine and Cotton Inc.  </P> <P> Watching a room in the making offered observers insight into the rationale  behind the design, a glimpse into how designers make seemingly incompatible  objects look great together.  </P> <P> Ben Lloyd, interior design and architecture editor for Metropolitan Home,  cleared away a 16-by-16 foot space in the store's home furnishings department,  surrounded it with white fabric-covered "walls" and turned it into an inviting  bedroom.  </P> <P> Admittedly, he cheated. He moved in a few of the heavier pieces before the show  so "you wouldn't see us break our backs." A pine armoire and an antique oak bed  with intricate carving already occupied his room.  </P> <P> "We like the idea that they're not matched," Lloyd said, explaining his choice  of furniture. The golden tone of the different wood brought harmony to the  mismatched pieces.  </P> <P> Lloyd called the armoire and bed his "virtuoso pieces."  </P> <P> They're "the big nice pieces that you like," and set the foundation for the  rest of the furnishings.  </P> <P> "They become the architecture of the room," he said.  </P> <P> The full-sized feather bed was then piled high with an over-stuffed comforter  and big square pillows, all made of white cotton with blue eyelet trim.  </P> <P> "Talk about comfort and sumptuousness," said Lloyd, sinking his hands into the  bedding while his audience looked ready to pounce upon the fluffy white mound.  </P> <P> "It looks like a giant marshmallow," a woman in the front row said.  </P> <P> Lloyd deliberately chose natural materials such as wood and cotton for his  room.  </P> <P> "They have more charm to them," he said. "We've gone from high-tech to  high-touch."  </P> <P> For his next "big piece of architecture," he added a classical screen painted  with Corinthian columns, romantic arches and florals.  </P> <P> A wicker love seat followed, its golden hue helping it to blend in with the  rest of the wooden furniture. Lloyd paired it with a coffee table of rough hewn  pine to create a comfortable sitting area.  </P> <P> With space at a premium for most homeowners, he suggests finding multiple uses  for a room. A bedroom, he said, should be more than just a place for sleeping.  </P> <P> "You're not just putting a lot of stuff in a room. You should ask what that  room's going to do for you."  </P> <P> Most of the eclectic furnishings and knickknacks that followed were united by  color -- greens and yellows, blues and pinks.  </P> <P> He placed pink and mint green throw pillows on the love seat, floral tapestry  pillows on a wicker rocking chair, an easel with a picture of a rose, a green  quilt stand with pale green and ivory afghans tossed over it "to soften the  look," and an emerald green bird cage.  </P> <P> "The cage is a craft. You might keep a bird, you might not," Lloyd said. "It's  the structure of the thing." He thought a moment longer and added:  </P> <P> "You're probably just as well without a bird."  </P> <P> Accessories work best when they contrast with each other, he said. When  everything looks the same, a room can look dull. To demonstrate, he brought out  a modern black torchere (a free-standing floor lamp) to contrast with the  romance of the classical screen.  </P> <P> One customer, noting that the blue eyelet trim on the bed's dust ruffle matched  the blue trellis pattern of a woven area rug, asked if the coordinating  patterns had been intentional.  </P> <P> "No, it's just a glorious piece of luck," Lloyd said. Such "happy coincidences"  often occur when one chooses eclectic furnishings.  </P> <P> Changing the look of the room proved as easy as changing the bed. Lloyd  replaced the white cotton on the antique bed with a comforter and sheets by  Esprit done in a green and gold geometric print, proving a contemporary design  could pair well with old-fashioned furnishings. Again it was color -- in this  case green -- that pulled the look together.  </P> <P> When he finished rearranging the room, one practical observer noticed that  something was missing.  </P> <P> "If there were a window, what would you do?" she asked.  </P> <P> Lloyd advised putting up a pleated shade for a clean look or taking a related  fabric or sheet and draping it over a pole to frame the window.  </P> <P> "Make your window into a picture," he said.  </P> <P> With its wicker and wood, cotton and down, Lloyd's room reflected a "glitzing  down" from the '80s.  </P> <P> "All that glitz is less appealing than the beauty of natural products. People  want something that's authentic."  </P> <P> They're filling their homes with granite, marble, wood and cotton instead of  synthetics.  </P> <P> He showed off a heavy glass goblet made in Mexico.  </P> <P> "It's stylish but relaxed," he said, admiring the imperfections of the glass.  He finds the handmade quality and natural material preferable to "high-tech,  anti-charm" furnishings.  </P> <P> In real homes, most decorators start not with an empty room but one filled with  stuff. Nor do they have a store full of new furnishings at their disposal.  </P> <P> To freshen a room, Lloyd suggests pulling out the things one no longer cares  about and swapping them with different accessories, preferably original pieces  that have the rough-hewn look of a handmade craft.  </P> <P> "Pick things you like instead of following the trends," he said. Too often,  people copy the style of the time, so that one could almost date their rooms.  </P> <P> "A look gets leaden after several people have done it badly."  </P> <P> Having the "in" decor might look slick for the moment, but only the furnishings  that reflect one's true tastes will withstand the test of time.  </P> <P> Some homeowners rely too much on the talents of an interior designer and not  enough on their own instincts.  </P> <P> "It's like getting people to dress you every day. It rings false," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> "The most successful homes I've seen are done by people who really like the  things they put in them."  </P></p>

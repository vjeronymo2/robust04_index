			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Gazde: "Inaugural Congress of HSLS (Croatian </F> Social-Liberal Party) for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija: A Year of  Peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia!"]    [Text] The chairman of the Croatian liberals, Drazen  Budisa, emphasized at the congress that there is certainly no  Croatian political party that will not wholeheartedly support  the recently signed document on a Croatian-Bosnian federation;  1994 is a year of peace for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia,  because there is real hope that the temporarily occupied  Croatian territory will be reintegrated into the Republic of  Croatia [RH].    "There is certainly no Croatian political party that will  not  wholeheartedly support the recently signed document on a  Croatian-Bosnian federation," the chairman of the Croatian  liberals, Drazen Budisa, said at the inaugural congress of the  HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party] for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija  on Saturday, adding that he believes that the HSLS assembly  scheduled for May will be held under conditions of peace.  According to Budisa, 1994 is a year of peace for both  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, because there is real hope that  the temporarily occupied Croatian territory will be reintegrated  into the Republic of Croatia.    Drazen Budisa sees the reality of these hopes in the efforts  by the great powers to solve the territorial problem of the  former Yugoslavia through political means; paraphrasing U.S.  President Clinton concerning "building destroyed bridges, but  also bridges between people," Budisa noted that there should be  support for the expressed flexibility of the Croatian political  leadership which, Budisa reminded, recently adopted in the  Croatian Assembly a declaration on foreign policy with a  different approach. Thus, there can also be no talk of  "continuity in policy," because the viability of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state was questioned. Emphasizing his  conviction that the Bosnian-Croatian federation will be joined  by Bosnian Serbs as well, Budisa added that it is necessary to  wait before building a confederation between the RH and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, because even without a confederal  framework, good political, economic, and other relations can be  developed. In Budisa's opinion, what has happened is not a new  Yalta in this region; indeed, international players, especially  the United States and Russia, are trying to stop the war, and he  noted that it is realistic to expect pressure from Moscow on the  Bosnian Serbs to join the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    "Responsibility for the fighting between Croats and Muslims  in Bosnia-Herzegovina is shared by Croatia, because we in the  HSLS have long said that this senseless and unnecessary fighting  should be avoided. Thus, in order to introduce the principle of  responsibility for wrong assessments and policies to Croatian  political life, I believe that the question of political  responsibility for this fighting as well must be placed on the  agenda," Drazen Budisa asserted, suggesting that the liberals  include the signing of the Geneva document on normalizing  relations with Serbia as one of the wrong moves. Explaining that  the HSLS considers that move premature, the leader of the  Croatian liberals asserted that they are in favor of the best  possible relations with neighbors, but only after the  Serbo-Montenegrin federation recognizes Croatia's  internationally recognized borders.    As far as the liberals' organizational structure is  concerned, Budisa announced that branches of the HSLS will be  founded in Croat cantons of the future federation as well,  because during the war such a move, he says, would have  contributed to the chaos. In Croatia, the liberals are already  organized by zupanija, and Budisa noted that there will be no  radical changes in the party. Candidacies will be announced by  the end of April, and besides his own candidacy for president,  each member of the HSLS has the right to run for office.  Complementing his party colleagues "for being in the good  company of honorable and capable people," Budisa said that  "attempts to destroy the party from within will not succeed."    At the same time, the inaugural congress of the liberals of  Split-Dalmatia Zupanija did not get a leader of its own. The  votes of those in attendance were evenly divided between Ante  Beljan (Trogir) and Niksa Viskovic (Makarska), so that until new  elections are held the duties of chairman of the HSLS Zupanija  Committee will be performed by vice chairman Ante Skeljo, who  received the largest number of votes of support. Also elected as  vice presidents were Edo Boban, Josko Dujmov, and Roko Vuletic,  while the secretary is Petar Krolo and the treasurer is Marija  Stambuk.    The gathering of the zupanija's liberals was also greeted by  Split Mayor Nikola Grabic, who acquainted the attendees with the  difficulties the city faces in articulating its policy, since  all that remains of the proclaimed local self-rule is a few  words on paper. He also emphasized that he expects support from  the zupanija level because, he said, he hopes that this  dimension of political support will be a critical factor in the  upcoming elections.    The HSLS zupanija congress was also attended by  representatives of the HSS [Croatian Peasant Party], the HNS  [Croatian People's Party], and the SDP [Party of Democratic  Changes], who also greeted their colleagues, whereby Josko Kovac  (HSS) noted that there are 53 registered parties in Croatia, but  only three of them came to greet the liberals. Endorsing  cooperation with the liberals, with whom an coalition election  victory was won in Split, Miro Granic (HNS) asserted that this  success would be repeated on the zupanija level as well. Also  participating in the HSLS congress were Goran Granic, Damir  Zoric, Tereza Ganza-Aras, and HSLS Assembly deputies.</p>

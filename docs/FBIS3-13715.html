They discussed  the possibility of resuming the peace talks. Our correspondent  Shlomo Raz reports that Mr. Rabin initiated the conversation.  It appears that no Jewish site in Hebron will be evacuated at  this time.    Minister Moshe Shahal estimated today that the talks between  the PLO and Israel will resume before the Passover holidays  [starting on 27 March]. Regarding the Waqf decision to ban the  entry of non-Muslims to the Temple Mount, Minister Shahal said  that Israel will not accept the Waqf decision, but stressed that  such disagreements are better solved through silent diplomacy.</p>

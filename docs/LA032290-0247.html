			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ITALIAN PAY TV HAS LOTS OF SPICE  </P> <P> Italians are all set for their first taste of pay television -- a cocktail of  X-rated movies, sex therapy and what is billed as an erotic version of candid  camera.  </P> <P> Some 70,000 people have written in to say they want to join the "Pay-TV Italian  Club" -- open to adults only -- and buy the decoder needed to receive the  broadcasts for $200.  </P> <P> "We won't be a hard-core TV," pledged the station's director, Roberto  Artigiani. "You can call it soft erotica if you want," said the 47-year-old  Artigiani. "We'll tackle sex in an open, intelligent way, without false  moralism or propriety."  </P> <P> His first coded signals are due to go on the air at 1 a.m. one night in  mid-April. First, "Perfume of Love" -- 10 minutes of viewers' letters. Then a  sex therapy session, a game show, a cabaret dominated by strip-tease, and  finally a movie, taking viewers to closing time at 3 a.m.  </P></p>

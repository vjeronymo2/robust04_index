			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Narrative painting gets lost for words - The RB Kitaj retrospective at the Tate Ronald Brooks Kitaj was born in 1932 in Cleveland, Ohio. His early adult life was spent as a merchant seaman, with intervals of study at the Cooper Union in New York. Then, in the mid-1950s, came National Service after which, in 1957, he came to England to continue a now subsidised education under the terms of the GI Bill. He spent the next two years at the Ruskin School at Oxford, followed by a further three in the Painting School of the Royal College of Art in London. By the early 1960s he was established as a central and influential figure within a loose freemasonery of artists that included not only such college contemporaries as David Hockney, Adrian Berg, Allen Jones and Derek Boshier, luminaries of the British strain of Pop-Art, but ranged from Bacon and Freud, Caro and Paolozzi to Hodgkin, Tilson, Blake, Andrews and Auerbach. He has remained in London ever since, not as refugee or committed expatriate, but by habit, as he puts it, a cultural vagrant after the fashion of Whistler, James, Pound and Eliot. He remains essentially American and an outsider, conscious of his own displacement and ever intrigued by the dissident, the stateless and the dispossessed. His own Jewishness gives such self-awareness a particular edge. The diaspora in general and the Nazi persecutions are his constant leitmotifs. He has always been a narrative painter, which is to say one who would always impose a reading, a story or scenario, upon the work, no matter how ambiguous or imprecise the physical working of the painting may then render it. Of one of the earliest paintings, the 'Tarot Variations' of 1958, he says: 'My journal entries for this painting are lost and I can't remember what exactly stands for what, but Eliot claimed that characters and genders melt into each other in (The Waste Land) and anyway I have obviously departed to suit my convenience.' The assumption was and remains that there would indeed be a journal entry. The danger is always that the journal entry, the literary content, might move from mere explication to justification of the work. The visual interest and quality of the painting, as a painting, should be what make it interesting or otherwise, good or bad, no matter how recondite or abstruse its exigesis - or every Crucifixion or Annunciation or Triumph of the Red Army would be as good as any other. But Kitaj parades his learning unabashed, his bookishness, his art-historical enthusiasms, his philosophical and political obscurities, his louche fantasies and personal adventures. Every picture tells a story. At what point does the story-telling take over? Of his complex allegory, 'If Not, Not' of 1976, he writes: 'its sense of strewn and abandoned things was suggested by a Bassano painting, of which I had a detail, showing a ground after battle . . . The general look was inspired by Giorgione's 'Tempesta'. . . My journal reports a train journey someone took from Budapest to Auschwitz to get a sense of what the doomed could see through the slats of their cattle cars . . . Since then, I've read that Buchenwald was constructed on the very hill where Goethe often walked with Eckermann.' It may seem gross to carp at such things, but this intellectual collage-making - which matches the collage-like technique of Kitaj's actual picture-making - masks repeatedly the ever more perfunctory and formulaic nature of the paintings themselves. 'Oh how clever and thoughtful and serious an artist I am', he would seem to say, 'and so how clever, serious and thoughtful my works must be.' It doesn't follow. The few paintings which are successful, and actually beautiful, such as the tall, thin figures of the mid 1970s, 'the Arabist', 'the Orientalist' and the 'Smyrna Greek', are those which attempt a fuller resolution in the statement of the image, and a richer, more considered quality on the handling of paint and surface. In other words, they are more interesting as paintings. Perversely they serve only to point the technical emptiness of the rest, which amounts to drawing out and filling in. The great Kitaj myth is that he is a consummate draughtsman. Rather he is a mannered and careful draughtsman, precious of surface effect in the use of pastel and charcoal. He looks to Degas, whose drawings 'are one of those artistic achievements by which I measure all art', but shares none of that infinitely greater artist's sense of adventure before the model, takes none of his risks. This retrospective is overdue for an artist of Kitaj's reputation. It is indeed an important show, though not perhaps in quite the way expected, re-evaluation rather than celebration. What is touching is his honesty, for there is no doubt that he believes in the significance of what he does. Here stands the Emperor in his innocent complacency, for us to see him in all his mortal fallibility.

Recent Pictures and Graphics 1974-1994; Marlborough Fine Art, 6 Albemarle Street W1, until August 20. A Print Retrospective; Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, until October 9.</p>

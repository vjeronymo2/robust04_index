			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Bank to set up works council Credit Lyonnais, the leading French bank, and the banking unions have agreed to establish a European-wide works council for all its employees including those working in Britain, it was announced yesterday by the Geneva-based International Federation of Commercial Clerical Professional and Technical Employees (FIET). The agreement is the first of its kind in the European banking industry. 'This is the start of a new era of positive relationships between management and workers,' said Mr Philip Jennings, FIET's general secretary. The bank's management will be required to consult with its employees across Europe on its business strategies, restructurings and employment policy. Employees from 10 European Union countries (except Denmark but including the UK) will have seats on the works council.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Brierley extends Gibbs Mew offer BRIERLEY Investments Limited, the New Zealand investment company which has made a hostile Pounds 11m bid for Gibbs Mew, has extended its offer for the Salisbury-based brewer until October 9. That is the date of an extraordinary meeting for Gibbs shareholders to vote on the proposed purchase of drinks distributor UK D. Brierley said that if the Pounds 2.3m purchase was approved, it would drop its 200p bid for Gibbs. In a document posted to Gibbs shareholders last week, BIL said the acquisition of UK D would be 'a serious mistake which could seriously damage Gibbs Mew'. It urged shareholders 'whether or not they wish to accept the BIL offer' to vote against the acquisition. Brierley launched its bid for Gibbs, which is almost 60 per cent controlled by the Gibbs family, in August. The New Zealand company holds 19.7 per cent of Gibbs Mew. Before the bid was launched, rumours had circulated the market that Gibbs was planning an acquisition on the drinks side of its business. It has been suggested that a growing dispute between the Gibbs family and BIL over the acquisition led to the New Zealand company's offer. However, the board and family members representing 55.5 per cent of Gibbs' shares have rejected the offer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Following this week's package  of decrees aiming to speed economic reforms, Russian President  Boris Yeltsin is now preparing another series of decrees to  regulate the sphere of production, according to Sergey Filatov,  chief of the presidential staff.    Addressing participants in a regular ceremony of signing the  treaty of social accord in the Grand Kremlin Palace, Filatov  said the package of decress now under preparation is above all  aims to improve efficiency of tax offices. "The poor performance  of tax services results in such losses that their reducing by  20-30 per cent would enable to cover the entire federal budget  deficit", he noted.    The chief of the presidential staff listed priorities to be  addressed by the said decrees. They include cutbacks in state  subsidies and preferential support of enterprises, protection of  private ownership, encouragement of private and foreign  investments.    The president also intends to issue an order on division  between the economic and social activities of enterprises with a  view to put an end to what head of the group of experts under  the Russian president, Aleksandr Lifshits, described as "factory  socialism".    Some measures are also expected to be taken for equitable  distribution of reform burden among all sections of the  population.    Filatov stressed that time had come to pass from words about  reform to the reform itself, which the old parliament failed to  do, despite repeated and urgent appeals by President Yeltsin.</p>

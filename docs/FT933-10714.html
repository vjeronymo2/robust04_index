			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Democrats declare pact on budget: Leaders in US Congress confident of deficit deal DEMOCRATIC leaders in the US Congress have agreed a compromise on President Bill Clinton's proposals to cut the budget deficit, they announced last night. The deal would cut the budget deficit by Dollars 496bn over the next five years, Dollars 4bn short of Mr Clinton's target. The announcement - details are to follow today - came after intensive bargaining among Democrats over spending cuts and tax incentives. The Senate and the House of Representatives passed different versions of the budget in June. The bill, since amended, will now go back to the Senate and the House for final votes this week before the Congressional summer recess. Speaker Thomas Foley of the House and Senator George Mitchell, Democratic majority leader in the Senate, predicted at a news conference last night that the bill will pass the House on Thursday and the Senate on Friday. 'We have the votes. We will have the votes,' Mr Mitchell said. The version of the bill which cleared the Senate in June did so only by 50:49, Vice-President Al Gore's casting vote having been decisive. 'We are confident (of) a majority in the House,' Mr Foley said. 'We're not going to bring it up to be defeated.' The Speaker heralded 'the largest deficit reduction package in history, one that provides Dollars 496bn in deficit reduction.' It includes a petrol tax of 4.3 cents per gallon and it raises income taxes on the wealthy. Mr Mitchell said: 'For a married couple with a gross income of less than Dollars 180,000 a year, there will be no increase in income tax rates.' The senator indicated that there would be Dollars 254bn in spending cuts to Dollars 241bn in tax increases. The White House gave a preliminary blessing to the pact yesterday. Press secretary Ms Dee Dee Myers said: 'We think it's a good deal, something that will be able to pass both the House and the Senate.' The biggest motivation Clinton can offer for supporting the bill is that there is no alternative, according to Ms Myers. President Clinton, as a climax to his intensive campaign to win popular support for the bill, plans to address the nation late tonight. The outcome of the vote is critical to the Clinton presidency. If the budget fails to pass, Mr Clinton would face a severe loss of credibility both in his ability to work with Congress and to manage the US economy. 'The time has come to pass this budget and get on with it,' he said yesterday. 'The tax burden is fair. Spending cuts will now exceed the tax increases, and we are going to put it all against the deficit.' All Republicans in both chambers will vote against the final package. Mr Clinton's task has been to find compromises between the left and right wings of his own party.</p>

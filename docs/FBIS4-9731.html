			<p>BFN     [Text] Blue chips were down by 4 percent yesterday, Bocon  [consolidation bonds] quotations plummeted, and the Central Bank  sold off the staggering amount of $167.4 million. Obviously,  this turn in business transactions has caused turmoil in the  City. Stockbrokers found a new explanation for the debacle in  stock prices: namely the conflict between [National Securities  Commission Chairman] Martin Redrado and [Economy Minister]  Domingo Cavallo. Financial circles are visibly confused, and  cling to any domestic or international event to explain the  decline in share prices. Given this state of affairs, bankers  do not dare forecast when the present crisis will be over.    The drop in public securities parities is severely affecting  the pockets of a number of stockbrokers, who had gambled on a  bull market. This gamble did not turn out as expected, and they  now have to pay off their debts. During the days of euphoria at  the Stock Exchange at the beginning of the year, when it seemed  there was no ceiling for bonds, many of these brokers closed  futures transactions (purchase of papers to be paid for at the  end of the month) at prices considerably higher than those  current. When it was time to settle their debts in February,  stockbrokers rolled over their transactions with the hope that  they would be able to reduce their losses this month. But  things became worse, and now losses are much greater.    Bankers have already stated that this time there will be no  extension of the deadline for settling outstanding debts.  Stockbrokers will thus have to pay their debts in the coming  days. Many of them will have to part with some of their capital.  This situation has obliged many stockbrokers to liquidate their  positions, which in turn caused share prices to plunge even  more. Analysts from the City have noted that the uncertainty  prevailing in the leading international stock markets is  affecting the Argentine Stock Exchange. They also point out  that the decline in Argentine papers is greater than that of  other emerging markets because of the unbridled speculation in  futures transactions.    The stockbrokers that have been able to withstand all this  are in no rush to purchase bonds and shares. They are awaiting  the forced liquidation by those who are in tight spots  financially, so that they can put in an appearance at the stock  exchange when prices bottom out. This strategy was reflected  yesterday in the slack trading at the stock exchange -- only 38  million pesos, the smallest volume of the year. It should be  pointed out that among the blue chips Tabacal was down by 8.3  percent, followed by Acindar, Bagley, Celulosa, Indupa, and  Telefonica, which dropped by 5 percent. YPF [Government Oil  Deposits) shares, for their part, closed at 24.20 pesos, thus  registering a 3.8 percent decline.    The sale of dollars by the Central Bank did not help at all  to calm stockbrokers down. Even though experts assert that the  current drain on reserves (the Treasury has lost $514.1 million  so far this month) stems from the great liquidity prevalent in  the system, financial circles dislike major interventions by the  Central Bank as the selling party on the exchange market. In  any case they state that this issue will be a cause for concern  if at the beginning of April the Central Bank does not start to  recover part of the dollars it is now selling.</p>

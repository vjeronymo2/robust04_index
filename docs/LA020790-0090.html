			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO PRESS FOR RAPID GROWTH, DOUBTS SLUMP;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: CONGRESS GETS PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE. ITS GOALS MAY SIGNAL  CONTINUING CLASHES WITH THE FED.  </P> <P> President Bush said Tuesday that his "primary economic goal" over the next 2  1/2 years will be to keep the economy growing as rapidly as possible without  rekindling inflation so the nation can grow out of its budget deficit and  improve its living standard.  </P> <P> In his annual economic message to Congress, Bush dismissed suggestions that  America is due for a recession soon simply because economic expansion has  continued for so long. He asserted that the economy's performance during 1989  has "set the stage for healthy growth" in the 1990s.  </P> <P> "Growth is the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of  prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need and to maintaining  America's leadership in the world," Bush said. He predicted that the economy,  now sluggish, will pick up later this year.  </P> <P> The President's commitment to more rapid growth appeared to signal a  continuation of the conflict between the Administration and the independent  Federal Reserve Board over how fast the economy should be growing.  </P> <P> The Fed has indicated that it wants the economy to grow relatively slowly, both  to ease inflation pressures and to dampen demand for imports. Some Fed  governors have contended that living standards must grow more slowly for the  United States to solve its economic problems.  </P> <P> But the President's remarks -- backed by a 419-page report written by his  three-member Council of Economic Advisers -- suggest that the Administration is  more convinced than ever that the economy should be growing more rapidly than  the Fed wants it to.  </P> <P> Bush's report said that the Administration's economic goal should be "not  simply to avoid recessions and extend the expansion" but to keep economic  output growing rapidly enough so that incomes keep rising faster than  inflation.  </P> <P> The Administration's differences with the Fed have cropped up periodically  during Bush's first year in office -- mostly in disputes over whether the  central bank ought to actively push interest rates lower or keep them  relatively high to help combat inflation.  </P> <P> The most recent clash occurred last month, when White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater criticized the Fed publicly for not nudging down interest  rates. When asked about the Fed's reluctance, Fitzwater asserted that lower  interest rates would be "justified."  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady conceded in testimony before Congress last  week that there are "differences of point of view" between the central bank and  the Administration, acknowledging that "the Administration probably has a bias  toward (faster) growth."  </P> <P> Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, sought to  minimize any disagreement, telling a news conference Tuesday that "what  differences there may be are rather minor" in context. "If you want to make a  mountain out of less than a molehill, that's your decision," he said.  </P> <P> The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday began a  two-day policy review. Although the White House is hoping the panel will vote  to nudge interest rates lower, the committee is expected to continue its  current policies.  </P> <P> Indeed, the presidents of four regional Federal Reserve Banks formally urged  Congress Tuesday to adopt a resolution directing the Fed to make cutting the  inflation rate to zero its primary goal over the next five years.  </P> <P> The four are Gerald E. Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York, Robert T. Parry of San Francisco, W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland and Robert  P. Black of Richmond. All are on the 12-member Open Market Committee.  </P> <P> Neither Bush nor the economic advisers' report attacked the Fed directly. The  President said he "strongly" supports "the Fed's goal of non-inflationary  growth and share(s) with them the conviction that inflation must be controlled  and reduced in a predictable fashion."  </P> <P> The council's report praised the Fed for its inflation-fighting efforts, saying  the central bank "appears to have achieved a high degree of credibility" by  "consistently following a forward-looking policy directed at this goal."  </P> <P> However, Bush noted pointedly in his message to Congress that the economic  pick-up he is forecasting for later this year depends at least partly on  whether the Fed "maintains a credible policy program to support strong  non-inflationary growth."  </P> <P> The Administration's contention that the United States can "grow its way out  of" the budget and trade deficits -- by spurring more tax revenues while the  government slows the growth of spending -- is sure to spark controversy.  </P> <P> Several key Democrats in Congress already have expressed skepticism about the  President's assertions that he can accomplish his aims without either raising  taxes or cutting spending more drastically. But Bush insists that he is on  track.  </P> <P> Tuesday's report dismissed the conventional wisdom that the economic expansion,  now in its eighth year, soon must begin to wane. It said historical evidence  shows that recession "does not automatically become more likely" just because  an expansion has continued several years.  </P> <P> The document noted that, in contrast to previous lengthy economic expansions,  inflation "has remained moderate and has not accelerated" during the current  growth streak, and the economy's shift from manufacturing toward services makes  it less susceptible to slumps.  </P> <P> The council's report cited a standard list of U.S. economic shortcomings -- the  United States must save and invest more of its resources, upgrade its  educational system and provide more jobs and housing for the poor, it said.  </P> <P> However, the central theme of the council document was that the government must  hammer out a clear and systematic long-term plan for resolving these problems  that will be "credible" to a majority of Americans.  </P> <P> "Without commitment to a clear plan," it said, "strong incentives exist to  change policies in an attempt to achieve short-term gain."  </P> <P> The report suggested some modest procedural improvements in the Gramm-Rudman  budget law to make it more difficult for Congress and the Administration to  circumvent deficit-reduction targets late in the fiscal year.  </P> <P> And it reiterated the Administration's opposition to so-called industrial  policies, which provide government subsidies to industries, and to allocating  shares of the international trade market under the guise of "managed trade."  </P> <P> In contrast to previous years, when the council used its report to announce new  concepts, Tuesday's document was bland -- amounting essentially to an economic  textbook designed to provide the intellectual background to explain the  Administration's economic philosophy.  </P> <P> But there were some surprises:  </P> <P> Departing from its earlier reluctance to discuss the issue, the Administration  conceded that the four-year improvement in the nation's trade deficit is likely  to be "smaller and more gradual over the near term" and could grind to a halt  in several more months.  </P> <P> Distancing itself further than before from the Ronald Reagan Administration,  the Council of Economic Advisers conceded that Reagan economic policies  "contributed to" the run-up in the value of the dollar -- and the dramatic  widening of the U.S. trade deficit -- in the 1980s.  </P></p>

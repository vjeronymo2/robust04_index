			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bihac region was again today the least quiet  part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From their strongholds in the  so-called autonomous region of Krajina, chetniks shelled the  outlying districts of Cazin. They also targeted the wider area  of Buzim. Although the members of Fikret Abdic's traitorous  units were reinforced with chetniks among their ranks in their  attacks on Pecigrad and Todorovo. Their attempts to recapture  lost territory were in vain. Mirza Sadikovic reports:    [Sadikovic] The truth is rapidly finding its way to Velika  Kladusa. This afternoon the fighters of the 5th Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army liberated new territories as they were  returning fire to constant artillery and infantry attacks  launched by members of Fikret Abdic's forces, fully supported by  the chetniks of the so-called autonomous region of Krajina.  They also disarmed yet another group of some 100 soldiers of  the self-styled people's defense of Velika Kladusa, thus  bringing total disarray into its 1st Brigade. A considerable  amount of artillery and infantry equipment, weapons and  ammunition was captured in this operation. At the same time a  large number of people have crossed into the liberated  territory, while Fikret Abdic's war-mongering headquarters is  being gripped by panic because even the private radio station of  Velkoton [Velika Kladusa Radio] has started to disobey orders.    Overall, conditions are being rapidly created for the  normalization of living conditions and the legality of the state  of Bosnia-Herzegovina across the entire region of Bihac.</p>

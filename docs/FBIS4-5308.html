			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 7 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The proper  functioning of power supply enterprises of the Mongolian capital  is not to be improved greatly shortly as soon as Russia started  two days ago supplying electricity which was ceased by the  beginning of the current year due to the delay in payments on  the part of Mongolia. But as is cleared up now, the failures in  power supply were and are stipulated by more serious reasons  connected with a poor organization of labour, irresponsibility  and loosening discipline of those dealing with as well as other  shortcomings in the work of the coal mining enterprises.  According to the Mongolian television, at the major heat and  power stations of the city there is the coal stock left only for  a few days so they are trying to make use of them as much longer  as possible which means that the current practice of cutting of  the power supply for several times a day would be continued for  a uncertain period up to a normalizing of the coal mining.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN ASKS PRINTING NAMES OF SCOFFLAWS;  </P> <P> PARKING FINES: MAYOR CALLS FOR CHANGES IN STATE LAW TO ALLOW CITY TO BETTER  COLLECT SOME OF THE $226.6 MILLION IN UNPAID TICKETS.  </P> <P> To collect more unpaid parking tickets, Los Angeles transportation officials  recommended publicizing the names of the worst parking violators, and Mayor Tom  Bradley called Monday for changes in state legislation that would improve the  city's ability to make scofflaws pay.  </P> <P> In a report to the mayor, Department of Transportation General Manager S.E.  Rowe revised downward the amount of unpaid parking fines from $249 million to  $226.6 million. Rowe also said 71% of the tickets issued annually are being  collected.  </P> <P> But the mayor responded, "Los Angeles can and must do more."  </P> <P> After inquiries from The Times, Bradley asked parking officials to provide  information on the status of the city's collections.  </P> <P> The report concluded that only $106.8 million of the $226.6 million is  potentially collectible.  </P> <P> The remaining $119.7 million was deemed uncollectible for a number of reasons:  Courts had dismissed some of the tickets, notices mailed to owners had been  returned for lack of a current address, or the state Department of Motor  Vehicles was unable to provide any owner registration information.  </P> <P> In his call for new legislation, Bradley wrote state Senate President Pro Tem  David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), saying that "state law currently inhibits the  city of Los Angeles" from pursuing those violators.  </P> <P> The mayor noted that $35 million goes uncollected because the DMV does not have  up-to-date driver identification information, and another $22 million is owed  by people who have sold their cars but can't be found.  </P> <P> "California must revise our laws to require drivers to obtain a single license  plate that would stay with the driver, not the car, whenever the vehicle is  sold," Bradley said. "In other words, simply selling the car would not be a way  to avoid paying parking tickets."  </P> <P> Bradley also endorsed another recommendation in the parking report that would  amend the state Vehicle Code to allow the city to impound or attach metal  "boots" to scofflaw vehicles, even when the vehicles are located on private  property.  </P> <P> Under current law, the boots can be applied to vehicles with five or more  unpaid tickets, but only if they are on public property.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Roberti said the senator would consider the mayor's requests.  </P> <P> The city should release for publication a "heavy hitter list" of scofflaw  organizations and individuals, the report recommended.  </P> <P> Jay Carsman, parking ticket coordinator, said, "If these folks happen to be  prominent citizens or corporations who flagrantly violate parking laws and fail  to address their responsibility to deal with the tickets, then publicizing  their names might help to persuade them to obey the law."  </P> <P> Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that the mayor has not taken a position on  the recommendation. "He is considering it," Chandler said.  </P> <P> Parking officials also proposed expansion of the "booting and impound program  to evenings and weekends, (which ) would increase revenue by approximately  $600,000 per year."  </P> <P> The department asked for two more booting teams, up from its present four, who  would be deployed six days a week instead of five. Bradley said he had provided  for one more team in his proposed budget.  </P> <P> The $106.8 million that parking officials described as collectible included  about $11 million worth of tickets issued within the last 60 days, $633,361  incurred by out-of-state motorists who had been mailed notices, and $47 million  in fines for which the DMV had placed holds on registration renewals. Under  state law, owners cannot renew those registrations until the parking citations  are paid.  </P> <P> Another $48 million in possibly collectible fines have been assigned, for a 30%  commission fee, to Lockheed Information Management Services Inc. The company  has held the city's contract to process parking tickets since 1985, and won a  contract amendment to do "special collections" last year.  </P> <P> Lockheed has collected $5.6 million in such delinquent fines.  </P> <P> In a letter Monday to Rowe, Bradley noted that the contract for processing and  collections is up for renewal later this year, and said: "This is a perfect  opportunity for the city to evaluate its parking ticket collection process. We  must give top consideration to those firms with the most aggressive plan of  action."  </P> <P> The report described recent steps taken to improve collections from the  outstanding $226.6 million. One involves new "specialized enforcement teams"  that in their first three days of operation impounded 25 vehicles with 285  citations listed against them, the report said, representing $17,000 in fines.  </P> <P> And Lockheed, which -- with parking officials' approval -- had relied only on  mailed notices to delinquent violators in the "special collections" program,  may pursue some of the more aggressive strategies spelled out in its city  contract.  </P> <P> The company, the report said, "is now developing a plan to address skip-tracing  requirements for violators who do not have a correct current address on file  and a program for telephone contacts to debtors."  </P></p>

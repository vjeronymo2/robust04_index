			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: GOP'S FIGHT WITH UNION POLITICS  </P> <P> Union strength in the workplace has dwindled, but, not satisfied with that,  many Republicans are now pressing for legislation to weaken labor's still  impressive strength in the political arena.  </P> <P> The goal is to blunt the increasingly sharp political tools that unions use to  get their nearly 20 million members to vote for labor-endorsed candidates, most  of whom are Democrats.  </P> <P> The Republican battle plan is primarily designed to block the methods unions  utilize to register members, get them to the polls on time and explain why  their leaders think they should vote for labor-endorsed candidates.  </P> <P> Unions have long used phone banks, door-to-door visits, mass mailings and  computers to ask their members to support labor's endorsed candidates. Now they  have refined and increased the use of those techniques, employing computers and  sophisticated telemarketing methods.  </P> <P> Congressional Republicans have introduced bills to stop the use of union dues  to finance these labor tactics, which depend on costly communications between  union leaders and their members in political campaigns. That restriction of  freedom for unions will be tricky for Republicans to impose because it would  also mean restricting support they get themselves from business and other  political action committees. That was one reason why campaign-financing  legislation wasn't adopted by the just-concluded session of Congress. But  determined Republicans such as Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) say they are going to  push ahead "to protect the rights of the working man" by limiting the use of  union money in politics.  </P> <P> Most Democrats oppose the bills, and the Democrats control both the House and  Senate. However, if the Republicans accept limitations on the support they get  from their own allies, they might get the limitations they want on the  political freedoms of unions too, all in the name of campaign reform.  </P> <P> The GOP would get the best of the bargain since unions are still the single  most effective political institution in the country, because their influence is  felt in almost every race from presidential contests to small town elections.  </P> <P> A majority of union members -- between 60% and 65% -- usually votes Democratic  and that makes them a decisive force, especially in close elections.  </P> <P> Unions have been the decisive force in nominating the Democratic presidential  candidates through primary elections. The defeats by Republican rivals in  general elections in recent years don't diminish the importance of the role  unions play in choosing the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.  </P> <P> True, the continuing influence of unions in politics contrasts sharply with  their declining strength in the workplace: While the total number of union  members has remained steady in recent years, unions now represent only about  17% of the work force, compared to more than 40% a few years ago.  </P> <P> But even so, unions' political strength remains greater than that of any other  group.  </P> <P> Liberals, labor and minorities who once formed a solid core of support for the  Democrats are still predominantly Democratic voters. In fact, a larger  percentage of Jews (74%) and blacks (78%) voted for Democratic candidates in  races for the House on Nov. 6 than union members (65%) did.  </P> <P> But only labor unions have a national organization to help coordinate their  political activities among their widely disparate members whose only common  bond is their union. About 30% of union members are Republicans.  </P> <P> Business puts up more money for Republicans than labor does for Democrats, but,  like Jews, blacks and other identifiable blocs of voters, business doesn't have  something like the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (COPE) to unify  their political activities nationwide.  </P> <P> Another union strength is the proportion of them who actually vote. Nearly half  of all union members voted in the last election, in contrast to about 36% of  the electorate as a whole, and one key reason for that turnout is labor's  registration and get-out-the-vote campaign that the Republicans are so anxious  to stop.  </P> <P> In the closely watched governor's race in California, the loser, Democrat  Dianne Feinstein, got 60% of the labor vote statewide and 65% in this area,  where the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor put on a particularly strong  campaign for her. The Republican effort to weaken labor's political influence  is aimed at just such tactics used by labor here.  </P> <P> For instance, William R. Robertson, head of the county labor federation, said  the federation assembled 75 members who made more than 24,000 phone calls  beginning a month before the election asking members whether they were for  Feinstein, Republican Pete Wilson or undecided. They were also asked which  issues were most important to them in the governor's race.  </P> <P> Then the name of each undecided member and the issue of most concern to him or  her were sent by computer modem to the AFL-CIO COPE in Washington. A  "persuasion" letter signed by Robertson was sent to each of the undecided  members explaining the position of Feinstein and labor on that issue. The  members were called again to see if they had decided to back Feinstein, and  finally, all the Feinstein supporters received a postcard from the federation  reminding them to vote, and they got another "don't-forget-to-vote" phone call  on Election Day.  </P> <P> You don't need to be a political consultant to understand why most Republican  politicians want to deny unions the right to use union money to try and  persuade their members to vote for labor-backed candidates: It would be a  quick, if unsavory, way to cripple some of the GOP's most effective opponents.  </P></p>

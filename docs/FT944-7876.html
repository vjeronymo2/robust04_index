			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: France to supply Saudi frigates - Contracts &amp; ventures France has won a FFr19bn (Dollars 3.7bn) contract to supply Saudi Arabia with two 'stealth' frigates of its latest La Fayette class. Thomson-CSF, the electronics group, will be the prime contractor for the Saudi frigates. This reflects the degree to which the La Fayette ships, with their box-shaped superstructures designed to minimise radar echos, contain the latest electronics. The main French subcontractors to Thomson-CSF - whose own contract is worth 30 per cent of the total - are DCN, the state navy yard which will build the hulls, and Aerospatiale which will provide Exocet missiles. The French defence industry has been complaining about the recent commercial offensive mounted by its US competitors in export markets. But, strongly backed by the French government, it has pulled off successes this year by selling Mirages to Qatar and frigates to Pakistan. The latest sale to Saudi Arabia is known as 'Sawari 2', following the 'Sawari 1' sale in 1980 of four French frigates. Earlier this year Thomson won the order to re-equip these four ships and to supply new land-based Crotale and Shahine missiles in a deal also worth around FFr6bn to the French company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans Peter Stihl, president of the </F> Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, by I.  Zaunitzer-Haase; place and date not given: "`Kohl Is My Man'"]    [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who should be the head of the  next government?    [Stihl] I would like it to be Helmut Kohl.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Rudolf Scharping is out of the question?    [Stihl] There were positive signals from industrial circles  before the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] presented  their draft government program. With these ideas, the Social  Democrats have dropped back in terms of economic policy. The  new taxes proposed in the SPD program have a deterrent effect on  the economy and on me personally.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Does Helmut Kohl meet with your full  approval?    [Stihl] "Full" would be an exaggeration. Let us put it this  way: Industry is basically content with the coalition's overall  achievements. Just a few examples: European Union [EU]  enlargement, the GATT agreement, the privatization of railroads  and postal services, the first moves toward securing Germany as  a business location. These are positive results.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Is there a "but" hidden somewhere?    [Stihl] The government has made a dramatic mistake recently:  The compromise on the nursing care insurance is unacceptable.  You can take my word for it: Industry will not stop resisting  this.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] What are you planning to do?    [Stihl] Well, we are not going to block highways. But we  will take suitable measures. You can rely on that.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Let us come back to the "cabinet of your  choice." Helmut Kohl should remain chancellor. Who will be  economics minister?    [Stihl] For me, the best economics minister of the past 20  years was Otto Count Lambsdorff. I would not mind his return.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] You are have not participated in the  recent attacks on Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt.    [Stihl] On the contrary. I have even protected him. When  he speaks out against the law on shop-closing hours I applaud  him. I hold two views on this issue: An official one that  advocates limited extension of opening hours. And a personal  one that says: Abolish the outdated shop-closing regulations.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Finance Minister Theo Waigel is said to be  tired of his office. They say he does not want to hold this  office beyond the current legislative period.    [Stihl] If this is true -- but only on that condition,  because Waigel has done his job quite well, considering the  existing difficulties -- if it is true that he no longer wants  to be finance minister, I have an idea who could become his  successor.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who?    [Stihl] Karl Otto Poehl, the former Bundesbank president.  He would certainly be a good choice.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] But Pohl is a Social Democrat.    [Stihl] What counts for industry is professional competence.  It takes priority over party membership.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Can you imagine the Greens in the  government?    [Stihl] A government including the Greens is unthinkable for  industry, because they have disqualified themselves even further  by their recent party program.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] How can we get out of recession?    [Stihl] No additional taxes! No further tax burdens beyond  the 7.5 percent surcharge from 1995, no reunification tax, or  whatever. Industry misses convincing austerity measures on all  levels.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where and how?    [Stihl] The Bundestag has too many members. We have too  many ministries. Their number has to be reduced.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] That will not be enough!    [Stihl] The number of laender must be reduced. It is  impossible that several of our 16 laender cannot support  themselves financially. The so-called financial crisis of the  laender is simply due to insufficient austerity resolutions.  This has to be changed.    [Zaunitzer-Haase] The financial crisis in most of the local  governments is undisputed.    [Stihl] I am not so sure about that. I hear nothing but  complaints. But at the same time, taxpayers are stripped of  their money. All the taxes are constantly being increased.  This is an unacceptable situation!</p>

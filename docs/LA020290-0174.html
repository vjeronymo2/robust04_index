			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS PATRONS MAY SAMPLE 3 MUSICAL FIRSTS;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: A ROBERT CUMMINGS OBOE CONCERTO AND ZELMAN BOKSER'S 'POINTS OF  LIGHT' ORCHESTRAL WORK WILL BE PREMIERED. ALSO DUE: A TANDEM PERFORMANCE BY  SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS AND THE GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY.  </P> <P> This will be a weekend of musical firsts in Orange County.  </P> <P> Micah Levy and the Orange County Chamber Orchestra will give the first  performances of local composer Robert Cummings' Concerto for Oboe and Strings  on Sunday at St. Joseph Center in Orange and Monday at South Coast Repertory in  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> UC Irvine faculty member Zelman Bokser will conduct the UC Irvine Symphony in  the premiere of his orchestral work "Points of Light" tonight and Saturday at  UCI's Fine Arts Village Theatre.  </P> <P> And the Garden Grove Symphony and members of the Grove Shakespeare Festival  will team up for the first time to offer a program of Shakespearean drama and  music Saturday at the Don Wash Auditorium in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Robert Cummings said he got the idea to write a concerto for oboe while  listening to the radio as he was driving along in his car in 1987.  </P> <P> "I heard the Corigliano Oboe Concerto and was rather drawn to it," he said on  the phone from his home in Garden Grove. "I thought it would be a nice thing to  write. There are not that many in the literature . . . so I proceeded to write  one in the next three months."  </P> <P> An organist and music director of Holy Family Cathedral in Orange for almost 25  years, Cummings, 50, has been composing since he was 14. His Third Symphony, he  said, won a Hollywood Bowl Award in 1956, but "nothing ever came of it."  </P> <P> "It is discouraging, but it's very hard for a composer to be an advocate of  himself," he observed.  </P> <P> Cummings said he underwent an "artistic crisis" in 1970 after "10 years of  experimentation in avant-garde material. I, like all artists, started in a  tonal style and, through the education process at various schools, was forced  to write in a rather different style. I looked back on (his work) and asked, is  this what I really want to do? So about 1981, I went back to a semi-tonal  style, post-Britten, post-Tippett. . . .  </P> <P> "That is the dilemma of the modern artist -- what in the world style does one  write in?"  </P> <P> He calls his Oboe Concerto "unabashedly tonal," so much so that "I'm sure there  are going to be people thinking, 'What's this guy doing in the 20th Century?' "  </P> <P> "But it's definitely a 20th-Century work. The harmony is 20th Century. But the  structure is very classical. The first movement is sonata allegro, the second  is rather an interlude and the third is a sonata rondo.  </P> <P> "Lots of composers are coming back to tonality," he continued. "In my music  from this point on, I will try to meet the audience at least half-way. If  that's a sell-out, I don't know."  </P> <P>  Micah Levy will conduct the premiere of Robert Cummings' Concerto for Oboe and  Strings with soloist Allan Vogel Sunday at 4 p.m. at St. Joseph Center, Loyola  Marymount University, 480 S. Batavia St. in Orange; and Monday at 8 p.m. at  South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Levy also will  conduct Haydn's Symphony No. 82 and William Boyce's Overture No. 4. Tickets:  $14-$17. Information: (714) 538-8391.  </P> <P> Zelman Bokser swears that his new "Points of Light" has "nothing to do with  George Bush.  </P> <P> "I was in Europe when the campaign was going on and for some reason managed not  to have heard about that phrase," Bokser said in a recent phone interview.  </P> <P> "I had planned this piece knowing I'd be doing Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1, a  very dark, heavy kind of work, on the same concert. So my original idea was to  write something considerably more ethereal, in texture anyway."  </P> <P> The composer said the work lasts about 11 minutes and is written for a "large  orchestra, used sparingly."  </P> <P> "There are particular sets of pitches I use in the work that motivate  everything that happens," he said. "That's true of virtually everything I  write. In this particular work, I'm using a set of whole-tone pitches. It's not  modal, it's not tonal, it's not 12-tone, but what could be seen as whole-tone  scale groupings. String chords are spaced in such a way that there are large  spaces between each of the voices. That gives kind of an airy sound."  </P> <P>  Zelman Bokser will conduct the UC Irvine Symphony in "Points of Light" today  and Saturday at 8 p.m. UC Irvine's Fine Arts Village Theatre. Also on the  program: Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 (soloist: Lincoln Mayorga) and  Mendelssohn's "Italian Symphony." Tickets: $7, general admission; $6 for  seniors and students. Information: (714) 856-6616 or 856-5000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Those listening to the Garden Grove Symphony on Saturday will get a bit of  Shakespearean drama as well, as Laura Mitchell and Wayne Watkins of the Grove  Shakespeare Festival act in selections from "A Midsummer Night's Dream,"  "Othello," "Henry V" and "Romeo and Juliet."  </P> <P> "The idea was to coordinate the efforts of the symphony and the Shakespeare  Festival, which are both major events in the city," said Thomas Bradac, the  festival's producing artistic director.  </P> <P> "There is a great body of music that has been written about Shakespeare's  works. (Originally, we thought) they could present one of these concerts that  would wrap around the body of the works." The idea evolved, Bradac said, into  "several small vignettes from the plays that are being used as transition and  dovetailing into the concert.  </P> <P> "We're not putting on a performance underscored by the symphony," he stressed.  "We are trying to give people a flavor of cross-disciplines.  </P> <P> "The two organizations are working much more cooperatively than we have in the  past," Bradac added. "There is a limited amount of dollars available for  everybody. But both organizations serve the community and we can work  cooperatively to maximize our efforts. We're both in the same ball park. If  this succeeds, I imagine in the future we may try some more experiments."  </P> <P>  Edward Peterson will conduct the Garden Grove Symphony in a "Sounds of  Shakespeare" program Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Don Wash Auditorium, 11271  Stanford Ave., in Garden Grove. Music by Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Walton and  others will be played. Laura Mitchell and Wayne Watkins of the Grove  Shakespeare Festival will present selected scenes from Shakespeare's plays.  Tickets: $10-$25. Information: (714) 534-1103.  </P> <P> </P></p>

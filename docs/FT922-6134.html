			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Thyssen tumbles 11% to DM203m NET profits at Thyssen, the German steel, engineering and trading group, fell 11 per cent to DM203m (Dollars 123m) in the first half of the current year. While group sales rose 1.7 per cent to DM18bn, turnover from the core steel business continued downwards and the volume of incoming orders taken by all divisions fell 0.5 per cent to DM19.1bn. Sales of capital goods rose from DM5.14bn to DM5.81bn. Net earnings of DM203m, compared with DM227m in the first six months of 1991 and DM363m in 1990, matched market expectations, and reflected the continuing weakness of international and domestic markets. Meanwhile, the group is rationalising its existing businesses and looking for acquisitions or partnerships which will reduce its dependence on the highly-cyclical steel and heavy engineering markets. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, said recently it was interested in telecommunications or consumer goods. The group's two main steel businesses, Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl, which yesterday reported substantial sales declines to DM5.09bn and DM1.53bn respectively, are to be merged later this year in an attempt to prune costs. Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the engines and agricultural machinery maker, yesterday forecast a 'negative result' for the first half of 1992 but said it expected to return to profit by the end of the year. Sales in the first four months had fallen to DM960m from DM1.17bn in the comparable period of 1991. Meanwhile the company plans to increase its capital base before its current authorisation runs out in mid-1995, according to Mr Werner Kirchgasser, chairman. Timing of the issue of new shares would depend partly on the condition of capital markets and partly on the group's ability to improve its earnings significantly. Krupp's takeover of Hoesch, and the creation of a new force in the European steel industry, has been given the go-ahead by the European Commission. Krupp has also announced the proposed terms for buying in the Hoesch shares it does not own. The merged group, with sales of about DM30bn and 100,000 employees, would still be smaller than the community's four steel giants, the commission said, and market domination was not an issue. The two companies have agreed the final terms for the takeover, which include Krupp's offering 13 of its shares plus DM6 in cash for every 10 Hoesch shares. Although no details are available of how much Krupp paid for its 51 per cent stake, the total value of the deal is estimated at over DM1bn. The final formalities are expected at an extraordinary general meeting at Hoesch on July 27.</p>

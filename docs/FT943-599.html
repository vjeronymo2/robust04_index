			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: IBM and Hewlett in fresh marketing war International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard, the two largest US computer companies, are engaging in a gloves-off brawl over leadership in the Dollars 43bn mid-range computer market. HP threw the first punch last week when it announced an aggressive marketing program to lure customers away from IBM's AS/400 computers with discounts of up to 30 per cent for those willing to trade their IBM models for HP machines. In magazine advertisements HP is claiming that the future of the AS/400, one of IBM's most profitable product lines, is in doubt. 'But I see no clear future here,' says a fortune teller gazing at a black box, the trademark colour and shape of the IBM computer. HP also claims it has persuaded 11 of the top 15 software developers to rewrite programs designed for the AS/400 to work on HP computers, removing the biggest barrier to switching from IBM to HP computers. IBM struck back this week with its own two-page newspaper advertisements, challenging HP's claims and vowing to match HP price discounts. 'Nice try, HP,' the advertisements read. 'To become number one in the business computer market it takes more than just shooting at the leader.' IBM, which is also distributing a seven-page 'fact sheet' to customers, business partners and its sales force, claims HP's minicomputer line is facing the end of its technological life cycle, prompting the discounts. Intense competition is nothing new in the mid-range computer market, where HP, IBM, Digital Equipment and others have been dueling for many years. This specifically target marketing battle is, however, unprecedented and reflects HP's determination to overtake IBM in a lucrative, high-growth segment of the computer market. HP dismissed IBM's counter attack. Its claims that HP technology was running out of steam, 'sounds like something a desperate product manager put together over the weekend', the company said. HP is attempting to hit IBM at a time when the market leader is most vulnerable. IBM's AS/400 sales weakened in the first half of this year.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Labour 'no threat' to big power generators A LABOUR government would not threaten the future of the two privatised electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, according to a report published yesterday by Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbrokers. Although Labour had an ostensibly tough policy towards utilities, the firm said, much of it was political rhetoric. Labour had two central policies for the electricity industry, the firm continued. They were to renationalise National Grid Company, which owns the electricity network of England and Wales, and to protect British Coal. The firm said it believed that neither policy should affect the generators significantly. Labour would be most likely to support British Coal through a direct Treasury subsidy, which would enable the company to maintain competitive prices for coal sold to the two generators. Meanwhile, renationalising the national grid should not affect its profits. Overall, Robert Fleming believed, a Labour government would not diverge sharply from the present government's policy of regulating the electricity market only where necessary. Dividend growth from the two generators would be at least 10 per cent in the long term, the report said. It foresaw that enough rival generators would emerge to satisfy the industry regulator, but not enough to threaten the market shares of National Power and PowerGen. This was in sharp contrast to a report from stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd earlier this month, which forecast that the two companies would not be able to maintain dividend growth in the mid 1990s.</p>

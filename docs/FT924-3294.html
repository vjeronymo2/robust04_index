			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: WestLB continues expansion WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale, the state bank of North-Rhine Westphalia, is expanding its influence in the German public sector banking arena with the acquisition of a stake in Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the state bank of its closest southern neighbour. WestLB and Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank (SudwestLB), its Baden-Wurtemmberg associate, will pay DM750m (Dollars 471.6m) for a 50 per cent stake in the Mainz-based bank. WestLB will own 37.5 per cent and SudwestLB 12.5 per cent. The move is part of a complex restructuring of German public sector banking, with WestLB - one of Germany's biggest banks - playing a leading role. It is in negotiations to take control of a majority stake in the Kiel-based Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, after winning the state government's approval for the move against a rival bid from the Hanover-based Norddeutsche Landesbank, the Landesbank for Lower Saxony. WestLB, which is expected to report operating profits of about DM1bn this year, takes an active approach to its investment activities. It is believed to have spent DM1.6bn on industrial acquisitions since 1991.</p>

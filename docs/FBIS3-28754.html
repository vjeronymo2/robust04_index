"Today, the partnership spirit has become the new pattern of  the North-South cooperation," said the head of state when  receiving 21 representatives of NAM members here on Thursday.    Foreign Minister Ali Alatas quoted President Suharto as  saying that the North-South cooperation should be implemented on  the basis of mutual interest and inter-dependency spirit. The  president said that some resolutions and agreements reached by  NAM members at the Jakarta's 10th NAM summit 17 months ago in  the sectors of debt management, population, food etc have been  implemented.    Suharto said he had discussed with leaders of the Group of  Seven (G-7) industrialized countries debt burden issues  involving 50 NAM members, 18 of which are classified as the  poorest countries with the slowest GNP. The G-7 groups the US,  Japan, Britain, Canada, Germany, France and Italy. The leaders  of the G-7 have admitted the important roles played by the  108-member movement in settling the debt burden, Alatas quoted  President Suharto as saying.    Stating that the NAM will always strive to put more emphasis  on such an economic issue, the head of state said that Indonesia  is ready to share its experiences with other members in managing  the debt.    "We made an effort to soften the debt burden faced by  countries having the lowest revenue. It could be the  re-scheduling of the debt payment," he added.    On the Bosnian issue, the head of state has expressed his  strong support for the establishment of an international  conference on Bosnia.    For this aims, the chairman of the NAM will give inputs to  the NAM coordinating bureau in the U.N. to follow up their  planned international conference.    Minister Alatas said that he could understand if there are  some groups of people who have expressed dissatisfaction towards  Indonesia's inability to send its troops to Bosnia. He said  that the sending of the troops would never settle the problem.    "It would only be worsening the condition," he said, adding  that the key to the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue  is to implement the U.N resolutions and abide by the  international law.    Alatas strongly asked the Serbian and Croatian forces to  stop  the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying "If necessary,  the U.N may use the arms force to stop it."</p>

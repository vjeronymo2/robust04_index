They had aims, which included plans to blow up public  places. These included the House of Representatives,  considering it a state institution. They also planned to blow  up places such as cinemas, video shops, and night clubs;  assassinate a number of intellectuals and economists in this  country; rob banks, considering them usurious establishments;  attack police foot patrols and seize their weapons and also  attack intelligence men; and attack public places.    Four crimes against supermarkets, taxi drivers, and a liquor  store were carried out. They also committed crimes in the  Rivoli Cinema in Amman and the Salwa Cinema in al-Zarqa', as you  heard and as we announced.

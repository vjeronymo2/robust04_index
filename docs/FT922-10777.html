			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Mujahideen government takes power in Kabul A NEW Afghan government drawn from the leading Islamic guerrilla groups yesterday took power in Kabul as heavy fighting continued in parts of the city. Professor Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, president of the 51-man interim council representing the main guerrilla groups, arrived in Kabul by road in the morning after a 27-hour journey from Peshawar in Pakistan. Accompanying him was a convoy of vehicles carrying heavily armed mujahideen. One of his first acts was to declare a general amnesty and to call on Gulbuddinn Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-i-Islam, and his followers to lay down their arms. But Mr Mojaddedi, who had earlier condemned Mr Hekmatyar as an 'aggressor,' also warned that they would be punished if they continue to ferment war. 'If they continue with their activities then this government will punish them according to the Sharia and Islamic law,' he said. Excluded from the amnesty was former president Najibullah who is still in the UN headquarters here. Mr Mojaddedi declined to be specific about his future but said, 'It is up to the people to decide.' Mr Mojaddedi formally took over power at a ceremony attended by what remains of the diplomatic corps here in the Foreign Ministry. He was flanked or faced by many senior members of the former regime including the prime minister, the chief justice, and the speakers of the two legislative assemblies who pledged him their co-operation and support. Mujahideen guerrillas standing behind interrupted their speeches with cries of Allah-u Akbar (God is Great). Immediately after the ceremony intensive fighting broke out in the centre of the city as Hezbe guerrillas demonstrated their opposition to a new administration. Mr Mojaddedi in a brief emotional speech appealed for national unity after 13 years of civil war. 'Now is the time to join hands and to work for the reconstruction of the country.' In a reference to the fighting that has accompanied the mujahideen victory he said that Afghans should not be divided on ethnic lines. Earlier, jubilant mujahideen fired automatic weapons into the air as the new president and his convoy arrived in Kabul. But the Hezbe forces gave warning that they would be resisted by firing 20 shells on to the airport. Hezbe forces remained entrenched to the south of the city and still held parts of the ridges overlooking Kabul. Gen Nabi Azibi, the former head of the Kabul garrison, who greeted the new president, admitted that there was 'still fighting in some parts of the city'. But he claimed that forces loyal to Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the new minister of defence and head of the Jamiat-i-Islami, were now in control of Kabul. Farhan Bokhari adds from Peshawar: In Peshawar's Chowk Yadgar market, foreign exchange trading undertaken by some 250 dealers is fast gaining business from events in Afghanistan. Local dealers say the afghani, the country's currency, has been trading at around 7.25 Pakistani rupees for 100 afghanis, more than four times the rate of PRs1.75 per 100 afghanis during the week before the fall of Mr Najibullah. Intra-mujahideen fighting in Kabul had at one stage pulled it down to PRs5.50 per 100, however. 'With peace in Afghanistan, we are getting more customers,' says Mr Haji Sherzadeh Khan, one of the traders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Odnokolenko article: "We Will Not Reinstate in Its </F> Old Form the Union Which We Have Lost"]    [Text] This memorable date will hardly be celebrated on an  official level. But, be that as it may, it marks a truly  historic event: Exactly three years ago, 17 March, the former  Soviet people voted by an overwhelming majority to preserve the  unified state -- the USSR. What happened next and how the  experience of the first Russian referendum ultimately ended is  well known. It would, of course, be possible to say quite a few  spiteful things about those who like to "consult with the  people." Nevertheless, the following nuance appears more  noteworthy: Some time later the same people who had said "yes"  to the Union voted equally readily for independence, this time  at a regional level.    ...We became witnesses to and participants in the notorious  sovereignty bandwagon. On departing, each republic took with it  as much freedom, economics, politics, security, and even  religion as it wanted. The former Union territory became the  most "president-intensive" in the world.    But now sociologists, sounding out public opinion among the  dwellers of the ruins of the "evil empire," once again present  us with sensational statistics: It turns out that the  overwhelming majority of former Soviet citizens are now, once  again, not averse to living beneath the same roof. And not just  the ordinary men in the street! Even well-known politicians  among the most frenzied radicals weep publicly for the  "prematurely deceased USSR."    Not that these tears will be believed any longer not only in  Moscow but even, probably, in Uryupinsk. It is all easily  explained: Separatism is now an unpopular field. Nobody, not  even the citizens of the "small but proud" Baltic republics, has  benefited from the partition and breakup. Of the entire former  Soviet population only the local elites -- leadership,  financial, entertainment -- are prospering. Previously they too  were ordinary Aeroflot passengers, but now they fly in their own  airplanes with a retinue and "retainers." Former party workers,  former commodity experts, former minor but cunning officials,  unremarkable officers.... Surely the purport of that all-Union  shake-up was not just that a band should play at the airport for  someone and a saber be waved about?    Oh, how strong our people are, nonetheless, with hindsight!  How trustful! First they were prepared to follow Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov's white cloak into the boundless sea of  independence, now they look somewhat too suspiciously upon the  "political" beard of Aleksandr Rutskoy.... Again no good will  come of it.... They would like very much not to be disappointed  again. Three whole years have passed, nonetheless! Russia is  no longer the same, and the entire post-Soviet area has greatly  changed. So we ask revolutionary gentlemen not to worry: A  return to the old ways is simply impossible. We must build our  common home anew and seek paths to unification anew -- to  effective unification which infringes nobody's interests. We  have already lived for long enough in states where everything --  from the economy to the borders -- is conventional, and it is  time we thought seriously about the future.</p>

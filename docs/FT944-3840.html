			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Field Sportsman What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . The smartest Christmas shooting stockings - as worn by the Prince of Wales - are knitted in local traditional patterns by Alison Thomson of 30 High St, Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway for just Pounds 19, made to measure. A gundog slip lead is a good stocking filler at Pounds 6 (Turner Richards, tel: 021-359 5577), but if the labrador is steady at the hottest pheasant drive he may merit immortality through Simon Gudgeon, whose dog portraits start at Pounds 125 (tel: 0243-811613). The silver dog whistle from Holland &amp; Holland, Pounds 38 (tel: 071-499 4411), is a better bet for owners of hooligan hounds - as it is 'silent'. This asset will be lost on the 50-plus shooting men bellowing over the port. The best present for those still with hearing is a pair of Sound Censor ear-plugs. Individually moulded to the ear canal, they are unobtrusive and extremely effective. They cost Pounds 130 a pair, although syndicates should be able to obtain group discount (tel: Mrs Perkins at Holland &amp; Holland). More light-hearted are the Loon cartoon boxer shorts - 'Cocks Over' - from the Enormous Handkerchief Co Hounds and, inevitably, fly fishing versions are also available at Pounds 9.95 (tel: 0333-329559). For more public display, the silver salmon cuff-links from William Powell's are good value at Pounds 50 (tel: 021-643 0689). And for a keepsake of an epic tussle with a fresh-run spring fish, there can be little lovelier than the hand-drawn river maps from Fred Cholmeley (tel: 047-683235), illustrated with water-colours of birds and mammals chosen by the client. Prices start at Pounds 95 unframed. All fish and fowl can be red-inked in true style in the new range of game-books by The Game Book (from Pounds 20.50, tel: 071-351 0233) but if the season's tally looks meagre, Roxton Bailey Robinson can organise the highest pheasants in the land from Pounds 800 per gun (tel: 0488-683222). Just thinking of such a day causes insomnia, so Wildsounds' Nocturne of Nightingale - one hour of nightingale song (Pounds 10.99 on CD, Pounds 6.95 on tape, tel: 0263-741100) - should send in the sandman before Santa.

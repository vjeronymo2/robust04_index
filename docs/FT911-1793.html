			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Armenia questions Kremlin's integrity ACCUSATIONS mounted yesterday that the Kremlin might be seeking to rekindle the long-running land dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan to serve its own political interests. Armenians say 36 people died on Tuesday when Soviet interior ministry troops stormed two Armenian-populated villages north of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but which Armenia lays claims to. The official aim of the operation was to crush Armenian guerrillas operating in and outside the enclave. Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, said yesterday the violence appeared to have subsided after a promise by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Tuesday to bring the situation under control. But he told the Reuters news agency that he had evidence the attack was designed to hinder Armenia's drive for independence and shore up Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, Azerbaijan's Communist president. Mr David Vardanyan, a senior Armenian parliamentary leader, told journalists in Moscow that he believed Soviet military action was a reward by the Kremlin for Azerbaijan's decision last week to sign the union treaty. The renewed trouble also follows Armenia's controversial decision last week to confiscate all Communist party property on its territory. President Gorbachev has issued a decree overruling that move. Significantly, a spokesman for Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry voiced suspicion over why trouble had started after three months of relative calm, even though he denied Azerbaijan was to blame. 'It's in somebody's greater political interest that this should start again now,' he said. The two southern republics' conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has cost hundreds of lives over the past two years. It led last January to the Soviet army declaring a state of emergency in Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, which is still in force. Since coming to power last summer, Mr Ter-Petrosian has succeeded in disarming illegal Armenian militias, leading to a decline in clashes in recent months. He warned yesterday, however, that any attempt to deport Armenian militants from inside Azerbaijan could trigger violence beyond his control.</p>

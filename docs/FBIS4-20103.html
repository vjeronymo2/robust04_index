			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 26 (AFP) -- French President  Francois Mitterrand, in Uzbekistan Tuesday [26 April], called  for an immediate international conference on Bosnia, involving  the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United  Nations.    A conference proposed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  supported by U.S. President Bill Clinton for next month "must  take place but sooner, if possible immediately," Mitterrand said.    "The way the military conflict is taking the upper hand over  diplomatic negotiations must not be allowed," he told a press  conference.    A contact group was formed in London at ambassadorial level  Monday to try to coordinate policy on ending the fighting in  Bosnia. The group comprises representatives of the United  States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations.    "It is time that the great powers, together with the warring  parties, set out an accord that it suits them to agree to,"  Mitterrand said Tuesday.    "The process of demanding in the name of the United Nations  a  retreat of Bosnian Serb military forces was very useful in  Sarajevo. Why not continue it in the designated security zones?"  he added.</p>

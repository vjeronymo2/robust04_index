			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): PLA to appeal against ruling THE Port of London Authority is to appeal against last month's industrial tribunal decision that 12 sacked Tilbury Dock shop stewards should be reinstated. The PLA has already appealed against the original decision that the dismissals were unfair. That appeal will now be taken with the appeal against reinstatement in the last week in February or the first week in March. The tribunal also ruled last month that seven other trade unionists, sacked after the ending of the National Dock Labour Scheme, should be compensated for unfair dismissal Mr Ken Reid, regional secretary for Tilbury with the TGWU general union, said he was confident that the union would win the appeal.</p>

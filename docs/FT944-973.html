			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: BTR Nylex in ADollars 800m Formica purchase BTR Nylex, the Australian arm of BTR, the UK conglomerate, announced yesterday that it is acquiring FM Holdings, the parent company of Formica Corp, the US laminates group, for ADollars 800m (USDollars 620m). FM Holdings, based in New Jersey, is the world's largest producer of high-pressure decorative laminates. It manufactures under the brand names of Formica and Sureil, and has 11 manufacturing sites in the US, UK, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Taiwan. It employs about 3,400 people. Under the terms of the deal, BTR would assume Formica's borrowings with the balance payable for 100 per cent of the company's shares in cash, BTR said. Formica's borrowings as of September 1994 were about ADollars 440m equivalent. Gross assets at the same date were about ADollars 485m, leaving net assets of ADollars 45m, according to BTR. For calendar year 1993, Formica's total sales were ADollars 580m with operating profits of ADollars 45m. Interest charges for that year stood at ADollars 62m and after-tax losses were ADollars 5m, BTR said. 'Full completion of the merger is expected in January 1995,' BTR said. 'Major shareholders and top management, representing approximately 90 per cent of the total equity of FM Holdings have approved the terms of the merger and therefore the merger is effectively unconditional as at this date,' it added. BTR chairman Mr Alan Jackson said the company signed an agreement in New York yesterday. He said he saw great potential for increasing Formica's sales in Asia. The deal comes at a sensitive time for BTR Nylex, which has been criticised for lack of acquisition activity. Earlier this month, it brought in a new managing director, Mr Philip Aiken, from outside the group, and signalled that this would herald a more aggressive strategic approach.</p>

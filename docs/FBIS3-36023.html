			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Kuznetsonv and Ivan </F> Novikov]    [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- The Duma Russia's Choice  faction did not, contrary to some news reports, raise the  question of removing fellow party member Mikhail Poltoranin from  his job as chairman of the parliamentary committee on  information policy and communications, ITAR-TASS learned from  faction chairman Georgiy Zadonskiy on Tuesday.    Zadonskiy was reacting to news reports which alleged that  Russia's Choice was "examining Mr. Poltoranin's case".  According to the media reports, the supposed grounds for  Poltoranin's removal was his comment on "Russophobia in our  press", uttered in a TV interview with Andrey Karaulov.    Zadonskiy declared that there was no Poltoranin "case". The  committtee chairman explained to Russia's Choice deputies at a  faction meeting that he talked with Andrey Karaulov for four  hours, only 40 minutes of which were eventually shown in the TV  programme, "Moment of Truth". At the meeting, Poltoranin  admitted that his "seditious" phrase could be interpreted as  being incorrect.    Zadonskiy reported that the Russia's Choice deputies were  satisfied with Poltoranin's explanation. However, they urged  upon him the importance of carefully weighing statements before  they are made public, since every word which issues from the  mouth of a party member reflects upon the image of Russia's  Choice.</p>

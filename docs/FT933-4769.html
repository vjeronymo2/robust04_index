			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy's global dollar bond offering could top record Dollars 3bn THE INTERNATIONAL bond market is limbering up for the Republic of Italy's global dollar-denominated bond offering, which could well exceed the previous record for a transaction of this kind. The record is currently held by the Province of Ontario with its Dollars 3bn global bond issue which was launched last January. At the start of August, the Italian authorities indicated that their global offering might raise up to Dollars 5bn. Italy has filed a registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to Dollars 10bn of bonds in the US market over the next decade. Officials from the Italian treasury were in London yesterday to gauge investor opinion. The roadshow, which will also include the Far East and the US, is scheduled to end on September 13 and the offering is expected to be launched shortly afterwards. Italian treasury officials declined to comment on the intended size of the global offering but they said that they expected the bonds to have a maturity of 10 years. They added that the aims of the offering were to subject Italy's credit to international scrutiny as well as to establish benchmarks for other Italian companies wishing to tap the international market in the future. Last January, the Italian authorities set an international borrowing programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn for 1993. So far, they have borrowed about Dollars 7.2bn through fixed-rate deals in D-Marks, dollars, and yen as well as a floating-rate note dollar bond. Syndicate managers said that the yield spread over US Treasuries which Italy would have to pay would depend on the size of the issue. They believed that investors would be willing to accept a spread of around 60 basis points for an offering of up to Dollars 3bn. However, some syndicate managers said Italy might have to pay a spread of up to 65 basis points if it decided to raise well over Dollars 3bn. 'It is a big deal so they will have to be careful,' said one syndicate manager. Italy's global bond issue is expected to be followed rapidly by the Republic of Portugal's global dollar offering. Since Portugal is only expected to raise around Dollars 1bn, syndicate managers said the sovereign borrower was likely to have to pay a spread over US Treasuries of between 40 and 50 basis points. There were only a few new issues in the international bond market yesterday. Abbey National Treasury Services launched its second lira Eurobond issue in little over a month, raising L200bn through a 10-year offering. A spokesman at lead manager Deutsche Bank said yesterday's offering appeared tightly priced compared with other recent lira Eurobond offerings. However, he added that the pricing was offset by the fact that, unlike other lira Eurobonds, this issue was not callable. The bonds were trading at 99.295 bid in the afternoon, at full fees. Elsewhere, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had placed four Japanese electric power companies on on CreditWatch with negative implications. Of the four, the best-known in the international bond market is Tokyo Electric Power Company which has a triple-A senior debt rating. About Dollars 38bn of rated debt is affected. The other three are Chubu Electric Power Company, which has a double-A plus rating, and Chugoku Electric Power Company and Shikoku Electric Power Company which both have a double-A rating. S&amp;P said that its actions were based on the increasing likelihood that electricity rates will be decreased and that flat sales and heavy capital expenditure programmes will put pressure on operating margins. The Jamaican government plans a USDollars 20m bearer bond issue, writes Canute James in Kingston. The bonds have a life of one year and carry a coupon of 7 1/2 cent. They will be issued in denominations of Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 50,000, with a minimum purchase of Dollars 10,000. Officials said if the offer is successful, subsequent and larger issues will be made. Foreign currency sales to commercial banks have declined in recent weeks, leading to increased pressure on the Jamaican dollar, which has depreciated by 17 per cent in the past three months.</p>

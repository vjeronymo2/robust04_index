			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lib Dem Euro-move gains Tory respect The Liberal Democrats' call for a referendum on Europe was a 'masterstroke', Tory party managers privately acknowledged yesterday. The firmness of Mr Paddy Ashdown's proposal for a national referendum to follow any major constitutional change proposed for Europe contrasted sharply with the uncertainty displayed by Mr John Major's cabinet over the issue. The proposal came in a leaked letter to the party's European campaign director. More crucially, the move may make it difficult for the Tories to claim, as they have in the past, that the Liberal Democrats are 'soft on Europe'. In recent months Conservative Central Office has argued that the government takes a much more critical stance towards the creation of a federal Europe than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats, and that this policy reflects public opinion more closely. Mr Ashdown's move may make it more difficult for Conservative candidates in the European elections to adopt this line. Labour officials, meanwhile, indicated that the party's campaign would focus on attacking Mr John Major's government on domestic political issues, repeating the approach adopted for the local elections. The party's manifesto for the European elections would underline that Britain must play a full role in the EU. Liberal Democrat officials said that the call for a referendum would not prevent their manifesto being 'the most pro-European' of any produced by the three main parties.</p>

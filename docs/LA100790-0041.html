			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: OFF TO THE RACES FOR OAK TREE'S 22ND MEET  </P> <P> Leaders of the California thoroughbred racing fraternity opened the fall season  at Santa Anita this week in the Directors Room with a lavish luncheon prepared  by executive chef Tony Pope.  </P> <P> Clement L. Hirsch who conceived the idea for Oak Tree -- begun in 1969 as a  non-dividend paying association to foster research, care and breeding of  thoroughbreds -- officially began his 22nd season as Oak Tree president. His  wife Lynn, Los Angeles and Orange County civic leader, was by his side.  </P> <P> Also in the crowd was the newest member of the board, Sherwood C. Chillingworth  of Pasadena and his wife, Sandra. He's the first addition to the board since  the deaths of founding directors Harold C. Ramser Sr. and Louis R. Rowan, more  than a year ago.  </P> <P> At their table, the Hirsches hosted the chief executives of the two most  successful race tracks (parimutuel-wise) in the country -- Joseph W. Harper,  president and general manager of Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, and Robert P.  Strub, chairman and CEO of Los Angeles Turf Club, and their wives, Barbara  Harper and and Betty Strub.  </P> <P> Traveling from San Diego for the affair were John and Betty Mabee. Mabee  campaigns one of the ranking 2-year-olds in the nation, Best Pal, winner of the  $344,100 Del Mar Futurity, in his Golden Eagle Farm colors.  </P> <P> Also in the crowd were Georgia Ridder, Dr. Jack and Maggie Robbins, Anabeth and  John J. Elmore Jr. of Newport Beach, Diane and Harry Rinker of Santa Ana, Betty  Ramser with Hal and Amalia Ramser, and Oscar and Alice Lawler.  </P> <P> ROYAL: Dudley Moore entertains and Roger Moore hosts when the British Academy  of Film and Television Arts hosts a royal gala evening to honor Michael Caine  in the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra -- she is the daughter  of the duke and duchess of Kent and Queen Elizabeth II's first cousin -- on  Friday at the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> It's a three-way split for proceeds: Childhelp USA, Children's Home Society and  the academy's Los Angeles chapter. According to chapter president Marion  Rosenberg, absolutely no cameras will be allowed into the banquet because of  restrictions by the British Consulate and royal protocol.  </P> <P> Princess Alexandra is here for the South Coast Plaza Festival of Britain and  the opening of the British and the Oscar Film Festival.  </P> <P> BLACK-TIE: As the new chairman of the board of trustees of Harvey Mudd College  and to bond the trustees for the challenges that lie ahead, Clifford A. Miller,  with his wife Judith, hosted trustees and spouses at a dinner-dance Upstairs at  the Bistro.  </P> <P> The evening also was a tribute to retiring chairman, E. H. (Hubie) Clark, who  will remain a trustee. Among guests were Norman and Erlenne Sprague, Richard  and Marjorie Stegemeier, the college president Henry Riggs and his wife Gayle,  Patricia Clark, Alexander and Adelaide Hixon and Robert Hastings and his  frequent date Phyllis Diller. More there -- Michael Morphy with Allegra Clark,  Trude and Joan Taylor, Jim Kilroy, Robert and Louisa Miller, Marian Garrett.  </P> <P> BLACK-SHOE: Invitations arrived in a black tap shoe when the Dance Gallery  Guild hosted its "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" opening evening. Co-chairwomen  Patti Amstutz and Ruth Moss arranged the champagne supper after the  performance.  </P> <P> SUCCESSES: More than 500 celebrities and supporters turned out for the  fund-raising brunch for the Rape Foundation hosted by the cast of the TV  series, "China Beach."  </P> <P> "L.A. Law" stars Susan Dey and Corbin Bernsen and actress Kelly McGillis were  among those honored for the center's documentary film for college students,  "Campus Rape." The center has distributed the film to more than half the U. S.  universities, according to Gail Abarbanel, center director.  </P> <P> The brunch was at Greenacres, Ted and Susie Field's estate. Hosted by  Emmy-winning actresses Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger and other "China  Beach" cast members, the event garnered about $200,000. Giving support were  Veronica Hamel, Jaclyn Smith, David Niven Jr., Norman and Lyn Lear, Sherry  Lansing, Heather Thomas, Judith Light and Linda and Bob Gersch.  </P> <P> BIG NIGHT: Santa Marta Hospital Foundation's Oct. 24 ball at the Beverly  Wilshire will support the only Latino-owned and operated hospital in the United  States. Because of its work with the poor in East Los Angeles, the hospital is  attracting the attention of prominent Angelenos.  </P> <P> To be feted that night are Sister Marie Madeleine of Saint John's Hospital and  Health Center, Reva and William Tooley and Santa Marta's hospital medical  staff. Among those supporting are Lois and Robert Erburu, Alice and Jerve  Jones, Wilma and Robert Campion, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Howard Allen, Jane  and Michael Eisner and Earle and Marion Jorgensen.  </P> <P> EXTRA TREATS: Platinum Circle guests at the third annual Frank Sinatra  Celebrity Invitational golf tournament in Palm Desert Feb. 21-23 will have the  extra treat of attending a post-gala at the Sinatra Rancho Mirage home.  </P> <P> Ol' Blue Eyes headlines the gala and can be counted on for a few nightcap songs  at the party.  </P> <P> Platinum Circle reservations are a mere $10,000, but it's for a superb cause --  the Desert Hospital and the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower  Medical Center at Rancho Mirage . . . .  </P> <P> And, speaking of treats, Halloween looms. The Los Angeles Children's Museum's  premiere group, The Inner Circle, hosts its annual Halloween Fashion Show and  Luncheon next Sunday at the Beverly Hilton. Saks Fifth Avenue will garb the  ladies on the ramp -- including honoree Jaclyn Smith, Inner Circle's president  Carol Walker and executive vice president Esther Rosenfield.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only in the case of civil money penalties could we see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the necessity of allowing facilities the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge the level of noncompliance since the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these penalties hinges upon discrete levels of noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than noncompliance as a whole. Thus, it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally significant to a facility facing a $10,000 per day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty to be able to prove that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance belonged in category 2, rather than category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3, since in category 2 the largest civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to HCF or a State would be $3,000 per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we are revising the rules to allow a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to challenge the level of noncompliance when a successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge on this issue would affect the amount of a civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty that HCFA or a State could collect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that a provider's burden of upsetting survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings relating to the level of noncompliance should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high, however. As we indicated in the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinctions between different levels of noncompliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether measured in terms of their frequency or seriousness,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not represent mathematical judgments for which there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear or objectively measured boundaries. Identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures in a facility's obligation to provide the kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high quality care required by the Act and the implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations most often reflect judgments that will reflect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of noncompliant behavior. Thus, in civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty cases, whether deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or are widespread and cause actual harm that is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy, or are widespread and have a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not reflect that a precise point of noncompliance has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred, but rather that a range of noncompliance has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred which may vary from facility to facility. While we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand the desire of those who seek the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible consistency in survey findings, an objective that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we share, the answer does not lie in designing yardsticks of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance that can be reduced to rigid and objectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated numbers. Survey team members and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisors ought to have some degree of flexibility, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deference, in applying their expertise in working with these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than perfectly precise concepts. For these reasons, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have revised the regulations to require an administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law judge or appellate administrative review authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uphold State or HCFA findings on the seriousness of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies in civil money penalty cases unless they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly erroneous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters believe it is not sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to simply state that the choice of a remedy is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appealable and recommend that the regulation explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that HCFA will not look behind or ``second guess'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's selection of remedy or remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We cannot accept these comments as sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(6) and (7) of the Act specify the means to resolve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any disagreement between the State and the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding noncompliance or enforcement action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters wanted sanctions imposed upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility for interfering with the survey team, monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or temporary manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 1128(b)(12) of the Act permits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to exclude SNFs from Medicare and to direct that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFs be excluded from Medicaid for failure to grant access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable survey agencies performing survey and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification functions in accordance with sections 1864(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act. Failure to grant access can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certainly be regarded as interference with the activities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency personnel. However, interference with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager is different. Sections 488.410 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 488.438 specify that if the facility does not agree to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions under which the temporary manager is imposed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility may refuse to relinquish control to the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager, and, in so doing, opt for termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted HCFA to include a ``sole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community provider exception'' to allow States to oversee the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations of noncompliant facilities with uncorrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies in rural areas, where the closure would result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in hardship to the residents and the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  States have the authority to oversee (appoint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State monitor) any noncompliant facility, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the location. However, if the commenter wants a provider in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rural area to be exempted from correcting deficiencies, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not have the authority to grant such an exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waiver authority requirements are provided at &sect;483.70 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;483.30(c) and (d), relative to the Physical Environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Nursing Services participation requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, and then only when specified conditions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

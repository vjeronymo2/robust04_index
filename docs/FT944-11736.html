			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Canary Wharf wins vote of confidence as climate alters: The dearth of 'big spaces' 'It frequently happens that monumental buildings are planned near the top of the building cycle, opened at a time when they cannot be filled, refinanced in the depression, and occupied during the upturn of the next building cycle.' World Prices and the Building Industry, published 1937. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has agreed to take an additional 350,000 sq ft of office space at Canary Wharf, the Pounds 1.5bn development in London Docklands now owned by a consortium of banks. Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, also confirmed that Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, is negotiating to take a further 500,000 sq ft. If this deal is signed, less than 1m sq ft of the 4.5m sq ft Canary Wharf complex will remain unoccupied. Canary Wharf's success in attracting tenants bears out the experience of previous property cycles, as the above quote makes clear. While the development boom of the late 1980s left central London awash with surplus space, there is now an acute shortage of large, modern offices. Although there is an overhang of vacant space - up to 12m sq ft including fringe areas of the City - most unoccupied buildings are old or small. Tenants such as investment banks which require open trading floors have few choices. According to Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, there are only three vacant floors of more than 40,000 sq ft in the centre of the City and only one in the West End. Until yesterday, Canary Wharf could offer a choice of 18 vacant floors of this size. If negotiations with BZW are successful, these will all be occupied. Scarce supply is already being reflected in rents. Surveyors Hillier Parker estimated that top City rents had risen to Pounds 32.50 a sq ft, up from Pounds 30 at the start of the year. While others dispute this figure, tenants are being offered fewer incentives and there is little doubt that headline rents will soon rise. Against this background, Canary Wharf's competitive position is improving. The terms of Morgan Stanley's new lease have not been disclosed, but agents said yesterday that rents of Pounds 20-25 per sq ft are usual at Canary Wharf, compared with Pounds 30-35 in the core of the City. Rent-free periods are also longer than the one to two years now common in central districts. The drawbacks with Canary Wharf in the eyes of many potential tenants are location and infrastructure. Despite the new Limehouse Link roadway, improved services on the Docklands Light Railway and the planned extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line, Canary Wharf is still one step away from the City. Barclays has shied away from moving all of BZW to Canary Wharf, opting to locate only the trading operations. Corporate finance, the equity markets operation and some senior management are expected to relocate to Royal Mint Court, a Barclays building near the Tower of London. Sir Peter was not concerned whether or not Canary Wharf attracted head office staff. 'It is my job to fill the place with good tenants. Beyond that, I don't really care who comes here.' Since it came out of administration a year ago, Canary Wharf has been owned by a group of 11 banks which financed the ambitious project for Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property developer. Yesterday's announcements bring forward the time when they will be able to cash in their equity by either selling the company or arranging a stock exchange flotation. The timing of such a move depends on Canary Wharf's profitability and the banks' reading of the property cycle. Last year, Canary Wharf's administrators predicted that the company would cover its costs by 1997/98, assuming that 80-90 per cent of the space was occupied. Sir Peter declined to comment yesterday, except to say that the company was covering its expenses before interest costs. If the administrator's forecast proves correct, the way could be open for a flotation within three years. Many forecasters also expect commercial property prices to peak in about three years time. The banks are doubtless hoping to make a better job of judging the property cycle than the developers they backed at the last peak.</p>

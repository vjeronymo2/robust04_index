			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Dealers bask in the heat of Nissan's dispute with Botnar: Chris Tighe wonders if customers will benefit from the bewildering franchise battle POISED on a step-ladder, a workman takes down the Nissan sign above the Newcastle upon Tyne premises of North East Garages and replaces it with a hoarding for Seat. In the showroom a couple, spurred into car hunting by reports of Nissan price wars, are listening to a salesman extol the Spanish-made Seat Toledo. The battle over Nissan sales is confusing for customers, and it is not yet clear how far they will benefit from it. Nissan UK, the importer-distributor headed by the 78-year-old Mr Octav Botnar, lost the Nissan franchise in Britain from the start of this year when Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest carmaker, set up its own UK operation. But Mr Botnar's operation still has a stock of new Nissans as well as a dealer network through which to sell them. Until last month North East Garages, with two sales outlets in Tyneside, was the Japanese manufacturer's largest independent dealer in north-east England. It was among the first in Britain to stock Sunderland-made Nissan Bluebirds and sold more than 5,000 new Nissan models of all types in six years. That helped to boost Nissan's market share in the north-east in 1990 to 15 per cent, three times its national figure. North East's link with Nissan has now been severed by the end of the 21-year relationship between Nissan Motor, the Japanese manufacturer, and Nissan UK. North East has become a dealer for Seat, the carmaker which recently tried to recruit workers from Nissan's Sunderland plant for its new factory near Barcelona. Mr Murray Shand, North East's owner and managing director, will not discuss why his showrooms are not among the 151 outlets so far signed up by Nissan Motor GB for its new dealer network. He does say that Mr Botnar was right to fight the Japanese over their UK pricing policy. Like other Tyne and Wear dealers caught in the crossfire between Nissan Motor and Mr Botnar, Mr Shand is bullish about the upheaval. 'It's like a breath of fresh air,' he says. North-east England is an important battleground in the fight between Nissan Motor GB and Mr Botnar's company. Meanwhile AFG dealerships - also part of the Botnar empire - are strong in the area because of local loyalty to Nissan's Sunderland plant. Mr David Hurst, Nissan Motor GB's deputy managing director, says: 'It gives us one of our biggest challenges.' So far, he has five outlets trading in Tyne and Wear and a sixth under discussion. Of the five, two are new to Nissan, one is ex-Fiat and one an independent that already sold Nissans. The fifth, Vic Young, switched from new Nissans to used cars in 1988 after finding AFG was building a dealership next door. Elsewhere in the north-east Nissan Motor GB's coverage is non-existent, although intensive negotiations are in progress. Even in Tyne and Wear it is having to compete against four AFG garages bearing the Nissan logo and aggressively marketing the carmaker's models. Proximity to the Sunderland plant gives the fight a personal edge. A salesman at AFG's largest Tyneside branch, in Newcastle, says: 'At the moment we're selling a lot of motor cars - to the detriment of Nissan Motor GB, I hope.' In Sunderland, executives of the big dealership chain Reg Vardy gathered for the opening of their flagship Nissan outlet. They were amused that their AFG competitor just along the road had washed his Nissan signs ready for the drive-past by Nissan Motor GB management. 'That's a load of rubbish,' says the AFG unit's manager. He adds that his sales since the new year have been 'fairly phenomenal'. Both camps insist that they are doing good business, but is there really a price war from which customers are benefiting? Certainly cars are being sold. A Vardy salesman at the company's new Sunderland showroom clinched a deal even as Mr Akio Sumitomo, Nissan Motor GB's managing director, was giving his opening address. Both new and old Nissan dealers in Tyne and Wear are willing to offer discounts of up to 10 per cent on new Nissans. But as Mr Botnar has no prospect of getting more Nissans to sell, neither side is likely to embark on ruthless undercutting. Direct price comparisons are almost impossible because of new model designations introduced on January 1 and special offers such as a year's free insurance. Customers are also prey to conflicting claims. Nissan's new dealers insist that AFG is selling 1991 cars, while AFG salesmen maintain they will be classed as 1992 vehicles. Mr Vic Young, at his newly approved Nissan dealership in South Shields, says: 'Buying a car is always a time of trepidation for people.' There is no sign that the Nissan dealers' war will make it less so.</p>

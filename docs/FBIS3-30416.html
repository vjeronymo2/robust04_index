Speaking here after visiting Sarajevo earlier in the day  with  her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller, the Islamic head of  government said the United Nations should press for an "early  negotiated political settlement" and, failing that, opt for air  strikes.    The United States had already "made it clear that it is  prepared to go ahead" with air strikes, but a lot depended on  the stance of European countries and UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    She added: "If the UN Secretary General feels that he cannot  reach a consensus for air strikes, the least that can be done is  allow the arms embargo (on Bosnia) to be lifted, so that the  people of Bosnia can defend themselves."

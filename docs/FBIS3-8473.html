"We didn't ask UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] escort since  it  is not operating in this area," Peter Kessler, spokesman for the  UN High Commission for Refugees said.    Asked about the UN Protection Force's mandate for protecting  humanitarian convoys, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Jose Labandeira  said the organisation had not agreed to force the convoy's  passage through blockades.    "We don't want to use force. If we do it, they (the local  Bosnian Serb militia) can destroy bridges and put mines on  roads," Labandeira said.    Kessler said that the last UNHCR convoy which tried to get  into Maglaj on October 26 was given a UN military escort. Two  of the convoy's driver's were killed in the action.    Maglaj, which has a majority-Moslem population, has been  under seige by Serb forces since last June.    UNHCR has supplied Maglaj by airdrops, some of which fell  onto Serb lines, Kessler said.

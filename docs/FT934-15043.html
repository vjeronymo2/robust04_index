			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (28): Weighing up the difficulties - Margaret Dolley follows a company's two-year battle to gain approval for the sale of its weighing equipment on the French market / Company profile of Scanvaegt AS CHAIRMAN of one of Europe's fastest growing manufacturers of weighing equipment, Lars Grundtvig thought he was hardened to the problems of being an exporter. 'Weights and measures have been a sensitive subject since the Roman balance was invented,' says Mr Grundtvig, from Danish firm Scanvaegt. 'And not surprisingly, since scales are so bound up with measuring money.' The company is still smarting, however, from a two-year battle to gain approval to sell its products on the French market. The experience has left it wary about the frustrations and delays that can be involved in fulfilling another country's technical specifications. It is also seeking compensation for lost money and time in the European Court, on the grounds that the actions of French officials constituted an unfair impediment to free trade. More than 90 per cent of Scanvaegt's specialised equipment for the food industry is exported and the company was bullish about its prospects in the French agricultural sector following the introduction of the Single Market. 'There has been considerable loosening in the weighing sector in recent years,' says Mr Grundtvig. 'Generally, a machine that has been tested and approved in one country will be approved in all. We have had no problems in selling our equipment to Scandinavia, Germany or Britain - or even further away to the US or Middle East.' Scanvaegt's semi-automatic weighing machines had been approved by an EC-approved testing centre in Denmark and sold in 11 other European countries. Moreover, a common European directive covering this type of equipment was issued in June 1990, just a month after Scanvaegt set up a subsidiary in Brittany, and won a large order to supply equipment for a factory being set up by the Anglo-French poultry concern Bourgoin Moy Park. Scanvaegt feels that its application for approval of equipment was from the outset met with undue delays, conflicting instructions and bureaucratic hindrances. The company says this was despite its best attempts to comply with escalating demands, attempts that put half its research and development team working flat out for several months in order to modify the machines. The French weights and measures department initially said it could only consider granting licences for machines fitted with electromechanical load cells that had been approved in France. In a bid to speed up the process, Scanvaegt consented to switch from British/Dutch made parts. But its dismay mounted during the two months of telephone calls, letter-writing and intercession by the Danish embassy that it took just to obtain a list of approved manufacturers of load cells. Scanvaegt became increasingly caught up in the immense complexity of the French regulations, contained in a series of intermeshing decrees dating back as far as 1941. France was also in the process of decentralising: a confusion between the Brittany weights and measures office and Paris headquarters over the paperwork that ought to accompany the application meant the company was sent to the back of the queue in November. 'It took seven months just to get to the point of submitting an acceptable application,' said Mr Grundtvig. 'In the rest of Europe, the entire procedure has taken typically between two to three hours and two weeks.' Then began a lengthy process of arranging to install modified versions of the machines at various test sites in France. Once again, several design changes were requested - some of which Scanvaegt successfully contested on the grounds that they would have been unhealthy in machines used in the food industry - and communications were answered late or not at all. The company says it was surprised to find several other, French-made machines on the market which had not been patent-approved, but to which the authorities had apparently decided to turn a blind eye. Gradually, it became a race against the clock. Bourgoin Moy Park was keen to have the Scanvaegt machines and it installed three for non-commercial, test purposes, but eventually warned that it might be forced to switch to another supplier. 'We had spent a year dancing around after the French pipe and fulfilling all their demands, and in the end we only succeeded by kicking in the door with some SAS-style methods,' says Mr Grundtvig. The Danish industry minister was eventually persuaded to write to her French counterpart to complain about a breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome - relating to unlawful impediments to trade - and had to admit publicly that her letter went unanswered for weeks. The political pressure did eventually bear fruit: after almost two years, the applications were suddenly granted. Scanvaegt is now pursuing an application for approval of its automatic weighing machines, for which an EC directive is still being drawn up, but is happy to report smoother progress. So far the procedure has only taken five months and the company feels that the French market will undoubtedly prove a good one to be operating in. It finds it harder to forgive the past and is still pursuing its claim for compensation from the French authorities for all the extra costs involved in testing through the European Court.</p>

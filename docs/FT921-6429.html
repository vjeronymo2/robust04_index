			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Heseltine warns of dearer motoring: Pressure on road use may lead to increase in petrol duty after general election MR Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, warned yesterday that the cost of using a car in Britain may have to rise. In a speech signalling an increased government concern at the pressure on road use, Mr Heseltine raised speculation that after the general election he would push for increases in petrol duty to curb growth in car use. 'Public transport will be central to any approach,' Mr Heseltine said. 'We simply cannot provide for growing numbers of cars within our urban areas.' Speaking to a seminar in London organised by five professional institutions interested in transport, Mr Heseltine marked a further significant switch away from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's defence of 'the great car society', saying that traffic growth had reached a point where it was no longer possible to provide new roads into urban centres. The demand for car travel in the south east would simply mean new road space would be quickly filled, he said. His comments came amid pressure on the Treasury from some Tory backbenchers for increases in petrol duty in the March 10 Budget to help fund the expected income tax cuts. However, an equally vociferous lobby of Conservative MPs, particularly from crucial Midlands marginals, are calling for extra help for Britain's depressed car industry. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, marked the shift in Tory thinking last May when he declared himself in favour of switching more passenger and freight traffic from road to rail. But the fact that Mr Heseltine has thrown his formidable political weight behind the new policy just weeks before a general election gives it fresh impetus. Mr John Major yesterday chaired a cabinet committee set up to resolve clashes between government departments over the pace at which pollution-cutting measures, including those for carbon dioxide emissions, could be introduced. On Monday, Mr Heseltine will use a speech in New York to urge other countries to consider June's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as a starting point for further progress towards cutting emissions of greenhouse gases and reducing the risk of global warming. In his speech yesterday, Mr Heseltine emphasised the debit side of motoring. The car was a major contributor to pollutant emissions and caused deaths and injuries and disruption due to congestion. 'More and better public transport will come,' he said. Recent budgets, he said, had increased vehicle fuel duties ahead of inflation and substantially reduced tax incentives for company cars. 'All told, we should certainly not be banking on cheaper motoring costs for the future.'</p>

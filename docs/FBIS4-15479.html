			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- "The invigoration of Russia's  role in the Middle East and recent intensive contacts by Russian  diplomacy in that region of the world are connected with the  critical situation into which it has been plunged by the tragic  events in Hebron that claimed the lives of dozens of  Palestinians," the Russian President's Envoy to the Middle East  Viktor Posuvalyuk said.    Speaking at a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry Press  Centre in Moscow on Thursday, Posuvalyuk said that some Russian  and foreign media reports have distorted the reasons for  Moscow's growing role in the Middle East. He stressed that its  main aim is to save the peace process and facilitate the  resumption of the PLO-Israeli and Arab-Israeli talks.    The envoy said considerable progress has been reached in  this  sphere. Palestinians and Israelis resumed talks in Cairo. Work  is underway to prepare talks between Israel and Arabs. He  denied that the peace process has acquired some element of  competitiveness with the United States. The Middle East theme  will continue to dominate our foreign policy, he added.    He admitted that there have been disruptions in the work of  the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, but they were  not caused by malicious intent of either side. This is a new  business on which no textbooks have been written yet. The  co-sponsors must act extremely carefully while looking for ways  of reaching peace between Arabs and Israelis, he said.    Posuvalyuk did not deny that the U.S. and Russia are  pursuing  their own interests in the region, but added that this should  not affect their efforts to help restore peace in the Middle  East.    He said that Russian and American officials will hold  consultations in Washington to attain a greater degree of  coordination in their joint work.</p>

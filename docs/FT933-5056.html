			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Tyre-burning power station set to operate EUROPE'S FIRST power station fuelled by waste tyres starts preliminary operations in Britain this week, which when complete will enable it to generate electricity by burning more than 8m tyres a year. The West Midlands plant, employing 60 people, expects to burn 23 per cent of Britain's waste tyres in its first year of operation. The project is the latest waste-to-energy scheme under a contract with the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency, which encourages alternatives to coal-fired power. The contract allows Elm Energy - a US joint venture between utility group Nipsco and the tyre company Performance Services Corporation - to supply power to 25,000 homes in the Midlands region. If pre-production tests this week are successful, the company intends to build another plant at East Kilbride in Scotland and to seek a suitable site in the south-east. Elm says the power station at Wolverhampton will be the cleanest in the UK, pointing to Pounds 48m of equipment and plant installed to ensure that emissions are well below maximum levels set by the World Health Organisation. Mrs Anne Evans, managing director, said that unlike fossil fuels, waste tyres contain only low levels of carbon and none of the dioxins which lead to greenhouse gases. 'This new technology is not an environmental problem. Our emissions are between one hundred thousandth and one billionth of the allowable limits,' she said. Potentially harmful by-products of burning tyres are to be recycled. The tyre industry will buy back zinc oxide, steel particles will be sold for scrap, and calcium sulphate used for building materials. Once purified, steam from the plant's generators will be transformed into electricity by a 35 megavoltamp turbogenerator. Midlands Electricity will supply the power to domestic users. Tyre distributors including subsidiaries of Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear have signed contracts with Elm Energy.</p>

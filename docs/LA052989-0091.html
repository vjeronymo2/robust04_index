			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 PATRONS INJURED AS GUNMEN OPEN FIRE IN BILLIARD HALL  </P> <P> Vinh Pham was playing billiards Saturday night at the Kien Giang Billiard hall  in Orange when the two men with guns walked in.  </P> <P> "One held a gun up and pointed it at us, and said, 'Move,' " recalled Pham, 23,  who was among more than 20 patrons in the hall just off busy West Chapman  Avenue.  </P> <P> Within minutes, the two gunmen robbed one man of $700, started pistol-whipping  patrons and then opened fire into the crowd, injuring four men, two of them  seriously, according to police and witnesses.  </P> <P> Two of the injured were treated and released at area hospitals, and two  remained hospitalized. Both are expected to recover from their wounds.  </P> <P> Police said the incident did not appear to be gang- or race-motivated. "As far  as we're concerned, it's just another robbery," Orange Police Sgt. John Richard  said.  </P> <P> Police are not sure what prompted the gunmen to start shooting. Pham said he  thinks that the men, who were not Vietnamese, may have gotten skittish when two  customers entered the billiard hall during the robbery.  </P> <P> Pham said that one of the gunmen also became irritated after patrons ignored  his order to move to a wall, struck Pham in the back of the head and then  pistol-whipped another customer before both men started shooting.  </P> <P> Pham, who spent Sunday at the billiard hall nursing a bump on his head, said  that the first gunman seemed irritated.  </P> <P> "He kept shouting, 'I said, MOVE, man!' And we all started to walk toward the  back," Pham said.  </P> <P> But as Pham joined the others, the first gunman walked toward him, lifted his  handgun and struck him in the back of the head, toppling Pham to the floor  beneath a billiard table.  </P> <P> "That's where I stayed. I was scared," Pham said.  </P> <P> The robber moved to another customer and pistol-whipped him, battering him  enough that he required hospital treatment, Orange Police Sgt. Bob Gustafson  said.  </P> <P> But as the customers were huddled together, both men began firing in rapid  succession, shooting at least six times, according to witnesses.  </P> <P> On Sunday, bullet holes were evident near a rear office table and along the  wall where a bullet ripped into wood paneling.  </P> <P> The robbery is the first time that an incident involving a shooting has  occurred at the billiard hall, which has been open 2 years, said manager Vo  Lap, 22.  </P> <P> Lap, who was not working Saturday night, said the hall is owned by an older  brother who was out of town on vacation.  </P> <P> The hall, which has about 10 tables, is in the rear of a small shopping mall  adjacent to a residential area.  </P> <P> A neighbor who was in her house Saturday at the time of the attack said she  heard about seven "very fast popping noises" but thought they were fireworks.  </P> <P> Injured were Asari Mohamed, 20, with a gunshot wound to the back; Hoa Danh, 25,  gunshot wound to the hand; Hung Manh Lee, 18, gunshot wound to the right  shoulder, and a 17-year-old juvenile, gunshot wound to the right leg.  </P> <P> Lee was listed in good condition at UCI Medical Center. Danh was listed in good  condition at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange.  </P> <P> Mohamed and the unidentified juvenile were both treated and released from area  hospitals.  </P> <P> Another customer, Umo Hossen, 21, who was struck in the head with a gun barrel,  was treated and released from Western Medical Center in Santa Ana.  </P></p>

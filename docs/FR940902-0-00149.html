Justification for decisions may be referenced but need not be recorded in the ISS. These decisions shall include, but are not limited to, the employment goal and/or career cluster; referrals to other programs for specified activities; the provision and amount of supportive services; and the delivery agents and schedules for training and supportive services activities. The decisions for time and duration of OJT (&sect;627.240 of this chapter) shall be briefly recorded in the ISS and may not reference other documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The ISS is a customer-centered case management tool and shall not be used as a compliance document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;628.525  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neither eligibility for nor participation in a JTPA program creates an entitlement to services, and nothing in the Act or this part shall be construed to establish a private right of action for a participant to obtain services described in the objective assessment or ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;628.530  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Referrals of participants to non-title II programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) When it is determined, through the objective assessment and the ISS, that a participant would be better served by a program other than one under title II ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Job Corps, Vocational Rehabilitation, State or local education, substance abuse treatment center, and/or dislocated worker programs), the participant shall be referred to the appropriate program. Such referral shall be recorded in the ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In cases where there will be a continuing relationship with a participant, a referral to another program(s) for specific services will be part of the participant's title II program strategy and will be recorded in the ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When there will not be a continuing relationship with a participant as the result of a referral to a program other than title II, and an assessment but no training component has been provided, the referral should be recorded in a partial ISS and the individual shall not be counted for purposes of calculating performance against the SDA's performance standards. Further tracking or follow-up of referrals out of title II is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;628.535  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations on job search assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Job search assistance is designed to give a participant skills in acquiring full time employment. (See &sect;626.5 of this chapter, Definitions.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Job search activities may be conducted only:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For participants when specified as appropriate in the ISS; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When delivered in conjunction with other training or educational services designed to increase the participant's ability to acquire employment.

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Police chiefs win power on budgets The government is to give police chiefs more say over the way in which their budgets are allocated, even before the police bill has become law. The Home Office has told chief constables starting to prune middle-ranking jobs that their proposals on how to spend the money saved will gain automatic approval from next April. Technically, police forces need permission to raise staffing levels above their authorised quotas under rules likely to be swept away from April 1995 under the government's police reforms. The Home Office's move should in effect remove these controls a year early. The reduction in middle-ranking positions may lead to an increase in overall police numbers because ministers want forces to use the money they save to recruit more officers on the beat. But chief constables will have discretion to use savings to buy new equipment or invest in more crime prevention.</p>

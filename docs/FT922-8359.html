			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Midland chief eases Hong Kong fears over offer - The Battle For Midland A PRESENTATION yesterday by Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, to Hong Kong's investment community has left a growing sense that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for Midland can succeed and that it would benefit the banking group. Fund managers had expected few revelations. But Mr Pearse provided reassurance to HSBC shareholders in his commitment to the merger and his view that the counter-bid by Lloyds Bank stood little chance of passing the scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'If the exercise was designed to get Hongkong Bank shareholders to look at this deal favourably, then I think they achieved this purpose', said one research director who attended the meeting. There had been considerable initial scepticism towards the deal from Hong Kong investors. They were opposed to the dilution of high growth south-east Asian earnings through the acquisition of a European bank. Suspicions remain as to the benefits of global banking. 'The arrival of Pearse has helped develop an understanding of Midland by Hong Kong investors. It also shows he is keen and it shows he gets on well with the Hongkong Bank', said Mr Peter Philips, portfolio manager at Fidelity International Investment Management. I can't think there will be enough opposition to block it. Given the dispersion of shareholdings, if there was any opposition we would have felt the groundswell by now.' Fund managers said the meeting provided reassurance that Midland's earnings cycle was in a strong recovery phase, while Lloyds Bank's interest in Midland had already helped persuade analysts that HSBC could be on to a good deal. The HSBC share price reacted favourably to the Pearse presentation, climbing 25 cents to HKDollars 44.50. The main concern in Hong Kong remains the possibility of the bank being forced to sweeten its offer. This will clearly depend on the existence of concrete alternative bidders. But analysts took encouragement from the comments of Mr John Gray, HSBC's deputy chairman, who also attended the meeting. He would not discuss the possibility of a higher offer, but pointed out that such a move would be likely to hurt the HSBC share price. This would lower the value of the offer for Midland, which has now risen to 422p,, compared with 378p when the offer was announced on April 14.</p>

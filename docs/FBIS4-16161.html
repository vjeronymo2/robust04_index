			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] In the opinion of Russia the NATO air strikes  against the positions of Bosnian Serbs in Gorazde were  unjustified. The statement was made on Wednesday in an  exclusive interview with Interfax by Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov who is the senior official at the ministry now  that Andrey Kozyrev is in Spain accompanying President Yeltsin.    Lavrov said that in the military sense the NATO air strikes  did not give anything, and in the political sense they sharply  worsened the situation. Besides, it should be found out whether  the NATO action caused human losses.    Lavrov spoke of the unproductiveness of regarding Russia as  an inferior partner of NATO. "This was proved by the situation  in Sarajevo and now though somewhat differently by Gorazde", he  said.    According to the deputy minister, the situation must be  saved  after the NATO air attacks. This can be done only through  concerted efforts, he said.    Lavrov stressed that last Monday the UN Security Council  held  a session called for by Russia to discuss the situation. "The  first report of the Security Council secretariat about the  developments in Gorazde was submitted. It was clearly  fragmentary and incomplete. We were not satisfied with it and we  expect exhaustive information", the diplomat said.    According to him, the Security Council met again on Tuesday.  "At the initiative of Russia it adopted a call to Bosnian  Muslims to stop the shelling. Russia again demanded information  from the secretariat about the way the procedure required by  Security Council resolutions was applied and what concrete  targets were attacked", Lavrov said. Besides, Russia suggested  that the Security Council take steps to implement the April 6  declaration concerning a safe zone in Gorazde which implies the  demilitarization of the area, the sending of a UN force, the  withdrawal of Serbian artillery and the disarmament of Muslim  armed groups.    He recalled that last June the Security Council passed a  number of resolutions permitting the use of force in  ex-Yugoslavia to prevent attacks on peace-keepers and the UN  personnel and violations of the no-flight zone over  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In such cases the UN secretary general can  request interested countries and regional organizations to  support the UN force and resist the violations. The procedure of  using force proposed by the secretary general in his report on  July 14, 1993 was approved. Lavrov stressed that under the  resolution the secretary general can made a decision on the use  of force after consulting Security Council members. The report  was discussed by the Security Council and approved in the first  clause of resolution No. 844.    According to Lavrov, the procedure providing for compulsory  consultations with Security Council members was the main  condition of Russia's approval of the resolution. "The  resolution must be observed. This equally applies to countries  that are targets of tough sanctions and Security Council  members, the secretary general, the secretariat. We are  bringing the idea home to our partners in the Security Council  and the secretary general", the diplomat said.    The deputy minister said that a high-ranking official from  the Russian mission in Geneva Valeriy Loshchinin met there with  Butrus- Ghali and "told him everything". "We did not get  exhaustive answers to our concerns", he said.    Asked whether Russia is going to submit the draft of a more  binding Security Council resolution Lavrov said that the whole  gamut of sentiments at the council should be taken into account.  Many Security Council members, in particular non-aligned  countries, view the Serbs as the only aggressors and constantly  call for one-sided actions against them. Lately only Russia  with the feeble support of two or three countries has been  resisting resolutions that would declare a Security Council  ultimatum to Serbs throughout Bosnia, lift the Security Council  embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims and expel Serbs from all  international organizations.    According to Lavrov, Russia is not turning a blind eye on  the  fact that before the air attacks the Serbs violated Security  Council resolutions. "According to some reports, 30 people were  killed and 100 wounded in the Serbian shelling. This must be  double-checked. We demand that the Serbs stop such actions. But  they should not be attacked alone. It is clear that the current  situation around Gorazde was provoked by the Muslims while the  Serbs reacted inadequately. If the world community chooses one  side as the scapegoat, this will lead to what President Yeltsin  has described as an eternal war", Lavrov said.    Asked whether Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev would go to  ex-  Yugoslavia -- a fact not ruled out by President Yeltsin in his  speech in Madrid -- Lavrov said that Moscow would want to get  detailed reports from the Russian presidential envoy in the  conflict zone Vitaliy Churkin first. "Churkin is engaged in  virtually round- the-clock negotiations with the conflicting  sides and the United Nations. Unfortunately, it is not always  possible to be in touch with him as he constantly moves from one  place to another", the diplomat said.    Moscow is alarmed by the fact that the support of many  Western leaders for the use of force in Gorazde might lead to  reliance on force in Bosnian and international affairs in  general. The feeling is expressed in a statement of a Russian  Foreign Ministry spokesman circulated in Moscow on Wednesday.    He said the NATO headquarters is reportedly discussing new  ultimatums to the Serbs in circumvention of the United Nations.  "This road is unacceptable for us, instead we pursue a policy of  true partnership and practical cooperation for the sake of  stability and security", the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Cheap tickets to ride - Nick Garnett finds a company that flies in the face of recession SO YOU are a small company set up in the 1970s and employing just 15 people when recession strikes at the end of 1989. What happens? In the case of Hamilton Travel, turnover since 1989 has jumped fivefold to Pounds 15m and the workforce now numbers 60. As the economy's green shoots of growth turn brown, Hamilton expects revenue of around Pounds 25m by next year. John Ansell is the majority stakeholder in the London company, which sells 'low cost' tickets on scheduled flights. When the economy is going through a mini-boom and the scheduled carriers are selling almost every ticket they have at face value, Ansell is not all that popular with them. But when airlines struggle to fill their planes, Ansell and his company come into their own. 'Airlines use us as a marketing arm,' Ansell says. 'They turn the tap on and turn it off. They use us in bad times to help fill their planes but won't give us much volume in good times.' Hamilton, which so far operates only to European destinations, makes a gross average profit of just 10 per cent on the tickets it sells. But since it is selling around 1,000 a day, that adds up to several hundred thousand pounds net profit a year. This is reeled in by young men and women booking flights on 50 computer screens in a nondescript office behind a nondescript door in a side street of the capital's West End. The world of discount tickets and so-called 'bucket shops' is a murky one which the airlines are reluctant - some might say frightened - to talk about and Ansell also is reluctant to discuss individual airlines. But Hamilton actually deals with 29 carriers. British Airways is widely perceived to be the market leader in offloading discount tickets, although companies such as Lufthansa and SAS have followed suit. The industry believes that more than half the revenue of companies such as Hamilton comes from BA tickets. Ansell denies that Hamilton - which claims to be the UK's largest supplier of discounted scheduled air fares - is a bucket shop. In fact, 80 per cent of its business - which is solely in the leisure market - is supplying wholesale tickets to travel agents. 'Carriers want some central agency like us to help do this so they can keep some control on it and ensure quality of service,' Ansell says. 'The last thing scheduled airlines want is to dilute their margins on business travel.' That is why a business class return to Nice on Air France is Pounds 568 and a 14-day Apex lowest published fare (LPF) Pounds 215 - but a low season Hamilton ticket is Pounds 120. Some low-cost business fares do circulate, but they are difficult to find. In some ways, though, Hamilton does operate like a super bucket shop clearing house. The supply of low-cost tickets works like this. An airline employs people called yield controllers whose job is to maximise its revenue from ticket sales day by day. On their computer screens are a series of price-related ticket classes which mean nothing to most travellers and very little to most travel agents. Yield controllers move tickets in and out of these classes as dictated by shifting demand. Hamilton negotiates the right to buy tickets from, say, class L, on a particular airline at an agreed fare. It can extract tickets only from that class and there is no allocation; Hamilton buys a ticket only when it has been sold. The airlines bill the company once a month. Thus, Hamilton has no inventory. This helps keep costs down and wages are modest: a ticket booker earns a flat Pounds 9,000 a year although this can rise to Pounds 16,000 with bonuses. Up to last month, travel agents had always obtained tickets from Hamilton by 'phone, but a new computer system introduced by the company now allows them to look into Hamilton's software system and book tickets using their own visual display terminals. Hamilton has just sent out information packs on this to all 7,500 members of ABTA. Unlicenced bucket shops can still buy tickets from Hamilton, but not through the automatic computer system. Issuing discount tickets is well organised; Hamilton distributes its own 20-page fare booklet to travel agents. As a mark of the airlines' paranoia over offloading tickets in the discount market, they are identified by code numbers rather than names. Underlining this element of secrecy, the airlines exert some control on Hamilton's advertising. You might end up with an Aer Lingus or Iberia ticket, but you will not see those names in Hamilton advertising. Only 20 per cent of Hamilton's turnover comes from direct sales to the public, something it started only at the beginning of this year. Ansell would like this to rise to 80 per cent, lowering the share of wholesale ticketing for travel agents to just a fifth. The reason is simple. 'The more direct sales we have to the public, the more leverage we have with the airlines. The boot would be on the other foot. We could go to the airlines and say: 'We'll do the honour of selling your tickets if you sell them to us at good rates'.' That is one reason why Ansell wants to get into long-haul flights. 'Because of the size of retail operations, these effectively have a headlock on the airlines. In long haul, the big retailers dictate to the airlines.' The other reason is that when (or if) the good times return, Hamilton Travel will again find itself starved of short-haul discount tickets by the carriers. Of course, the price of a discounted ticket is only relative. To an American, a 55-minute flight from England to Ireland still looks like daylight robbery at Pounds 110.

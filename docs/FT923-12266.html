			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Ucatt to reform voting and finance UCATT, the construction union, is to reform completely its system of electing officials and controlling its finances. The decision follows a year-long internal inquiry by Mr John Hand QC, who found that the existing electoral systems were open to abuse. Financial controls were found to be loose and, in certain respects, negligent. The investigation started after a change of control of the union's executive last year. The union has already changed its bank and auditors since Mr George Brumwell took over as the general secretary in February, and a fresh investigation is to be mounted into missing financial reports. The union is to appoint a professional general manager for the first time and a new system of scrutinising expense claims and monitoring budgets is to be introduced. The report concluded that allegations against named individuals could not be proven. It was highly critical of irregularities and an absence of natural justice in the conduct of the union's proceedings. Among the recommendations to be considered by Ucatt's general council on Thursday is that 'those charged with the leadership of the union make it clear that electoral irregularity and/or malpractice will not be tolerated'. The report also recommends 'that the union seeks to uphold the general principles of natural justice when taking any disciplinary action against members or officials'. Central to the reforms, which will be considered by an emergency rules revision conference will be the method of installing the union's officials. Mr Brumwell said yesterday: 'I am glad this report is now out. It gives us the chance to bury the wrongdoings of the past and make a new beginning under new management. I am determined that Ucatt will become the most open, democratic and effective union in the TUC.'</p>

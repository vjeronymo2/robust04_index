			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Leading Article: City regulation SOME TIME over the next two months, responsibility for overseeing the UK's investment markets and financial services companies will pass from the department of trade and industry to the Treasury. The switch has been presented as a rationalisation of financial regulation: it looks suspiciously half-baked. The DTI's record on financial regulation has been poor. Before the Financial Services Act came into force, it failed to prevent investment disasters like Barlow Clowes and Norton Warburg. Since the act, it has presided over a fragmented system of investment regulation based on an uncomfortable blend of statutory prescription and self-regulation. Unfortunately, the Treasury has also failed to cover itself with glory in this department. Successive chancellors were kept informed about the Bank of England's concerns over Bank of Credit and Commerce International without prompting tougher action  - though the ultimate responsibilty for banking regulation rests with the Bank. There is no reason in principle why the Treasury should make a better job of supervising the financial services sector than the DTI. Secretive and haughty by nature, it lacks the DTI's experience of consumer-related matters and would be a less effective guardian of the interests of small investors. On the plus side, the switch will allow a single government department to negotiate in Brussels over the regulation of Europe's financial markets at a crucial moment in their history, as Europe moves towards monetary union and London faces mounting challenges from other financial centres. But too many questions remain unaddressed. How can financial conglomerates be properly regulated, if the responsibility for insurance companies remains with the DTI? How can the fight against fraud be made more effective, if the present disjointed system for investigating financial malpractice is left untouched? Should the Securities and Investments Board, the top investment watchdog, be strengthened, or should the UK opt instead for European-style dominance by banking regulators? And is it right for one government department to be responsible both for protecting investors and promoting the interests of the investment industry? Clear policy thinking on these matters is needed, not a piecemeal shuffling of responsibilities between ministers.</p>

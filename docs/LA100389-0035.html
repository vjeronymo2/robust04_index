			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROTESTERS' BID TO BAN POLICE HOLD FAILS  </P> <P> Six anti-abortion activists, who allege that they were hurt during Operation  Rescue protests at two women's clinics, were denied a federal injunction that  sought to prevent the Los Angeles Police Department from using so-called pain  compliance holds in making arrests at demonstrations.  </P> <P> In denying the request, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said that the  protesters' constitutional right to freedom from unreasonable seizure was not  violated, as they had claimed. Noting that the activists had used passive  resistance during the arrests, Tashima said that under California law, police  may use "reasonable force" to make an arrest.  </P> <P> He added that the plaintiffs could file damage suits against individual  officers if they felt they had been abused. Samuel Casey, executive director  for the Rutherford Institute, which represented the activists, said state law  allows police to use as much force as needed but not to inflict pain.  </P> <P> The activists were among 700 arrested during a blockade at Family Planning  Associates Clinic on Westmoreland Avenue in March, and at a similar protest in  June at Midland Medical Clinic on West Washington Boulevard. About 300  activists were arrested at the June protest.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the activists said the group plans to appeal.  </P></p>

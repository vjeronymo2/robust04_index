			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mobile phones market surges Cellnet, the second-largest mobile phone operator, has passed the million subscriber mark with net new connections growing at twice the rate of a year ago. Vodafone - the largest operator, with more than 1.1m subscribers - is reporting similar growth. Last month it had 58,000 gross new connections. After record growth in the run-up to Christmas, Cellnet had expected a sharp slow-down in new connections but it is projecting a gross 70,000 new subscribers for this month, only a small decline from 84,000 in December. By the end of this month Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, will have added a net 110,000 subscribers to its network since the beginning of January compared with 56,000 in the first three months of last year. Most analysts attributed the rapid growth at the end of last year to sharp tariff cuts, a fall in the price of handsets, a pre-Christmas rush and the launch in September of Mercury One-2-One, a third operator offering free calls at evenings and weekends inside the M25 area. Mr Bob Warner, Cellnet managing director, predicted that total UK cellular subscriber numbers would reach 3m by the end of the year, up from 2m at the end of 1993. 'Two years ago we were adding cellular customers at the rate of 2,000 a month; now it is 2,000 a day,' he said. The continued boom points to strong underlying growth, however, in particular from the entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market. The launch next month of Orange, the UK's fourth cellular network, is expected to boost the market further. Orange, a joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, will cover 90 per cent of the population by the middle of next year. Management, Page 16</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / People: Developments at Supasnaps DIXONS is famous for selling the latest electronic gizmos through its Dixons and Currys retail outlets but is less well known for running the Supasnaps chain of film processing stores. There is good reason for this; Dixons has traditionally remained pretty quiet about the performance of its 354-store Supasnaps chain which has proved lacklustre in recent years. This week, however, the parent company has moved to reshuffle Supasnaps senior management. Colin Glass, 35, managing director of Supasnaps, has been elevated to the post of chairman and will also join the Dixons Stores Group board as marketing director. 'I will be focusing on developing the Dixons and Currys brand propositions and where they stand on the high street,' he says. His position at Supasnaps is filled by Elizabeth Fagan, 34, previously responsible for the company's buying and marketing functions. She joined Supasnaps from Boots in 1990. ***** Trevor Murch has been appointed managing director of NEI Parsons, the Newcastle-based subsidiary of Northern Engineering Industries, designing and manufacturing turbine generators for power stations. An engineering science graduate from Brasenose College, Oxford, and a Harvard MBA, Murch, 42, is currently president of Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba, also part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power division. He was previously managing director of NEI Peebles, the Edinburgh-based producers of power and distribution transformers. ***** Anette Lawless has been appointed company secretary of PEARSON on the retirement of George Collett. ***** Robert Hawley, managing director of Northern Engineering Industries within the Rolls Royce Industrial Power Group, has been appointed chief executive of Nuclear Electric from June 15. Frank Ledger, deputy chairman, retires at the end of June. Brian George, chief executive of the pressurised water reactor group, becomes executive director of planning and construction on the retirement of Sam Goddard. ***** Gordon McGlone, previously md of Beverlac Fine Foods, is appointed commercial director of Elkes Biscuits of Uttoxeter, part of NORTHERN FOODS. ***** John Fleming has been appointed operations director of The MAYFLOWER CORPORATION; Geoffrey Codrington takes his place as md Ribbons, a Mayflower subsidiary; he moves from Bendix Safety Restraints. ***** Marie Blackburn has been promoted to group company secretary of ARGOS.</p>

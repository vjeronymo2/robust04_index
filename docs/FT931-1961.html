			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Some neat financial engineering designed primarily to raise equity - A look at the latest batch of targeted share schemes TARGETED shares have recently hit the headlines as some of the big US corporations, including RJR Nabisco and Ralston Purina, unveiled plans to introduce the catchily-named stock. However, these shares, designed to reflect the fortunes of a portion of a company's business rather than that of the group as a whole, are not exactly new. The best-known scheme was introduced at USX in 1991. Mr Carl Icahn, the financier-cum-greenmailer, had acquired a 13.3 per cent stake in the Pittsburgh-based company and was agitating for a full demerger of USX's steel and energy interests. In February 1991, USX responded with a targeted stock plan, which offered one group of shares pegged to the steel business's performance and one to its energy assets, notably Marathon Oil. USX subsequently added a third class of shares, called USX-Delhi, to reflect the natural gas unit's performance. The scheme duly bought peace, and Mr Icahn sold his stake shortly afterwards. Even USX had forerunners. General Motors, for example, has long offered a set of Series E shares, which reflect the performance of its EDS subsidiary, and another set of Series H shares, which mirror the performance of its Hughes Electronics business. Nevertheless, targeted stocks have been receiving increased attention, largely because of the activities of big consumer products groups. RJR Nabisco announced plans earlier this month for two classes of shares reflecting, in turn, the group's food and tobacco interests. A few weeks earlier, Ralston Purina, trying to separate out its large but lacklustre Continental Baking division from its other consumer products operations, substituted a targeted stock scheme for a full demerger plan. Disgruntled bondholders at Marriott Corporation have suggested a targeted stock scheme would be a better option than the highly-contentious spin-off proposed by the hotel and food services group. And there has even been talk that IBM might adopt a targeted stock plan, although the company maintains this is highly speculative. Mr Ronald Gallatin, the managing director at Lehman Brothers who devised the USX scheme and has been involved with many of the subsequent initiatives, maintains that 'any company where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole', but where multiple spin-offs are not feasible, could be suited to a targeted stock scheme. The obvious attraction of targeted stocks is that they focus attention on the progress being made by individual divisions. In theory, this addresses the problem complained of by some conglomerates - that relatively successful businesses are dwarfed by problems elsewhere in the group. Second, management incentives can be aimed more specifically, a factor behind the separate GM stock series. And finally, capital can be raised by the sale of new securities pegged to the more attractive elements of a group's overall business. RJR Nabisco, for example, expects to garner about Dollars 1.5bn from the initial flotation of shares pegged to its food division. Ralston's chairman, Mr William Stiritz, has claimed the plan will 'increase flexibility with regard to future capital raising requirements and acquisition opportunities'. However, it is obvious these same advantages would flow from a full demerger. Targeted stock schemes tend to come into play when there are obstacles to legally dividing a company's operations - because of liabilities (including debt obligations) faced by the group as whole, or for tax or administrative reasons. Mr Gallatin cites three considerations which may render the targeted stock approach more suitable than a demerger: economies of scale derived from keeping the businesses under one administrative umbrella, economies of insurance (if, for example, the company self-insures), and where there are tax drawbacks to a demerger. RJR is a case in point. Following the record-breaking Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, the company conducted a speedy disposal programme and has engaged in a string of refinancings and capital restructurings. However, it has struggled to galvanise its two core operating businesses - the food group, where products range from Planters nuts to Oreo cookies, and the cigarette business. The cloud hanging over the latter has been particularly dark of late. Cigarette consumption has been on a declining trend for years in the large US domestic market, and possible tax increases by the Clinton administration threaten to accelerate the trend. Within the shrinking market, a rise in the popularity of discount cigarettes is undermining the position of higher-margin, full-priced brands, including Phillip Morris's Marlboro and RJR Nabisco's Winston and Salem. The costs of defending these products are rising. Under these domestic pressures, operating profits from RJR's tobacco business fell in 1992 to Dollars 2.69bn from Dollars 2.73bn in 1991. The food division managed an operating profit advance to Dollars 947m from Dollars 920m. But a full demerger of RJR Nabisco is viewed as impossible - not least because the problem of tobacco litigation. Like all tobacco manufacturers, RJR faces liability suits. Removing a substantial portion of the group's assets from the potential line of fire via a conventional spin-off, would not pass muster. Investors in the group's debt securities would scarcely cheer, either. Unfortunately, the appeal of a targeted stock scheme - the fact that there is no legal division of assets - is its weakness. Such plans can smack of window dressing, and yield relatively little benefit in share price terms. Shares in RJR Nabisco, for example, have barely budged on the back of the targeted stock announcement. 'A bit of neat financial engineering designed primarily to raise new equity, with the secondary benefit of somewhat sheltering shareholders from tobacco's legal and psychological risk,' was how analysts at Oppenheimer described the announcement. They concluded that there was little in the transaction for shareholders.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIRELESS WATCHERS LOOK FOR SHOPLIFTERS  </P> <P> Anne Droid looks like a typical mannequin, except for an unusual twinkle in one  eye. That twinkle means Anne Droid can "see" you. She can also "hear" and even  "remember."  </P> <P> Anne Droid is a surveillance mannequin designed to watch for shoplifters, an  idea that has caught the eye of some retailers.  </P> <P> "My wife is a jeweler," says F. Jerry Gutierrez, Anne Droid's creator. "We were  in a jewelry store and they had a TV monitor set up, but I couldn't find the  camera. Then the jeweler showed me this tiny thing, and I thought, 'My God,  that would fit in a mannequin.' "  </P> <P> At the time, Gutierrez's job was to restore mannequins -- a business he started  when he was laid off as a carpenter.  </P> <P> Now, the 40-year-old Gutierrez has designed a line of mannequins with built-in  cameras and microphones, which he hopes business owners will use to fight  shoplifting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Miniature Camera  </P> <P> Gutierrez inserts a miniature camera behind a mannequin eye, and the image is  projected on a monitor that can be viewed privately. For sound, a microphone is  placed in one nostril. Everything the mannequin sees or hears can be recorded  on videotape.  </P> <P> "It's got a perspective no other surveillance system has," said Eric Freehling,  who owns Odyssey Jewelry and Watch Out Watches in Denver.  </P> <P> He said when he first heard about Gutierrez's mannequins he was interested only  in getting one for his store.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a heck of an idea," Freehling says. "Then I realized he  didn't have as much of a business background as he needed to get off the  ground. With my CPA background and a lot of experience in retail, I told him  I'd see if I could help."  </P> <P> A partnership developed, as did a spinoff from the mannequin restoration  business called Anne Droid Security Systems. Freehling pitched in $115,000 to  help launch it.  </P> <P> Basic security mannequins cost about $2,400, not including extras like a  time-lapse VCR, Gutierrez said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Television Watcher  </P> <P> "One gentleman travels a lot, and he wants to have a male mannequin that would  'watch' television to give the appearance someone is home," he said. "If that  wasn't a deterrent the mannequin would double as security for him" by recording  anyone entering the room.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said he has an order for 10 mannequins from a major Denver retailer  but wouldn't give the company's name and did not say how many he's sold  altogether.  </P> <P> "This is covert surveillance," he explained. "Some businesses don't want the  customers to know they are being watched."  </P> <P> Shoplifting and employee theft cost the nation $508 billion annually, said  Detective Gail Riddell, who heads the Denver police shoplifting unit.  </P> <P> "I think it's an interesting idea," said Susan Henderson, owner of Bikboks, a  store in a tony Denver shopping district. She has ordered a male Anne Droid for  delivery in the fall and plans to use it for nighttime surveillance.  </P></p>

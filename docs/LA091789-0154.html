			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DERRING-DO IN A LAND WITHOUT SPICE;  </P> <P> BRIGHTEN THE CORNER WHERE YOU ARE BY FRED CHAPPELL (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $15.95;  212 PP.)  </P> <P> His name is Joe Robert Kirkman. He is a science teacher at the Tipton high  school in the mountains of North Carolina and he is in big trouble.  </P> <P> Kirkman is a man who likes to push life, feel it completely, live it fully. He  delights in risks and challenge, in all that life is -- its great joys, its  telling tragedies, its promise and potential. Admirable characteristics, you  would think, especially for a high school science teacher, but Kirkman's  exuberance for life has gotten him, at last, into more trouble than he can  handle. Perhaps.  </P> <P> In this deeply felt, warm, and funny novel, Fred Chappell, one of the South's  and indeed the country's finest writers, introduces us to a character whose  passion for life, for the hardness of truth, changes not only his life, but the  lives of those around him.  </P> <P> Chappell's narrative, told by young Jess, Kirkman's son (Chappell readers will  remember Jess from the novel "I Am One of You Forever"), probes close to bone  and nerve, giving us a telling portrait not only of Joe Robert Kirkman, but of  life in the small mountain town of Tipton just at the end of World War II.  </P> <P> As this single day in the life of Kirkman unravels so does the life of Tipton,  in all its darkness and promise. Chappell, a master storyteller, weaves a  wonderful tale, one full of wild humor and honest humanity, all of it surfacing  in but a single day in a man's life.  </P> <P> It is, however, no ordinary day, but then Kirkman is no ordinary science  teacher. Besides being a teacher, Kirkman is a farmer, an outdoorsman,  something of a philosopher, and a most inventive and imaginative dreamer. In a  place "so lacking in spice," he is a man of "derring-do." Tipton, N.C., is a  town in need of a jolt of passion and Kirkman is just the man to deliver the  blow. Kirkman can feel it's time to make his mark on life: "His glory days were  coming. He could feel the bright glow of them on his face like a rising dawn."  </P> <P> Kirkman's less than traditional teaching methods, especially concerning his  handling of Darwin and the theory of evolution, have landed him in hot water  with the local school board which has called a special session. Kirkman is to  appear before them, explain himself. But things aren't going well for Kirkman.  His day and his life seem star-struck. The day begins with Kirkman in the deep  mountain night up a tree battling what he calls a devil-opossum (a bobcat) and  getting the worst of the encounter; saving a drowning child in Trivet Creek and  ruining his only suit in the process; meeting a ghost in the school's basement,  and trying to coax a philosophical goat off the high school's roof and losing.  And so on. By the time of his meeting with the school board, it seems Joe  Robert Kirkman is indeed doomed.  </P> <P> But sometimes things work out, even if it takes a little magic, and it does  here, but Chappell, a novelist and poet of great range and talent, handles it  with great humor and grace, making it magic of the best sort: not just  possible, but believable.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis A. Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The government will not negotiate  with international financial organizations to continue the  economic adjustment program imposed by Rafael Leonardo Callejas'  administration. It will instead present its own proposal, which  has been coordinated with different productive sectors.    The statement was made yesterday by Economy Minister Delmer  Urbizo Panting a few hours prior to talks with international  credit organizations, scheduled for today and tomorrow.    He added that the international representatives' visits will  involve preliminary negotiations where they will discuss the  terms for a negotiation and the possible results, to have an  overall idea and later notify all the groups.    "We must temper agreements reached by the previous  government  and the conditions (established with financial organizations) so  these do not have a violent impact on the Honduran people; if  they made credits contingent upon something, we will try to  reverse that," he said.    Referring to the increase in some staple product prices,  Urbizo Panting said that according to figures from the Central  Bank of Honduras, there was a 3 percent increase in February,  but it dropped in March, which proves it has been a moderate  increase.    The economy minister said agreements have been reached with  the private sector concerning price controls, a salary increase,  and the supply of assets and services.    He added that when the economic cabinet begins to discuss  the  scope of the measures with international organizations, the  cabinet will have to first reach an agreement with businessmen  so that they are fully aware of the situation.    The official said the government wants the national  community  to be aware of the possible results of the credit organizations'  plans and the state's position in the talks.    He emphasized that joint efforts must be exerted by all  national groups to face the challenge, not only of international  organizations but also the challenge resulting from a shortage  of products.</p>

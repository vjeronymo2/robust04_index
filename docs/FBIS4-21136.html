Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais has said that the  report  "does not accurately reflect" the Nicaraguan situation and that  "the U.S. State Department had told Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry  officials Nicaragua was not a country that caused concern"  regarding drug trafficking.    "Furthermore," it added, since the date of the report until  today, "Nicaragua has shown important progress in cooperating to  confront international narcotrafficking problems."    The U.S. document, to which BARRICADA gained access, states  the National Police has delayed the antidrug-trafficking  struggle and conducted its first operation, "jointly with the  DEA" in early 1994.    Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has recalled that  John  Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, had sent a letter  congratulating the police corps for its antidrug-trafficking  struggle.    The annual report also states "the extension and importance  of drug trafficking in Nicaragua is not fully known," but "there  are hardly any doubts Nicaragua's tremendous financial and  political problems make the country an obvious target" of  narcotrafficking.    A ranking police source has agreed that undoubtedly a large  amount of drugs passes through our country, air space, and  across our sea.    The source added: "Concerning Nicaragua, one cannot speak,  however, of official authorization of narcotrafficking flights  or official protection groups for cocaine-unloading operations."    The report has criticized Violeta de Chamorro's government  for not progressing as the United States wants "in fulfilling  the UN Convention of 1988, not passing new counternarcotics  laws, not adopting measures against government corruption, and  not progressing in bilateral and regional agreements signed in  previous years."    "It recognizes as facts, however, that Nicaragua is part of  the executive secretariat of the Central American Antinarcotics  Commission, that the Banco Central demands documents verifying  transactions exceeding $10,000, and that a counternarcotics  police unit has been created."    Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has said "there is no  evidence of money laundering in Nicaragua," as the U.S. State  Department claims.    A police source has agreed with Cesar. "We cannot certify  there is money laundering in Nicaragua." The source added the  police cannot conduct an investigation "as long as there is no  law authorizing us to do so."    Luis Humberto Guzman, National Assembly president, has said  that thus far, for lack of economic means, the legislative  branch has not conducted an investigation on money laundering.    He said: "If one examines the amount of financial activities  in Nicaraguan banks, we cannot speak of money laundering."    The U.S. report adds "although the Nicaraguan Government  promised in 1992 to present a law, according to the UN  Convention of 1988, it decided not to use any political capital  for it."    The report added Nicaraguan legislation on the topic is  "obsolete," because it defines the problem as a "health" problem.    The National Assembly has learned of a draft bill which,  because of its complex nature, is taking awhile. It is hoped  the law will be ready in eight weeks.    Guzman has said the U.S. State Department "has false  information" on the narcotrafficking situation in Nicaragua and  that the deputies are "doing what we must regarding this topic  (of narcotrafficking)."</p>

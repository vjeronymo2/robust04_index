			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Tales from the skin trade - Nick Garnett meets Angus Greenlees, who does chic things with chickens' feet 'WHEN WE had the shop people would come in wanting to buy something unusual. They would look around the eelskin range, examine some pieces made out of salmon skin and if they couldn't find want they wanted, as a last resort, we would say: 'Well, we have some things in chickens' feet.' They would either run out of the shop or turn round, like what they saw and buy it.' Angus Greenlees is in the skin trade. Exotic skin: wallets and shoes in eelskin, hip flasks in salmon skin, handbags in the skin and bone wrapping which envelops the stingray. No chinchilla, sable or mink in sight, but this year will see personal accessories in lizardskin-like chickens' feet covering and the snake look-alike pelt of the frog. 'People like the feel of natural leathers, but with most exotic skins you are encroaching on the environment,' Greenlees says. 'I am trying to create an alternative which doesn't offend people, using leathers people like the feel of, but can be assured that their use is not destroying a species or over-exploiting the environment. They are skins from creatures caught principally for food.' Using factories in South Korea and Thailand as well as Northamptonshire (for salmon skin products), Greenlees buys in a wide range of goods, from penholders and spectacle cases to belts and briefcases. They are all made out of the type of fishy hide that hardly comes first to mind when buying hubby's slippers or aunt Agatha's lipstick case. Environmentally friendly it might be, but putting Greenlees Leathers on a sound financial footing is proving more troublesome. Sales of Pounds 100,000 in 1990 rose to Pounds 120,000 last year, providing the company with a net profit of a few thousand pounds. Greenlees, its only employee, took a salary of about Pounds 10,000. Stocks are expensive to hold, the recession has badly hit the market and there is a larger competitor run by Greenlees' former partner, Michael Benjamin. Nevertheless, the 28-year-old agriculture graduate hopes to open a shop in central London this year, supplementing the mail order business he runs from his home. Benjamin had a shop in London selling eelskin products which Greenlees joined in 1989, the partnership breaking up the following year. When Greenlees Leathers was established, Greenlees put in Pounds 30,000 of his own money, mainly to purchase stock. He also arranged a bank overdraft facility of Pounds 15,000. Members of his family out in Thailand, where stingrays are farmed for food, supplied the names of companies using the soft but tough armour-plated skin  -which includes the ray's central jewel bone - to make purses, wallets, shimmering handbags and briefcases. The salmon skin is tanned in tonshire manufacturer provides Greenlees with flasks, jewel boxes, jewellery, wallets and waistcoats. A wide range of eelskin-covered products form the backbone of the company. The eel that is used is eptatretus bergeri, a primitive creature scavenging off dead creatures deep in the Pacific. The eels are caught in something similar to giant lobster pots and landed in South Korea. Slime is scraped off, they are then soaked in degreasing fluids and dropped into revolving vats with tanning chemicals and dyes. The eel's unique skin structure, with tiny latticed collagen fibres, provides stronger material than that of a calf but is one tenth as thick and with no smell. You would not know the smooth material was eel except for the giveaway marking, a few millimetres thick, which runs down the middle of the creature's back. Items made from sea animals are not cheap. An eelskin jacket wallet retails at Pounds 28, wholesale Pounds 11.50. An eelskin handbag retails at Pounds 108, wholesale Pounds 46. A briefcase made from the skins of four small stingrays costs Pounds 350 retail. For a lot of people, using the pelt of a slimy creature verges on the creepy. So who would buy things made from these unusual pelts? 'We are in the gift business', says Greenlees. 'We are not in the fashion business. For one thing that would involve holding too much stock. A lot of our customers are middle aged women buying for themselves or their husbands.' Stocks, which are held in a warehouse, can total Pounds 40,000. 'Stocks are what cripples me,' says Greenlees. To help defer the cost, Greenlees uses the credit facilities of his Korean manufacturers which charge interest of 9 per cent. Retail gross margins are 75 per cent on eelskin products, slightly less for salmon 'leather'. Establishing a comprehensive sales operation has proved a problem. Greenlees operates a mail order scheme with a client base of about 1,200 and uses agents paid on commission only. He also sells wholesale directly to shops and stores but this has proved an uphill battle. Setting up a dedicated retail outlet in London this year will be a significant step in hooking more customers, Greenlees argues. 'The biggest growth area will be sales to the retail trade and our own shop will help with that.' There are also plans to make special items for corporate purchases, such as pouches for a gift clock and mobile phone cases. The past year's growth has been 'disappointing', says Greenlees. 'It is just a question of keeping my head down and consolidating and growing the business. I may be disappointed but I am still here.' Greenlees Leathers, 43 Marney Rd, London SW11 5EW.

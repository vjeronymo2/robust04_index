			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Based on the quality of product lately, were I a stockholder in NBC, CBS or  ABC, I would demand an accounting and an apology. Even the most timid of  critics rates the best of the fall shows at the lower end of mediocrity. The  only fit viewing: returns, reruns and old movies. TV finally has descended to  its nadir in autumn '89. We hope it is the nadir, not the norm.  </P> <P> Carol Law, Leucadia  </P></p>

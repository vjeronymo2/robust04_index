			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLARD SETS SIGHTS ON SETTING HIS SIGHTS;  </P> <P> SHOOTING: AFTER REFINING HIS SKILL IN THE ARMY, HE TAKES A SHOT AT ANOTHER  OLYMPICS AND A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP.  </P> <P> Brian Ballard believes there is a formula for success in trap shooting:  </P> <P>  -- 90% visual skill -- the "instinctive" ability to point.  </P> <P>  -- 8% technique.  </P> <P>  -- 2% luck.  </P> <P> He said 98% should come easily for him at the 45th World Shooting Championships  in Moscow, U.S.S.R., next month. "Realistically, if I can go in there and have  that 2% luck for three days, I'll come back with a medal," Ballard said.  </P> <P> Luck is important in a sport in which the 4 1/4-inch width of a single flying  clay targetcan be the distance between top honors and middle of the pack.  </P> <P> Only three targets were the difference between the 1988 Olympic gold medalist,  who hit 195 of 200, and Ballard, who placed 12th.  </P> <P> Ballard, 29, began developing shooting skill and technique at age 8, when his  father in Cul-de-sac, Ida., taught him how to use a rifle.  </P> <P> Ballard began competing at 10, and after he graduated from Lewis-Clark College  in Lewiston, Ida., the Army gave him the opportunity to work full time on  refining his shooting skills with the Marksmanship Unit at Ft. Benning, Ga.  </P> <P> He stayed with the Marksmanship Unit -- the one responsible for training most  world-class American shooters -- for seven years, but left to avoid serving  overseas as an infantry staff sergeant.  </P> <P> His reputation as a trap shooter got him another job offer -- this time to  manage the Coto Valley Country Club Hunt Lodge in Coto de Caza.  </P> <P> Ballard believes just about anyone can develop some skill as a trap shooter.  </P> <P> "I can take anybody who has decent eyesight and decent hand-eye coordination  and make them into a recreational trap shooter." he said. The "mental game"  required of a world-class shooter, however, is a different matter.  </P> <P> Ballard's mental game has improved in recent years. He went into the last  25-target round of the '84 Olympic trials needing to hit 23 to make the team.  He hit 22. "Looking back on it, I was scared," he said. "I just choked."  </P> <P> But at the '88 trials, where Ballard found himself in a similar situation, he  was ready. "I remember I had a smile on my face when I walked out on the field  for the last round," he said. "I had been in that situation before and I knew I  could deal with it."  </P> <P> Ballard also finished second at the national championship in 1988, has shot on  five U.S. national teams and is the current California state champion.  </P> <P> Though he has made a livelihood of standing up to the pressure of competitive  trap shooting, Ballard said he is more comfortable hunting dove or giving  lessons at the lodge.  </P> <P> He said the ranges he competes at are "like my office."  </P> <P> "It's not all fun," Ballard said of the four months each year he spends  traveling to and participating in trap-shooting tournaments. "It is (fun,  sometimes) or I wouldn't be in it. But it's my job. . . . It's something I want  to excel in like anyone wants to excel at their livelihood.  </P> <P> "It's the competitiveness in me that keeps me doing it. It keeps me going."  </P> <P> The National Rifle Assn. is one of the governing bodies for U.S. trap shooting  and often uses competitive events to raise money to support political lobbying  against gun control.  </P> <P> Just by telling people what he does for a living, Ballard is often forced into  discussions he sometimes finds tiresome. "Of course I'm pro-gun," he said. "I'm  not into the politics that much. . . . Again, I'm just a competitor. I don't  think the politics should be involved in it. . . . I'm just a guy trying to  have some fun."  </P> <P> Off the shooting range, Ballard can let go of his competitive edge. "When I'm  hunting with my friends, if I miss a shot, I'll get ribbed a lot," he said.  "But I'll laugh right along with them."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.506 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Publication of award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> An award notice shall be posted on the NABB for seven (7) calendar days after posting, if the contract offers subcontracting opportunities or if it is subject to the Trade Agreement Act. The information required by (FAR) 48 CFR 5.207 shall be included in the award notice in abbreviated form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.507 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Debriefing of unsuccessful offerors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the procurement method used provides for a debriefing of unsuccessful offerors, the procedures applicable to that selection process shall be used in the debriefing. The procurement buying team member shall conduct debriefings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 1871.6_``Best Value Selection'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.601 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of MidRange procurements and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers. It eliminates the use of area evaluation factors and the highly structured scoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.602 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Specifications for MidRange procurements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BVS refines the traditional approach to preparing specifications. BVS envisions that the specification will focus on the end result that is to be achieved and will serve as a statement of the Government's baseline requirements. The offeror will be guided in meeting the Government's needs by a separate set of value characteristics which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer. These value characteristics will be performance based and will permit the selection of the offer which provides better results for a reasonable marginal increase in price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.603 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Establishment of evaluation criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The requiring organization will provide, along with the specification, a list of value characteristics against which the offers will be judged. There is no limit to the number or the type of characteristics that may be specified. The only standard will be whether the characteristic is rationally related to the need specified in the specification. Characteristics may include such factors as improved reliability, innovativeness of ideas, speed of service, demonstrated delivery performance, higher speeds, ease of use, qualifications of personnel, solutions to operating problems, level of service provided on previous similar contracts, or any of numerous other characteristics that may be of value to the Government in satisfying its needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Cost and technical will be considered equal in importance. The value characteristics will not be assigned weights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) All subsequent evaluations will consider these characteristics when determining the finalists or making the final selection for award. Additional characteristics, not listed in the RFO, shall not be used as a basis for discriminating among proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.604 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation phases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.604&hyph;1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Initial evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Offers will be reviewed to determine if all required information has been provided and the offeror has made a reasonable attempt to present an acceptable offer. Offerors may be contacted only for clarification purposes during the initial evaluation. No further evaluation shall be made of any offer that is deemed unacceptable because: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It does not represent a reasonable effort to address itself to the essential requirements of the RFO or clearly demonstrates that the offeror does not understand the requirements of the RFO; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonably be expected to cure; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In R&amp;D procurement, a substantial design drawback is evident in the offer and sufficient correction or improvement to consider the offer acceptable would require virtually an entirely new offer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Offerors determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their rejection and the reasons therefor and excluded from further consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If it is concluded that all offers are acceptable, then no documentation is required and evaluation proceeds. If one or more offers are not acceptable, the procurement member of the team will notify the offeror of the rejection and the reasons therefor. The documentation should consist of one or more succinct statements of fact that show the offer is not acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

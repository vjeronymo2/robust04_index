			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Apr (AFP) -- According to official  reports, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer today created a  military commission to enforce, "throughout the national  territory," the United Nations embargo on Haiti's military  government. The commission consists of the minister of the  Armed Forces and the chiefs of staff of the Army and the Navy.    The president's decree says the commission "is authorized to  request logistical and technical support from the United Nations  and its corresponding agencies to better fulfill the  commission's mission."    However, this decision by Balaguer, who always opposed the  embargo, seems to be a response to the demands of 48 U.S.  Democratic congressmen for a more active role in checking the  fuel contraband that "oxygenates" the Haitian military.  According to the Dominican press, fuel is smuggled through the  very same border checkpoints manned by the military.    A U.S. State Department official, during a visit less than a  month ago, clearly advised Balaguer to check this operation.  According to reports from Washington, the State Department  expects Balaguer to ask the United Nations for observers to help  Dominican troops watch the border to prevent the smuggling of  gasoline, diesel, and other products sent to the Haitian  military. Balaguer and his assistants oppose the embargo because  they think it harms the Haitian people more than it harms the  military who overthrew President Jean-Betrand Aristide.    It has been pointed out in official circles that, despite  Washington's firm position, the transactions between Haitian  businessmen and U.S. businessmen increased last year.    Analysts recall that Balaguer had hostile relations with  Aristide when the latter was president and that Aristide accused  Balaguer of permitting thousands of Haitian sugar cane cutters  working at Dominican sugar mills to be treated as "slaves."  Aristide even reported these lowly workers were denied the  right to go to their villages, where they lived in barracks-like  dwellings with no potable water, no electricity, and no social  assistance. Aristide also reported that these workers worked  more hours than allowed by Dominican law and that they worked  for extremely low salaries.    Balaguer reacted to these charges by ordering the sugar cane  cutters out of the country. The result was a "cooling" of  relations with Port-au-Prince. When Aristide was deposed in  September 1991, however, Santo Domingo accepted the Haitian  ambassador and others as exiles.    Months ago, Balaguer and Aristide formalized their  "rapprochement" when the ousted Haitian president visited Santo  Domingo.</p>

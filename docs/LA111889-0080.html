			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WAR OF THE WHITEFLY;  </P> <P> STRATEGIES: SCIENTISTS UNCORK THEIR BIOLOGICAL WEAPON AGAINST A PEST  INFESTATION. THEY'RE PITTING TINY WASPS AGAINST TINY FLIES.  </P> <P> Scientists launched the first attack in a biological war against the ash  whitefly Friday when they placed 60 tiny parasitic wasps in a San Fernando  Valley park.  </P> <P> Perched atop ladders in Encino's Balboa Sports Center, researchers reached into  nylon mesh bags that had been wrapped around branches of two infested trees and  uncorked several narrow, inch-long vials containing the predators.  </P> <P> "We've just taken a small step on a long journey," said Los Angeles County  Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy.  </P> <P> Scientists are hoping for marked progress by 1991 but say it will take up to  five years to bring the whitefly under control.  </P> <P> The gold and black wasps, imported from Israel, look like dust specks and are  about half the size of a pinhead. They do not sting humans and can only  multiply by laying their eggs within immature whiteflies. As the eggs develop,  the growing wasps consume their host from the inside out, said Larry Bezark, a  pest management specialist with the California Department of Food and  Agriculture.  </P> <P> The whitefly has invaded trees from the Mexican border to Sacramento since it  was first discovered at a Van Nuys fruit stand 14 months ago. Researchers fear  the pest, accidentally imported from Europe or the Middle East, could spread  through most of the state by next year because it has no natural enemies here.  </P> <P> "This is very serious," UC Riverside entomologist Tom Bellows said as he stood  beneath a tree infested with tens of thousands of whiteflies. "This is one of  the most serious infestations of a foreign insect in the last 10 years."  </P> <P> Friday's controlled release, coordinated by scientists at the University of  California, Riverside, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture,  is the first in a series of such test releases planned this month in Los  Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> The wasps will breed inside the mesh bags, enabling scientists to monitor their  progress. In all, 300 of the wasps will be deployed in the bags this fall, with  as many as 10,000 or more scheduled for similar tests in the spring of 1990.  </P> <P> The test releases will help scientists determine if the wasp can survive the  California winter outside the laboratory. Researchers are optimistic, noting  that the wasps thrive under similar climatic conditions elsewhere.  Entomologists also will be testing wasps imported from Italy, where the  whitefly is kept under control by natural conditions.  </P> <P> The white-winged pest sucks vital juices from leaves, weakening and eventually  defoliating trees. Ash and pear trees are its most common victims, but loquat,  pomegranate, citrus, toyon and others are also at risk.  </P> <P> Pesticides have been unsuccessful for several reasons. Chemicals have a  difficult time penetrating the waxy coat of the whitefly, and their eggs are  difficult to reach because they are laid on the underside of leaves, Bellows  said. Also, the sheer number of whiteflies, which Bellows estimated in the  billions in the Los Angeles basin, make the use of pesticides impractical and  undesirable.  </P> <P> "There is no reason to attempt that approach when there is such a good,  environmentally sound alternative," Bellows said.  </P> <P> Although damage so far has primarily been confined to shade trees and back-yard  fruit trees, officials warn that the non-native pest poses a severe threat to  the state's nursery and citrus industries. "There is a great potential for  loss," Bellows said.  </P> <P> In parts of Europe where the whitefly has gained a foothold, up to half the  pear and apple crop has been destroyed, he said. "But we'll beat it before it  happens here."  </P> <P> Since the whitefly sucks more juice from plants than it can use, it leaves a  sticky ooze in its wake that discolors fruit, stains patio furniture and ruins  automobile paint. Residents throughout the basin have complained that the  swarming pests, which stick to hair and clothing, have ruined back-yard  barbecues, driving traditional outdoor activities inside.  </P> <P> The biological control program, funded by government agencies, grower groups  and the University of California, has cost less than $100,000 so far, Spaugy  said. But Bellows estimates the biological control program will cost $120,000 a  year for up to six years.  </P> <P> State Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Tarzana) said Friday that he will introduce  an urgency measure when the Legislature reconvenes in January that will provide  $2 million over the next five years to combat the whitefly in California.  </P></p>

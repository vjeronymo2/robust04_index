			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> SURVIVING IN THE '90S;  </P> <P> NEW SKILLS, NEW CHALLENGES;  </P> <P> A RETRAINING PROGRAM CAN EXTEND A CAREER OR IMPROVE IT. BUT IT'S THE EMPLOYEE'S  RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE IT WORK.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell is faced with the bloody task of cutting nearly 11,000 jobs during  the next five years -- about 16% of its work force. And the main operating unit  of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group is trying to do it without laying  anybody off.  </P> <P> The answer, officials at the telecommunications company are hoping, will be  found in aggressive retraining of its employees, coupled with natural attrition  and early retirement.  </P> <P> "Some of the options facing some of our employees may not be what they would  like, but it beats being laid off," Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kate Flynn said.  </P> <P> During the next decade, workers who thought they were long past the age of  matriculation will find themselves once again in a classroom. They will be  seeking new skills because they have been laid off by a company in a troubled  industry -- maybe an aerospace company or a savings and loan -- or they may be  desperately trying to hold onto the job they have in a world of technological  change.  </P> <P> Indeed, retraining has become a booming industry itself. But while training  programs abound through governmental agencies, colleges and even some  employers, such as Pacific Bell, there may be a shortage of the right kind of  training, experts say.  </P> <P> "If we were to try to retrain all the people that need retraining or teach all  the skills that need to be taught, we'd never get a plane out the door," said a  training coordinator at layoff-plagued Lockheed, which does devote significant  resources to employee training programs.  </P> <P> In the end, experts say, it is up to the individual employee to seek out the  right training program and get the most possible from it.  </P> <P> "The old view of career decision-making was 'once I get out of school, I make  one decision -- I get on the career train and stay there for the rest of my  life,' " said Richard Knowdell, executive director of the Career Planning &amp;  Adult Development Network, a nationwide network of career counselors.  </P> <P> "Now the expectation is people will change jobs and change careers several  times," he said.  </P> <P> Some of the change will be by choice; some will not, Knowdell said. Either way,  "there's going to be a huge need for training and retraining."  </P> <P> A recent study by the Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force found  that the skills of U.S. workers are lagging their counterparts overseas,  causing a crisis in productivity. Among other things, the commission called on  the U.S. government to immediately pour billions of dollars into public schools  and on-the-job training and recommended that U.S. businesses be required to  invest an amount equal to 1% of their payrolls on worker training.  </P> <P> "Retraining is not only for people who are being laid off, but for people who  are remaining with their company in the labor force," said Sonja S. Marchand,  director of the division of business and industry services of the Office of  Continuing Education at Cal State Northridge. "Even people who aren't being  laid off will lose their jobs if they don't continually keep on top of what's  happening."  </P> <P> The aerospace industry is a perfect example because it is both shrinking and  adjusting payroll to training, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> There are many training programs sponsored by such agencies as the state  Employment Development Department, the California Employment Training Panel,  which channels much of its training money through local Private Industry  Councils, and employers themselves. They support an ever-growing army of  schools, consultants and trainers, Knowdell said.  </P> <P> "Companies pay top dollar" and private trainers frequently earn $1,500 to  $2,000 a day, said Knowdell, who also conducts training classes for businesses.  "It's a good living."  </P> <P> Yet, in the face of increasing demand, some worry that enough of the right kind  of training might not be available. Budget cuts at the state's educational  institutions are an ominous sign as well, they say.  </P> <P> Many government-funded programs don't have a good track record when it comes to  deciding what kind of training to provide, said Duane E. Leigh, an economics  professor at Washington State University and author of "Does Training Work for  Displaced Workers?" a book published recently by the W. E. Upjohn Institute for  Employment Research.  </P> <P> Leigh studied several government training programs for displaced workers and  found that job search assistance -- helping workers develop their job-seeking  skills -- was clearly the most effective form of training.  </P> <P> "The job search assistance looks awfully good for displaced workers in project  after project," Leigh said. But more intensive classroom skills training and  on-the-job training were more questionable and more costly.  </P> <P> In most of the programs he studied, "It wasn't clear that the training provided  was really going to be helpful to people in terms of the jobs available in the  community," Leigh said.  </P> <P> A particularly unsuccessful program in Houston took highly educated  white-collar workers laid off by petrochemical plants and trained many of them  to maintain air conditioners, computers and refrigeration units.  </P> <P> In contrast, the California Employment Training Panel designs programs tailored  to the needs of employers, rather than training for jobs it hopes will exist,  Leigh said. The ETP reimburses the company for training costs only if the  worker is placed in a job using his or her new skills and remains there at  least 90 days. "In the absence of an indication from the employer of what  skills are going to be needed, it's kind of hard to predict for him," he said.  "It's just hopeless to try to forecast manpower training needs."  </P> <P> Ultimately, most of the responsibility for finding the right training program  and making a success of it belongs with the employee.  </P> <P> "The company gives some, but the employee has to give some, too," said a  Lockheed official. "If you leave here, you don't leave your training knowledge  with your Lockheed employee badge."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RESOURCE: TIPS ON TRAINING:  </P> <P> * Figure out what you really want. Training may not be the answer for everyone.  </P> <P> * Ask questions.  </P> <P> * Be willing to commit yourself to training.  </P> <P> * Go beyond what is assigned.  </P> <P> * Try to put into practice what you learn.  </P> <P> * Form a study group.  </P> <P> * Keep an open mind. look at the situation as an opportunity.  </P> <P> * Don't overlook any options.  </P> <P> * Try not to get discouraged.  </P> <P> * Ask for help if you need it.  </P></p>

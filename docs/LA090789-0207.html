			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VICTIM SCRAWLS RAPIST'S NAME IN BLOOD;  </P> <P> LEFT TO DIE BENEATH HER BURNING HOME, DENVER WOMAN ESCAPES  </P> <P> Blindfolded, bleeding and trapped in the basement crawl space of her burning  home, a rape victim scrawled her attacker's name in blood with bound hands and  then made a desperate escape, authorities said today.  </P> <P> "Donnie next door," she scratched on the wall Wednesday, minutes after she was  raped, robbed, slashed and beaten, police said.  </P> <P> Her home had been set on fire and she had been left to die in the crawl space  sealed shut with furniture, police said.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old woman was reported in fair condition today at Denver General  Hospital.  </P> <P> Her head throbbing from a hammer beating and her hand bleeding from a knife  wound, she had managed to kick her way out of the crawl space and break her  basement window with the knife with which she was stabbed, police said.  </P> <P> Half-nude, blood-caked and clutching the foot-long knife, the woman scaled a  6-foot fence in her back yard and ran through her neighborhood screaming for  help.  </P> <P> Police said terrified neighbors, unsure whether she was running from trouble or  looking for it, shut their doors.  </P> <P> But after hearing the woman's weak moans, one neighbor did phone police.  </P> <P> As paramedics treated the woman moments later, the neighbor saw smoke flowing  from her clapboard-and-brick house. A fire truck was summoned, and firefighters  quickly doused the blaze.  </P> <P> Police were searching for the suspect, identified as Donnie E. Russell, 18. The  teen-ager, whom the victim has known for two years, allegedly got into her  house about 10 a.m. by asking to use her telephone, police said.  </P></p>

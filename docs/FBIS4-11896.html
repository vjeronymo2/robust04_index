In an interview with the Iranian news agency's correspondent  in Khartoum on Sunday [3 April], Professor Saraj said the media,  parliamentary, and political circles were responsible for  America's hostility towards Sudan. He said the United States  had never been concerned with the restoration of peace in  southern Sudan, and that it used the rebels in the south as a  pretext to put pressure on the Sudanese Government. [passage  omitted]    He emphasized that Sudan will not accept threats and will  never give up its Islamic path, whatever the pressures.    He said the United States cannot internationalize the  conflict in southern Sudan, as that would constitute a violation  of Sudanese sovereignty. Sudan is ready to defend its  independence and territorial integrity.</p>

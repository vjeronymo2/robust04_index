			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> 1,001 SIGN PETITION FOR COUNCILMAN FREGEAU RECALL  </P> <P> Organizers of a recall campaign against Cudahy Councilman Joseph Fregeau have  gathered more than enough signatures to force a special election if the  petition is approved by the city.  </P> <P> Acting City Manager Jack Joseph said the Committee for Good Government on  Monday turned in a petition with 1,001 signatures supporting a recall election.  </P> <P> Joseph said 809 valid signatures are needed for the petition to qualify. The  city has 30 days to verify the signatures, he said.  </P> <P> The committee last September launched a recall campaign against Fregeau and  Councilman John Robertson after they voted to switch the city's law enforcement  service from the Bell Police Department to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department. The recall against Robertson was dropped recently.  </P> <P> Committee member Georgia Scrivner called the day the petition was turned in the  "greatest day of my life."  </P></p>

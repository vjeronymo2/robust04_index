			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Poll tax dilemma that is a matter of records: Robert Rice on the implications of a legal loophole THE adjournment by magistrates in the past two weeks of nearly 4,000 cases involving alleged poll tax defaulters leaves the government in a quandary. The adjournments expose an apparent loophole over the admissability of computerised records as evidence in civil proceedings in magistrates' courts. If the government acts to close this loophole it will in effect invalidate almost 5m liability orders made against non-payers since April 1990 by admitting that the law is faulty. If it fails to act, it risks depriving local authorities of any realistic possibility of recovering outstanding poll tax. The government response yesterday was that it was still 'urgently' considering the matter. The Home Office gives every indication of having been taken by surprise over the issue. This is in spite of the fact that lawyers acting for anti-poll tax groups have been arguing for months that computer records are inadmissible in magistrates' courts because of a loophole in the 1968 Civil Evidence Act. Most magistrates' courts have rejected this argument, but the problem was highlighted when the argument was accepted by magistrates at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, two weeks ago. Their decision prompted magistrates at Gravesend in Kent, Camberwell in south London and Liverpool to halt all their poll tax cases until the matter has been clarified. Other courts are expected to follow suit. Leaving aside the specific concerns about the ease with which computer-generated records can be altered without detection, lawyers defending in poll tax cases claim that before 1968 no written records of any kind were admissible as evidence on their own. In support of their argument they cite a 1965 Appeal Court case which ruled that written records were equivalent to hearsay evidence, and that only oral evidence could be accepted as proof of what a written record said. That case led the government to introduce the 1968 act which changed the law to allow written records to be put in evidence in the High Court and county courts. The act omits any specific reference to the change being applicable to magistrates' courts. The government knows that it could easily close the loophole by parliamentary order. But to do so would be to admit that the loophole exists and cast doubt on the validity not just of the poll tax cases decided since April 1990, but of an unquantifiable number of other cases decided on the basis of written and computer-generated records in magistrates' courts since 1968. Making such an order retroactive is a possibility, but is thought to be both too politically sensitive and too vulnerable to challenge by judicial review. The government's best hope of a quick solution to its predicament may lie in trying to persuade the High Court to rule that, although the 1968 Act makes no specific reference to magistrates' courts, by applying the change in the law to the High Court parliament must have intended it to be binding on lower courts. If the default cases heard so far are eventually declared invalid, local authorities are unlikely to have to repay the money recovered so far. But the government may face claims for wrongful imprisonment from the 170 people who have been jailed for non-payment. Whatever the outcome, the issue needs to be clarified soon. In Liverpool alone, magistrates are scheduled to deal with a further 130,000 cases next month.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DATING TEENS OFTEN MIMIC STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 16-year-old daughter, who is often a terror and always  totally assertive at home, turned into the most passive, old-fashioned girl  when she went on her first date. I observed this because she and her young  boyfriend shared coffee and dessert with my husband and me before they went to  see the film they'd selected. Both my husband and I were a bit disappointed  because neither of us admire the passive, submissive female. What happened to  our little feminist? -- S.B.  </P> <P> DEAR S.B.: Don't be too alarmed. If your daughter has been raised to be  independent and assertive, I doubt that she'll permanently switch roles and  become a quiet, clinging vine. Like most youngsters on a first date, she's  insecure and afraid of offending her partner.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Jerrold Lee Shapiro, an associate professor of psychology at  the University of Santa Clara in California, youngsters often fall back on  stereotypes on a first date. For girls, that means taking a passive role about  initiating the date and deciding how they spend the time, and for boys, the  script is the opposite, even though it may not feel comfortable.  </P> <P> He attributes the stereotypical behavior to teen-agers' acute need to be  accepted by peers. Youngsters are deeply concerned about how their peers see  them and they want to be like everyone else. God forbid, they should appear to  be different in any way.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, my wife and I inherited enough money to do a major  remodeling job on our home. This is something we've wanted to do for years, so  it amazes me that ever since we started we've done nothing but quarrel. Twice,  I've walked out of the place and at one time we considered divorce. What is  this? We were a happily married couple for 15 years. -- M.K.  </P> <P> DEAR M.K.: You're not the only couple to find the whole process of remodeling  stressful. Humans are creatures of habit and when their surroundings are in a  state of disarray, especially if they feel they're being taken advantage of and  they can see their money doing down the drain, stress is created that can make  the best of marriages erupt in turmoil.  </P> <P> Many architects use the parallel of pregnancy and birth to describe the anxiety  and trauma the couples experience during this trying time. The good news is  once it's over, couples usually begin to lick their wounds, heal and start  enjoying the rewards of all the months of doubt.  </P> <P> People invest a great deal of themselves in their houses and what is done to  them. The choices that are made can become a kind of personal statement, where  each spouse feels his taste is on the line.  </P> <P> You can help yourselves if you try to keep the remodeling in perspective. Admit  error and try not to blame each other when something goes wrong.  </P></p>

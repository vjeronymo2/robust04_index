			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort tops takeover table The value of mergers and acquisitions among public companies declined by 60 per cent over the past 12 months according to industry estimates published yesterday. Figures compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the financial magazine, put the value of successful bids for UK public companies at Pounds 3bn in 1993, compared with Pounds 7.5bn last year. The decline - part of a downward trend which has continued since 1989 when activity peaked at Pounds 55bn - has led to a shake-up in the magazine's annual league table of financial advisers and depressed the fees received by merchant banks. SG Warburg, which last year topped the table as advisers on successful and failed bids worth Pounds 7.65bn, has slipped from first to 12th place. In 1993 it took part in seven deals totaling just Pounds 138m. Kleinwort Benson emerged as the new league leader, although the combined Pounds 1.33bn value of its eight deals represented a decline of 82 per cent on Warburg's 1992 total. Industry analysts said yesterday that changes in the rankings had been exaggerated by the paucity of large public bids. There were only two deals worth more than Pounds 500m compared with five such bids in 1992. Kleinwort's ascendancy, up from 10th place last year, was boosted by its advisory role with Central Television, the target of an agreed Pounds 758m bid from Carlton. The other large bid was Granada's hostile Pounds 660m hostile offer for LWT, which is unlikely to be resolved before February next year. Granada is being advised by Lazard, which finished sixth in the 1993 table with seven deals worth Pounds 408m. Acquisitions Monthly said the TV bids were due to the government's relaxation of ownership rules rather than an abrupt change of sentiment in the takeover market. 'Fees earned by the City's merchant bankers, accountants and solicitors from mergers and acquisitions work fell to Pounds 100m from Pounds 110m in 1992,' the magazine added. Some of the banks featured in the table criticised it for focusing on public sector activity and not taking account of private buy-outs and divestments. SG Warburg, which is expected to emerge as the league leader among advisers on private activity, said it had been involved in private deals worth Pounds 3.2bn. The relatively stable private sector business helped offset the slowdown in public activity, although Acquisitions Monthly said the total value of all deals - public and private takeovers, buy-outs and divestments - fell by 13.3 per cent to Pounds 17.2bn (Pounds 19.8bn). A senior executive at Warburg said merchant banks had reacted by putting more resources into restructuring, rights issues and flotations. 'We've seen more issues to rebuild balance sheets and divestments to slim down companies. Mergers and acquisition should pick up next year as the cycle continues.' Warburg's view was echoed at NM Rothschild, which slipped from fifth to 11th place in the league table. Mr Russell Edey, the bank's head of corporate finance, said: 'I'm disappointed with our placing but we've made money doing other things, particularly cross-border activity and overseas disposals.' The importance of the M&amp;A figures was also played down by Lord Rockley, chairman of Kleinwort Benson. 'Corporate finance has grown at the expense of mergers and acquisitions this year. There's been more rationalising of businesses and fewer takeover opportunities,' he said. Lord Rockley predicted that in 1994 the buoyant stock market would lead to a pick-up in M&amp;A activity, although it was unlikely to return to the heights of the late 1980s.  ------------------------------------------------------------ FINANCIAL ADVISERS ON UK PUBLIC TAKEOVERS 1993  ------------------------------------------------------------ Adviser                         Value Deals                                Pounds m    No.  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1 Kleinwort Benson (10)          1,331      8 2 Schroders (2)                    718      9 3 Baring Brothers (9)              645      7 4 BZW (6)                          557      5 5 Morgan Grenfell (4)              436      7 6 Lazard (7)                       408      7 7 Samuel Montagu (3)               339      4 8 Robert Fleming (12)              285      3 9 County NatWest (18)              251      4 10 Wasserstein Per.

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> 2 GIRLS TESTIFY AT MOLESTATION TRIAL  </P> <P> Two 15-year-old girls testified Monday in an ongoing molestation trial that  their Camarillo High School drama teacher hugged them and made them feel  uncomfortable during classes.  </P> <P> One girl testified in Ventura County Municipal Court that William Fisher, 42,  held her hand and hugged her while she was wearing a bikini during a private  play rehearsal last November. During cross-examination by defense attorney  George Eskin, the girl said that Fisher was following the same stage directions  as the student actor he was substituting for.  </P> <P> Fisher is being tried under a state law that makes it a misdemeanor for someone  to "annoy or molest a child under 18." Eight of his female students complained  that he inappropriately hugged them, held their hands or made sexual remarks to  them.  </P> <P> On Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. O'Brien played a videotape for the  jury of Fisher showing photographs of himself in women's clothing to the other  15-year-old girl. Since the trial began on Thursday, she was the fifth girl to  testify that Fisher had shown her such photographs in the school's theater.  </P> <P> In the four cases that the jury saw on videotape, Fisher behaved in a similar  manner with each girl: he sat with the girl in chairs facing away from the  camera and talked for a few moments about the girl's school or social life.  </P> <P> The tapes show Fisher producing photographs of himself in women's clothing,  asking the girl to look at them and picking out a favorite picture, then  walking out of the camera's view with the promise, "I'll be right back." In  each tape, Fisher returns 30 to 90 seconds later and sits down, discusses the  girl's impressions of the photographs, then gathers them up and leaves the  theater with her.  </P> <P> No one has testified about who made the tapes. Testimony by prosecution  witnesses is expected to continue today.  </P> <P> Fisher pleaded guilty to four counts of misdemeanor child molestation but  changed his plea to not guilty last June after learning that he could be  sentenced to jail. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail  and a $1,000 fine. MACK REED  </P></p>

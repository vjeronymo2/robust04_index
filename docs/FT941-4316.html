			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Refuge makes Pounds 12m provisions Refuge Group, the life insurer, has made provisions totalling Pounds 11.6m in its 1993 results in respect of possible compensation for the personal pensions sold to people transferring out of occupational pension schemes. The total comprises exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.7m in respect of the business carried out by Refuge Investments, and a further Pounds 5.9m provision in the ordinary long-term fund of Refuge Assurance, both wholly owned life assurance subsidiaries. Mr Tom Booth, chairman, would not specify the number of pension transfers sold, but said the group was making the sort of prudent provisioning that larger companies had done. Pre-tax profits in 1993 totalled Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 16.2m). A further Pounds 1m of provisions were made for compensation in about 1,000 cases where people contracted out of the state earnings related pension scheme, but documentation was not received by the Department of Social Security. A Pounds 1.2m surplus accrued from the sale of the remaining part of the portfolio of the personal loan subsidiary, which was closed during the year. The proposed final dividend of 7.9p (7.3p), makes a total of 11.35p (10.5p). The shares fell 21p to 359p. Gross premium income in Refuge Assurance and Refuge Investments rose by 4.4 per cent to Pounds 239m. Within that total, there was a clear switch from unit-linked pensions, where gross premium income was Pounds 35m (Pounds 61.1m), to with-profits pension policies, where gross premium income was Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 13.5m). General insurance broke even compared with losses of Pounds 250,000 in 1992. Combined net income rose to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.7m).</p>

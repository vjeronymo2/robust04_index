			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Attraction of locked currencies Sir, Last year the European Parliament's Economic Committee, of which I was a member, interviewed Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy for 1 1/2 hours prior to his appointment as president of the European Monetary Institute. Like you ('Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief', October 24), I formed a very positive view of his expertise, pragmatism and commitment. Given adequate convergence, the idea of irrevocable locking of member currencies at an earlier stage than domestic use of the Ecu seems increasingly attractive. The banks warn us of huge costs, difficulties and lead times in introducing Ecu notes and coinage. On the other hand irrevocable locking of currencies gives business most of the advantages with few of the costs. The approach to stage three of Emu would thus be 'a European currency with local manifestations' in the form of existing domestic notes and coinage in each member state involved. It is quite right that this has great advantages in terms of public opinion as well. However, I also advocate early consideration of the issue of perhaps two Ecu notes (say Ecu50 and Ecu20, worth today the awkward sums of Pounds 39 and Pounds 15.60 respectively) which would be legal tender as a parallel currency in all Emu states, giving travellers some relief from the cost and fuss of changing currencies, and showing an everyday benefit from a European currency.

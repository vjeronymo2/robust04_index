			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Teraflop takes on slower dinosaurs To the uninitiated, a teraflop machine might sound like a dinosaur trap. To those in the know, it is one of the fastest computers around. The CS-2, developed by Meiko of Bristol, can carry out 100,000 times as many instructions as today's most powerful personal computers or workstations in the same time span. The company envisages that the teraflop machine will be used for large database applications as well as the more traditional supercomputer applications such as weather forecasting. The CS-2 achieves such speed because thousands of processors work in parallel - unlike conventional serial computers where each bit of data is processed consecutively. Meiko: UK, 0454 616171.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A wet blanket - Appetisers either underway, imminent or long overdue - range from cautious to downright suicidal. My colleague Edmund Penning-Rowsell will shortly be reporting in detail on Bordeaux's soggy harvest. The Portuguese, who seemed poised for success in the table wine market, have also been experiencing cold rains off the Atlantic. For once it does not seem premature to assert that 1993 will not be a vintage port year (although both 1991 and 1992 were splendid). Those who harvested early, and bothered to spray carefully earlier in the season, may make some good wine in the south of France, but 1993 tried the patience of organic viticulturists almost everywhere. Northern Italy was washed out in many parts, although late last week Piero Antinori was still optimistic about the prospects for Central Italy (where 1992 was disappointing). The Champenois are putting on a brave face, but there has not been a single vintage that could be described as generally good throughout Europe since 1990. The 1993 vintage was better in the southern hemisphere, and some exciting whites are beginning to arrive from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Chile. This is as good a time as any for the most die-hard classicist to explore the best that these countries have to offer. An excellent place to start is the Australian Wine Centre, 50 Strand, London WC2 (071-925-0751). Its new list boasts many an exciting find in the Pounds 4 to Pounds 8 range, among the predictable taunts about cricket and the monarchy. It was the centre's Craig Smith, for example, who first imported the extraordinary Heritage Cabernet Franc 1991, an arm-twister with about as much in common with a red Loire as Paul Keating. This extraordinarily dense, voluptuous red is now listed by Bottoms Up and Wine Rack at Pounds 7.49. Smith will not get his allocation until January but, meanwhile, can offer a Cabernet Malbec 1991 at Pounds 6.49, from the same style of concentrated low-yield, unirrigated, hand-picked fruit grown in one of the less blistering parts of South Australia. This is the one place in Britain to find the sort of Australian bottlings that elicit drools from the normally phlegmatic ('make mine a beer') wine writers of Sydney and Melbourne. The centre has a particularly glamorous range of Australia's dry Rieslings from Pounds 3.49 to Pounds 6.99 a bottle, and will deliver any order worth Pounds 75 free anywhere in the UK mainland. A South African selling at Pounds 8.58 a bottle somehow managed to wrest the Chardonnay Trophy from many a grand white burgundy at this year's vast International Wine Challenge organised by WINE magazine. Dieu Donne 1992 is due in to the warehouses of Tanners of Shrewsbury (0743-232400) this week.</p>

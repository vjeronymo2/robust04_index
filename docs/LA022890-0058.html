			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORDSTROM HOLDERS SUE OVER TROUBLES  </P> <P> Three Nordstrom Inc. shareholders filed a suit Tuesday against the beleaguered  retailer, charging it with fraud by not warning investors about the potential  financial damage stemming from its employee pay practices.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, asks the court that it be  accepted as a class action on behalf of the approximately 76,000 Nordstrom  stockholders.  </P> <P> In the 28-page suit, Eli De Comminges, Alphonse Kaufman, and Jessica Longston  charge that between Feb. 1, 1989, and Feb. 15, 1990, Nordstrom failed to  adequately report the potential problems stemming from its pay practices. The  suit seeks unspecified damages.  </P> <P> In its fourth-quarter report, the company said it established a $15-million  reserve for the back-pay claims.  </P></p>

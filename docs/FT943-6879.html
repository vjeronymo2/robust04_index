			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A qualified success story The first results for the new advanced-level General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs), announced yesterday, deserve at least a qualified welcome. They suggest that the government might have found the right vehicle for delivering desperately needed improvements to the UK's skills base. It is not before time. By international standards, Britain's record on vocational training is appalling. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, 64 per cent of Britain's workforce has no vocational qualifications. In Germany, this figure is only 26 per cent. In that light yesterday's news that at least 50,000 16-year-olds will be embarking on the new qualifications next month, and that the pioneer students who took the two-year pilot enjoyed more success looking for university places than rivals with academic A-levels, is encouraging. This was exactly the intention. Advanced GNVQs, referred to by ministers as 'vocational A-levels' are broader than national vocational qualifications (NVQs), which are meant to be taken in the workplace and commit trainees to narrower fields such as plumbing and bricklaying. By contrast GNVQs are offered in subjects such as 'manufacturing' and 'health and social care'. Successful GNVQ candidates can use their qualifications either to apply to university or to move into the world of work. Employers impressed Employers may well be impressed by the fact that only a third of the candidates who set out on pilot GNVQ courses two years ago completed them. On this year's evidence, the qualification cannot be dismissed as a soft option. But so much weight has been put on the qualifications that further improvement is still necessary. The Department for Education appears to have recognised this, and has presented the bodies which award GNVQs with a six-point series of reforms. It is imperative that they are implemented if the respect of universities and employers is to be maintained. Ministers want tougher objective testing, better training for external verifiers, and clearer grading. At present, with most coursework being assessed by colleges funded in part according to their students' success rate, there is a worrying potential conflict of interest. The pilot scheme was heavily policed by government inspectors, who passed the results with a clean bill of health, but much more rigorous internal checks and balances will be needed. Theoretical grounding The education department also wants clarification of what knowledge is needed for a GNVQ. Without this, GNVQs might fall victim to a problem which has bedevilled NVQs, which are designed to test candidates' competences, rather than their knowledge. Critics complain that this produces trainees without sufficient theoretical grounding in basic mathematical and scientific principles. And as a result the government is now spending Pounds 31m on a review of the structure and content of all existing NVQs. In continental European training schemes, vocational courses are studied alongside discretely taught general education courses, in mathematics and language. Such basic skills should be explicitly required in GNVQs, and tested independently. Ultimately, the government's problems concerning both assessment and knowledge can be solved by reforming A-Levels, so that more subjects can be studied - a move which ministers regrettably refuse to consider. This would allow GNVQ candidates to gain the right basic skills by taking separate A-levels in maths, sciences or foreign languages as appropriate. The remaining question-marks over assessment of GNVQs could be removed by making them conform to the same assessment criteria as practical A-level subjects such as art, where roughly 40 per cent of work is externally assessed and other coursework is left for teachers to assess. GNVQs would then carry just as strong a guarantee of impartial marking as the widely respected A-level. But all of this is in the future. For now, the awarding bodies must ensure that the government's list of reforms is fully enacted. If they do this, they will deserve unqualified praise.</p>

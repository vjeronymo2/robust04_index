			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Hillsdown advances after cut in interest charges: Food group's shares fall despite higher profits and pledge on maintained payout HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, saw its shares slump 23p to 83p yesterday in heavy trading, in spite of announcing marginally higher interim profits and promising a maintained annual dividend, barring unforeseen circumstances. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 77.6m to Pounds 78.1m, but the gain was due to a Pounds 13.1m fall in the interest charge to Pounds 14m following the group's Pounds 280m rights issue a year ago. A gloomy statement on the second-half outlook persuaded analysts to cut profit forecasts for the year, even after heavy downgradings in recent weeks. One said: 'The market is taking nothing on trust.' The shares are on a yield of 14 per cent on the basis of the dividend forecast, suggesting the market is not convinced about the payment. Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said the first quarter had been reasonable but profitability declined 'quite markedly during the second quarter'. He said the group faced 'a difficult second half' with trading continuing to deteriorate in some areas. Sir Harry said the group's poultry business was suffering because of imports of cheap chickens from France. These were not kept in conditions up to the standards introduced in the UK after the salmonella scare at the end of 1988. He said the group aimed to be the lowest-cost producer of chickens but could not compete with imports unless 'we are all operating on a 'level playing field'.' Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said given the trading conditions  -such as food price deflation of 2 per cent and pressure from food retailers - the businesses were 'responding as vigorously as they can'. Analysts were concerned by Pounds 88m of debt on the balance sheet following a change in policy on securitising trade debtors. Mr Simon Moffat, finance director, said this change increased the group's gearing by 8.6 percentage points to 26.9 per cent at the end of June. He said: 'There is no black hole in the cashflow or balance sheet.' Earnings per share were down 23.3 per cent to 6.96p, due to a higher tax rate and the increased share capital, and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.2p. The 21.7 per cent fall in the shares set the seal on the removal of Hillsdown's shares from the FT-SE 100 index yesterday. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20; Market, Page 42</p>

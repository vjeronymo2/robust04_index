			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866/Secretary's Memorandum 1512&hyph;1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.55l. For the reasons set forth in the final rule and related notice to 7 CFR 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). George Braley, Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect recipients who must elect a repayment method for IPV claims. State and local agencies which administer the Food Stamp Program will be affected by the change in retention rates on food stamp recipient claims and the reduction in the enhanced funding rate for development of ADP system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the Notice of Adverse Action and the demand letter for recipient claims is approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB number 0584&hyph;0064. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens associated with the collection of claims assessed against food stamp households have been approved by OMB under OMB number 0584&hyph;0069. Information collection requirements relating to automated data processing and information retrieval systems have been approved by OMB Approval No. 0584&hyph;0083. The provisions of this rule do not contain any additional reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements subject to OMB approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 10, 1991, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 46127) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed changes to Food Stamp Program recipient claims and ADP funding requirements as required by the Mickey Le Lano Memorial Hunger Relief Act, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, (hereinafter ``Pub. L. 101&hyph;624''). The Department received 21 comment letters which addressed provisions of the proposed rule. FNS has given careful consideration to all comments received. The major concerns of the commenters are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recipient Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Repayment Decision Timeframe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have shortened the time for participating households to choose how they would repay inadvertent household error (IHE) and intentional Program violation (IPV) claims in order to forestall involuntary reduction of their allotments. The timeframe for such elections would have been shortened from 30 days to the day of receipt of the demand letter for repayment unless the adverse action period for the claim had not elapsed or the household had timely requested a fair hearing and continued benefits. Public Law 101&hyph;624 mandates the shortened timeframe for IPV claims. The proposed rule would have also applied this timeframe to IHE claims. The preamble to the proposed rule should be consulted for the complete discussion of the background of this decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received 13 comments on this part of the proposed rule, 10 from State agencies, one from the welfare department of a large city, and two from public interest groups. Five State agencies supported the proposal; most other commenters objected to it, primarily because it applied the shortened timeframe to IHE claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that since the statute spoke only to IPV claims, applying the ``same day'' decision timeframe to IHE claims was against the law. Several commenters objected to the proposal on the grounds that the shortened decision timeframe for IHE claims would cause hardship on households, especially those in rural areas, and was in any event too short to allow adequate time for due process. Two commenters objected to our statement that the proposal would enhance conformity with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) rules on claims management. Several commenters stated that if it were established for either IHE or IPV claims, the ``same day'' standard would impose significant operational problems on State agencies, and that a 10-day minimum should be adopted for both types of claims. One of the operational difficulties cited was the need to track responses due at varying intervals because of the consideration of such circumstances as geography. One commenter believed that the proposed rule required a fair hearing on IPV claims in addition to an administrative disqualification hearing or comparable action establishing such claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

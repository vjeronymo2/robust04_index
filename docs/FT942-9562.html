			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The French Connection): Food and fizz - a tricky match / As France prepares for its summer invasion of Britons, Weekend FT writers have been gathering news and views from its regions / Just what should you eat with champagne The large and ancient province of Champagne was one of the jewels in the French crown. In spite of so many vicissitudes of fortune it has hung in there, bearing the brunt of the action. Battles and wars have been fought over its chalky soils. You would be hard-pressed to find a city, town or village which remains unscathed. Mention Champagne today and it is wine rather than war which springs to mind. Ask about the food and the locals will explain that there has never been a gastronomic tradition worthy of the name. Press them further and out will spill a shortlist of rather earthy things: the potee or stew which was served to pickers at the end of the vintage; pigs' ears, trotters and andouillettes, so prized by the area's peasant farmers; in the less vinous country to the east, bread and dripping; little pies and pates and even that great pigeon pie on which French kings gorged themselves after coronations in Rheims; river fish, some muddy, some not: trout, pike, perch and eel; a special race of sheep which grazed on the chalk slopes of the Mountain of Rheims and which had white flesh as a result. In Britain a similar list would be the object of pride. In Champagne it is dismissed as 'nothing much'. Since the champagne houses started receiving favoured customers in the region, much of this has changed. The business of entertaining visitors has spawned its own style of cooking, as like to the original as chalk to cheese. The great houses needed restaurants of an elegance worthy of their top cuvees and dishes which would not spoil the delicate taste of the wines. Any restaurateur who could provide both could be guaranteed of the patronage of the champagne firms. A second cuisine champenoise was born. It is the only one the casual visitor is likely to experience today. Champagne wine is a delicate balancing act between three grape varieties: the maligned Pinot Meunier, the more robust and fruity Pinot Noir and the floral, and occasionally ethereal Chardonnay. Some champagnes depend wholly or principally on one variety and make wines which are, for the most part, less complex. Then there are the still wines of the region: red Pinot Noirs from Bouzy, Ambonnay or Cumieres; white, Coteaux Champenois; or oddities such as the earthy rose des Riceys. The variety of styles gives the restaurateur a wide range of flavours to play with. Certain dishes go better with one champagne than they do with another. By common consent some dishes do not go with champagne at all: chocolate, oranges and salad. To this list, Jean-Pierre Lallement, of L'Assiette Champenoise (tel: 26 04 15 56), would add bell peppers, onions, mint and rosemary. Garlic is highly risky. On the other hand Lallement is not shocked by the idea of tripe with a Pinot Noir- based 'blanc des noirs'. Anyone who wants to play safe will serve you lobster, scallops or Dublin Bay prawns. None of these will rock the boat. The conventional wisdom is to serve them with a Chardonnay-dominated cuvee, or even with a pure Chardonnay Cremant from the Cote des Blancs. The only time I found this did not work was in a champagne house where the chefs, from an Epernay restaurant, had laced the lobster with onions and garlic and assassinated the wine. Chardonnay-based wines would seem to suit the ultra-fashionable John Dory too - although any wine of character will tend to overpower it. Traditionally, salmon was thought to pine for champagne: Grimod de La Reyniere gives a recipe for a salmon sweated in two bottles of the stuff: 'This fish is something of a drunkard; what's more it will only drink the best.' I wonder what Grimod would make of modern farmed salmon; a fish so oily that it is half way to a herring or a mackerel. In the restaurant Florence in Rheims (26 47 12 70) I have seen champagnes knocked sideways by both sardines and red mullet. The chef at Florence did, however, manage to come up with a papeton of pigeon stuffed with its own liver and little nicois olives which went remarkably well with an all-Pinot Noir rose. On the other hand, an attempt to match a gutsy champagne with lamb wrapped in bacon (white-fleshed or otherwise) proved a failure. I remain unconvinced by any attempt to marry champagne to red meat or game. Champagne's cheeses are all peripheral to the province: Chaource, Langres, Boursault, Brie and Maroilles. The Champenois have a particular affection for the latter which ripens in the autumn and is brought down from the north by the pickers. It is a strong cheese; not for nothing is one sort dubbed le suppositoire du diable while a version from Lille is called le puant, or the stinker. Strange as it may seem, the stinker went well with an old (1975) vintage champagne at the excellent Grand Cerf at Montchenot (26 97 60 07) and old vintages of this sort also combine well with foie gras. Providing your pudding is not too sweet, champagne, especially rose champagne, can provide an effective foil. Buttery pastry seems to cry out for it. On the other hand it is best to go easy on sweet, fruit sauces. All over France it is common practice to open a bottle of champagne with dessert when you are dining in style. Outside the region itself, there is clearly less demand for meals accompanied by different champagnes. Even in Epernay I found the head of one champagne house who was clearly not going to go to war for this sort of gastronomic marriage: I asked him when he liked to drink champagne and he replied: 'Every evening, before dinner.' The rest was diplomatic silence. Anyone wishing to learn to cook with and around champagne at one of the regions better hotel-restaurants might be interested in the Auberge Saint Vincent, in Ambonnay, which runs a three-night cookery break at just Pounds 183 per person. For the price you get accommodation, dinners and breakfasts, cooking sessions (you eat you own work), a visit to a champagne house and ferry crossings for car and passengers.

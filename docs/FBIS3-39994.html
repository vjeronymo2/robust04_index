The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman  Khurshid, told the heads of various delegations in informal  meetings in Geneva that abstaining in the event of a voting on  the Pakistan-proposed resolution on Kashmir will undermine the  very concept of human rights and will encourage Islamabad's  involvement in terrorism. Talking to Indian reporters, Mr.  Khurshid said New Delhi expects a categorical rejection of the  resolution.</p>

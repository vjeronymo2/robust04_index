			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Yeltsin faces two-pronged attack: Zhirinovsky's praise for North Korea a snub to Russian parliament Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party which won a large following in the Russian parliament in the last elections, has said North Korea has 'a distinguished leader, an excellent society and a great history . . . its excellent style of politics has brought it great success', according to the official Korean news agency. Mr Zhirinovsky's visit to North Korea, now shunned by Russian leaders, coincides with the opening of the Russian parliament, and symbolises the nationalist leader's contempt both for the democratic process in Russia and for parliament itself. His party has threatened to walk out of the parliament, and to back - although not initiate - a vote of no-confidence in the Russian leadership. His star has waned as well as waxed since his success last December in the parliamentary polls. But he has remained able to command attention, and is now supporting the candidacy of Mr Sergei Mavrodi, controversial (and jailed) head of the MMM share dealing company, as a candidate for the constituency of Mytishi, an industrial suburb of Moscow. The previous deputy was killed there, in what was described as a gangland feud. The opening of the parliament was also marked by a direct accusation by Mr Victor Ilyukhin, the communist deputy who chairs the state duma's security committee, that Mr Boris Yeltsin 'has been suffering from alcoholism for a long time and cannot run the country.' He said it was 'our anguish' and 'the peak of shame for Russia' to watch the Russian president's recent conduct abroad. Mr Ilyukhin was referring to Mr Yeltsin's public indisposition during a visit to Germany last month, and his inability to descend from his aircraft to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, while en route back from the US last week. Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy premier who met Mr Reynolds, said the Russian president was ill - while Mr Yeltsin later said he had overslept. 'The security service did not let in the people to wake me. Of course, I will sort things out and punish them,' he said then.</p>

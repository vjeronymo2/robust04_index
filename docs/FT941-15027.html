			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Minister unhurt in Colombian car bombing Colombia's finance minister, Mr Rudolf Hommes, escaped unhurt in a bomb attack on his armour-plated car yesterday morning. A bodyguard was injured. The bomb was detonated as the minister's car crossed a flyover in the centre of Bogota, the Colombian capital. Shrapnel shredded the vehicle's boot and bent in a door. Mr Hommes said later he had received death threats but did not know who from. He has been finance minister for three-and-a-half years, responsible for opening up the Colombian economy since the beginning of President Cesar Gaviria's administration. Economic liberalisation and policies to reduce inflation have become increasingly unpopular, particularly with the political left. The attack is being attributed to Communist guerrillas, though no organisation claimed responsibility immediately. Guerrilla groups are stepping up action in rural areas with the approach of congressional and presidential elections, scheduled for March 13 and May 8. They were blamed for recent bomb attacks in Bogota. On October 7 explosives hidden at the side of a road were detonated by remote control as a busload of police drove past. Three officers were killed and 30 injured. Just over two weeks later a series of small bombs went off early on National Census Day, killing a beggar.</p>

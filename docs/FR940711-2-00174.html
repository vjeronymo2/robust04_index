			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate whether housing need in the primary area specified in the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been underfunded and will assign one of the three point-values, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;45 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been severely underfunded. A primary area with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of need served that is equal to or less than one-third the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation area's percentage will be determined to be severely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underfunded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;30 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been moderately underfunded. An application with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of need served that is greater than one-third the allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area's percentage but equal to or less than two-thirds of the allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area percentage will be determined to be moderately underfunded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;15 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been proportionately funded. An application with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of need served that is greater than two-thirds the allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area's percentage but equal to or less than the allocation area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage will be determined to be proportionately funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;0 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been overfunded. A primary area with a percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need served that is greater than the allocation area percentage will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to have been overfunded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Selection Criterion 3: Local Initiatives (5 points).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) Description.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application must describe the extent to which HAs demonstrate locally initiated efforts in support of their Rental Voucher and Rental Certificate Programs or comparable tenant-based rental assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Evaluation of a locality's contribution is measured competitively by the extent to which a locality is able to provide services or cash contributions or demonstrate its intention to provide this kind of support in the future, as compared to services or contributions provided by other localities of like program size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Rating and Assessment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The HUD State or Area Office/Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Programs Office will assign one of two point-values, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;5 points: The State or locality provides significant local support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rental Certificate Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;2 points: The State or locality provides minimal local support to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;0 points: The State or locality does not provide support to the HA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Selection Criterion 4: Efforts of HAs to Establish a Family Self-Sufficiency Program (10 points Deduction).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) Description:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application must describe the efforts undertaken by the PHA to establish a Section 8 Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program including (1) submission to HUD of an Action Plan, and (2) creation of a Program Coordinating Committee. If a PHA is not administering a Rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, the HUD State or Area Office will rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HA administration of the Public Housing FSS program, if applicable.

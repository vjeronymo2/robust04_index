			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> A LITTLE GEM OF A CAFE HIDDEN AWAY IN A NEWPORT BEACH SHOPPING CENTER  </P> <P> Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely name for a restaurant, but then again  Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely restaurant. The proprietors, Grant Showley and  Shirley Wrightson, are a married couple, and the food they serve reflects their  background as cooking teachers. Because they can cook in almost any style, they  do. Lyon, Jakarta and Santa Fe could be envisioned as tri-cities in the  restaurant's tiny kitchen.  </P> <P> It's a tiny restaurant, too, tucked away in a hard-to-find shopping mall called  Eastbluff, in a ritzy part of Newport Beach. The owners have tried to give the  place some atmosphere -- a collection of posters depicting life in provincial  France, white tablecloths and candles at night -- but the look is still that of  an upscale grocery store with tables. Racks of comestibles like good imported  olive oil and fancy pastas line the room, which is papered bath shop-style in  dotted white. A real estate agent might key on the word cozy in his description  of it.  </P> <P> But as a neighborhood restaurant, Showley-Wrightson works perfectly. I know  some local people who wouldn't dream of eating anywhere else, and they are not  alone. The wide variety of entrees caters to every taste. The menu changes  daily. Owner Wrightson is a friendly woman, and she greets every one of her  customers like house guests. "I can procure just about anything for a customer  with a few days' notice," she says, "and if I can't, neither can anybody else."  When I ask her about Bresse chicken, she says, "Give me until Tuesday."  </P> <P> The candles were flickering one Friday evening as we took our seats, and the  music of Vivaldi reverberated throughout the crowded room. Little canapes of  shrimp mousse and spinach-laced ricotta were served to us on a silver tray,  making the greetings from our two servers seem even more genteel. Service is  warm and relaxed in this restaurant, with noble attempts to render the  experience more European. (Silverware is replaced between courses. Butter is  served in little crocks.)  </P> <P> We began with wonderful breads, a dense, chewy walnut bread and fougasse, a  Provencal flat bread topped with onions. I could have gone on eating bread all  night -- if I had, I would have left in total contentment.  </P> <P> But I didn't. Subsequent courses exposed the major problem at  Showley-Wrightson: many dishes here are more adapted than reproduced. And while  all are well-crafted, their flavors seem muted, minimally spiced, ephemerally  smoked, lightly salted, quickly simmered.  </P> <P> A case in point: the pate plate. When it arrived everyone's eyes got a little  bigger. But when we tasted the components our initial hopes were dashed. The  duck rillettes actually could have used more fat (that's where the real flavors  come from). The chicken-liver mousse needed more texture (Gerber couldn't have  made it much smoother). Thanks to a fine, grainy country pate served with an  excellent pear chutney and a superb mustard, we finished off somewhat  impressed.  </P> <P> A tomato bisque was food-processor silky, but though the basil in it was  clearly visible, it was not easy to taste. The lentil soup was better, a light  broth with carrots, onions and delicately stewed lentils. That soup had real  flavor, though I would have liked it better with a little more garlic.  </P> <P> About the best of the main courses that night was Tante Paulette's garlic  chicken, boned chicken sauteed with unpeeled garlic cloves and brandy. The  caramelized garlic was especially delicious. But I couldn't help noticing that  the chicken tasted as if it had been partially boiled before hitting the saute  pan. Tante Paulette would never take a shortcut like that.  </P> <P> Some entrees listed on the menu that night seemed so interesting we couldn't  resist ordering them. Indonesian lamb loin, served with chutney and, according  to the menu, rice sticks, was one of them. But the rice sticks turned out to be  ordinary fried rice, and the lamb, while fresh and tender, had none of the  perfumed coriander or turmeric that I associate with Indonesian cooking.  Tortelli with spinach, ricotta and Parmesan -- advertised as pasta rounds --  was in reality one giant sombrero of baked pasta with a rather innocuous  filling. I thought it looked and tasted like a German pancake.  </P> <P> On a second visit I found more of the bright spots. Risotto with asparagus,  shrimp and fresh spinach was perfectly cooked, and nicely balanced. I could  taste several divergent flavors in every forkful. Grilled tenderloin of beef,  lightly smoked over grapevines and sauced with red wine and porcini mushroom,  would have been at home in any of the great restaurants of Tuscany.  </P> <P> If you have room after your culinary world tour there is a dessert tray filled  with homemade goodies. Two stand out: One is the flour-less chocolate cake, a  dense wedge so popular with the table that the person who ordered it surrounded  it with empty wine glasses to keep the rest of us at bay; the other is the  ginger-snap ice cream with ginger-snap cookies on the side, a  raised-consciousness version of ice cream and cookies. This is an adult  dessert, but it arouses childish emotions. With a little more nerve, most of  the other dishes in this restaurant could do the same.  </P> <P> Showley-Wrightson is moderately priced. At lunch time, attractive salads like  chicken lemon, Tex-Mex potato, and mushroom feta, are offered in combinations  for $8.75. Picnic baskets, filled with goodies that Lynn Redgrave wouldn't  touch, are $20. At dinner, appetizers are $5.50 to $8. Main dishes are $12.50  to $18.  </P> <P> SHOWLEY-WRIGHTSON  </P> <P> 2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach  </P> <P> (714) 760-9700  </P> <P> Open for takeout Monday through Friday, 10 a.m to 6 p.m., lunch Monday through  Friday, 11 a.m to 3 p.m., dinner Tuesday through Saturday, 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P> American Express, MasterCard, Visa accepted.  </P></p>

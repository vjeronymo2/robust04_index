			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 13 (MTI) -- Acting Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres and  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] executive Balint Magyar  discussed the operation of a joint government and cooperation  guarantees during their meeting on Monday. The negotiators  worked out a draft text of a joint proposal which will be  submitted to the two parties" general political coordination  forum on Tuesday for approval.    The draft extends to the cooperation of the coalition  partners within government, the working order of the cabinet,  cooperation between the parliamentary groups, appointment  rights, and the coordination mechanism between the two parties.    Speaking to journalists after the talks, Szekeres said  discussion between the two parties about these issues could  possibly be completed on Tuesday. These issues received special  emphasis in the course of the talks because this is the first  time that the basic principles of the coalition cooperation are  to be set down in writing.    The MSZP politician did not wish to provide further details  about his talks with the SZDSZ official. However, journalists  were told that personnel issues were not discussed, as the  general political negotiating forum and the party chairmen are  the ones who coordinate such matters.    The Socialists and the Free Democrats are not forced to  conclude a coalition, but they are negotiating in the interest  of the country, Szekeres said in answer to a question from the  press. As regards the chances of a coalition government,  Szekeres said the likelihood of the two parties reaching  agreement in the course of their talks is quite good.</p>

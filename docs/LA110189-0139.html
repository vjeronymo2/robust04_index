			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FUNDING BAN ON FETAL TISSUE STUDIES EXTENDED  </P> <P> Calling it a "moral issue," a top federal health official said today he intends  to extend indefinitely the current ban on federal funding for research using  fetal tissue from induced abortions.  </P> <P> James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and  Human Services, said he has the authority to make a decision on the ban and  "the moratorium should be continued indefinitely." Health and Human Services  Secretary Louis W. Sullivan unexpectedly declined Tuesday to make the decision  himself.  </P> <P> Permitting federal funding for such research, Mason said, "would be  unacceptable federal policy."  </P> <P> Conservative supporters of the Bush Administration had promised a firestorm of  protest if the Administration lifted the ban.  </P> <P> Mason's predecessor as assistant secretary for health, Robert Windom, last year  forbade use of government funds to finance such research and established a  special advisory committee on whether it should continue.  </P> <P> Later last year, the committee recommended the ban be lifted.  </P> <P> Mason told reporters he will write a letter to the National Institutes of  Health within 10 days informing it of his decision.  </P> <P> "This is a moral issue," he said. "I'm concerned that in sponsoring fetal  tissue transplantation there will be a clear perception that the government is  encouraging or promoting abortion."  </P> <P> Many scientists believe Parkinson's disease and other conditions could be  treated by transplanting fetal tissue into patients.  </P> <P> Allowing federal funding for fetal tissue transplants from induced abortions  would create a demand for aborted fetuses, which would increase the number of  abortions, Mason said.  </P></p>

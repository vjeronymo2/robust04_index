			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Hellberg: "Swedish UN Men Do Not Want To </F> Go to Bosnia"]    [Text] "Clearly, it is calmer than we thought here in  Bosnia. The mass media have given a wrong picture of the  situation," says Major Mats Backteman, commanding officer of the  Swedish company that the politicians want to move from Macedonia  to Bosnia.    Backteman has been with the Nordic battalion in Tuzla for  two  days, in order to find out, along with two colleagues, what the  situation is like in Bosnia.    "We have gotten a positive idea of what we are to do here,  mainly guard the airport," Backteman says.    But "at home" in Macedonia the Swedish company of 200 men is  not as positive as the four who have visited Tuzla.    "They are still negative, but then they have not heard about  the experiences we have had."    Mats Backteman himself would absolutely agree to move to  Bosnia.    "I have discussed it with my wife in Linkoping, where we  also  have two small children. I would accept a rewriting of the  contract."  <H5>  Accept </H5>   Backteman is not really able to say how many in the company  would accept moving.    "I think that right now it is 50-50 in favor of moving to  Bosnia."    The alternative for the Swedish unit is not to remain in  Macedonia but to break its UN contract and go home.    "As I see it, there is no possibility for us to remain in  Macedonia if we do not want to move to Bosnia," Backteman says.    For most the alternative is going home to unemployment. The  company has only been in Kumanovo in Macedonia for one month.  Five months remain of the contract.    "For many of the guys their period of sickness benefits has  expired and they regard the UN service as a job.    ``At the same time we have not had the opportunity of  checking with our families. In that way we have dual loyalties;  it is a difficult situation.''  <H5>  Persuade </H5>   As Mats Backteman describes the situation in Tuzla, "it is  not much more dangerous than in Macedonia."    Colonel Ulf Henricsson, commander of the Nordic battalion in  Tuzla, has tried to persuade the Swedish company in Macedonia to  move. As Henricsson describes the contracts, they are written  with the UN and do not refer specifically to Macedonia.    But Backteman points out that it says "MA 03" -- which is  the  Macedonian battalion -- in their contracts.</p>

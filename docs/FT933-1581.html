			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Arts: Perverse 'Therese Raquin' - Theatre A green gloomy glass bowl shimmers through the dark, suggesting an empty cell. Two figures dressed like pest controllers in black PVC intone the sombre opening words of Therese Raquin. The cast stagger on stage, cackling, lumbered with their props of table and chairs. A lone young woman, like a figure from a Munch painting, stands disconsolately apart. We are firmly in the grip of director's theatre. Julia Bardsley, the young (31) new joint director (with Tim Supple) of the Young Vic, begins her reign with the production of Zola's novel of lust, murder and retribution which made her reputation at the Leicester Haymarket. It is stridently in the popular vein of physical theatre, the staff of life for troupes like Theatre de Complicite, theatre that forces the audience to spend most of its time watching actors perform tricks of free expression and bodily improvisation, dormant since drama school, rather than lose itself in the action. It may well let fresh air into old classics but it can also encourage stale longueurs. It is particularly perverse to adopt the approach to Zola's masterpiece of realism, in which he poured his genius into depicting the life of the petty bourgeoisie in minute detail. The intensity of the relationship between Therese (Anastasia Hille) and Laurent (Rory Edwards), the lover who awakens her sexuality, is dissipated by distracting directorial inventiveness. For their first love making the actors flutter white sheets to suggest orgasm. In their final despair they throw themselves about the stage like two-years-olds in a tantrum. It little helps that Hille is a graduate of the Vanessa Redgrave School of the demotic dirge, and Edwards is stronger at brooding menace than passion. The real problem comes with the other actors. Apart from Madame Raquin, Bardsley has given them Mickey Mouse voices: the doomed husband Camille (Gordon Milne) shows his feeble mindedness by talking like John Major. There are absolutely no laughs in Therese Raquin and populating the stage with goons is yet another distraction. Happily Bardsley has her inspirations. The fish bowl set is correctly claustrophobic; the drowning of Camille in the River Seine is cleverly and damply transposed to a bath on stage; his haunting ghost is suitably creepy; and the scene in which Laurent visits the morgue to discover Camille's body is the best possible justification for expressionistic theatre. At the end Therese and Camille are locked in a deathly embrace, and you suddenly get involved with their tragedy. For almost three hours the two actors have been allowed to go their separate ways, dipping deep into their individual boxes of actorly tricks. Their final lapse into Zola's naturalism comes too late. Still at least Bardsley has the guts to have a point of view and the refurbished Young Vic is as comfortable as it is welcoming.</p>

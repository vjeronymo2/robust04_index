			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Court of Appeal for </F> Information Disputes -- Censorship or Promoting Free Speech?"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin has ratified the Statute on the  Russian Federation President's Court of Appeal [sudebnaya  palata] for Information Disputes. It is likely to meet with a  mixed reaction from journalists.    The Court of Appeal set up by the president is the successor  to the Information Court of Arbitration that operated during the  election campaign. Five of the seven members of the new  collegium worked on the Court of Arbitration under the  leadership of Doctor of Juridical Sciences Anatoliy Vengerov,  who has now been appointed chairman of the Court of Appeal for  Information Disputes.    The court should help the president to carry out his  constitutional role as guarantor of citizens' rights and  freedoms -- specifically in the sphere of information and the  mass media. It will not examine disputes within the jurisdiction  of the general civil courts -- in particular, defamation cases.    In accordance with the Statute on the Court of Appeal it  must  promote the "safeguarding of rights and freedoms in the sphere  of the mass media; objectivity and accuracy of reports  concerning the public interest; the protection of the moral  interests of children and young people in the media; and the  observance of the principle of political pluralism in news and  sociopolitical television and radio programs." The Court of  Appeal will resolve disputes on the allocation of airtime to  parliamentary factions.    The statute gives the Court of Appeal the right to "order  the  rectification of factual errors in media news reports concerning  the public interest," to make representations regarding the  submission of written warnings to media sponsors and editorial  offices and, following such warnings, to make representations  for the activities of the media to be judicially wound up. The  court has the right to reprimand journalists and to raise the  question of instituting proceedings against them if they have  violated "generally accepted ethical norms."    This level of jurisdiction and the range of powers available  to the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes makes it very  similar to an organ of censorship -- albeit one after the event  rather than before the event. Admittedly, such censorship would  be useful, for instance, in the sphere of protecting public  morality from chauvinist propaganda, violence, or pornography,  but the court's direct dependence on the President's  Administration also creates the threat that its censorship  powers might be used for political purposes -- particularly in  light of the vague criteria for "generally accepted ethical  norms."    In personal conversation Anatoliy Vengerov categorically  dissociated himself from the claims that he is a censor,  pointing out that, on the contrary, the Court of Appeal intends  primarily to campaign for the extension of journalists' rights  and their unswerving observance by officials, and to fight  infringements of the media's freedom and, in particular, the way  in which journalists' right to obtain socially important  information is ignored. The Court of Appeal chairman advocated  close cooperation between this state organ and journalists.    From the journalists' standpoint, the fact that the Court of  Appeal for Information Disputes is being set up is as yet hard  to assess unambiguously. Some of the organ's functions could  undoubtedly serve to promote genuine free speech. At the same  time, under certain circumstances the Court of Appeal could also  pursue a policy of actually restricting free speech and  interfering in matters which would be better left to journalists  themselves within the framework of the Law on the Press or a  general civil process without the importunate help of special  state organs. Incidentally, we as yet have no cause to rebuke  the Court of Appeal for anything of the kind, and journalists  are initially inclined to cooperate with it rather than to be in  confrontation with it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Sa'id Sadi, president of the </F> Algerian Movement for the Republic and secretary general of the  Rally for Culture and Democracy, by Irina de Chikoff and  Philippe Gelie; place and date not given: "Algeria: Said  Sadi's Appeal for Resistance; According to the Democrats'  Leader, `Algerian Society' Has Understood That It Has To Assume  Responsibility Itself, Even for Security Issues" -- first six  paragraphs are LE FIGARO introduction]    [Text] The president of the Movement for the Republic, a  46-year old doctor and psychiatrist who is secretary general of  the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD], has just launched an  appeal for resistance in Algiers.    He was one of the few politicians present during the 22  March  demonstration in which more than 50,000 people, mainly women,  marched through the streets of the capital to present a  rejection front to the violence of the Islamic fundamentalists.  He has never minced his words in talking about the violent  collapse of the regime formed immediately after independence, of  which fundamentalism is just a by-product. He condemns the  government's relentless pursuit of the same policy despite all  the evidence, namely advocating dialogue with the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front] leaders while repressing acts of terrorism.    Condemned by the armed Islamic groups, Said Sadi continues  to  live in Algeria. Forced to constantly move house and cover his  tracks, he makes numerous speeches and attends numerous meetings  throughout the country to rally around a single republican  platform all those who are not yet resigned to the worst.    Born in a poor family in Aghriba near Tizi Ouzou -- his  father was a road mender -- Said Sadi has always been an  oppositionist. As a high school student he had a brush with  prison. As a student, he was frequently in trouble with the  authorities because he took part in cultural groups which  escaped the control of the single party. Said Sadi became a  doctor and is the driving force of Berber Spring. In 1980, he  organized the first general strike in Kabylia against the  dictatorship and appeared before the State Security Court.    Barely had he been released when he reoffended. In 1982 Said  Sadi headed a semiclandestine publication. Between 1983 and  1985, he worked on the creation of the Human Rights League.  Brought before the courts once again, he was condemned to three  years' imprisonment and remained in the Lambese prison.  Pardoned in 1987, he did not give up. He was behind a new  strike and called for the holding of a national assembly of the  Amazigh cultural movement, which resulted in the creation of the  RCD which, in the June 1990 municipal elections, won 87 communes  whereas the fundamentalists won 900 city councils.    When Mohammed Boudiaf became president of the HCE (Higher  State Committee), Said Sadi regained hope, but the head of state  was assassinated six months after his return to Algeria in June  1992. Disaster. Panic. The political class did nothing or  emigrated. Said Sadi has not given up. He knows that his  country is already at war. He chose his camp a long time ago --  that of resistance. He is organizing it.    [LE FIGARO] You have just launched an appeal for resistance.  Do you think that Algeria is at war?    [Sadi] A civil war is being imposed on society and we must  face it. One section of the nation is organizing the genocide  of the other. I will mention just two examples: Outside a high  school in the suburbs of Algiers, a 13-year old boy had his  throat cut simply because his father is a policeman. A young  woman who refused to wear the veil was shot in the head.  Hitherto, the majority of Algerians felt that the defense of  individuals and goods should be entrusted to the state. It must  be admitted that this state is defective. We can no longer  spend our time burying our dead.    [LE FIGARO] Does the 22 March demonstration in Algiers,  which brought together 50,000 people, the majority of them  women, mark a turning-point in the struggle against the FIS?    [Sadi] It is a turning-point for two reasons. First, this  demonstration was organized by citizens' movements and  associations of women who are among those most seriously  threatened by radical Islamic fundamentalism. They are now  taking up the fight. Second, this demonstration took place  under the banner of resistance. The slogans clearly proclaimed  the rejection of a fundamentalism which is the product of the  existing system. Society has understood that it must assume  responsibility itself, even for security issues.    [LE FIGARO] Are you planning armed resistance?    [Sadi] Without waiting for my appeal, armed groups have been  formed, self-defense cells are emerging to resist  fundamentalism. It was therefore necessary to react before  control was lost. Just because you are a democrat, it does not  mean that you are incapable of using a gun, but war is not the  only way of bringing down this regime.    [LE FIGARO] What kind of action are you envisaging?    [Sadi] Demonstrations, especially in Kabylia on 20 April,  repeated strikes throughout the country, a boycott of the  schools which have become terrorist factories... The situation  is deadlocked, but it will not continue to be for long. The  word resistance has spread like a trail of gunpowder.    [LE FIGARO] Who will wage this struggle with you?    [Sadi] The priority is to channel all those who reject the  Islamic fundamentalist plan. The trade unions, the  associations, the political parties understand that they are all  equally threatened. The issue goes beyond government-opposition  splits. I know senior officials, officers, and diplomats who  fully support our approach. Civilian society cannot accept  being the hostage of the government and the Islamic  fundamentalists. The match will be a three-sided one.    [LE FIGARO] Do you want to open up a "third path" between  the FIS and the FLN [National Liberation Front]?    [Sadi] I reject the idea that the FIS and FLN represent two  antagonistic options. The FIS is the FLN painted green. Most  of its political cadres come from the FLN's inner circle.  Islamic fundamentalism is a natural but radical variant of the  FLN.    [LE FIGARO] Who is the main enemy?    [Sadi] We must first deal with the government, force it to  step down and free the state from the clans. What does the FIS  trade on other than the government's negligence and corruption?  I am convinced that the Islamic fundamentalists would lose  their credibility if the existing regime fell.    [LE FIGARO] How can it be forced to step down?    [Sadi] It is a struggle: These things cannot be requested,  they must be seized.    [LE FIGARO] Surely you also have to be able to organize the  resistance?    [Sadi] That is the whole problem. The majority of the  population are disorientated, crushed by the weight of social  problems. But thinking and active Algeria totally supports our  idea for resistance and change.    [LE FIGARO] Is that Algeria not tempted by exile?    [Sadi] A race against time has started, between safeguarding  the country and despair. I refuse to cast any stones at those  leaving.    [LE FIGARO] Will you not help the FIS by first targeting the  existing government?    [Sadi] It is a risk. The Islamic movement's ability to  cause trouble is strong enough to take advantage of a power  vacuum. The FIS is at war, it is trying to win it. The  transfer of power must not be chaotic.    [LE FIGARO] Otherwise?    [Sadi] There are three possible scenarios. First, the  collapse of the state. Algiers will not be Tehran but Kabul:  We do not have the 2,000 ayatollahs or the 4,000 mullahs who  could replace the state with a theocracy. Second, the country's  collapse, because Algerian national consciousness is fairly  recent. Third hypothesis on which we need to work: All the  nation's vital forces say: "That is enough! This suicidal  course of tolerating corruption in the heart of the government  must be stopped!"    [LE FIGARO] President Zeroual has decided to open the  dialogue to all political parties, including the FIS. What do  you have to say to him?    [Sadi] I have four questions to put to him: First, do you  believe it is possible to dissociate terrorism and  fundamentalism? Second, how can you hope that the country will  mobilize when you are haggling over the state in the visiting  rooms of Blida prison with the Islamic fundamentalist leaders?  Third, what form of Islam do you plan to uphold? Four, do you  accept that a definitive lesson should be learned from the  failure of the system to which you belong?    [LE FIGARO] Are you resolutely opposed to dialogue with  the Islamic fundamentalists?    [Sadi] I am not opposed to it on principle but what kind of  dialogue can you have through Kalashnikovs? For the time being,  the dialogue is merely a relentless pursuit of the same policy  despite the evidence. If it is to enable the clans to survive  by plunder, we already know where that has led us. Dialogue is  a means, not an end.    [LE FIGARO] Is there room for a moderate Islamic movement?    [Sadi] I have never believed in the idea of a moderate  Islamic movement in Algeria. What we have is an Islamic  movement born of frustration, it can only express itself through  extremes. Ali Belhadj (one of the FIS leaders) is the real  representative of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria: He always  represents outrage, extremes, and violence. He is the result of  a social failure which could have led to the extreme Left it had  been mature in 1970.    [LE FIGARO] So it is secular society against Islamic  fundamentalism?    [Sadi] I do not think there is any alternative. Religion  and politics must be separated. The regime claims to have found  a middle way which does not exist. Even the established Islamic  fundamentalists who tried to play that game have been  disqualified by the armed groups.    [LE FIGARO] Does the FIS really enjoy popular support?    [Sadi] If that were the case, Algeria would already have  toppled. It is perfectly possible to win back the FIS' social  base. Many young people who demonstrated with us last week were  in the streets with the FIS in 1991. It has constantly been  said that the small traders form the Islamic fundamentalists'  social base, but they closed their stores on 22 March.    [LE FIGARO] Why is Algeria deadlocked 30 years after  independence?    [Sadi] The regime's clan-based and mafia-based organization  prevented competition from emerging, efficiency has always been  regarded as a luxury we could do without. A kind of mediocrity  has been established at all levels. Algeria was rich. Some $12  billion in aid was showered on us and we managed to gain a debt  of $26 billion.    [LE FIGARO] Is the problem entirely political?    [Sadi] There is also a sociological division. More than 70  percent of the Algerian population is less than 30 years old. I  am 46: I have met with the seven or eight main political  parties in the country; I was the youngest. Young people are  going to extremes because they cannot identify with leaders who  are constantly looking to the past.    [LE FIGARO] What is your generation doing to counter that?    [Sadi] What little has been achieved is thanks to my  generation. But we are merely technical cooperation agents.  Those who administer have never had power and those who have  power have never administered.    [LE FIGARO] Do you expect any specific aid from France and  Europe?    [Sadi] What is happening in Algeria does not just concern  the Algerians. The aim is to uphold peace in the Mediterranean  basin. If our allies, who share the values of democracy, do not  support us, everybody will suffer. Tehran or Riyadh take their  alliances for granted. France and Europe are swinging between  compassion and rejection. They ought to stop their credit to  the existing government: They are transfusing a corpse, turning  the wheel of misfortune. It is a question of political ecology.    [LE FIGARO] Are you afraid of having to go into exile or  underground?    [Sadi] Nothing can be ruled out. But the democracy of exile  is not my style. I have to move house frequently, keep my  schedule secret... I have already been forced underground to  some extent.</p>

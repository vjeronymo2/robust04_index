			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Markets: Building societies suffer one of worst months ever  -At a glance Building societies had one of their worst months ever in September. Business was sharply down for both savings and mortgage lending activities. The accompanying graph shows the sudden drop in mortgage lending which fell last month to Pounds 446m, down from roughly Pounds 1.7bn in each of the previous two months. The figure was the lowest monthly total since 1982 and was exacerbated by the end of the stamp-duty holiday in August. There was also a net savings outflow of Pounds 264m last month compared with an inflow of Pounds 327m in August. Those struggling with their mortgage payments can refer to a new book produced by the Child Poverty Action Group, 'The Rights Guide for Home Owners' which gives homeowners details of schemes to help those in difficulty. The guide is available for Pounds 6.95 (incl p&amp;p) from CPAG, 4th floor, 1-5 Bath St, London EC1V 9PY.</p>

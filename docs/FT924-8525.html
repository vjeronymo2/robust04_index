			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 2: Bilateral route finds favour - Sara Webb examines banking relationships during a recession WHAT A difference a recession can make. While the 1980s were characterised by cheap and easy access to bank loans, the early 1990s will probably be remembered by UK corporate treasurers as a time of high borrowing costs and tighter credit. With the change in the economic climate, many companies are being forced to re-examine their banking relationships and the scale of their bank borrowings. Looking back on the 1980s, many corporate treasurers would agree that they were spoilt for funds. The banks competed fiercely for new business, with the result that companies were able to borrow at very fine margins. Indeed, the low pricing on loans and standby credit facilities often encouraged companies to set up credit facilities exceeding the amount they actually required. One of the most popular forms of borrowing was the Mof - or multi-option facility - which was prevalent in the late 1980s. A Mof consists of two parts: a committed portion (or backstop) where a bank syndicate is committed to lend at an agreed margin over the London interbank offered rate, as well as an uncommitted part (called the tender panel) where the banks compete to lend money, usually over the short term. Competition between the banks was so great that companies could obtain financing at margins of between  1/16 to  1/8 of a percentage point over Libor. 'There were plenty of corporate treasurers who thought it was a wonderfully cheap way to obtain money even if they didn't need the funds at the time,' reflects one UK banker. However, times have changed. For a start, the pricing on loans has increased substantially since the late 1980s as the international capital adequacy requirements agreed by the Basle Committee have forced international banks to adopt a more selective approach to lending. A rash of corporate disasters  -including such names as Polly Peck, Brent Walker and the Maxwell empire - has prompted bankers to pay closer attention to the creditworthiness of their customers. Many banks are now placing more emphasis on their loan covenants, with the inclusion of tighter financial ratios - particularly those concerning interest cover and gearing. Average spreads on new loans have risen from about 50-60 basis points in 1989-1990 to around 80 basis points in 1992, according to the recent OECD report, Financial Market Trends, June 1992. Bankers claim that the overall pricing - including spreads and fees - has risen two to three times since the 1980s. The increase in pricing has forced corporate treasurers to consider two points: whether they need to replace in full those loans and credit facilities approaching maturity, and whether there are cheaper ways of obtaining bank loans. On the first point, bankers agree that many companies borrowed far more money than they needed when the pricing on loans was low. 'In many cases, the companies didn't need the money, they just did Mofs because they were so cheap. Companies often borrowed between 30-70 per cent more than they needed, so when they come to renegotiate the credit facilities, they are likely to borrow far less,' says one banker. Another adds: 'We've seen plenty of companies scaling back their borrowings as their Mofs mature - after all, they ask themselves 'Why spend that amount on borrowing when we don't need it?' ' In addition, the debate among corporate treasurers and their bankers is now more likely to focus on the advantages of bilateral loans over syndicated credits. Several companies have chosen to refinance their borrowings using a series of bilateral loans. BP and Reckitt &amp; Colman have followed this route: when BP refinanced its borrowings last year, it cut back the amount of the loans and the number of banks involved. Choosing the bilateral route can mean a lower overall borrowing cost for the company. One banker cites the following example: 'We were approached by a company which wanted to refinance its loans. The company told each of its relationship banks to quote their terms for a three-year loan of between Dollars 50m-100m. It then borrowed from those banks which offered the most favourable pricing, so that instead of setting up a large syndicated credit, it had a series of bilateral loans, where each of the participating banks had a separate bank agreement and where the pricing varied slightly from bank to bank.' 'The bilateral route continues to be attractive to companies because it gives them much more clout over their banks and they can get finer terms that way,' says one of the European banks in London. In addition to obtaining finer pricing, some companies see the bilateral route as a way of spreading out the debt maturity dates. 'With a syndicated credit you have one loan and one maturity date - but not every company wants to have Dollars 500m maturing on the same day. Instead they may prefer to have bilateral loans which mature in stages,' points out one UK banker, although he adds that the borrower needs to have a well-organised treasury department to deal with the administration of a complex array of loans. Bilateral loans do have their disadvantages. It can prove much more difficult to raise a large amount in total using a series of bilaterals. Bankers argue that if a company needs to borrow a large amount all in one go, the syndicated loans market still provides the easiest means of doing so, but while pricing remains high, the level of corporate borrowing is likely to remain relatively subdued.</p>

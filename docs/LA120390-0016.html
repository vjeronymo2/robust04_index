That's all that mattered to Ray Perkins.  </P> <P> "It was kind of ugly, but I really don't care," the Buccaneer coach said Sunday  after Vinny Testaverde teamed up with Mark Carrier on a 35-yard touchdown pass  play with 39 seconds left to hand the Falcons their 17th consecutive loss on  the road.  </P> <P> "We made lots of mistakes, but it was awfully beautiful at the end," Perkins  said. "We played with more intensity and more belief that we could win than in  the last six weeks."  </P> <P> Testaverde completed 17 of 33 passes for a season-high 351 yards against the  NFL's worst pass defense. Tampa Bay's offense had its most productive day in  eight weeks with Willie Drewrey scoring on an 89-yard reception and Steve  Christie kicking field goals of 39, 44 and 21 yards.  </P> <P> "We should have scored a lot more points," said Perkins, whose team had scored  only 53 during the six-game slide that prompted fans to call for the coach's  dismissal.  </P> <P> "I don't really know whether this takes the pressure off anything, and I don't  care," Perkins said.  </P> <P> The defeat was the fifth in a row for Atlanta (3-9), which hasn't won on the  road since Nov. 20, 1988. Adding to the Falcons' frustration was the loss of  quarterback Chris Miller, who suffered a broken collarbone in the third quarter  and is out for the season.  </P> <P> The Buccaneers (5-8) intercepted three of Miller's passes before he was injured  after scrambling out of the end zone to the Atlanta 11, where Keith McCants  made a diving tackle.  </P> <P> Scott Campbell replaced Miller and the Atlanta offense responded positively.  Campbell completed his first five passes for 51 yards to sustain the drive, and  the Falcons went ahead, 14-13, on Mike Rozier's nine-yard run. The drive took  nearly nine minutes.  </P> <P> Christie's third field goal gave Tampa Bay a 16-14 lead with 10:03 to go, but  Campbell held his composure, Rozier continued to run effectively, and the  Falcons came back to regain a one-point lead on a 46-yard field goal by Greg  Davis.  </P> <P> "Scott Campbell did a good job moving the ball," Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville  said. "He gave us a chance to win."  </P></p>

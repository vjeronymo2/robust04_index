			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's  largest labor organization expressed hope Friday [17 June] for  an early return of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan,  SDPJ] to power and the formation of a stable government.    Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight million-strong  Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), voiced the desire in  a meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    ''It is extremely difficult for the current administration,  a  weak, minority government, to push for political, administrative  and economic reforms,'' Yamagishi told reporters following the  meeting.    It was the first meeting between leaders of Rengo and the  government since Hata took office in April.    The labor leader also urged Hata to take the lead in  persuading the second largest opposition SDP, a former coalition  party, to return to the fold and in strengthening the power base  of his government, Yamagishi added.    Rengo, founded in November 1989, supports the SDP and the  Democratic Socialist Party, a middle-of-the-road party in the  Hata administration.    Hata, who heads Japan's first minority government since  1955,  was quoted as replying he also longs for the SDP's early return  to power.    The prime minister reportedly agreed on Yamagishi's proposal  for holding a summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama to discuss the SDP's possible re-entry to the coalition  government.    Yamagishi also offered Hata a set of recommendations on  major  policy issues, including economic management, tax system reform  and pension system reform.    Hata and Yamagishi agreed on the need to hold a meeting  between the government and Rengo to build consensus on key  policy issues.</p>

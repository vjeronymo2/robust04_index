			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / People: Barclays' private banker plans to stay put Barclays' intention to expand its private banking presence in the UK is underscored by the arrival of Michael Tomalin as managing director of the newly structured private banking division, replacing Alan Hogg, former head of international private banking, who is posted to Barclays Northern Region. Tomalin, 45, has moved at considerable speed round the Barclays group - Barbados, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Tokyo and back to London (as head of financial institutions) within the past 12 years. 'Yes, I have flitted around a bit, but I now hope to stay put for some considerable while. As a private banker you should grow grey with your clients.' Hogg, 47, who was in charge of international private banking, had little time to grow grey companionably; he was transferred to become corp-orate director of the northern region after two and a half years on international private banking. 'He is an extremely strong commercial banker and comes from that part of the world,' explains Tomalin. The division has been renamed - dropping the 'international' - to reflect ambitions of building the UK end of what has hitherto been very much a cross-frontier operation. Tomalin sees private banking - a concept much trumpeted in the 1980s that is still adapting to the leaner 1990s - as the provision of 'corporate finance for private individuals'. Hinting that the bank intends to aim its service further up-market than are some of its clearing bank competitors, Tomalin will not be tied to setting a specific financial threshold. 'You don't set a minimum net worth for prospective purchasers of a Savile Row suit.' He sees his job as 'creating a honeypot' to encourage existing wealthy clients to put more of their assets with the bank, as well as attracting new money. 'And that is done by the quality not of our ads or livery but by the quality of the service,' he says after a month with his feet under the desk. ***** John Cotton is the new director of personnel for Barclays, succeeding Bill Gordon, recently appointed managing director of the banking division. Cotton was previously regional director covering south west London. ***** Martin Chick, previously publisher of Flyer, an aviation monthly from Insider Publications, has moved to become managing director of Rococo, a growing publishing and event management group based in Islington. Having helped take the circulation of Flyer from 0 to 35,000 in just over two and a half years, Chick's new job is to build the Rococo business, centred around the publication of annuals principally in the sporting field, towards the goal of a stock market flotation in a few years. Rococo is putting together the official review of the Barcelona Olympics, and has just signed an agreement with the Test and County Cricket Board for its major publications. Chick describes his two years with Edinburgh-based Insider as 'a rest because of the incredibly slow pace of life (in that City)'. Clearing up after a break-in at Rococo's premises last week, he maintained he was 'delighted to be back in the thick of it'. ***** Richard Jonas has become senior partner of CLUTTONS on the retirement of Rafe Clutton. ***** Shirley Powell, formerly head of human resources at AVCO TRUST, has been appointed personnel &amp; training director at HAPPY EATER RESTAURANTS, part of Forte. ***** Graham Andrews, company secretary of BUTTE MINING, has also been appointed finance director. ***** Gary Unsworth, director and founder of Nichols Foods, has been appointed to the board of the parent, J N NICHOLS (VIMTO). ***** David Davis is appointed PALMA's director with responsibility for group manufacturing; he moves from Robert H Lowe. ***** Malcolm Bruce has been promoted to director-in-charge of RACAL-DECCA SERVICE. ***** Ephraim Brasam has been appointed chairman of ACSIS GROUP. ***** Bob Peddie, previously chairman of the South East Electricity Board and a member of the Central Electricity Generating Board, has been appointed executive chairman of POLYMETERS RESPONSE INTERNATIONAL.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Belgian Bonds: Snowballing debt keeps yields above 7% IN the European bond market rush for the pot of gold, Belgium has been left at the back of the queue. While its EC partners have seen phenomenal rallies in the past few months the Belgian bond market has languished. A league table of international debt markets monitored by J. P. Morgan shows Belgium as the worst performer in August, providing a return of only 0.61 per cent in local currency terms - for the same period Italy's return rose 5.54 per cent. Then, late last week, when many were beginning to consider that Belgian debt prices had been left too far behind, the central bank announced it was raising central interest rates from 9.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The news sent bond prices plunging by up to two percentage points for some maturities. A wave of selling pushed the yield on 10-year bonds back up to 7.3 per cent against 7 per cent in July. On Friday, prices continued to fall and yields to rise, widening the gap with German bund returns to some 115 basis points as the market factored in a slide in the Belgian franc to BFr22 against the D-Mark. Some analysts believe there will be no pick-up until early November and then only if wages are frozen under the social pact to be thrashed out at the end of the month. Belgium's problems are encapsulated in its soaring public debt, which stood at around 116 per cent to GNP last year, the highest in the OECD. Ms Jane Edwards, economist with Lehman Brothers, says the recession and the central bank's determination to maintain high rates to protect the currency's parity with the D-Mark are leading to snowballing debt, a situation where debt spirals because high debt means high interest rates which lead to more debt. She says interest payments on public debt were close to BFr800bn last year and are unlikely to fall this year or next. Ms Edwards argues that Belgian bonds will be attractive once a wage agreement is reached. But any solution to the crisis is likely to involve lower short-term rates which will also weaken the currency, so overseas buyers would have to hedge against currency falls. A more optimistic case is put by Bear Stearns, the US securities house, which has taken the widening spread between Belgian and German 10-year paper as a pointer to the prospective value and recommends a switch from bunds to Belgian paper. Mr Craig Shute, an economist with Bear Stearns, claims: 'Domestic considerations point to lower short-term rates by the end of the year, even if it means breaking the franc/mark tie.' Mr Shute published his research shortly before last Thursday's plunge and when the bund/Belgian bond spread was around 85 basis points. Whether his enthusiasm is justified depends on whether Belgium is prepared to unshackle its monetary policy from that of Germany, where unification has led to relatively high inflation that has to be fought by a tight monetary policy. As with Denmark, Belgium fears that a decoupling of monetary policy from Germany would reveal fundamental economic problems that could be ignored when the European monetary union project was strong. But since the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism divergence margins from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent the German link has looked increasingly spurious. Two weeks ago, a group of 14 Flemish economists called for monetary policy to be relaxed. They said that continuing to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark - a policy pursued since 1990 - would damage industry and employment prospects and was no longer an acceptable option. Late on Friday, speculation that the Belgian franc's tight link to the D-mark would be dropped as well as news that the state budget deficit rose to BFr76.9bn in August left short- and long-term debt markets rudderless.</p>

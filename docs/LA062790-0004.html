			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPROVING BUSING PROGRAM  </P> <P> Your article on the failure of busing to raise the test scores of bused  students opens the door to a practical alternative ("Minority Gains Limited in  L.A. Busing Program," Part A, June 17).  </P> <P> Why not spend the monies on busing for extra teachers and/or teachers aides to  work with the students during the time they now spend being bused.  </P> <P> This accomplishes several good things at the same time at no additional cost:  1) extra time to learn, 2) supervisors to help offset the latch-key problem  and, 3) a chance to develop friendships with the entire neighborhood after  school hours.  </P> <P> The management of time concept is what life is all about, more time to do both  the things we should and want to do. Busing denies the use of optional time,  where a child has the right to decide. Through a good selection of non-academic  supervisors replacing bus drivers for this busing period we may find some  favorable role models so often missed at home.  </P> <P> FREEMAN F.

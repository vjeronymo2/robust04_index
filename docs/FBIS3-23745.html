			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tuykov, Sverdlovsk Oblast procurator, </F> honored jurist of the Russian Federation: "Nowhere Are There So  Many Laws and So Much Lawlessness as in Russia"]    [Text] "Privatization." This word is all we hear. And  it is no wonder, since the state property is being divided up,  and this is being done with a purely Russian sweep. According to  the statement of Anatoliy Chubays, a miracle has occurred:  "Privatization in Russia has come to pass!"    But now let us take a closer look at miracles. When the  question of the results of procurator's investigations into  implementation of legislation on privatization of state and  municipal property was being discussed at the meeting of the  Sverdlovsk Oblast procurator's office governing board, the  following question was asked, among others: "Is there even one  object which has been privatized correctly?"    Of course there is. By its rate of privatization, Sverdlovsk  Oblast is one of the leaders in the country. Contracts of  purchase and sale have been concluded for 2,650 facilities, for  a sum of 9 billion rubles (R). A particular onslaught was noted  in the sphere of services: Around 75 percent of the facilities  in trade, public catering and consumer services passed over to  private ownership.    But, alas, these tempos and accelerations, these leaps and  shocks! Is the state not selling itself off too hastily and  generously, sometimes to the point of incredibility? That is  banal, you say, we are tired of it. I agree. Yet the facts  remain...    Let us take, for example, the supermarket "Kirovskiy" which  is known to all in Yekaterinburg. By law, it must be auctioned  off in such a way that the state will retain its share. However,  it turns out that it was sold to individuals--founders of the  closed joint-stock company "Yunezis"--for a mere R10 million. A  gigantic store--for the price of a one-room apartment. Moreover,  the owners have up until the year 1996 to pay 90 percent of this  sum.    The management of the former production association (today  the joint-stock company) "Uralmash" has handed over the former  state store to the limited partnership "Orion" for R126,000.  Moreover, by decision of the oblast committee on administration  of state property, the laboratory unit of the Central  Scientific-Research Institute of Metallurgy and Materials was  simply given over to the balance sheet of the private firm  "MKM-Standart." In this case, the value of the property,  according to the certificate of transfer, comprised R1,836,000,  although the actual figure is somewhat different--R31,347,000.  These are truly czar's gifts.    Such examples are not singular. Perhaps we could write them  off to the shortcomings of the now former State Program of  Privatization for 1992, which existed only until the end of last  year. It was this program which set the so-called "accounting  indicators for privatization of state and municipal enterprises  for 1992 for the krays and oblasts." But to put it simply, the  percentages on what and how much must be sold to private hands  in one region or another were handed down from above. Moreover,  it was reported that these indicators were "minimal."    For example, the "plan" obligated Sverdlovsk Oblast to  privatization only in the light and food industry, construction,  retail and wholesale trade, public catering and consumer  services, comprising from 45 to 60 percent of all enterprises.  Thus, the fervor of some local bureaucrats stems from the  authors of the now defunct program.    It was primarily small enterprises, and more rarely  medium-sized ones, which fell under these percentages. Yet the  large ones which occupied a dominant position at the federal or  local levels (and there are also many of these in our oblast)  were permitted to privatize only by decision of the government  or the Goskomimushchesto [State Committee on Administration of  Property] of Russia.    And so finally, on 24 December 1993, the new State Program  for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the  Russian Federation which had been presented by the government  was ratified by edict of the Russian Federation President. As a  man who in the recent past has had work experience in the  supreme legislative agency of Russia, I am convinced that this  program will evoke a non-synonymous evaluation among the Federal  Assembly and will be one of the first rather debatable questions.    As is the rule, the next program organically stems from the  preceding one and at the same time contains much that is new. We  would like to note two curious circumstances which lie, so to  speak, on the surface. As before, accounting indicators are  retained for the regions. However, while before they were  directly secured in the program ratified by resolution of the  Supreme Soviet and having the force of law, now these  "guidelines" will be handed down to the agencies of state power  of the republics within the make-up of the Russian Federation,  the krays and oblasts by the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, and  moreover with increasing totals.    That is the way it is. And there is no need to argue. Read  the program, and you will understand why. With the consent of  the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, additional methods of  privatization may be used, but only by those regions which, and  we quote, "have reached the highest indicators in implementing  privatization" and have been included in a special list ratified  by the government of Russia.    And since they have made it to this list, they have the  right  to independently make decisions on privatization of those very  same large, dominant, all-federal and similar (with certain  exceptions) facilities without obtaining any permission from the  government of Russia.    And so, there are the tempos for you! So it is better not to  be indignant, but to get to down to business. And not to forget  that "allocation of financial resources to regions is performed  with consideration of their fulfillment of the State Program of  Privatization."    Skeptics will say: "There will not be enough money to buy  such enterprises." And again they will be wrong. The program has  one other peculiarity in this regard: While before the personal  savings of citizens, privatization checks, private as well as  loaned funds of legal persons were listed as sources of funds  for acquisition of state facilities, today those who have no  money can take personal credit in any commercial or, if you  like, foreign bank. So hurry to get in line at the banks. Who  knows, you may become a large-scale property owner...    Of course, we cannot do without shortcomings. And the most  unpleasant of these are violations of the laws. According to the  effective legislation, the right to appeal to a court of  arbitration is granted to practically any organizations,  entrepreneurs, or simply to individuals.    Here they have once again "forgotten" about the procurator.  We are referring to the procurator of a city or rayon who can  appeal to a court of arbitration in defense of state and public  interests only through the oblast procurator. Although it is  clear that this will require additional time and, as a result,  the efficiency of reacting to violations of the laws will be  lost. The oblast procurators, in turn, cannot independently  protest the decision of the arbitration court. They must appeal  to the Procurator General's office for this.    This question was raised repeatedly at different levels, but  without result. Moreover, we know that most of the legal  violations occur specifically in the local areas. This is  evidenced also by the procurator's investigations.    Unfortunately, it has become a customary situation for  private owners not to keep the enterprise which they have  purchased, despite the conditions of privatization. In one of  the largest rayons of Yekaterinburg, with its million-and-a-half  population, there is practically not a single operating barber  shop, and specialized bakery and dairy stores are violating the  conditions of their agreements.    There is no sense in listing all the destruction which has  been permitted, due largely to the ambiguity, confusion and  contradictory nature of the laws, as well as the personal  irresponsibility and professional incompetence of the people  "making" privatization. It is true what they say: Nowhere are  there so many laws and so much lawlessness as in Russia.    The new Constitution of Russia states that all types of  ownership, including also state property, is equally protected  by law. But by which one? By the antiquated criminal code, which  has long been in need of radical changes? Or perhaps by the  effective law, "On Property in the RSFSR," which merely  declared, and nothing more, that the loss inflicted upon an  owner by a crime is to be compensated by the state?    The new state program will undoubtedly stimulate the process  of privatization and give it greater scope.</p>

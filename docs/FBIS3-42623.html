Russia has never had enough  food. In 1989 the need for basic agricultural products was met  by only 58 percent. In 1993 this indicator dropped to 37  percent. What awaits us in 1994?    These figures were mentioned at a board meeting of the RF  Committee on Trade, where the food problem was discussed.    During 11 months, as compared with the same period of last  year, the volumes of sales of livestock and poultry for  slaughtering decreased in 67 out of Russia's 77 regions, of  milk, in 61 regions, and of eggs, in 35 regions. The reduction  in the stock of cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats, owing to its  considerable discarding on kolkhozes and sovkhozes, is  compensated for only partially by the increase in the number of  animals in private homesteads. The breeding stock has also  decreased in many regions, which undermines the foundations of  animal husbandry over the long term.    During 11 months of 1993, as compared with 1992, the  production of basic foodstuffs decreased as follows: of meat, by  16 percent; of butter, by 4 percent; of sugar, by 5 percent; of  vegetable oil; by 34 percent; of whole milk products, by 16  percent.    In Russia in the middle of December the average price per kg  of first-category beef was 1,949 rubles. Throughout cities the  situation with prices looked as follows: in Kemerovo, 2,800  rubles; in Murmansk, 2,622 rubles; in Ryazan, 1,784 rubles; in  Belgorod, 1,440 rubles; in Ulyanovsk, 561 rubles. Milk prices  also differ very substantially: in Arkhangelsk, 390 rubles; in  Kemerovo, 360 rubles; in Kirov, 248 rubles; in Tula, 192 rubles;  in Ulyanovsk, 61 rubles. There is a big "spread" in the cost of  bread. The most expensive is in Kemerovo--311 rubles. The  cheapest is in Ulyanovsk--47 rubles. Sugar: in Tyumen, 900  rubles; in Kemerovo, 311 rubles; in Belgorod, 581 rubles; on the  average throughout Russia, 708 rubles per kg.    A reduction in livestock products is expected this year. The  state purchase of [refined] and raw sugar is not envisaged,  whereas only one-third of the needs of the Russian Federation  for sugar are met by its own production. Vegetable oil and milk  products will not be sufficient. There will not be enough  vegetable oil and milk products. In 1994 it is difficult to  forecast the import of foodstuffs purchased by state and other  organizations and enterprises in connection with the lack of  clarity about customs duties for their import.    It should be stated that the per-capita delivery of basic  food products has decreased annually and in 1993, in relation to  the 1991 level, comprised the following: of meat products, 58  percent; of milk products, 64 percent; of vegetable oil, 38  percent; of sugar, 84 percent.    In 1993, as compared with 1992, the sale of fish declined to  45 percent. And this, despite the fact that the fishing fleet  came to a standstill--ships were filled with products. The  volumes of export of fish products from the country exceed the  consumption inside the country, although everyone knows that the  demand of the Russian people has not been met. With regard to  this year resources are quite sufficient. However, the  exorbitantly high transport rates spoil everything. For example,  the delivery of every kilogram of fish from the Far East costs  240 rubles. The price of fish products in retail trade has long  outstripped meat products.    A reduction in the production of canned goods is not  expected. There are no problems with salt. Its remainders in  warehouses are increasing. Vodka is the only product, the sale  of which proceeded "with a plus" last year, making up 106  percent of the 1992 level. Things are not going too well with  tobacco. The domestic industry is capable of meeting only 50 to  60 percent of the need for tobacco products. Previously, imports  rescued us. Now the excise on tobacco greatly hampers deliveries  from abroad. And so, if nothing changes, it will not be possible  to meet the population's demand.    As was noted at the last board meeting of the RF Committee  on  Trade, with the shortage of food resources in Russia the  creation of insurance food volumes is simply necessary for a  guaranteed supply for servicemen and residents of the Far North  and of ecologically polluted territories of large industrial  centers, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, and for the  fulfillment of state goal-oriented programs adopted by Russia's  government--"Children of Chernobyl," "Children of the North,"  "Protection of the Russian Federation Population Against the  Effect of the Chernobyl Catastrophe," and others.    The RF Committee on Trade advocates the preservation of  federal food stocks for this year at last year's level. However,  the draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Food Deliveries  for Federal Needs for 1994" provides for a significant reduction  in the volumes and number of consumers of these stocks. It  proposes that they be formed only in order to provide the  military and categories of consumers equated with them, to  replenish state reserves, and to create operational government  reserves--and only of several types of foodstuffs at that.    In this case federal stocks are envisaged in the following  volumes: of grain--9.6 million tonnes, or 96 percent of the 1993  level; of meat products--633,000 tonnes, or 37 percent; of dairy  products--3,349,000 tonnes, or 26 percent; of  vegetables--466,000 tonnes, or 48 percent; of sugar--839,000  tonnes, or 20 percent; of vegetable oil--166,000 tonnes, or 15  percent; of eggs--1,445 million, or 9 percent.    In order to provide incentives for rural commodity  producers,  it is planned to make advance deliveries amounting to no less  than 70 percent of the value of contracted products. Despite the  fact that Russia's Ministry of Agriculture, the RF Committee on  the Food and Processing Industry, the RF Committee on Fishing,  and the Roskhleboprodukt Joint-Stock Company insist on the  preservation of previous volumes of federal stocks, the Ministry  of Economics considers it possible to allocate funds only if the  number of federal recipients is reduced.    Recently, a special subdivision engaged in problems of  commodity supply for Moscow has been established in the RF  Committee on Trade. How to feed the city of many millions? This  question has always been quite acute. The committee has prepared  a draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Measures To  Provide the Population of the City of Moscow With Food During  the First Half Year of 1994," which determines the volumes of  basic food products at the 1993 level. However, the fair on the  sale of food products held in the capital on 16-17 December made  it possible to conclude contracts for their delivery in 1994  from Russia's regions as follows: of meat--75,000 tonnes, or 62  percent of the volumes, which, according to our calculations,  are needed; of butter--7,500 tonnes, or 75 percent; of dry  milk--2,000 tonnes, or 67 percent; of vegetable oil--0,100  tonnes, or 0.2 percent. Only cheese (5,700 tonnes, or 190  percent) and sugar (60,000 tonnes, or 120 percent) will be  sufficient until July. Undoubtedly, Moscow is a special city  both in terms of the number of its residents, its status, and  other indicators. The RF Committee on Trade advocates that the  country's capital also be included among federal recipients.  Unfortunately, the Ministry of Economics has another opinion.    To all the above-stated I would like to add that the new  customs duties on many key food products greatly aggravate the  food situation. The RF Committee on Trade asked the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations not to apply customs duties to meat,  meat products, milk, dairy products, sugar, vegetable oil, and  baby food at least for contracts concluded before 1 January 1994.    Thus, all forecasts can be made only tentatively, except for  one: under conditions of the increase in inflationary processes,  the crisis of insolvency and financial instability of  enterprises, and the unbalance of previous trade relations a  saturation of the market with food at prices within the reach of  the basic population is not foreseen.</p>

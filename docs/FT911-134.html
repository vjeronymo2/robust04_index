			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): Paperless trading offers single market opportunities - EDI, the switch gathers pace MANUFACTURING companies have identified EDI (electronic data interchange, or paperless trading) as potentially one of their most effective weapons in the battle for survival. Hundreds of British manufacturing companies are beginning to feel the benefits of cutting out bureaucracy and dealing via computer to place orders, send invoices and make payments. Some British manufacturers believe that they could derive significant advantages from EDI when the single European market is fully operational. The UK is well advanced in EDI compared to other European countries because of the development of standards by the Article Number Association and the Simpler Trading Procedures Board and because of value-added network services created in the wake of telecommunications deregulation. The ANA developed Tradacoms, the UK standard for trading communications, in 1982. This gave birth to services such as Tradanet offered by International Network Services (INS), the EDI supplier co-owned by ICL and General Electric Information Services of the US. About 1,500 UK manufacturers do business via Tradanet. As companies search for ways of improving their business operations, they have realised that many changes will be dependent on direct computer-to-computer links with their suppliers and customers. In particular, Jit (just in time manufacturing, a manufacturing philosophy which has spread from Japan across the world in the past 10 years) can only work properly on an EDI infrastructure. This represents a considerable change of attitude from the early days of EDI, when it was seen simply as a cost-cutting technique. Now the emphasis has moved from saving money to providing a better service to customers through swifter response to demand and more competitive prices. Supply chain management is the centre of attention. Members of the supply chain comprise what has been called a virtual organisation. This involves a new way of thinking about the whole production process. For example, in a virtual organisation it is possible to cut out duplication of quality assurance. Components which have been rigorously tested by the maker to his customer's standards are not re-tested on arrival at the customer but go directly into stock or, better still, straight into production. When component makers receive their orders and confirm delivery electronically, production scheduling can be more tightly controlled. The result can be shrinking lead times and stock is sharply reduced or eliminated. Not surprisingly, the vanguard of EDI users is to be found in sectors which are technologically-oriented. The electronics business began the switch in 1987. Leaders in that field, such as ICL, have progressed in the last three years to using EDI on an international scale to deal with component suppliers in the US and continental Europe. NCR uses EDI to exchange forecast demands regularly with its trading partners in a Jit environment. Texas Instruments makes a point of its EDI capability in its marketing slogan which insists it is 'better to do business with'. Telecommunications manufacturers are becoming keen EDI adherents. Mitel, the Canadian private branch exchange (PBX) maker which is 51 per cent owned by British Telecom, is in the process of converting. It expects to have over 30 of its suppliers communicating via computer by the end of the year for purchase orders. This will be followed by accepting invoices from suppliers electronically and then by paying them through the BACS banking network. Mr Jeremy Arnold, Mitel's EDI co-ordinator says that although cost-saving is important the main aim is to establish better long-term partnerships and cut lead times in production. The automotive sector is another which is taking up EDI rapidly, led by leading manufacturers including Rover, Peugeot-Talbot, Citroen and Renault. This sector, like others, has its own EDI user support group, called Odette, which is active in eight European countries and is run in the UK by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. According to Ms Kerry Shipley, its project manager, there are over 400 EDI user companies in the automotive business in the UK. This represents a high proportion of the leading companies but she notes that their use of EDI is still restricted to a few functions such as invoicing and delivery instructions. She expects to see a steady expansion in the number of types of message sent between members in the next five years. At the same time there may be a second wave of recruits to Odette as many smaller companies will be compelled by their larger customers to take up EDI. The big companies are not officially making EDI mandatory for their trading partners, but they are stressing that an EDI capability is one of the criteria for becoming a preferred supplier. Other EDI user groups serving specific sectors include Cefic for chemical companies and Edifice for electronics companies. Aerospace is another area in which large manufacturers are driving EDI down to small suppliers. British Aerospace, for example, keen to adopt a Jit approach, has begun using EDI not just with its production partners but with suppliers of other goods and services too. The laggard in EDI is still government. Manufacturers which supply ministries and local authorities are still generally unable to communicate with them electronically. However, even in this area there are signs of movement; the number of suppliers dealing electronically with the National Health Service has risen to over 250. Mr Patrick Tonks, marketing manager for INS, says that large companies have been putting a lot of effort into winning over their trading partners to the EDI method. Rather than simply imposing a rule that all business with them must be done electronically in future, they are holding seminars to persuade them of the benefits of the new systems. In the long term there is little doubt that any large or medium-sized company in manufacturing must go over to EDI. How long it will take is uncertain, but the trend is certainly accelerating; and it is one of the bright spots of the computer industry which must give it hope in its present time of crisis.</p>

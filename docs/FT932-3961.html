			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Leading Article: LA lawman IF NOTHING else, the voters in Los Angeles have taken a fair-sized leap in the dark by electing Mr Richard Riordan as mayor. He may have carried the Republican law and order banner, but he is a virtual political novice. His promise, like that of Mr Ross Perot, is that this very lack of conventional experience at least gives him a chance to try to apply so far largely untested, business-like solutions to the city's problems. There could be easier inner-city laboratories. Last year's riots demonstrated the extent of urban decay and attendant social and racial divisions. The Rebuild LA project, the business-led effort directed until recently by Mr Peter Ueberroth, has made only modest progress. The city's government, designed for a simpler age, is antiquated, an agglomeration of fiefdoms, such as the police force, over which the mayor often can exercise only minimal control. Even Tom Bradley, an artist at consensus for 20 years at City Hall, used to complain that his writ did not run far. But the problems of Los Angeles are still mostly different only in magnitude and complexity from those of other cities. Their collective plight is not short of analysis or advocacy. President Bill Clinton was the latest to weigh in, with a speech singling out for equal criticism his own Democratic party's addiction to the existing social welfare system and the Republican determination to starve the inner cities of the resources for recovery. Both are, indeed, salient features of their difficulties. Yet, as the Rev Martin Luther King was fond of saying, there can be 'a paralysis of analysis'. President Clinton's actions have so far been less impressive than his diagnostic rhetoric. Most of his proposals - some 'empowerment' zones, some summer jobs money, some innovative housing projects, a limited national service corps, greater police funding, a push for modest gun control - are both small scale and long term. Meanwhile the private sector, with not enough exceptions, steers clear of the inner cities' needs, which do not square with the macro-imperative of reducing the national budget deficit. Absent federal assistance on a grand scale and with state resources (most painfully in California) equally strained, a particular burden does fall on local initiative. To his credit, Mr Clinton is inclined to encourage this, supporting, for example, state reforms of Medicaid, the costly federal-state health programme for the elderly. Local officials insist they have greater flexibility under his administration than under previous federal governments, Republican and Democratic. Whether Mayor Riordan can avail himself of this licence by pursuing innovative programmes remains to be seen. What he would like, as would any other mayor, is a substantial economic recovery, but that, too, cannot be promised. And this is but the start of another long, hot summer.</p>

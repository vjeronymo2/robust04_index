			<p>BFN     [Text] A news conference was held at the DPRK Embassy in  China on 4 June to expose and condemn the unfairness and  irresponsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA]. Reporters from the Chinese media and foreign reporters  in China attended the news conference. DPRK Ambassador to China  Chu Chang-chun made remarks at the news conference.    Ambassador Chu said: The IAEA has recently issued  information indicating that it would not take the issue with the  discovery of a considerable amount of undeclared plutonium in  Japan. This shows the unfairness and irresponsibility of the  IAEA as it is.    Pointing out that originally the foundation of the  international organization's existence is based on its fairness,  he concretely disclosed: Regarding nuclear the inspections of  us, the IAEA has distorted the fact and submitted a wrong report  to the UN Security Council. Based on it, the UN Security  Council has adopted a so- called presidential statement, thus  kicking up an improper commotion. Also, he stressed that this  clearly shows the IAEA's unfairness.    He pointed out: The agency's behavior of backing Japan's  nuclear armament by looking on it with indifference, while  taking the issue with our peaceful nuclear activity under the  unjust pretext, thus submitting its inspections to political  intentions [kigu sachalul chongchijok uidoe pokchong  sikimyonso], is an act of gravely running counter to the spirit  of the IAEA itself. Also, he stressed that the agency must  revise its unjust position on the nuclear issue of Korea in  conformity with its own mission.    He appealed to reporters to correctly see the true color of  the Japanese authorities' nuclear ambitions and to disclose and  condemn them in the presence of the people throughout the world.  At the same time, he also appealed to them to pay attention to  the unfairness of the IAEA, which has conducted nuclear  inspections from the insidious political angle.    While answering reporters' questions, he stressed that it is  the United States that has built the largest nuclear depot in  the Far East by introducing nuclear weapons into South Korea,  and that has aroused the suspicion of nuclear development in the  DPRK, therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can  be only resolved by Korea-U.S. talks.    Referring to the so-called sanctions talked by the United  States and its followers, he stressed that as already declared  by the DPRK Government, we will regard any steps to impose  sanctions on us as a declaration of war. Also, he expressed the  conviction that as they have straightly embarked upon the single  road of victory with their own foot up to date by smashing all  kinds of obstructive plots by the U.S. imperialists, our people  -- in the future, too -- will be fully capable of defeating any  sanction steps with a strong might in which they are  single-heartedly united around the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, and that they will continue consolidating and  developing our country into a popular mass-centered socialist  powerful country, thus upholding the great leader Comrade Kim  Il- song.</p>

A powerful shock wave blew out a wall at the city's  well-known "Marcopizzi" Italian shoe store, incinerating the  display stands. The entrance hall at next door's  "Petrogradskaya" subway station was also affected. It was only  by good fortune that nobody was injured during this "firework  display."    Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The search for  the bombers has not yet yielded any results.</p>

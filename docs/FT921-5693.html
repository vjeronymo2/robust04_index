			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: MTM's warning on profits prompts shares to dive 21% SHARES IN MTM yesterday fell by 60 1/2 p to 226p after the specialist chemicals company warned that its profits for 1991 would fall substantially below City expectations. At one time the share price fell to 180p. The company said it was discussing with Binder Hamlyn, its auditor, the application of certain accounting policies, in particular in relation to the valuation of some fixed assets. MTM said it expected to recommend a final dividend of 3.73p, giving a total for the year of 5.6p, up from 5.1p in 1990. The company said its trading performance showed a sound, profitable business which demonstrated strong growth. MTM will now report on March 31 instead of this Thursday. The offending practice which caught the auditor's eye this year was MTM's capitalisation of some product and process costs. In previous years Binder Hamlyn had gone along with MTM's treatment of the process development costs as intangible assets. The impact of the auditor's change of interpretation, according to one analyst, appears to be to the reduction of pre-tax profits - forecast until yesterday at about Pounds 23m for the year - by between Pounds 2.5m and Pounds 4m. MTM said the full impact of the accounting interpretation has not yet become clear. Ultimately the tightening of the interpretation might work in MTM's favour, analysts believe. The change has no cash impact and MTM's shares have been trading at a discount to the chemical sector partly because of doubts about this less than conservative approach to the valuation of intangibles.</p>

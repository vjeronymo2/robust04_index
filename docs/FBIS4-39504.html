			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's Industry Minister Anatoliy </F> Holubchenko by Lyudmyla Nikolaychuk; place and date not given:  "Unless We Create an Industrial-Banking Union, the Banks Will  Begin To Die Following the Industry"]    [Text] [Nikolaychuk] Anatoliy Kostyantynovych, what, in  your opinion, must be the most urgent measures taken by the  parliament?    [Holubchenko] Undoubtedly, the most important thing today is  "to stir up production." A whole range of measures must be  adopted, which would allow producers to work normally, would  stimulate rather than choke them with taxes, and would defend  them against the highhandedness of bureaucrats, corruption, and  crime.    It is necessary to resolve the issue of working capital as  well as the indexation of people's banking accounts. The issue  of social protection of pensioners is also very acute, since, no  matter how surprising it seems to be, pensioners and elderly  people, who apparently have already done their job, are the most  politically active sector of society, which, in particular, was  confirmed by the elections. If normal living conditions were  created for them, they would become less politicized, and their  place would be filled by more reformist-minded people with the  advanced views. People, who currently live as our elderly  citizens do, cannot rest. What kind of rest can there be in  poverty? To create conditions for a normal life of pensioners,  which would allow us to conduct reforms, is also one of  parliament's tasks.    Relations between bankers and industrialists are another  very  serious, and probably even a key problem. Industrialists are  currently blaming bankers for all sins, and the latter are  blaming industrialists. None of them, however, has ever sat at  a negotiating table and discussed how to overcome the crisis. I  believe that a union of bankers and industrialists holds the  link, with the help of which one can pull out the whole chain.  Bankers must understand that they will live better only if they  are able to financially ensure normal work of industry.  Industrialists will then see bankers as not their enemies and  oppressors, but as friends and fellow champions. Clearing of  payments will then not take three months, and banks will not use  this money for credits, but they will want to quickly deliver  payments to customers. One must help these two groups reach an  understanding, and I believe that the parliament, the National  Bank, the Cabinet of Ministers, and perhaps new nonstate  industrial-banking unions can play a certain role in this.    [Nikolaychuk] As far as I know, you have been one of the  first people in Ukraine to suggest that the main reason behind  the crisis is the conflict between industrialists and bankers,  and that their union will be beneficial for the state. You have  built a whole concept around this issue. What is the main point?    [Holubchenko] Banks' profits have currently exceeded those  of industrial enterprises by three or four times. Additionally,  enterprises are being stopped and closed. But where are the  banks' profits? Where have they been directed, where are they  working, and where have they been invested?    Currently, our large industrial enterprises do not trust  small commercial banks -- they go only to large ones. But when  they need credits they ask small commercial banks, because they  cannot obtain them from large ones.... Banks must also  understand that when a customer comes to them and deposits money  or collateral, they must make all possible efforts to deliver  the money to the addressee within two or three days. A customer  who has money in an account must have the confidence that, no  matter what happens, when he orders a bank to transfer money, it  will be done. A bank must work in a way to ensure that it  always have these funds, and that a customer can receive a  credit on working capital whenever he wants. This is what  industrialists currently need. This is not someone's whim, but  a current demand. A bank must also be interested in investing  money in industry.    Of course, a bank must have the confidence that a customer  will not leave it, that he will pay the interest rate for a  credit received in time (since credit resources are essential),  and that it will receive a part of profits for investing its  capital in enterprises. This is an entire system that should  have the form of an agreement between a bank and an  industrialist.    For over a year and a half in my work in government, every  day I have been hearing from industrialists how bad bankers are,  and from bankers -- about bad industrialists. This is not  normal. Yet, they all do the same thing. I believe that when  bankers understand that their prosperity depends on industry's  wellbeing, things will be put in order in our country.    [Nikolaychuk] Yet, one can also understand bankers: Given  the current level of inflation, long-term credits are  unprofitable, and profits are produced only by short-term  credits, which, at best, can be used for purchasing ready-made  goods for resale, not for developing, or all the more, for  launching new production.    [Holubchenko] The point is that banks must give up huge  profits. They must live very modestly, in order to not let  industry die, and to help it overcome the crisis. If industry  stops, banks will have no place to obtain money, and nobody will  support them. Banks will begin to die following industry,  whether we want this or not. Our government must be wise enough  to conciliate the two forces and to convince them to work for  each other. It must create conditions for friendly work of  these two groups, so the search for guilty stops, and productive  work begins. This, of course, requires an appropriate training  of cadres, qualifications, skills, and talent. At least, I  would like to see such a new government -- not a fiscal one, but  creating normal relations and conditions for harmonious work.    [Nikolaychuk] Based on your theory, however, the government  will have to force banks to accept small profits, even if this  method of "carrot and stick" comprises much more of the second  component....    [Holubchenko] One must not force them! I am convinced that  if bankers sit at "a round table" with industrialists and become  aware of the state of affairs in industry, one will not have to  force them -- they themselves will agree to establish such a  union.    [Nikolaychuk] Who, in your opinion, can play the leading  role on both sides?    [Holubchenko] These can be, for example, the Association of  Commercial Banks and the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs and  Industrialists, led, of course, by the government.    [Nikolaychuk] Provided that your theory is implemented, when  can we expect positive results?    [Holubchenko] The point is that we do not have time for  long- term things and distant forecasts. Circumstances and the  crisis are advancing so rapidly, that we have, perhaps, a few  months to resolve such essential issues as, first of all, the  problem of working capital and the payment crisis, which would  allow the industry to rebound. By the way, a union of bankers  and industrialists can become one of the primary measures aimed  at overcoming the payment crisis. The payment crisis is a drag  on the path to move forward -- on political resolution to all  kinds of relations in Ukraine, on friendship among all parties,  on parliament's work, and the people's mood. It does not let us  breathe, it does not let us work, and it does not let us look to  the future. If one cannot see any perspective, one cannot move  forward.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Clothes prices lift RPI PRICE increases for clothing and household goods as new stock entered the shops and summer sales ended spurred the 0.4 per cent increase in the retail prices index last month, compared with August. In September, prices of clothes and shoes rose by 4 per cent on the previous month, the biggest rise in the sector for any September since 1917. However, on an annual basis prices continued to fall. They were 0.1 per cent lower than a year ago. The figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that dearer leisure services and a smaller-than-expected fall in seasonal food prices also contributed to the rise in the retail prices index from 138.9 in August to 139.4 last month. The CSO said seasonal food normally normally fall in September, but this year's drop was not as sharp as last year's, which was exceptional. Fresh fruit and potatoes were cheaper but there were price increases for some other fresh vegetables. As a result, seasonal food prices fell by 9.5 per cent in the year to September, compared with a drop of 12 per cent in the year to August. Housing costs increased last month. The CSO said that reflected an increase in the index for mortgage interest payments as the average outstanding mortgage debt continued to rise. On an annual basis, housing costs rose from 3.7 per cent in August to 3.9 per cent last month. The recent cut in base rates from 10 per cent to 9 per cent is not expected to affect the headline rate of inflation until November. A reduction of 1 percentage point in mortgage interest rates might knock about 0.4 percentage points off the all-items index. Higher fees for evening education classes at the beginning of the academic year pushed leisure services prices up by 2.2 per cent on the previous month. Lower prices for secondhand cars and cheaper petrol contributed to the 0.5 per cent fall in motoring expenditure last month.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK inflation rate (+3.6%)   RPI: 139.4 in September  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Housing (172)               +3.9% Motorinh (143)              +4.8% Food (non-seasonal) (130)   +2.9% Alcoholic drink (80)        +4.8% Household goods (77)        +1.8% Clothing &amp; footwear (59)    +0.1% Household services (48)     +5.1% Leisure goods (47)          +2.4% Catering (47)               +5.4% Fuel &amp; light (47)           -0.4% Personal goods, serv.

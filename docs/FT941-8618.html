			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Barbarians knock at the gates of the future of broadcasting At first glance it looks crazy that TeleCommunications Inc, the world's largest cable television company, should want to buy a 20 per cent stake in a modest ITV company broadcasting to Wales and the west of England. After all, TCI of Denver is about to become a Dollars 60bn (Pounds 41bn) concern through its merger with the Bell Atlantic telephone company, while HTV was fighting for survival last year with pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.5m. By coincidence the loss matched the annual bid the company made to see off three rivals in the ITV franchise contest. The deal involves Pounds 27m - a pittance compared with the hundreds of millions being spent by ITV companies taking each other over. Yet the closer you look, the more sense the deal makes. 'ITV is like a lake full of old pike eating each other. This is a completely new additive. It is not cannibalism,' said Mr Adam Singer, vice president international of TCI. He said it was the first time in British commercial television that two companies would be 'interacting across the whole spectrum of broadcasting,' from conventional television to cable and satellite television. The stake in HTV is being acquired by Flextech, the former oil services company which Mr Roger Luard has transformed into a media group. Ironically Flextech, the European investment vehicle for TCI, was an unsuccessful bidder for the Wales and the West ITV licence. Flextech through United Artists European Holdings, a wholly owned TCI subsidiary, either controls or has an interest in 11 cable and satellite channels, including The Children's Channel, Bravo, the classic films channel and Discovery, the factual and documentary channel. For HTV the advantages of the tie-up are enormous. At a stroke the company's debt, now at a seasonal low of Pounds 19m, is virtually wiped out and there is the chance of making programmes for the developing media market. If any old ITV pike are circling, HTV would now prove an indigestible and expensive bite. But more important, as Mr Louis Sherman, the HTV chairman said yesterday, it will help achieve the goal of 'forging alliances which will allow our television business to grow beyond the limits of the ITV franchise'. For Flextech the 20 per cent stake - the maximum permissible for a satellite channel owner under existing rules - gives a first link with a conventional broadcaster. 'We are terribly pleased as Visigoths to be allowed in to tour Rome for a day,' commented Mr Singer. Apart from securing two seats on the board, the 'barbarians' of the new media have their eyes on HTV's production and transmission facilities. It is likely that some Flextech satellite channels will be packaged and transmitted from Bristol or Cardiff. Local news programmes for cable networks are also a possibility. TCI has a 50 per cent stake in Telewest, the largest cable television group in the UK with 3.3m homes under franchise including the Bristol area.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Book Review: The move is on to Nowheresville USA EDGE CITY. Life on the New Frontier By Joel Garreau Doubleday Dollars 22.50. 546 pages One of the most dynamic urban centres in North America is a city with no name, merely a number: 287/78. You will not find it on any map, nor does it have a coherent civic government. Yet it, and the dozens more like it mushrooming across the US and Canada, may represent the biggest change in more than 100 years to how the western world builds its cities. 287/78 lies about an hour west of Wall Street, in the lightly wooded suburban sprawl of New Jersey. It takes what identity it has from the two interstate highways - 287 and 78 - which cross at this point. These good transport links have encouraged some of America's biggest companies to quit the dirt, high costs and sheer inconvenience of Manhattan for grassy new 'campuses' hidden away amid the clapboard and shingle homes and shopping strips. The world headquarters of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is here. So too are offices of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Bristol-Myers and Hoechst Celanese. 287/78 may not have a name, but it has more office space than downtown New Orleans. It may not have any commercial flights into its little airport, but so many corporate jets use it that it has its own customs shed. But this, you may be thinking, is no city. It has no centre, no soul, no shared history. It is merely a characterless, suburban excrescence, a ghastly monument to the power of unfettered American development capital. And that, says Joel Garreau, in his stimulating book, is where you would be very wrong. To him, 287/78 is a prime example of an 'edge city', a phenomenon which, like it or not, is 'the crucible of America's urban future', and an example the rest of the world is starting to follow. Edge cities are the mixed business, residential and shopping conurbations which have sprung up on the edge of America's big 19th century cities. Garreau reckons there are about 20 in the greater New York area alone. Other examples include the area around Houston's Galleria shopping mall, and the remarkable sprawl that is greater Los Angeles, probably the first edge city of all. Garreau, a journalist on the Washington Post newspaper, reckons that what we normally think of as a city, with a defined centre, tall buildings standing cheek-by-jowl, is a relic from the last century. What makes a city a city, he argues, is not how it looks, but how it functions, and edge cities exist because they provide an efficient answer to the needs of the computer, motor car and jet age. They are also a response to the age of the working woman, with employers realising in the 1970s they could tap a huge pool of well-educated, female, white-collar labour if they sited their offices out in the suburbs. For the most part, edge cities are the product of commercial developers  - 'the Medicis of the 20th century', according to one Houston planner - who have simply been responding to the iron laws of the marketplace. Garreau says: 'Their unshakeable observation was this: if they gave the people what they wanted, the people would give them money. The crazy quilt of edge city made perfect sense if you understood the place as the manifest pattern of millions of individual American desires over 75 years.' Good architects and planners, however, have tended to stand aloof, regarding the suburbs as 'sprawl gone wrong', and the people in them as 'so banal as to be utterly remote from their experience and interests'. Garreau defines an edge city as having at least 5m sq ft of office space - more than exists in downtown Memphis, Tennessee  - which is apparently the level needed to support a luxury hotel and set off further development. It must have 600,000 sq ft of retail space, enough for a large shopping mall, the edge city equivalent of the town square. It must also have more jobs than bedrooms, be perceived by the population as one place, and have been suburbs or cow pastures a mere 30 years ago. 'Making sense of an edge city,' he writes, 'requires the following leap of faith: any place that is a trade, employment and entertainment centre of vast magnitude is functionally a city. That is true no matter how sprawling and strange it looks physically, and no matter how anarchic it seems politically.' Garreau is on more controversial ground when he argues that this new phenomenon does not necessarily spell decay for America's old inner cities. He points out that the rise of edge cities has coincided with, and possibly provided the capital for, a striking revival in many of America's biggest city centres, which may become mainly cultural and tourist resources. That, however, is to brush aside the dire problems of the black urban underclass living alongside many of these cultural jewels - although he does point out that America's new black middle class is growing rapidly in edge city. This is an important book, wittily and entertainingly written in somewhat breathless journalistic prose. Its many pleasures include an amusing glossary of developers' English. Plants and trees are 'softscape'. Potholes are 'pavement deficiencies' and a beautiful building is 'one that is fully leased'. Garreau provides no clear answer to the central question of whether the edge city can rise above its sterile origins. He admits to depression on the subject during the four years in which he wrote this book. Yet whenever he lost hope, there was always someone on hand with good advice: 'Calm down, take deep breaths. These edge cities are only 10 to 20 years old. It took Venice 500 years to become what it is today. Our new edge cities are works in progress. It's just beginning to dawn on us that they are cities.' Quite so.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse chief executive quits MR PAUL LEGO, chairman and chief executive of Westinghouse Electric, is to quit the troubled US conglomerate. The Westinghouse board announced yesterday morning that Mr Lego, chairman since July 1990, had 'elected to retire', although he would remain a consultant to the group. The company gave no immediate explanation for the move, nor indication as to whether there had been pressure from the board. However, Westinghouse said it would hold a news conference on the resignation later in the day. The company elected Mr Richard Morrow, a retired chairman of the oil company Amoco, as chairman and Mr Gary Clark, 57 and president of special operations, as president and acting chief executive officer. Mr Morrow, 66, has been on the Westinghouse board since 1986. The board is to look for a new permanent chief executive, and said it would consider candidates from both inside and outside the company. Mr Lego's resignation came only 24 hours after Mr John Akers, chief executive of troubled International Business Machines, announced he was resigning. Over the past year, US boards and shareholder activists have grown much more aggressive in ousting managers at poorly-performing companies. An important example was set at General Motors, where the board forced the resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, who was deemed to be moving too slowly to reform the company. The 62-year-old Mr Lego and the Westinghouse board have been widely criticised over the past year by shareholder activists for failing to react with sufficient vigour to the severe problems of its financial services business. However, Mr Lego, a 37-year Westinghouse veteran, managed to soften the criticism last November when he announced a drastic restructuring of the group. This included plans to get out of financial services, cut its dividend, take a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge, and sell several businesses to bolster its balance sheet.</p>

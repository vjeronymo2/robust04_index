			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Foreigners hold 12% of shares Overseas investors held about 12 per cent, or Pounds 75bn, of all UK shares at the end of 1992, figures from the Central Statistical Office showed yesterday. US investors accounted for just under half of the overseas total, at Pounds 36bn, while the Japanese represented 2.7 per cent. Continental Europeans were the second largest overseas shareholders, owning about 17.5 per cent, or Pounds 13bn, followed by Opec investors, with 6.4 per cent, about Pounds 5bn. The figures appear in the CSO's annual share register survey, which includes investors' countries of residence for the first time. The figures are subject to uncertainty because the CSO was unable to allocate about Pounds 15bn of overseas holdings to particular areas. UK financial institutions held the largest proportion, 56.6 per cent, or Pounds 351bn, of UK shares. Among the institutions, pension funds were dominant, with around Pounds 215bn - or a third of all shares - and insurance companies with Pounds 103bn, about a sixth. Individuals owned 20.3 per cent. The survey revealed that about 23,000 holdings, worth between Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m, were held by individuals in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Registers of 191 companies were covered by the survey, representing about 79 per cent of the capitalisation of UK companies' ordinary shares listed on the International Stock Exchange in London.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / MPs in call to rejoin Unesco THE government should rejoin Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, a Commons committee said yesterday, Rachel Johnson writes. The government's claim that it could not afford Pounds 11m a year to re-enter the organisation was 'unconvincing', the foreign affairs committee said. It accused the government of making policy 'on the coat-tails of the US', which left Unesco in 1985, a year before the UK. The UK was a founder member of the organisation, set up in 1945 to promote international collaboration and respect for justice and human rights through education, science and culture. The UK took observer status in 1986, in spite of a warning from the committee. The government said it was concerned that too many personnel were concentrated in Paris rather than in the field, that administration was inefficient and that work was duplicated by other UN bodies 'with perhaps less political bias'. In 1990 the committee issued a further warning that Britain was failing to participate in important initiatives and urged the government to rejoin. The government refused, arguing that it was too soon to tell whether the organisation was 'genuinely on the mend'. The committee yesterday said that the government's objections had been overcome. Mr Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, had said in evidence that the few concerns left did 'not stand in the way of (the UK) joining'. The government now says, according to the committee, that spending pressures stand in the way of rejoining. Membership of Unesco, Fifth Report, Foreign Affairs Committee. HMSO. Pounds 14.40.</p>

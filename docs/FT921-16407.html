			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: GTE/Sprint The sale by GTE to United Telecom of its 20 per cent stake in Sprint looks like a backward step for the US long distance market. The Dollars 530m deal hands Sprint back into full ownership by United. The price looks absurdly cheap by international standards, although an old option agreement between the two companies dictated that. GTE tried to sell its stake to a third party, but, since players such as Cable and Wireless apparently baulked at the higher price asked of outsiders, United and MCI will remain the only real competitors to AT&amp;T. The US long distance market has been steadfastly resisting the trend towards globalisation of the telecoms industry. Until the regulatory climate changes, even a more powerful United offers little attraction to outsiders wanting to enter the market. British Aerospace It is a measure of investor disillusion with British Aerospace that the shares conspicuously lagged the end-year stock market rally. Since the Footsie bottomed out on December 23, BAe has underperformed the market by 6.5 per cent; over the last six months the underperformance is 47 per cent. Recent positive news has failed to impress, including this week's signal from the US State Department that it no longer objects to the sale of the 146 regional jet to Iran. The problem is that, even setting aside the Pounds 250m exceptional restructuring charge announced in mid-1991, there is still no sign of a profits stream sufficient to staunch BAe's outflow of cash. Negotiations on the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence contract, once promised for the end of 1991, are still apparently making progress, but doubts remain over the scope of any final deal or how much cash it will generate initially. The UK car market remains depressed, while demand is also turning down in France, Rover's largest export destination in Europe. As for Airbus, the weak dollar looks set to make for disappointing earnings from that quarter. On an historic basis the shares now yield nearly 11 per cent, but this means little when future dividends must be in doubt. Even after yesterday's 13p fall to 306p, the paper hardly represents a bargain.</p>

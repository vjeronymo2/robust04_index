			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A DULL and mostly downward day in stock market futures, with volume levels half of Friday's, left dealers gloomy about the short-term outlook, writes Christopher Price. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,845 and was initially squeezed up. It reached 2,849 within a short period, which turned out to be the high point of the session. Dealers said that with little new economic news to focus on - the official end to the recession already factored in to the price - buyers of June were few and the contract began a slow drift. A lacklustre Wall Street failed to inspire a rally and June continued its decline throughout the afternoon period, a fall that gathered momentum towards the close. It finished at 2,822, just two points ahead of what is seen as a significant resistance point for the contract. Dealers said the downward pressure was such that further weakness could be seen at the opening today. Should 2,820 be breached, the next resistance point is at 2,794 and then all the way down to 2,700. The more pessimistic futures traders are preparing for such a bout of short-term selling. The closing level was around 5 points below current fair value of 6. Volume was 7,509 lots. Forte topped the stock options list, with 2,020 contracts dealt. Bid candidate United Biscuits was also busy, with 1,648 lots transacted. The total volume was 22,056.</p>

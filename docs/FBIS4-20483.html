The institute also established purification  facilities that have 46 percent recovery rate and have  capability of fermenting 10 liters of genetically-engineered  bacteria. The purity of gamma-interferon produced by the plant  reaches WHO standard. The transformation of its  genetically-engineered bacteria into a clinically-useful drug by  the institute has led China to a new approach to industrialize  its biotechnology products.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Trends in Swedish jobs growth Sir, Your report, 'Swedish elections' (September 15), repeats the questionable statement, often made in the Swedish election campaign, that Sweden 'saw all of its employment growth between 1960 and 1993 derive from the public sector'. Statistics should be used in a more careful way. I do not have the employment figures from 1960, but from 1963 to 1993, employment in the private sector (excluding agriculture) has developed like this:  --------------------------- Period          Jobs    Gov.  --------------------------- 1963-1976    +62.600    soc. 1976-1982    -98.200    con. 1982-1991   +214.000    soc. 1991-1993   -304.500    con.  --------------------------- It is a curious fact that there is such strong correlation between the political colour of the government and the development of the private sector. For a non-biased observer it might look as if the economic policy of social democrats was more advantageous for the private sector than the conservative's.  Managers in the private sector argue that conservative governments - in spite of their performance statistics - are better for business than social democratic governments. Conservative governments have just had bad luck, they say. Be that as it may, the so-called Swedish model, which really is a social democratic model, has performed well under social democratic governments. It cannot be declared a failure because of the present crisis, which has been managed by parties opposed to the Swedish model, even though they are Swedish.

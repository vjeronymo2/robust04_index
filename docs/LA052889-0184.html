			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS HOLD 2ND RALLY AT CHINA CONSULATE IN L.A.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 Chinese students and sympathizers converged on the Chinese  Consulate in Los Angeles on Saturday, chanting "We Want Freedom!" with clenched  fists held high in response to a call for support from pro-democracy activists  in Beijing and elsewhere in China.  </P> <P> It was the second such demonstration in Los Angeles since student activists  began a sit-in at Beijing's Tian An Men Square and coincided with  demonstrations around the world. The demonstrators want political and economic  reforms in China and the resignation of Premier Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping,  China's paramount leader.  </P> <P> "This is in response to a call from Beijing to demonstrate the power of the  people and their desire for freedom and democracy in China," said Wang Youqi,  33, a student at Caltech and a leader of the Chinese Student Scholars Assn. "We  want freedom of speech and freedom of the press no matter who is in charge in  China."  </P> <P> The demonstrators gathered Saturday morning at Sun Yat-sen Square in Chinatown  before marching along a serpentine, five-mile route to the consulate on Shatto  Place. They waved placards that said "Down with Deng Xiaoping" and "Down with  the Communist Dictatorship." Some of the marchers yelled Min zhu! (democracy)  and Zi you! (freedom).  </P> <P> Dozens of students who participated in the protest vowed to camp out on the  steps of the consulate overnight and begin a symbolic 24-hour fast as part of a  worldwide fast in support of student activists in China who have staged  life-threatening hunger strikes.  </P> <P> The Chinese students came from colleges and universities throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> "It's exhilarating to be a part of history," said Pei Huang, 26, who is  studying applied physics at UC San Diego. "Democracy and personal freedom make  a country great and strong -- like the United States. That's what we want for  China."  </P> <P> Among the boisterous sympathizers at the consulate demonstration was Stephen  Yee, 69, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn.  </P> <P> "I feel good, good, good -- we have to stop communism over there," said Yee.  </P></p>

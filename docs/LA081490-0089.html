			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: MATTHEWS STUDIO PROFIT FALLS 8% IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Matthews Studio Equipment Group, a Burbank company that makes and rents movie  and television production equipment, said its fiscal third-quarter profit fell  8% from a year earlier despite a 51% jump in revenue.  </P> <P> The company's net income in the quarter that ended June 30 slipped to $180,648  from $196,584 a year earlier, while its revenue climbed to $5.86 million from  $3.88 million.  </P> <P> The latest quarter included a higher provision for income taxes, which  depressed earnings, Matthews said.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of its fiscal year, however, Matthews' profit soared  to $437,857 from $5,720, and its revenue rose to $14.8 million from $10.3  million. Matthews said the gains reflected its buildup of production equipment  available for lease, and the "extremely strong entertainment industry  environment" that maintained demand for its products.  </P></p>

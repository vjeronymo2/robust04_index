The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its statement  expressed "its concern about the European Council's resolution".    Until now, despite Azerbaijan's efforts, all internationally  adopted documents neglected to mention Armenia, as a country, as  a participant in the conflict.    The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs sees the  resolution of the European Council as "a success in Azerbaijan's  diplomacy".    A representative from the Greek Embassy in Baku stated that  they do not have the text of the resolution that was taken by  the European Council.    Greece is in charge of affairs concerning Azerbaijan for the  European Council.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Ecu bonds face an uncertain future - Richard Waters on the faltering performance of the Ecu market AN ambition postponed? Mr John Major, the UK's prime minister, yesterday delivered this blunt verdict on the future of the Ecu as Europe's single currency. If he is right, then the Ecu bond market could finally be consigned to oblivion after its faltering performance of recent weeks. The condition of the Ecu market this week has been as bad as at any time since Danish voters first punctured the politicians' optimism about European monetary union at the beginning of June. The French referendum - the event which only a fortnight ago was expected to determine the future of the market - has come and gone, and things are no better. Marketmakers continue to sit on large stocks of the bonds with no investors in sight. If anything, more institutions have taken to liquidating their Ecu bond holdings since the ERM crisis intensified a week ago. As a result, liquidity has disappeared. Apart from benchmark issues such as those from the French and UK governments, trading has ground to a halt, pushing up the yield on the less-liquid bonds. The yield on Denmark's 10-year Ecu bonds, for instance, was yesterday quoted at 35 basis points above the French Ecu OAT, compared with a difference of 5 to 10 basis spread in more normal times. The yield spread between German government bonds and the Ecu OAT speaks volumes about how far investors' sentiment has changed. Immediately ahead of the Danish referendum, the yield spread had narrowed to as little as 61 basis points. The Ecu bond at that time was yielding considerably less than its constituent currencies. The reason: investors hoped that when the EC reached its deadline for currency union, set by the Maastricht treaty at 1999 at the latest, some of the higher-yielding currencies would not have met the convergence criteria. As a result, when the Ecu became Europe's new single currency it would comprise only the 'core', low-yielding currencies, making it more valuable than the wider basket of all EC currencies. That process would effectively have reversed the sort of adjustment made to the Ecu basket in 1989, the most recent of the Ecu's five-yearly adjustments. At that time, the Spanish peseta was brought in with a 5 per cent weighting and the Portuguese escudo with 1 per cent - adding 40 basis points to the yield on Ecu bonds overnight. Since the Danish referendum, Ecu bonds yields have soared back above their theoretical yield, reaching a spread of 50 basis points this week. The spread over German government bonds has levelled out this week at around 180 basis points. The Ecu's hopes are now pinned on two possible outcomes to the current crisis, both of them seemingly remote. One is that the Maastricht treaty will survive the current upheaval, and that European currencies will restart the march to union. The other is that, if Maastricht dies, a new - and perhaps even more determined - rush to monetary union will develop with the D-Mark and French franc at its core. If the EC were to use the Ecu as its single currency for this more limited monetary union, then holders of Ecu bonds would make a large and unexpected gain. Such hopes still look far-fetched. Most analysts agree that such a limited currency union would adopt its own single currency, leaving the Ecu as simply a reference basket for a wider group of EC currencies. In that case, the Ecu would never return to the position centre-stage that it enjoyed until June this year. The result is in the hands of Europe's politicians - though Ecu investors seem already to have made up their minds.</p>

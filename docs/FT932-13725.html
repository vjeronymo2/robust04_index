			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Branding debate results in more hot air than consensus - A look at moves by the Accounting Standards Board to issue new guidance on goodwill and intangibles WHEN senior executives at Hoover last year launched a high-profile campaign to offer free flights to the US in exchange for their vacuum cleaners, they may have hoped to change the image of their brand. If so, the aim was successful - except that the image went down instead of up. Angry customers unable to fight through the small-print and claim their tickets besieged the switchboards. Three top UK executives were branded with blame and forced to leave the company. A name so carefully cultivated since 1908 that it had become an accepted part of the English language was damaged almost overnight. When Philip Morris decided to cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes earlier this month, it sent a frisson through companies with branded goods everywhere. The world's most valuable brand - worth Dollars 31bn according to a recent estimate and supported by an annual Dollars 100m marketing expenditure in the US alone - seemed under threat. Events such as these are causing new attention to be given to the subject of brands and their valuation, just at a time when British business is holding its breath in anticipation of new guidance from the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). It is a topic which demands attention, as a growing number of companies face the issue of how to report acquisitions and investments in their accounts, and while there is little regulation of the existing position. The annual survey of accounts by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1990-91 showed just 2 per cent of all companies and 6 per cent of large listed companies had brands on their balance sheets. The figures in the 1992-93 edition have risen to 15 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. These proportions might have been considerable higher had not acquisition activity dropped off sharply as the heat of the 1980s was doused by the cold shower of recession and the end of the bull market. Now at last, after considerable delay, it looks as though the ASB is poised to deliver a missive. The latest timetable suggests delivery of a discussion draft by late summer or early autumn this year. The focus will not be on intangible assets and brands in general, but on accounting for goodwill - the difference between the purchase price of an acquired company and the value of its net assets. As a paper sponsored by the ASB from five academics at Manchester University last year argued, goodwill includes three separate elements: the fair value of separately identifiable intangible assets; the present value of benefits such as market imperfections; and over- or under-payment. The new paper is likely to argue that there are three ways to deal with goodwill: to write it off over a fixed period, set it against reserves, or keep it in the balance sheet while it maintains its value. Current thinking seems to be that the ASB is willing to accept retention of goodwill in the balance sheet as long as it is satisfied that any diminution in values can be reliably tested. This question of robustness is the problem. The ASB is likely to recommend adoption of the technique generally used by industry - based on projections of future cash flow. This must be verified by regularly comparing actual cash flow against that originally predicted at the time of the acquisition of an asset. This approach is currently being 'field tested' with a number of companies to see whether it can work in practice. One is Reed International. Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director, says: 'We think it is perfectly feasible. We have been undertaking (brand valuations) for four or five years.' But opinion is strongly divided - not least among members of the ASB itself. A recent report on brands* highlighted both the variety of existing treatments of intangible assets in countries around the world and the split of expert views. Mr Art Wyatt, a partner with Arthur Andersen and former chairman of the International Accounting Standards Committee, warned that no transaction exists to trigger recognition of brands and other intangibles, and no exchange transaction takes place to validate their measurement. He questions whether 'the financial community is ready for reflection of undisciplined entries for non-events'. Mr Dennis Beresford, chairman of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, says brand accounting is 'a squall in a large storm' affecting the growing use of 'soft' assets which will increasingly challenge the traditional view of the balance sheet as simply 'a repository of transaction-based hard assets and firm liabilities'. Mr Peter Cartmell, finance director at Cadbury Schweppes, said his company decided to introduce brand valuations in its 1989 accounts after some significant acquisitions for three reasons: the value of their brands was increasing and would not be appreciated by less sophisticated investors; Stock Exchange regulations were relying purely on audited accounts rather than any underlying reflection of company value shown by the share price; and lower shareholders' funds would lead to a lower credit-rating, higher financing costs and more onerous borrowing procedures. A journal article published last winter by Christopher Napier and Michael Power from the London School of Economics poured scorn on claims in a 1992 report from Arthur Andersen - sponsored by companies which include brands in their balance sheets - that a consensus was growing on valuation. The academics argued that the Andersen report was as much about marketing and defending the firm's own valuation techniques as about assessing the true level of consensus. But while the theoretical debate goes on, the reality is that companies are developing and using a wide range of brand valuation techniques. Mr Michael Birkin, group chief executive of Interbrand, one of the leading brand consultancies, says that virtually all branded-goods businesses use valuation techniques for internal purposes. While many companies have held back from reporting brand values in their accounts, they use valuations for activities including internal brand management, mergers and acquisitions, tax planning and litigation work. Mr Birkin stresses that the Hoover and Marlboro incidents do not suggest that putting values on brands in company accounts is pointless, but rather show the need for regular revaluations. The question is how far accountancy decides to catch up with reality. Nigel Stapleton warns that any valuation techniques developed by the ASB should not depart too far from the way businesses value brands for their own purposes. But while the ASB focuses on acquired goodwill, pressure will continue to mount on the subject of internally-generated intangibles. These include not only brands, but equally even less measurable assets such as the value of staff. Even the academic study sponsored by the ASB recommended that internally-generated intangibles should be valued as well as those which were acquired, to ensure consistency. The ASB's own attack on the balance sheet and its definition of assets in the statement of principles appears to argue in this direction. But personally, Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, shares Art Wyatt's scepticism on the subject. 'Their measurement is not reliable enough,' he says. 'There has been no market transaction to prove their worth. I think one day we will consider the subject, but it may be a long way off.' *Accounting for brands. Kato Communications.

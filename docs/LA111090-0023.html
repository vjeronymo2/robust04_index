			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS : ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE;  </P> <P> CENTER MAY LEAD TO 4-YEAR SCHOOL  </P> <P> College students in the high desert appear to have an unquenchable thirst for  education. And drinking from the fountain of knowledge promises to be easier  with the creation of a California State University education center on the  campus of Antelope Valley College.  </P> <P> The center, consisting initially of a two-classroom relocatable building, will  offer CSU campuses a place to hold classes and test for potential enrollment.  </P> <P> Eventually, plans call for a more permanent facility at the two-year college.  Funding is expected to come from $25,000 that Palmdale and Lancaster provided  to the Antelope Valley Board of Trade to attract a four-year college.  </P> <P> The desire to attract a four-year campus to the Antelope Valley has been  particularly frustrating, especially when the CSU system picked Fresno as the  next university site earlier this year. But the relocatable education center  could accomplish proponents' objective by showing university officials that  demand is greater than expected.  </P> <P> "And what I'm hearing now is yes, they are real pleased with the kind of  response they are getting," said Rae Yoshida, Antelope Valley College's  president of academic affairs. "This gives them two years to decide, since  that's the shelf life of a relocatable classroom.  </P> <P> "So maybe by '92-93, Cal State could start the ball rolling to put some kind of  mobile unit on campus that would be more permanent than the temporary  classrooms. It just takes people with a little vision."  </P> <P> The temporary classrooms are already used by Cal State Los Angeles. And Cal  State Bakersfield and Cal State Northridge are expected to follow after  renovation and remodeling are completed this semester.  </P> <P> "We're asking CSUN to wire the relocatable unit so we can catch the signal out  of Northridge's interactive television facilities," Yoshida said.  </P> <P> Students would watch classes conducted at CSUN or at another location and ask  instructors questions through a telephone hookup.  </P> <P> And the demand for higher-education classes closer to home is expected to  continue growing, Yoshida said. Antelope Valley College, which now has 9,800  students, is expected to have 18,000 within 10 years.  </P> <P> The state university classes are also seen as an economic development activity.

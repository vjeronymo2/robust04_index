			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poor conditions hit Wall Street securities firms Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns yesterday provided further evidence of how the deterioration in trading and underwriting conditions on Wall Street has hit securities firms' earnings. Both companies announced sharply lower profits for the latest quarter. At Merrill, the securities industry leader, net income during its third quarter tumbled 36 per cent to Dollars 232m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, while net revenues dropped 13 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. As in previous quarters, the biggest decline at Merrill was recorded in investment banking revenues, which fell 46 per cent to Dollars 245m. Higher interest rates have led to a dramatic downturn in the underwriting business, with the rising cost of credit deterring domestic and international companies from raising capital on the US debt and equity markets. The firm's trading business has also suffered, with revenues from principal transactions falling 12 per cent to Dollars 654m. Surprisingly, however, Merrill said its earnings from trading fixed-income securities were about the same as a year ago, which indicates that the firm is surviving the slump in worldwide bond markets better than most. Brokerage commission revenues held up reasonably well, slipping 3 per cent to Dollars 674m in the quarter, but the flattening of the yield curve prompted a 19 per cent decline in net interest profit to Dollars 211m. On a more positive note, Merrill's asset management and portfolio service fees climbed 9 per cent to Dollars 431m, as client assets under fee-based management rose 8 per cent to Dollars 167bn by the end of September. With much of its employees' compensation tied to performance, the decline in Merrill's overall earnings at least led to lower expenses during the quarter. Non-interest expenses fell 4 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn, with the compensation and benefits category dropping 9 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn. The earnings picture at Bear Stearns was bleaker, primarily because the firm lacks Merrill's more diversified revenue base. Net income during its fiscal first quarter fell to just Dollars 35.5m, or 25 cents a share, from Dollars 104.3m a year ago. Although revenues from commissions, interest and dividends rose during the period, those gains could not offset big declines elsewhere. Investment banking revenues fell by more than half in the quarter, to Dollars 58.4m from Dollars 119m a year ago. Commission revenues, however, climbed 12 per cent to Dollars 120.3m, while interest and dividends produced revenues of Dollars 447.5m, up sharply from Dollars 247m a year ago. There was a positive reaction from the stock market. Shares in Merrill Lynch climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 , while Bear Stearns rose Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 15 5/8.</p>

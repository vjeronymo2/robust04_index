That same scheme also seeks to exhaust the efforts and  patience of the Arab parties one after the other, force them  into positions different from their current ones, and push them  into signing separate deals that are not based on the UN  Security Council resolutions governing the region's peace  process.    With the absence of the Security Council resolutions,  everything can be subject to interpretation and different  readings, like the Oslo agreement. Everything can also be  subject to extortion and procrastination. What is agreed upon  now can be violated tomorrow. In such agreements, the rights of  the weak will be lost and the powerful evil can gain supremacy.    We say this because the Washington talks on the level of  heads of delegations ended without any progress. Israel  expected, and even wanted to see, such a result even before they  started. The World was expecting positive results, especially  after the great momentum given to the peace process by the  Geneva summit. Nothing was preventing the achievement of  decisive progress on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks. Syria  explained its concept of peace and its position was supported by  the United States and the world. Israel was supposed to pledge  complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the occupied  territories in implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions and the principle of land for peace. But, as usual,  Israel maneuvered, procrastinated, and once again raised the  issue of its security concerns.    In this regard, we recall a statement by Former Israeli  Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Shamir in which he stated publicly that he was  planning for talks lasting several years so that the world will  forget the Middle East question. It appears that what Shamir  said is being implemented now in letter and spirit. The  Washington talks have entered their third year with no signs of  an impending agreement. The positions remain the same. Israel  is avoiding the requirement of the complete withdrawal from  occupied Arab territories, insists on subjugating the  Palestinian people, confiscates their land to give to settlers,  and treats the Palestinian people in a manner that runs contrary  to all charters and principles of the United Nations and human  rights. It murders, destroys, sets fires, and erects further  detention centers in violation of all international laws. At  the same time, it continues its aggressions against southern  Lebanon. Today is so similar to yesterday and the day before  because nothing has changed in Israel's behavior and conduct.  Everything is being done as if the Madrid Conference had not  been convened and as if the Washington talks were a mere  opportunity to kill time.    With its course of maneuvering, procrastinating, and  emptying  the peace talks of any substance, Israel seeks to frustrate the  Arab parties first, and then the world so the world will reach  the point of despair concerning the Middle East question and the  stage will be set for Israel to exercise its arrogance,  extortion, and aggression.    Israel is trying to surpass the results of Geneva summit,  which revived the world's hope in the possibility of reaching a  just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and torpedo its  dynamism by dragging out the talks in Washington, by reviving  procedural matters, by raising the security excuses, and by  avoiding as much as possible the substance of the talks; namely,  the exchange of land for peace. Israel is avoiding the future  of the territory and gives priority to security before peace as  if peace were not the ideal guarantee for the security of states  in the region.    However, Israel's old-new game is not hidden from the world,  particularly the sponsoring party of the peace process. In  Geneva, the United States committed itself before the world to  the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace based on the  UN Security Council resolutions. The United States must  intervene at the right time to put things in order because the  collapse of the peace process will only bring great harm to  world stability and U.S. interests.</p>

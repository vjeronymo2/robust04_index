			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> VII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Agency preliminarily certifies that the proposed regulation would not have a significant impact on small businesses in any industry. As shown in the earlier section on costs of compliance, the cost to individual small establishments is estimated to be the same as for larger establishments. The costs to establishments in every industry are very low. In addition, OSHA inspects proportionately more large establishments than small establishments, and the Agency as a matter of policy does not perform some types of inspections on establishments having ten or fewer employees. The Agency therefore concludes that this regulation does not place any undue burden on small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Environmental Impact Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and the Department of Labor's NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). The Agency estimates that the regulation and employers' compliance efforts will not have any impact on the environment or result in the release of materials that contaminate natural resources or the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions which would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to States that do not have State plans, the proposed regulation conforms to the preemption provisions of section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 667) which preempts State promulgation and enforcement of requirements dealing with occupational safety and health issues covered by Federal OSHA standards unless the State has an OSHA-approved State plan. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gade <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Solid Wastes Management Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 112 S.Ct. 2374 (1992). Since States without State plans are already prohibited from issuing citations for violations of requirements covered by Federal OSHA standards, the proposed regulation does not expand this limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency certifies that this proposed regulation has been assessed in accordance with the principles, criteria, and requirements set forth in sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12612. Section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act [29 U.S.C. 667(c)(2)] provides that an OSHA-approved State plan must provide for the development and enforcement of safety and health standards which are, or will be, at least as effective as the Federal program. In implementing this requirement, 29 CFR 1902.3(d)(1) requires a State plan to provide a program for the enforcement of the State standards which is, or will be, at least as effective as that provided under the OSH Act, and provide assurances that the State-plan enforcement program will continue to be at least as effective as the Federal program. Furthermore, 29 CFR 1902.4(a) requires State plans to establish the same procedures and rules as those established by Federal OSHA, or alternative procedures and rules as effective as the Federal procedures and rules. In particular, a State plan must provide that employees be informed of their protections and obligations under the Act. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(iv). It must also provide for prompt notice to employers and employees when an alleged violation of standards has occurred, including the proposed abatement requirements, by such means as the issuance and posting of citations. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(x). Since the proposed regulation will improve Federal OSHA's effectiveness in enforcing the OSH Act and, in particular, will foster the abatement of violations and communication to employees about their protections under the Act, State plans will be required to adopt an identical regulation, or an equivalent regulation that is at least as effective as the Federal regulation, within six months of Federal promulgation. Thus, the proposed regulation complies with the Executive Order 12612 with respect to State plan states because (1) it deals with a problem of national scope, and (2) the OSH Act requires that State-plan states adopt OSHA regulations or equally effective regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered before a final regulation is promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. State Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are currently 25 states and other jurisdictions with OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans. These 25 jurisdictions are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming; and Connecticut and New York (for State and Local government employees only). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

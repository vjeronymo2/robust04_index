			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUIET DOW REBOUNDS 5.86 IN 'UNEVENTFUL' TRADING  </P> <P> Stock prices closed slightly higher in moderate, uneventful trading today;  there was little news to spur investors.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.86 points to close at 2,483.87.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of 6 to 5 on the New York  Stock Exchange, with 768 issues up, 640 down and 538 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 178.60 million shares, against 187.69 million in  Tuesday's session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 0.35 to 177.96.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index finished at 351.00, up  0.04.  </P> <P> The market opened lower behind weakening bond prices after the Bank of England  said it would raise its base lending rate from 13% to 14%.  </P> <P> Stocks began to firm slightly after midday, taking a cue from rising bond  prices, then moved narrowly for the rest of the session.  </P> <P> "The market was pretty uneventful overall," said Eugene Peroni, technical  analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott.  </P> <P> Analysts said the market spent most of the day in a consolidation phase, with  some investors taking profits amid mostly even-keeled buying and selling.  </P> <P> "After the 5% rally of the last couple of weeks, it's natural for the market to  pause for rest and relaxation," said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with  Kidder, Peabody Group Inc.  </P> <P> Despite concern on Tuesday that the dollar was rising too fast against Japanese  and European currencies, many analysts said the market continued to view the  strengthening U.S. dollar as positive.  </P> <P> The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen as well as against major European  currencies.  </P> <P> The stocks of potential takeover targets, including Avon, were active. Oil  stocks and steel and high-tech issues also showed broad-based gains.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Fall  </P> <P> Bond prices continued to fall in quiet early trading today, pushing interest  rates higher.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, which slipped $2.50 per $1,000 face  amount on Tuesday, declined by that amount by midday. Its yield, which moves  inversely to its price, rose to 8.64% from 8.61% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Short-term rates were also higher.  </P> <P> Traders blamed today's decline in bond prices largely on Britain's decision to  increase interest rates.  </P></p>

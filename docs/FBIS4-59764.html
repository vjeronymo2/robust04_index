			<p>BFN     [Text] In these critical and grave moments in the history  of our people in which towns and villages are destroyed, lives  lost, children orphaned, women widowed, and the hopes and  aspirations of our people for unity, security, stability, and  progress sacrificed, and when full blows are being dealt to  democracy with the aim of enshrining the hegemony of forces  hostile to the people and their aspirations to build modern  Yemen in the light of the documents of pledge and accord, the  patriotic opposition bloc announced a salvation initiative on 9  May, which is summarized here as follows:    1. The immediate cessation of all war operations.    2. The cancellation of all government institutions  because of their inability to solve the crisis and to prevent  the catastrophe.    3. To speed up the formation of a national salvation  government so as to enable it to save the country from the deep  abyss.    4. The salvation government is to undertake the  application of the pledge and accord document which has won  national consensus, a matter that is unprecedented in the life  of our people.    5. The salvation government is to undertake the  investigation and exposure of those who caused the crime of  in-fighting and to present them for trial.    6. To oppose any side which refuses this initiative which  seeks to save our people and our country and to end this  destruction.    The dialogue commission outside the coalition announced its  initiative on 30 April which is summarized in the cancellation  of the institutions of the existing authority and the formation  of a national salvation government. This followed the events of  'Imran which led to this overall disaster. This was then  followed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] initiative on 12  May, when it stated its agreement with and acceptance of the  initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc, and responded to it.    Consequently, any opposition or rejection of these  initiatives must be considered as opposition to the Yemeni  national consensus. The patriotic and democratic forces  represented by the political parties and organizations which  signed this declaration defined the bases of their moves as  cooperation and standing in one trench to achieve those  patriotic initiatives which seek to end the bloodshed and the  machinery destroying our people, their unity, and land. They  continue to hope that reason and Yemeni wisdom will prevail and  that all honorable people will rally to this initiative  throughout Yemen, in all political organizations, as well as the  older men of reason in the parties of the authority which has  not responded to the initiative of the patriotic national  opposition.    These patriotic forces represent by this responsible stand a  basis for a responsible patriotic and democratic alliance  relying on the pledge and accord document to continue the  struggle to save the homeland from the destructive war, to  preserve unity, and to build a modern state on the basis of the  following concepts and commitments:    1. The objective we are striving to achieve is the  implementation of the pledge and accord document.    2. The machinery to implement the document has already been  stated in the initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc on 9  May and the dialogue commission outside the coalition on 30  April, and the YSP through its initiative of 12 May, namely a  national salvation government which reflects national unity and  widespread participation in the building of the nation on the  foundations of democracy as a firm option from which there can  be no retreat.    3. We are committed to the pledge and accord document and to  work for its implementation with all honorable and wise people,  wherever we are able to do so in the land of Yemen.    4. We are irrevocably committed to democracy based on  multipartyism and peaceful alternation of authority.    5. We all pledge and are committed, as far as we are able,  to condemn any manifestations of authoritarianism in government  or any manifestations by an individual, party or group of  attempts to control the instruments of authority anywhere in  Yemen.    6. We pledge and are committed to the equality of  opportunity in political action without the tyranny of one group  over another or of one region over another region or of one  party over others. Government institutions, resources, and tools  should not be run for the benefit of any particular group, party  or tribe.    7. Opportunity should be made available to all national  and capable patriotic cadres regardless of their party or  regional affiliation in all fields and at all levels.    8. The homeland belongs to all. All are partners in both  good and bad times. The responsibility for its protection,  defense, the safety of its sons and ending this catastrophe,  belongs to all. All political forces committed to this national  salvation initiative document are equal in rights and duties.    9. We are all committed to cooperating in order to eliminate  the vestiges of the far and near past, to soothe the wounds and  to eliminate these vestiges from people's minds through  national, historic reconciliation which would restore everyone's  rights, guarantee justice and equality, and sow the seeds of  love and brotherhood.    10. To work for the elimination of the effects of division  in people's minds through parity in communication, balancing of  interests between groups, governorates and provinces, and the  rejection of all attempts to sow hatred and malice. We must  rise above any narrow regional, sectarian, divisive or partisan  tendencies.    11. We do not support those who advocate war, in-fighting,  division or secession. However, we shall confront with all  honorable people the mentality which desires the continuation of  killings and destruction and refuses to silence its guns.    The continuation of the [word indistinct] stubborn refusal  to  stop the massacres and destruction will increase our  determination to mobilize all the energies of our people to  confront the perpetrators of the catastrophe and the destructive  war. The democratic forces are capable of doing this with  reason, wisdom, and real democratic work and by the application  of parity in communication and equilibrium which will take care  of all the sons of our people.    12. On the basis of commitment by us all to the pledge and  accord document, the document of national consensus, and on the  basis of the fact that we constitute a foundation for an  extensive, democratic and national alliance, we all agree to  form joint machineries which will lead, manage, and supervise  all affairs, relations, actions and activities. None of us will  take a unilateral decision. The proper machineries for this  will be formed to represent all and to lead all activities with  the aim of attaining a government of national salvation and the  implementation of the pledge and accord document.    The political parties and organizations signing this  agreement warn of the consequences of ignoring this agreement  which is aimed at saving the homeland and safeguarding the land  and people of Yemen. It is a natural culmination of all  previous political initiatives.    We appeal to the rest of the political parties and  organizations participating in the dialogue commission to play  their full role by taking part in all the machineries of this  agreement. God knows our intentions.    Signed by: The Patriotic Opposition Bloc [al-Takattul  al-Watani lil-Mu'aradah), the Nasirite Unionist Popular  Organization [al-Tanzim al-Wahdawi al-Sha'bi al-Nasiri], the  Party of the League of the Sons of Yemen, [Hizb Rabitat Abna  al-Yaman, RAY], the Union of the Patriotic Forces [Ittihad  al-Quwa al-Sha'biyah], the Yemeni Unionist Alliance Party [Hizb  al-Tajjamu al-Wahdawi al-Yamani], the Party of Rights [Hizb  al-Haqq], the YSP [al-Hizb al-Ishtiraki al-Yamani].</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan drops on political turmoil fears BOURSES mostly offered a modest response to Wall Street's overnight gains, writes Our Markets Staff, and some of them managed to ignore the Dow altogether. MILAN faced the spectre of a government in serious trouble, and what was briefly seen as the possibility that the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, might resign. The Comit index fell 17.11, or 3.2 per cent to 511.02 with the biggest casualties in blue chips, small banks and insurers which had outperformed in the recent rally. News that a lunchtime cabinet meeting was being delayed and that Mr Amato planned to see President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro unnerved investors, already digesting a resignation threat by the justice minister, Mr Giovanni Conso, and more arrests in the ever-widening political bribes scandal. Mr Robert Meiyer, of Intersim in Milan, said that the market was still taking the bribes scandal in its stride. 'But if the government is facing collapse, that is another thing.' Mr John Stewart, of Pastorino and Partners in Milan, added: 'The market over-reacted. It certainly looked as if there was some panic selling. 'Some of the correction was expected from a technical point of view: a lot of call options are being exercised due to the end of the account later in the week. But the political situation has also become very problematic and Mr Amato's position is seen to have been weakened.' FRANKFURT got an early boost from Wall Street and a late one from BASF before it closed with the DAX index 18.31, or 1.1 per cent higher at 1,713.13. After hours, the dividend from Hoechst was an opposing influence. Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM8.2bn. Mr Thomas Nolten of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the DM10 dividend from BASF compared with fears of DM9 or even DM8, and lifted the shares by DM12 to DM240.50. Carmakers reflected the high liquidity in the market, although rises of DM10 to DM491 at BMW and DM12.50 to DM625.50 at Daimler were slightly offset by a 70 pfg fall to DM287.70 in Volkswagen. The BASF decision led to hopes that Hoechst, too, would pay more than the DM9 expected and Hoechst rose to DM263.50 in the post-bourse against a close DM2.70 higher at DM256.30. Unfortunately, Hoechst delivered DM9 in the afternoon, and the shares came back again to DM257.50. PARIS persisted with its interest rate cut hopes and the CAC 40 index closed 5.83 higher at 2,009.69. One trader said that buying was centered around smaller companies which had been lagging behind the market. Remy Cointreau was up FFR8.80, or 6.2 per cent to FFr151.80 while Alsace Supermarche led the winners with a lift of FFr231, or 13.8 per cent to FFr1,911 in 21,000 shares. Euro Disney rose FFr4.30, or 5.1 per cent to FFr88.80. One analyst said he expected an announcement 'any day' from Euro Disney about refinancing its debt so as to benefit from easing European rates, but opinion on the stock remained bearish in a couple of major investment houses. ZURICH benefited from expectations of lower interest rates and the SMI index added 19.1 to 2,151.3 after peaking at 2,157.0. Alusuisse bearers rose SFr13 to SFr501 as the company announced an unchanged 1992 dividend and forecast unchanged results for 1993. AMSTERDAM continued in positive mood, supported by the dollar and Wall Street. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.1 to 103.7. Philips added 30 cents to Fl 23.60 in active trade as recent US demand was followed up by local investors. BRUSSELS trading was dominated by Delhaize which closed BFr58 or 4.7 per cent ahead at the day's high of BFr1,292 in response to a profits forecast. The Bel-20 index closed 8.27 firmer at 1,236.12 in turnover of BFr1.635bn. OSLO's all-share index rose 8.69 or 2.1 per cent to 429.05 in very active trading. Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum each added NKr1.50 to NKr169 and NKr67.50 respectively after Statoil, in which both have stakes, announced its largest oil and gas find in recent years in the Nordland II area of the Norwegian Sea. DUBLIN seemed to offer a positive response to Wall Street, the ISEQ overall index rising 23.96 to 1,397.43 for a two-day gain of 3.1 per cent, but foreign buying, the possibility of the government's 30 per cent stake in Greencore going into corporate, rather than institutional, hands and, above all, the drop in domestic interest rates were also put up as factors. Irish interest rates have come down from 13 3/4 to 12 per cent since February 19, another half-point cut is on the cards and professionals are looking for a fall to 10 per cent or lower by the end of this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 9                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes               Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1161.91   1161.98   1162.60   1164.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1233.01   1231.94   1231.73   1233.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1163.38   1163.24   1163.58   1164.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1233.25   1229.81   1230.41   1230.72  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 8     Mar 5     Mar 4     Mar 3     Mar 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1165.04   1159.70   1156.15   1158.99   1156.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1229.32   1225.29   1216.30   1221.03   1211.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1165.71 ; 200 -  1234.35 Low/day: 100 -  1161.84  200 -  1228.75 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

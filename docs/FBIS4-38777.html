			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- A discussion of President Leonid  Kravchuk's speech on the situation in the Republic of Crimea and  on the draft resolution "On Implementing the Supreme Council of  Ukraine's Resolution of 20 May 1994 on Suspending the Actions of  the Law of the Republic of Crimea on Renewing the Constitutional  Bases of Crimea's Statehood" has begun at a session of the  Supreme Council.    People's Deputy Petro Osadchuk sharply criticized the draft  resolution and noted that the document "plays into Yuriy  Meshkov's hands" and is an example of "Kravchuk's head in the  sand policy" over Crimea.    Admiral Borys Kozhyn, speaking on behalf of the Rukh  deputies' group, noted that the Republic of Crimea should be  transformed into a Crimea-Tatar autonomy within the composition  of Ukraine. He criticized the president and the government  since, in his words, they assumed the position of detached  onlookers of events in Crimea. Borys Kozhyn proposed that the  president should travel to Crimea together with ministers to  "tackle the problem within the law."    Serhiy Kyyashko, a representative of the socialist group,  supported Kravchuk's proposal and the draft resolution.    Olha Pshenychna, a deputy from Crimea and member of the  interregional deputies' group, asked deputies "not to make any  hasty conclusions and decisions noting that people in Crimea  want peace and not bloodshed." She proposed that the president  of Ukraine should seek advice from the Russian president and  that the Supreme Council of Ukraine should seek advice from the  Russian State Duma.    People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy said that he has a plan on  how to solve the "Crimean problem" and is prepared to give it to  the president.    Discussion of this issue continues.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Paying up when the time is right - In A Nutshell New proposals for reducing the problem of late payments have been made in the form of a draft interest on payments bill by the Forum of Private Business. The forum suggests that suppliers should have a statutory right to collect overdue payments for up to six years from the date of invoice. That statutory right would be conferred if the principal amount but no interest had been paid or, when a customer could not pay, the interest alone could be collected until he could. The proposed legislation has been framed to allow the creditor to choose the best time to collect the interest while minimising the risk of losing business. Interest could be demanded when the supplier ceased to trade with the customer, when it became less important to retain the customer or when the supplier retired or went into liquidation. Forum, Ruskin Chambers, Drury Lane, Knutsford, Cheshire WA16 6HA. Tel. 0565 634467.</p>

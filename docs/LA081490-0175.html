Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BUCKS' GUARD JAILED IN ASSAULT  </P> <P> Milwaukee Bucks guard Alvin Robertson was jailed on an assault charge in  connection with a reported beating of his wife, officials said today.  </P> <P> Robertson, 28, who played for the San Antonio Spurs for five years until 1989,  was charged with misdemeanor assault with bodily injury, according to sheriff's  records.  </P> <P> He appeared before a magistrate Monday afternoon and was freed on an $800  personal recognizance bond. The charge is a Class A misdemeanor carrying a  maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.  </P> <P> Robertson's wife, Jacquelin, 29, told Bexar County sheriff's investigators that  her husband returned home Monday morning from a trip with another woman and  that she refused to let him into their house.  </P> <P> Robertson reportedly went to the back of the house and smashed a window to get  in. He then followed his wife to an upstairs room and later to the garage,  where he grabbed her hand "and struck it against the concrete floor," injuring  her, the report said.  </P></p>

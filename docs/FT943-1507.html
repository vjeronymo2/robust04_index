			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Verbund profit almost doubled Oesterreichische Elek-trizitatswirtschafts (Verbund), the Austrian electric power generation and transmission group, has reported a near doubling of first-half net profit to Sch626m (Dollars 57m) from Sch346m on revenues down 1.6 per cent to Sch9.3bn. However, it warned that its performance in the second half would be considerably worse because dry weather forced a 25 per cent to 30 per cent cut in domestic hydraulic production in July, August and the first half of September. The main reason for the strong profit improvement in the first half was the abolition of the national trade and asset tax at the beginning of the year. This knocked Sch288m off the group's tax bill. Verbund is 51 per cent state owned.</p>

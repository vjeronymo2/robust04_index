			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EXPERTS ARE SURE THE DOW WILL EITHER RISE OR  DECLINE  </P> <P> One guy on Wall Street thinks that the Dow Jones industrial average will fall  8% more before the end of the year. Another agrees, but he's concerned that if  the Federal Reserve doesn't continue to reduce interest rates, the stock market  could go even lower.  </P> <P> Sometimes you have to hit people on Wall Street over the head before they see  the obvious. In this case, it took the investment community until last week to  start realizing that corporate profits are becoming so weak that the stock  market may be in for some bad time ahead.  </P> <P> As I mentioned a few weeks ago, not everyone was oblivious to the  corporate-profit trap. A minority in the investment community realized as early  as this past summer that things weren't right in corporate America. But by and  large, the vast majority of those on Wall Street thought that everything was  hunky-dory -- until last week.  </P> <P> Now, suddenly, most people who make their living peddling stocks are asking  themselves one question: How low can it go?  </P> <P> "I think the market is going to seek some level between 2,300 and 2,400 on the  Dow over the next two or three weeks," says Anthony Woodruff, the head trader  at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "I think the whole economy is slowing. There are  recession fears," and, says Woodruff, there just isn't enough optimism to go  around.  </P> <P> Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer for First Albany Corp., and one of  the few who was warning investors in September, thinks that stocks will become  attractive again when the Dow gets down to the 2,400 level. But Johnson isn't  just worried about what is happening to corporate profits.  </P> <P> "It's not what's going on now that's the problem," says Johnson. "It's what  lies ahead that's making everyone nervous."  </P> <P> Fears were eased a bit last week when the Federal Reserve reduced interest  rates, allowing the closely watched federal funds rate to drop to about 8.5%.  </P> <P> Despite that action, a lot of people on Wall Street are still concerned. A  slight reduction in interest rates is not enough to bolster the sagging  economy. And a big drop in interest rates is unlikely while inflation is still  a concern here and abroad.  </P> <P> If the Dow were to drop to between 2,300 and 2,400, it would represent a loss  of about one-tenth of its value. But if the decline comes suddenly, as it did  Oct. 13, it could prove very damaging to the stock market's already-sagging  confidence. And then there is no telling where the bottom will be.  </P> <P> There are some people on Wall Street who see good things ahead for the stock  market, if only short term.  </P> <P> Richard McCabe, head of technical market analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,  for instance, thinks that stocks will go higher for the six weeks in the  traditional year-end rally.  </P> <P> But McCabe is anything but an optimist over the longer term. Says McCabe: "The  Dow might yet make one new high. But we may then see more correction in 1990."  McCabe says he wouldn't be surprised if stock prices dropped 20% to 25% during  next year's first three quarters.  </P> <P> John Connolly, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, is one of a  very small group that thinks stocks are not vulnerable. "I don't think there is  a great downside potential here," Connolly says of the market. Why? Because he  thinks that the Fed -- despite persistent problems with inflation -- has  already begun to come to the rescue of the economy by reducing interest rates  and will continue to do so.  </P> <P> Who's right? The majority isn't always wrong. I'd count on stocks slipping more  than they rise in the months ahead -- even if there is a traditional December  upturn.  </P> <P> The "Rabbit" died.  </P> <P> At least it appears that an attempt to raid Greyhound Corp. -- code-named  "Rabbit" by the guy leading the charge -- won't occur soon.  </P> <P> A Wall Street source says Daniel Good, an investment banker who made his mark  as an adviser to corporate raiders while at Shearson Lehman Hutton, has been  trying to line up partners for a run at the Phoenix-based company.  </P> <P> But sources tell me that Good is having the same problem as everyone else --  raising financing for a takeover. In fact, his troubles appear to have stunned,  if not killed, any plans that Good had for Greyhound.  </P> <P> "There is nothing going on in this kind of market," says Good, who denied  having any interest in Greyhound. Good added that he didn't think the takeover  business would improve in the near future.  </P> <P> Despite Good's denial, a reliable source on Wall Street tells me that Good has  been making the rounds for the past few months carrying a data book on  Greyhound, a company best known for the bus lines that it no longer owns. These  days Greyhound makes an assortment of consumer products and runs a  financial-services business.  </P> <P> Greyhound has been a rumored takeover target for years. Good apparently  believes that Greyhound is worth a lot more than its stock price, which last  week was about $31. And Good has apparently even persuaded some investors to  kick in a few bucks.  </P> <P> But the banks are balking. And it's no wonder. Not everyone thinks as highly of  Greyhound as Good does. An analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, for instance, has  said publicly that he thinks Greyhound's stock is worth just $35 a share.  </P> <P> Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has been mentioned most often as a possible  suitor. Jacobs, however, has sold his Greyhound shares. A source tells me that  he dumped the last of his Greyhound stock earlier this year. So Jacobs won't be  carrying this rabbit's foot around.  </P> <P> An adviser to 250 retirement funds is telling his clients to get out of growth  stocks now and into more conservative stocks with intrinsic values. And more  important, he's telling them that by next February they should have only 25% of  their money in the stock market.  </P> <P> Robert Moseson, president of Performance Analytics Inc., Chicago, says that  growth stocks have done so well over the past year that they can't do much  better. With the economy slowing, it's time for pension funds to start putting  their money into more conservative stocks that have low price-to-earnings  ratios and good income, he recently told clients.  </P> <P> "People right now should move away from growth stocks -- like cellular  telephone companies -- and toward higher-yielding stocks, like blue chips  paying high-dividend yields," says Moseson.  </P> <P> Moseson believes that different types of investment strategies take their turns  in the limelight. And he thinks that the next strategy that will prosper is one  that emphasizes higher-dividend, value stocks.  </P> <P> When you think of people who have declared personal bankruptcy, you may  envision down-on-their-luck losers destined for failure. But a new study by a  group of professors shows that such a supposition is far from the truth.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Warren, law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says before  her study of personal bankruptcy filings began, she assumed that a majority of  the victims would be from one group -- an underclass of society.  </P> <P> "Instead we found it was a cross section of the middle class of America," says  Warren, whose co-authors are professors Jay Westbrook and Teresa Sullivan of  the University of Texas. "We had accountants, dentists and entrepreneurs, as  well as truck drivers."  </P> <P> The professors studied 1,557 bankruptcy cases that were filed in Texas,  Illinois and Pennsylvania. Warren said there was "no overwhelming reason" for  bankruptcy filings except, generally, there was an "income interruption"  because of illness or loss of job. "They can't keep up with their debt  service," she added.  </P> <P> But Warren said the blame can't be placed solely on borrowers. Lenders, she  said, have been too willing to give loans to unqualified people. "The credit  industry isn't being very careful," Warren adds, and doesn't shut off the  spigot even when a borrower has debts wildly out of proportion to their income.  </P> <P> Some other observations:  </P> <P> * Medical debts aren't nearly as important in causing bankruptcy as had been  thought.  </P> <P> * Debtors in bankruptcy tend to have more kids -- an average of 3.4 to the  normal 2.7.  </P> <P> * Only about 45% of the wives work, compared to 60% in the general population.  </P> <P> * One of five debtors in the study who filed for bankruptcy has operated his  own small business.  </P> <P> * And, nine of 10 who file for bankruptcy list some credit card debt.  </P> <P> THE RUNOFF: The second deadline for making bids on Hilton Hotels Corp. is  sometime this month, say Wall Street sources, who wouldn't be more specific.  The sources say negotiations will begin after that, and a winner could be  announced in December. There is still strong interest in Hilton, which put  itself up for sale last summer, but some of the tire kickers have dropped out,  the sources say. . . .  </P> <P> John Sorte, co-head of investment banking at Drexel Burnham Lambert, says the  leveraged buyout business is "very slow" right now, with deals "few and far  between." Sorte says either borrowing costs paid by acquirers or acquisition  prices have to come down to revive the business. . . .  </P> <P> As I said a few weeks ago, there are still lots of corporate takeovers in the  works. two weeks ago, it was Georgia-Pacific Corp. going after Great Northern  Nekoosa. Wall Street sources say there's another small deal in the $500-million  range coming soon and still another one twice that size is in the advanced  stages of planning. Most of the deals are companies buying other companies --  sometimes in an unfriendly manner. Corporate raiders aren't very active . . .  </P> <P> KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, says there is one portion of the  takeovers business that is still doing well. Acquisitions of companies worth  $100 million or less by foreigners -- cross-border acquisitions, KMPG calls  them -- rose 22% in the second quarter, compared to a drop of 40% in deals  worth $100 million or more. . . .  </P> <P> Coniston Partners, the sometime corporate raider, has filed for a new  partnership in Delaware that it's calling Condor. Coniston says it's just one  of 20-odd partnerships that it has registered in that state. Wall Street's  ever-imaginative speculators, however, think that the partnership may have  something to do with Coniston's interest in making trouble for the management  of UAL Corp. They figured this out, you see, because both condors and UAL's  airplanes fly. Get the connection?  </P></p>

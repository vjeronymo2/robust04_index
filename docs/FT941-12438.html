			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: The sickly sweet smell of success - Choc art Among the first time exhibitors at Art 94, the leading contemporary art fair in the UK, was Karsten Schubert. Schubert, 32, runs the avant-garde gallery recently described by Evening Standard art critic Brian Sewell as 'the most squalid little gallery in London'. Among Schubert's artists are Rachel Whiteread, latest winner of the Turner Prize, and Anya Gallaccio, whose current show offers just one exhibit - 325 bars of Bournville chocolate melted down and smeared over the walls. At the art fair, which closed last weekend in Islington, Schubert was displaying his most accessible and accepted artist, Bridget Riley. He sold five of her gouaches, priced up to Pounds 6,500. Financially, the fair was good for his gallery but he found it a depressing experience and he will probably not bother to show again next year. 'My six main customers did not show their faces'. You feel that Schubert shares their disdain for most of the decorative and often figurative modern art on display at the fair. The gap between the contemporary paintings and sculptures for sale at Art 94, designed to enhance living room walls, and the 'cutting edge' contemporary art promoted by Schubert has never been wider. Most of the time this hardly matters. Schubert sells to a few loyal customers and to museums: he is not commercially minded, at least in public, and makes little attempt to cash in on any notoriety. This is most obvious with his reaction to the Turner Prize, the only occasion in the year when 'cutting edge' art intrudes into the popular awareness. Last November's Prize went to Whiteread, who subsequently filled the media with the furore over her installation 'House', a concrete moulding of the interior of a Victorian terraced house. 'The Turner Prize generates a lot of publicity but this is not translated into additional sales. People who are serious about art don't need the Turner. The interest in Whiteread was already there. Charles Saatchi bought three of her works in 1991. Everything she does sells and the Turner has not affected her prices'. Schubert sees the destruction of 'House' as 'real short-sightedness, verging on a Fascist mentality: destroy what you don't understand. Artists want to resolve certain contemporary problems. When Rachel finished 'House' it was apparent that it was bigger than she had hoped for. There is now a real sense of loss.' In the next year Whiteread might produce 12 pieces, with a medium-sized work valued at Pounds 15,000. She has half a dozen buyers in the UK, a few more abroad. The Tate Gallery already owns two of her sculptures and the Museum of Modern Art in New York is seeking one. Neither Schubert nor Whiteread seem anxious to capitalise on the Turner. 'We could increase White-read's prices in the short term but must be careful not to push the market beyond what it can bear'. The demand for her moulded one-off's is intense but limited: in these rarified reaches, talk of money seems an embarrassment. 'Artists are not driven by revenue. When it becomes a concern, their creativity is drying up.' Schubert is as good as his word. He used to give his young artists stipends, but 'I try not to any more. It creates dependency, and artists are frightened if they are indebted to a dealer'. Instead of cash he attempts to strike up a rapport. The real battle between Schubert and most other dealers revolves around whether to back the new - which these days consists mainly of conceptual art, most of which will prove meretricious and ultimately banal but which will occasionally throw up a new insight on the world - or to concentrate on selling historically sanctioned art, where prices are sustained by the patina of time. Once the distinction is made it is obvious that the 220 collectors, dealers and museum curators who make up the Patrons of New Art at the Tate, and who founded the Turner Prize, are actually interested in an entirely different type of art to that which attracts most people. Often the very size of the artifacts makes it curatorial, designed for museums or galleries, rather than the This does not stop the darts of the critics, notably Brian Sewell, whose distaste for the new inspired a coven of artists, dealers and academics to call for his head. Schubert signed the letter of protest. 'Any art critic who maintains that modernism is a failure, something that went wrong somewhere between Picasso and Duchamp, between 1907 and 1912, disqualifies himself totally from talking about contemporary culture in any context. Brian Sewell has in effect dismissed everything that is truly great in our century and I somehow cannot agree with that'. Sewell has, inevitably, expressed contempt for Gallaccio's chocolate walls, which have been on display for ten days now. Patches of white show through and the sickly sweet smell is nauseating. Schubert has not sold the exhibit, or rather he has not sold the certificate, priced at Pounds 5,000, which enables the buyer to 'decorate a room to a specified height with plain chocolate, applied with a brush in three layers'. There has been only one encouraging inquiry but the gallery owner is unperturbed. After Gallaccio's last show three years ago, consisting of flowers pressed between sheets of glass, it took 18 months to find a buyer. Schubert believes in his artists: history will determine their merit. Of course there has to be some financial discipline. Schubert could not run his gallery solely on the certainty that one day Anya Gallaccio, a 30-year-old graduate from that hot-house of conceptual art, Goldsmith's College, south London, will be recognised as an original and significant artist. His next show will consist of three new paintings by Bridget Riley, an established Royal Academician, whose work is already sanctioned by time. With two of the works, each priced at Pounds 45,000, already spoken for, Schubert can trawl the degree shows of the art colleges this summer for new concepts with some confidence.</p>

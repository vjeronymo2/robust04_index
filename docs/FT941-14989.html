			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Regions report good trading performances Companies in northern England and the east Midlands have started to put the recession behind them, according to two surveys yesterday. Business Survey North, the quarterly report on the north-east and Cumbria, indicated that the fourth quarter of 1993 had the highest-ever positive balances for home sales, home orders and profits since the survey began in mid-1990, before the recession hit the area. And in a survey of business performance at 353 companies in the east Midlands, the Association of East Midlands Chambers of Commerce said 36 per cent of companies reported a rise in export orders in December, compared with 27 per cent in September and 38 per cent in June. Business Survey North reported that, following two successive quarterly falls, export sales and orders were up, plant and machinery investment reached a new peak, and training expenditure increased sharply in response to skill shortages. However, the survey said that improved performance had yet to lead to a sustained growth in employment, which fell back to the 1993 second-quarter level and showed little prospect of improvement in the first quarter of 1994. Business confidence also suffered a setback, possibly, in response to the extra tax increases announced in the November Budget. But businesses had growing optimism about the long term. The increase in home sales, the survey said, bore out anecdotal evidence that the economy enjoyed a pre-Christmas boost; 51.6 per cent of companies reported an improvement, and 20.6 per cent a decline. Manufacturers accounted for most of the improvement. Predictions of turnover growth reached a record positive balance; 66.7 per cent of respondents forecast an increase, against 8.8 per cent forecasting decline. Meanwhile, in the east Midlands the level of domestic business appears to have flattened out after a surge of orders last spring. The east Midlands chambers of commerce said that in December 40 per cent of companies had order books fatter than three months before. That compares with 42 per cent in September and June and 28 per cent last March. However, the region also had plenty of unused capacity: 32 per cent of companies were operating at full capacity, 4 percentage points more than September but 8 percentage points less than June. Last month 59 per cent of companies were expecting a rise in turnover, but only 45 per cent expected a rise in profitability.</p>

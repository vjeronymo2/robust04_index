Turnover fell from Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 1.17m. However, the company also announced a trading venture with Shaklee Japan, a member of the Yamanouchi Group, whereby Shaklee will act as Regina's exclusive distributors in Japan. He said that with the Japanese Royal Jelly market estimated to be worth over Pounds 100m a year, he was confident that Regina would become a main brand in this market. Losses included an exceptional charge of Pounds 147,000 for start-up costs of the new US operation and reorganisation of the Irish interests. Also included was a provision for the carrying cost of the former headquarters in Elstree. Losses per share were 0.34p (earnings 0.09p).</p>

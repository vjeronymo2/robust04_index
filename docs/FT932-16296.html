			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER touched five-week lows on the LME, helping to push ALUMINIUM down to 14 1/2 -month lows. Further losses are likely in both metals, dealers said. Copper's decline stemmed from the fall below Dollars 2,155-Dollars 2,160 for three-month metal. Dealers will be looking for support around Dollars 2,130 to hold, ahead of tomorrow's April option declarations, although falls towards long-term support near Dollars 2,100 are possible. GOLD was still consolidating its position on the London bullion market and would probably remain for now between Dollars 338 and Dollars 340 a troy ounce, dealers said. Arabica COFFEE was lower at midday in New York after scoring life-of-contract lows across the board in early trading. There was no buying interest and volume was thin. One analyst said the recent break below 59.20 cents for May had set the stage for a move to 48 cents over the next few weeks. In London the May robusta contract managed to hold key support at Dollars 852 a tonne. The only possible supportive factor was the likely absence of origins owing to the imminent Easter holidays.

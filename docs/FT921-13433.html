			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen holds gains against dollar THE YEN remained strong against other currencies on the foreign exchange market yesterday but trading stayed cautious following intervention by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan late on Friday in favour of the Japanese currency, writes Simon London. While the scale of intervention on Friday was limited, with both central banks selling dollars against the yen, the effect was dramatic. From a close in London at Y127.45, the dollar stood at Y124.45 by the end of trading in New York on Friday. The move was interpreted by analysts as a clear sign that the US authorities do not want the dollar to appreciate from current levels. A stronger currency in general could stifle domestic economic recovery and inflate the already huge US trade deficit with Japan. The yen gained further ground on the US currency in Tokyo trading as dealers digested the consequences of intervention. By the close in Tokyo the dollar stood at Y123.95. Against the D-Mark the US currency was also weaker, closing at DM1.5863, from DM1.5920 in New York. In European trading a cautious tone prevailed, with few dealers willing to take on new positions ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers. Against the D-Mark, the dollar rallied to DM1.5985 during the day but was unable to break through resistance at the DM1.60 level. The US unit ended at DM1.5970, from DM1.6070 in London on Friday. In New York the dollar slipped back to end at DM1.5905. The yen maintained its position as finance ministers spoke out in favour of a strong Japanese currency. By the close in London the dollar stood at Y123.65, having traded in a tight Y123.35 to Y124.50 range through the day. In New York the US unit eased to Y123.25. However, many analysts are still expecting the dollar to appreciate over the longer term, whatever the wishes of the US Administration. For example, analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd suggest that the US currency could fall to around Y120 over the next few days but is set to appreciate to Y140 by the end of the year. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to soften. The peseta remained the strongest currency in the system and rose to Pta63.21 against the German unit during the afternoon, from Pta63.37 at the opening. This lifted the floor for sterling, the weakest currency in the system, to around DM2.8540 from DM2.8475 at the end of last week. The UK currency responded by strengthening and remaining just above the floor, underlining that the sterling/D-Mark exchange rate is linked to expectations that central banks would intervene with some force if the lower limit was breached. The pound strengthened from DM2.8550, Friday's London close, to stand at DM2.86 by yesterday's finish.</p>

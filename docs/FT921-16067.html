			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Falklands arbitration sought ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem has called on Britain to accept international arbitration to settle the two countries' rival claims to the Falkland Islands. Over the weekend, Mr Menem said Argentina's decision last year to refer a border dispute with Chile to a panel of international jurists was a valid precedent for settling the Falklands question. However, Argentina's Foreign Ministry yesterday 'clarified' the president's statement, denying that it implied a formal government commitment. The ministry said it intended to pursue with 'imagination and firmness all possible alternatives' in its negotiations with Britain. The ministry said arbitration would be only one of several options. However, British officials cut short any talk of arbitration. The embassy in Buenos Aires said: 'We have no doubt about our sovereignty'. Inflation in Argentina fell to 84 per cent in 1991, the lowest since 1986, after reaching 1,344 per cent in 1990. December inflation was 0.6 per cent.</p>

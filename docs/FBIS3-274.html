			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Rasalama Active Forces Political </F> Department on 1 March; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Political Department notes the following:  students' concern over their bursaries; the rushed increase in  civil servants' wages that still does not meet their demands;  the explosion in prices and inflation, both of which penalize  the people; the prices of rice, bread, drugs and even that of  charcoal for households; and the decision by the government to  reduce the list of imported goods, which contradicts the spirit  of liberalization and competition and can only surely favor the  emergence of black or parallel markets indicating inconsistency  and immaturity in the government's management methods. The  Rasalama Active Forces Political Department, which always  remains side by side with the people and is ready to continue  the struggle, draws the government's attention in particular to  the seriousness of this situation, an example of which is the  coming civil servants' strike. The Active Forces Political  Department calls on the government to find rapid and appropriate  solutions to these insufferable problems.    The Political Department believes that the prime minister  has  only two choices left: He should either resign or should  replace ministers who are incompetent.</p>

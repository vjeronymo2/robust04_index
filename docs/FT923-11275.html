			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Court gives SIB fresh muscle THE Securities and Investments Board (SIB) is now free to prosecute anyone who breaks the Financial Services Act, including third parties concerned knowingly in unauthorised investment business, following an Appeal Court decision. This could be good news for victims of unsafe home income plans who now rely on partial remedies from different regulators. The case involves a Swiss firm called Pantell - unauthorised for investment business - which sold apparently worthless shares in an American company, Euramco, to UK investors. SIB sued Pantell's London solicitors and the company itself for repayment of the money, alleging they knew about the misconduct. The solicitors challenged SIB's powers to seek a repayment order but the court rejected their case. The result is that anyone involved knowingly can be ordered to make full restitution of money invested even though they might neither have received it nor encouraged the investment actively. SIB says it is considering using these powers in a number of cases. Independent solicitor Nigel Hodkinson of Locks Heath, Hampshire, who has dealt with 1,000 home income plan cases, thinks the ruling might help extricate investors damaged by inappropriate sales of home income plans from the lengthy struggle for compensation. Sold mainly to elderly people during the late 1980s, these plans involved taking out a mortgage to buy an investment bond, which was supposed to produce an income as well as paying off the loan interest. But many investors were unaware they could lose their homes if - as happened - interest rates rose, house prices fell and the bonds failed to perform as forecast. Thousands of complaints and claims for compensation began churning around in the regulatory system. In March this year SIB announced a non-stop complaints procedure, but it ran into opposition from some building societies. They refused to allow the building societies' ombudsmen to extend their jurisdiction to cover home income plans. Redress for investors has varied. Insurance companies answerable to Lautro (the life assurance regulator) have paid Pounds 5m to restore around 400 people to the position they were in before investing via tied agents. The insurance ombudsman is dealing with another 120 claims against agents tied to Lautro firms and has made clear that compensation may include amounts for distress and legal fees. No such extras will go to investors who make claims on the Investors' Compensation Scheme following the default of four intermediaries licensed by Fimbra - the independent brokers' regulator. The Scheme said this week it expects 1,500 claims to arise from these firms, and hopes to pay at least some compensation as quickly as possible, without delaying to settle the more complex aspects. Investors will be compensated only by reference to the value of their investment on the day the firm was declared in default and cannot receive more than Pounds 48,000. People claiming against Fimbra members still extant face even more uncertainty. 'Unfortunately, it does not necessarily follow that (they) will be entitled to the same restitution and compensation as those covered by Lautro,' Anthony Nelson, treasury minister, told the House of Commons during the debate on the Finance Bill. 'Each case is subject to an examination of the package, the circumstances and the terms of the investment bond, and the mortgage proposed.' Hodkinson said, however, that many investment salesmen around the country had operated without authorisation. He thinks investors who have dealt with such people will be able to ask SIB directly to recover their money in full from any institution involved knowingly. But he adds: 'The question is whether the will is there to use the legislation.'</p>

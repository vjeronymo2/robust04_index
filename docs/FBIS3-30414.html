			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bernard Nezmah: "Diplomacy Without a Tail"] </F>   [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry of Lojze Peterle, who has  been criticized in the parliament for placing forestry engineers  in the highest positions, approached Zhirinovskiy's visit in  Slovenia in an ingenious fashion. To win the Russian  authorities' approval, the ministry advised Mr. Girenko, charge  d'affaires at the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, that V.  Zhirinovskiy should leave Slovenia as quickly as possible  because his group had flagrantly disturbed public order in Bled.  The Russian ambassador is, of course, looking toward the future  and wisely advised that this problem should be resolved by the  Slovene juridical system. However, the hand of the Slovene  Foreign Ministry obviously does not reach beyond the foyer of  its own building. Who is going to take seriously a foreign  ministry that the Croatian authorities can outmaneuver anytime  they please and that is threatening to the Russian  parliamentarian like a paper tiger. While Peterle has been  granting diplomatic privileges all over the place, he treats the  chief of the most powerful Russian party worse than a foreign  hooligan. How many affluent foreign guests have broken a little  something in hotels and had a bit of fun on the streets but were  not expelled from the country because of it? Furthermore, a  vehicle that Lord Carrington was racing through Styria a few  years ago fatally ran over a Slovene citizen. The English  gentleman was neither expelled from the state nor prosecuted. A  grim image of independent Slovenia without a sovereign foreign  policy. Appeasement of the West and hatred of the East have  reached the outermost limits of insanity. There is no longer  any mention of Slovene neutrality in the parliament, not even a  shred of an idea about the possible benefits of a military  alliance with the Russians. Slovene politicians, with the  exception of bright Jelincic, take it for granted that the  United States have a more favorable attitude toward Slovene  independence than Russia. They are falling all over prima donna  Albright, who comes empty-handed, but fear Zhirinovskiy like a  devil fears the cross, even though he has signed a statement  with Jelincic on Slovenia's independence, its position as an  East-West bridge, and other related things. East Europeans are  so very precious because they inspire some dignity in the  Slovenes. Only next to the Ukranian Foreign Minister has  President Kucan managed to regain the appearance of a serious  statesman. Now if only he could get rid of a bothersome tic  that automatically pulls his face into a smile at the sight of a  western politician.</p>

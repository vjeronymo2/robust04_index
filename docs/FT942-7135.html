			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (7): Motor to recovery - The car industry Brazilian car sales are booming, but domestic producers and importers of foreign models are bickering over how to share the spoils. The industry, dominated by Brazilian subsidiaries of the world's leading carmakers, was the motor to general economic recovery last year. It was kick-started by a price-cutting pact between government, manufacturers and unions, and by opening up the long-protected sector to foreign competition. Domestic output, which was floundering at 914,000 units in 1990, has recovered strongly, growing 30 per cent last year to reach a record 1.39m units. First quarter output this year rose a further 34 per cent to 368,000 units. Brazil, now the world's tenth-biggest vehicle manufacturer, has recaptured from Mexico the position of top Latin American producer. The threat of imports, combined with better market conditions, has led to big improvements in productivity. At Autolatina, a joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford, productivity in terms of man-hours per car has jumped 50 per cent since 1990, matching similar gains at the other two domestic manufacturers, Fiat and General Motors. However, analysts say the industry is still a long way behind productivity in more advanced industrial countries. Meanwhile, car imports, for years blocked by prohibitive tariffs, have risen from virtually zero in 1990 to 67,000 units last year, nearly 6 per cent of market share. Over that period, import tariffs have fallen from 85 to 35 per cent and are due to drop to 20 per cent later this year. Domestic carmakers, fearful of a potential onslaught of imports, have called for quotas aimed at restricting vehicle imports for seven years to percentages ranging from 3.5 to 7. 'Quotas would be a temporary measure to give us time to face international competition,' says Mr Ivan Fonseca e Silva, vice-president for business and legal affairs at Autolatina. Mr Jose Carlos da Pinheiro Neto, corporate affairs director at General Motors do Brasil, says it is not feasible to leap directly from full protection to taking on imports from more competitive countries, some of which he accuses of dumping cheap cars on the Brazilian market. 'It's like a kid. You keep it locked in a room and then you open the door with no kind of restrictions,' he says. Brazilian carmakers also argue that foreign competition has not been the crucial element in revving up the industry. They point to price-cutting agreements in which the government slashed vehicle sales tax, unions curbed wage demands and industry cut profit margins as the main factors behind steeply rising sales. The tripartite pact has cut average car prices by 30 per cent in real terms and those of the so-called 'popular' car (with engines of less than 1000cc) by 46 per cent. The price of Autolatina's basic Gol, for example, has come down to Dollars 7,200 from Dollars 13,000 two years ago. Increased sales have prompted big investment projects. General Motors will have spent Dollars 1bn on adding new production lines in the five years to 1995 and is considering starting a third plant. Autolatina intends to spend Dollars 2.2bn in the next three years, modernising its production lines. Both companies are taking advantage of the proposed Mercosul common market to rationalise production between their Brazilian and Argentine plants. Some foreign manufacturers, attracted by Brazil's huge growth potential, are also contemplating direct investments. Nissan do Brasil is weighing up the possibility of building a Dollars 3bn fully-automated plant to produce popular cars and possibly pick-ups, according to Mr Luiz Carlos Sollitto de Oliveira, general manager. A final decision will await the outcome of October's presidential elections and signs of greater government policy consistency, he says. Nissan has identified Brazil as potentially one of the world's most lucrative markets. There are 11.4 Brazilians per vehicle, compared with 5.7 Argentines, 2.3 Japanese and 1.3 North Americans. Sustained growth, or access to credit - almost impossible with near hyperinflation - could send sales spiralling. Nissan expects total sales to reach 165,000, with a potential foreign share of 13 per cent, next year. Importers reject industry arguments that they threaten Brazilian jobs. The vehicle industry employs 120,000 workers, with knock-on benefits for thousands of others. Foreign manufacturers say imports have created more jobs than they have destroyed as well as contributing Dollars 700m in taxes last year. Rivalry is bound to continue, something to which domestic manufacturers are reconciled. 'We will have more competition,' says Mr Robert Rennard, chief operating officer at Autolatina. 'I'm not particularly concerned as long as they play by the same rules: as long as there's a level playing field,' he says.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Observer: Overpowering Burton The latest unseemly boardroom squabble at Burton, the high-street retailer, over the future of two long-serving non-executive directors, is instructive. Does a new chairman have a right, like an incoming prime minister, to demand that his non-executive directors offer their resignations on his arrival in office? As the rumour mill has it, the directors in question - Ladislas Rice and Mark Littman - have been pressed by Sir John Hoskyns, the chairman, to quit. The two are widely seen as the last hangovers from the Sir Ralph Halpern era of corporate excess. Rice and Littman have, however, refused to budge. They do not challenge the right of a new chairman to recompose his board of directors. On the other hand it is the directors who appoint the chairman and the shareholders who appoint the directors. While one can debate Rice and Littman's record as non-executive directors, their firm stance on this issue attracts sympathy. Thanks to last year's rights issue, Burton's finances have been stabilised, but there remain serious doubts about its longer term retailing strategy. Permitting a chairman to replace his own board puts far too much power in one person's hands. For one thing, it would make it far more difficult to sack Sir John Hoskyns himself.</p>

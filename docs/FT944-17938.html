			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Job figures give election boost to Kohl: Good news on employment enhanced by report of steady producer prices Mr Helmut Kohl's hopes of a fourth term as German chancellor were given a timely fillip yesterday by improving unemployment figures and a favourable opinion poll. The last labour market data to be issued before the federal election on October 16 show that the seasonally adjusted jobless total in the west fell by 5,000 last month. Although slight, and enhanced by a rise in numbers taking part in official work creation and education schemes, the improvement exceeded most expectations. Coupled with an unadjusted drop of 64,000 in the east, the result was likely to be 'highly supportive' for Mr Kohl, according to one analyst. The optimistic message was reinforced by pan-German producer prices unchanged in July from June, and up only 0.3 per cent year-on-year. The unadjusted jobless figure for the whole country fell more than 140,000, taking the total below 3.5m for the first time this year. Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said the data were more favourable than usual at this time of year, when companies hired extra staff after the summer lull. Vacancies registered in the west rose 16 per cent during the month, Mr Jagoda remarked, adding that the low point in the eastern labour market was 'well behind us'. At 7.9 per cent compared with 8.2 per cent in August, the jobless rate in the west was the lowest of the year so far, although still above the annual average of 7.4 per cent in 1993. The eastern rate, down to 13.8 per cent in September from 14.7 per cent, was also considered likely to bolster support for Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) in the region. Signs of improved backing for the CDU in the five new states emerged yesterday in a poll from the Allensbach Institute showing nationwide support for the ruling coalition steady at 49.3 per cent. Although the share of the vote going to the liberal Free Democrats, junior government partners, was down slightly on the institute's previous survey, it was still sufficient at 8.2 per cent to help the current coalition to an absolute parliamentary majority. Meanwhile, the Social Democrats advanced their share to 35.1 per cent from 34.7 per cent in the previous Allensbach count, while the Greens, their putative coalition partners, slipped from 9.2 per cent to 8 per cent. The Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the east German communists, has continued to gain ground, scoring 4.5 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent in the previous poll. Much too close to call, Page 21</p>

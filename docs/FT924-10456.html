			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Noranda overcomes volatile metal markets A WEAKER Canadian dollar and lower costs helped Noranda, the Toronto-based resources group, overcome volatile commodity markets in the third quarter. The company cautioned that recovery in its businesses was continuing only at a very slow pace. Zinc prices, which contributed substantially to higher metals earnings in the third quarter, have moved down sharply in recent weeks. Net earnings were CDollars 26m, (USDollars 21m) or six cents a share, compared with a CDollars 57m loss a year earlier, equivalent to a loss of 39 cents a share. Revenues climbed to CDollars 2.18bn from CDollars 2bn, and interest charges fell to CDollars 85m from CDollars 105m. Cash flow from operations almost tripled in the third quarter to CDollars 284m, but long-term debt climbed to CDollars 4.8bn on Sept 30 from CDollars 4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings from mining and metals rose to CDollars 48m from CDollars 7m, largely due to a more favourable currency, the healthier zinc market and productivity improvements. Forestry earnings were CDollars 6m, compared with a CDollars 20m loss. While demand for lumber, panelboard and paperboard has strengthened, prices for pulp, newsprint and most other types of paper remain below levels a year ago.</p>

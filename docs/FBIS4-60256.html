			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division.  The Majles met yesterday morning chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam  val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of  Salmas, Tehran, Minab and Mashhad gave speeches. Then the  speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he condemned the  crimes of the bloodthirsty Serbs against the defenseless Muslims  of Bosnia and Hercegovina, which was printed in yesterday's  issue. Then the Majles took up its agenda, the details of which  are printed below.  <H5>  Fathollah Reza'i, Deputy From Salmas </H5>   The members of the Council of Ministers, by increasing the  rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power,  are themselves taking a step down the road to increasing high  prices.    Reza'i, deputy from Salmas, was the first preagenda speaker  at yesterday's open Majles session. In his speech he  commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari and  offered congratulations on Teacher Day and Worker Day. He said:  Every moment and everywhere in the world where the cries to  heaven of freedom-loving people are to be heard, as in the  Muslim nations of Sudan, Somalia, and in free countries such as  Nicaragua and Panama, the unworthy and inadequate UN  policymakers, in collaboration with the world's plundering  nations led by criminal America, are busy mercilessly  suppressing and killing the freedom seekers in those countries.    He discussed the slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and  Herzegovina by the criminal Serbs, and in other parts of the  world. He said: Unfortunately the Muslim nations, with their  silence, are consenting to these crimes. Only the Islamic  Republic of Iran, with the prophetic leadership of its exalted  leader, has responded positively to the cries of the Muslims of  Bosnia and Herzegovina and other freedom-seeking people, and is  revealing their oppression in a world full of infidelity and  atheism.    He added: In this wide world, has anyone ever asked the  secretary-general whether human rights are invoked only to  defend murderers and international smugglers?    In visits to the camps for Azeri refugees run by the Red  Crescent in Parsabad, I saw for myself the depth of the plot.  According to the existing statistics, more than 1 million  defenseless people are refugees from their own countries. The  Red Crescent has more than 53,000 of these people in its care in  Azerbaijan, where it is treating them with Islamic concern and  kindness.    Continuing, the deputy from Salmas expressed thanks for Dr.  Vahid Dastjerdi's management of the Red Crescent. With regard to  the problems and difficulties in his electoral district, he  mentioned the importance of the geographic position of the  Salmas Plain, and noted that preliminary studies on the  possibility of doing a water exploration project in the Salmas  Plain were done in the years 1348-1351 [21 March 1969-20 March  1973] by engineers from the former Yugoslavia. Studies on the  reservoir dam, the power plant, the diversionary dam and the  irrigation and drainage network were completed through the end  of phases I and II. In the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March  1979] construction began on the plain's irrigation and drainage  network, and the work stopped after nine months.    He issued memoranda to the officials in charge concerning  the  creation of a labor market and confronting and resisting the  cultural invasion caused by the country's strategic, political,  and cultural composition and by its geographic social  composition.    He mentioned unemployment as one of the problems of the  people of the region and noted: The activation of tens of  television channels in the region has caused individuals to be  pierced by the sharp spear of the West's cultural invasion. I  implore cultural officials to take basic steps to create sound  recreational areas.    Reza'i discussed the spoilage of some agricultural crops due  to the lack of conversion industries in the region. He asked  officials to take steps to provide guaranteed purchases of  agricultural crops.    Increasing and multiplying inflation and high prices for  various goods and items needed by the public have placed the  oppressed nation in the grip of a vise. The members of the  Council of Ministers must come to the aid of this nation. They  must not increase the high prices themselves by raising the  rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power  instead of anchoring inflation and solving the problems of high  prices.    He asked for help from the minister of health care,  treatment  and medical education to open the Salmas hospital, and from the  minister of education and training to solve the problem and  determine the status of residential areas in the vicinity of  educational areas, and to pay the profit differentials on loans.  <H5>  'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   The government has not made the proper decisions concerning  the control of prices of goods and materials and dealing with  those who sell at high prices.    The second preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy  from  Tehran. In his speech he discussed the events of Ordibehesht [21  April-21 May]. He said: Although the enemies of the revolution,  especially in the current century, have set out to destroy the  Muslims, now in Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina and  in other nations and regions we see that world imperialism and  domestic despots are attacking Muslims with propaganda,  pressure, and severe torture in order to suppress their faith,  their desire for Islam, and their religion.    He then added: There are two factors in the glory,  greatness,  and progress of Islam and the Muslims. As long as these two  factors exist among the Muslims, no danger or enemy can destroy  them. One is awareness, and the other is jihad and struggle for  faith and belief.    Although in Bosnia and Herzegovina we are witnessing the  most  savage aggression, crimes, and genocide against the Muslim  people of that region, ultimately Islam will cast its shadow in  that region and throughout the world and the Muslims will be  victorious.    The deputy from Tehran then discussed domestic issues. He  said: While I fully support the government, its work has been  naive and insufficient in some areas.    One of these issues is the struggle against selling at high  prices. It would be possible to set prices in the proper way for  all goods and materials and there could be a system and control.  I myself go to the square and to the market to buy what I need  to live. You also know that there is no problem with shortages  of goods and materials. The problem is the government's failure  to control and supervise the prices of goods.    He emphasized: Unfortunately, sellers have been left to  their  own devices. A piece of fruit has a certain price in the main  square in Tehran, but the prices in stores are up to double that  amount. This is a question of weak management. It is a problem  of lack of leadership, making the proper decisions concerning  prices and dealing with the criminals who sell at high prices.  We know of individuals who have put tens of millions of tumans  in their pockets in less than five years with just a little  fruit stand, and have bought 40- to 50-million-tuman homes right  here in Tehran.    I strongly protest the economic policies, and especially the  issue of price controls. I say to the government, even if you  intended to test to see if the prices had found their true  levels, enough is enough, because the test itself has failed.  <H5>  Seyyed 'Ali Mirkhalil, Deputy From Minab </H5>   Basic thinking must be done concerning inflation and high  prices.    The third preagenda speaker was Mirkhalil, deputy from  Minab.  During his speech he discussed the fact that we must stand up  against all the plots without ceremony. He said: We know that  America is plotting. It has opened a second front, where it is  making mischief in the country with paid and unpaid agents.  However, with God's grace, America has gotten nothing but shame  and defamation.    He said: With America's disgraceful defeats in Somalia and  Haiti, the oppressed people must realize that American  invincibility is nothing but a myth.    He then said: It is clear that the government has done less  in Minab, Rudan, and Jasek than it has done in other parts of  the country. These areas have the least amounts of piped water,  electrical power, suitable rural roads, schools, treatment  centers, and health clinics. The number of rural areas with  electrical power can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and  a great many villages are completely without electrical power,  water, rahnema'i schools, or treatment centers.    The speaker added: God knows what happens to children and  indigent patients, with the air and water pollution and the  distance of up to 10 hours from the hospital. Are we willing to  spend even one day in that deprived villager's place, where  patients die from the heat and on impassable roads? The  government must not be satisfied merely with getting reports  from the relevant organizations, making trips in the winter and  on New Year's, stopping at Qeshm Island and then going back to  Tehran. They should come in the summer and see Jasek and the  desert, where water is supplied by tanker trucks.    This is surprising. What happened to these people's share of  all that government iron, construction materials, housing loans,  and other credits that were distributed? According to the people  themselves in these rural areas, no official has been there and  nothing has been done to solve their problems.    Do some officials even know how to pronounce the names of  these villages? He thanked the speaker of the Majles for voting  to provide electrical power to 100 rural areas. He said: The  work of the reconstruction crusade in providing electrical power  to 100 rural areas will be reminiscent of the splendid  operations of the dear crusaders at the war fronts, and that  will keep alive the atmosphere at the fronts. I ask the deputies  and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade to help with the  full implementation of our electrical power service project.    He noted that the government must make every effort to  establish the security expected by the people. He said: The  existing situation does not provide the security that is  expected and satisfactory for the people. I ask the minister of  the interior either to provide the region's security himself or  to assign responsibility for the area's security to the  revolution guards. Security is not a development project that  can be done next year if not done this year. If an innocent  person is killed due to naivete and if the Ministry of the  Interior does not make a decision to reinforce the region's  security management, won't the minister of the interior have to  answer to God and the people?    He then discussed the nation's economic problems. He  emphasized: Basic thinking must be done about inflation and high  prices. We must get out of this current price situation and give  attention to the principle of price control. If the government  does not put the brakes on this speeding machine of high prices,  is it clear what it will do to the low-income people?    The government must do more to employ the local manpower  that  is knowledgeable, able and concerned, and in some cases it must  refrain from treating them unkindly. Mirkhalil called for an  investigation into the reasons for the region's deprivation and  unemployment, and he noted: The sea is a divine blessing. The  government must invest to make maximum use of this blessing and  to eliminate unemployment and false occupations.    Among the problems in his electoral district he cited the  lack of water in the area, the failure to dredge existing  estuaries, the lack of a university, the unusability of the road  from Jasek to Bashagerd and the lack of a hospital, and he asked  for solutions.  <H5>  Qadiseh 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>   The Muslim nation of Iran is completely prepared to support  and help the Muslims of Bosnia.    The final preagenda speaker was Ms. 'Alavi, deputy from  Mashhad. She offered congratulations on the birth of Imam Reza  (peace be upon him), and she discussed the willing response from  the public to the leader's call for support of the Muslim people  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. She said: At this time endless  oppression is supported by the United Nations, and wickedness  and bloodletting have reached the point where the Serbs are  attacking safe zones. [passages omitted on Serbian activities]    He called on the exalted leader to issue an order forming an  Islamic United Nations. The question, remains, how long will  Iran remain a member of this lying, deceptive organization,  which so far has done nothing to defend Muslims and the real  rights of humanity? Of what benefit is it to Muslims when this  organization's secretary-general stands by while children are  killed in the wombs of their mothers and women and children are  being attacked, when Gorazde, which was a safe zone, is  transformed into a killing ground for innocent women and  children, while he just watches and lowers his lip? What is the  benefit of cooperating and continuing relations with elements  whose state of mind is obvious and whose character is weak?    What policy have the government leaders of the Islamic  Republic of Iran adopted in this regard?    I ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, what is the need for  us to remain in an organization whose secretary-general's hands  are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent Muslims?  Isn't it time for the Muslim nations to protest all this  injustice and oppression by forming a free United Nations and  getting out of the yoke of imperialism and exploitation? The  Muslim nation of Iran is entirely ready to rush to the aid of  the Muslim nations of Bosnia and Gorazde, and the women of our  Islamic society are certainly waiting for the exalted leader's  order to support the people of Bosnia.    Ms. 'Alavi said: The women deputies in the Majles,  representing all of society and especially the women, have  declared and are declaring that they have any kind of readiness  necessary to answer the divine call from the exalted leader of  the Islamic revolution to support the tormented people of  Bosnia, and especially the women and children of Gorazde.    In conclusion, she discussed the attempted assassination of  the temporary Friday Imam of Mashhad, and she issued a memo in  this regard to the relevant officials.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Amendment of Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was continued consideration of the report from the first  consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission  concerning the Bill on Note 5 of the Law Appending Five Notes to  the Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges.    This bill provides that "the chief of the judicial power may  select women who have the qualifications for Ministry of Justice  judges approved 2/14/1361 [4 May 1982] and they may be hired as  judges to serve as counselors to the court of administrative  justice, the special civil courts, examining magistrate,  assistant public prosecutor, managing the supervision of minors,  and practicing in legal and other offices with judicial  positions."    After this bill was discussed and studied by the deputies,  Mr. Nateq-Nuri spoke in support of the principle of the bill. He  said: The question being discussed in this bill is legal  counsel, not judicial practice. Counsel has not been prohibited  in Islam. We must not indulge in the limited thinking that we  should even prohibit counseling by women. In the special civil  court, where most of the family issues are discussed, the women  have many problems, which they cannot explain to men. The best  help for them is women who know the law.    The speaker of the Majles then said: What is the problem  with  doing this? Aren't mobilization members serving as court  bailiffs? If the mobilization sisters encounter a situation,  they notify the judicial power and they pursue it. Thus the same  research judge (consultant) will also serve the purpose at the  same place. What is the problem with this? What is the meaning  of all these slogans and talk in defense of women at the podium,  if we reject this bill? Is rejection of this bill a defense of  women's rights?    Mr. Nateq-Nuri discussed the fact that if this bill provides  for judicial activity for women, the Guardian Council will  reject it. He said: In view of the fact that the bill's second  consultation is before us, some of the problems can be resolved  in the details.    Among the points for discussion on this bill is its  rejection  by the Judicial Affairs Commission. The commission expert  mentioned the reasons for rejecting the bill. During a speech he  said: Because the Law Eliminating the Positions of Examining  Magistrate and Assistant Public Prosecutor has only recently  been passed in the Majles, the new position called "research  judge" has been created in which women can serve and the  position of counselor in the special civil courts has also been  eliminated, therefore, a bill cannot now be brought to the  Majles that violates a recently enacted law. Therefore,  opposition to this bill is not opposition to the work of women  graduates in judicial law, it is due to the elimination of the  jobs of examining magistrate and assistant public public  prosecutor.    Then the general form of the bill was put to a vote and  approved.  <H5>  Amended Izmir Protocol </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the  Foreign  Policy Commission concerning the Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol  Bill, which was approved by the deputies.    Article 1: The Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol between the  governments of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, dated 21 Esfand 1355  [11 March 1977], as an amendment to the Amended Izmir Treaty  Protocol dated 28 Khordad 1369 [18 June 1980], consisting of 18  paragraphs and including new members of ECO (the republics of  Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) and other aspects implemented, which  was signed by the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran,  the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the Republic of Turkey in  Islamabad on 7 Azar 1371, corresponding to 28 November 1992, is  approved as a supplement and authorization is given to add it.  <H5>  Amendment to Majles Internal Guidelines </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Internal Guidelines Commission concerning  the Motion To Append One Note to Article 146 and One Note to  Article 148 of the Majles Internal Guidelines, of which Article  1 was approved.  <H5>  Article 1 </H5>   1 - The following note is appended to Article 146 of the  Majles Internal Guidelines:    Note: The specialist commission is required, at the time it  invites the minister involved and the deputy or deputies with  the question or questions, to also invite the Articles 88 and 90  Commission to send a representative to the specialist  commission, and if the Articles 88 and 90 Commission announces  the need, all the negotiations and documents requested must be  given to this commission.    2 - The following note is added to the Article 148 of the  Majles Internal Guidelines as Note 2:    Note 2: At the request of the Articles 88 and 90 Commission,  the grace period in the above article may be extended to a  maximum of two months.  <H5>  Amendment to Law Establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran </H5> Aviation Organization    The report from the second consultation of the Motion to  Amend Articles from the Law Establishing the Islamic Republic of  Iran Aviation Organization was the final item on the agenda,  continued consideration of which was postponed to the next  session.</p>

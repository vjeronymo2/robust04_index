However, there have been attempts  by criminal rings to coordinate their illegal activities in the  regions. And these attempts have not always been unsuccessful,"  First Deputy Interior Minister of Russia Colonel-General Mikhail  Yegorov said in his opening report on "business and crime in  Russia," delivered to a three-day international seminar "for  honest business," which opened at the Russian Management Academy  here today. The seminar is being attended by economists, law  scholars, bankers, and heads of commercial structures from  practically all the CIS countries.    General Yegorov noted that organised crime today controlled  about 40,000 commercial and state enterprises and organisations.  Capital, earned in recent years, is being multiplied mainly by  means of illegal financial transactions involving forged advice  notes, automobile trade, drug-trafficking and trade in armaments.    The struggle for spheres of influence among various criminal  gangs is continuing unabated. According to Yegorov, from 600 to  700 cases of racketeering, from 10 to 15 cases of  hostage-taking, and from 30 to 35 armed clashes between gangs  are now being registered every month.    Yegorov noted that the professionalism of criminals had  increased. This is borne out by the recent assassinations of  prominent bankers and businessmen.    The deputy minister urged businessmen to stop doubting the  efficiency of law enforcement bodies. He stressed, in  particular, that "full-blooded" units to combat organised crime  were formed in all the regions of the country, and that they  were prepared to react promptly and effectively to any extreme  situation. "To ensure honest business, we are able to take upon  ourselves the tasks of guarding commercial buildings,  transporting valuables and other cargoes, installing alarm  systems, which will bring our men to the spot within a few  minutes. We need common tactics to coordinate the actions of  private security services and official law enforcement bodies,"  Yegorov stated.</p>

The efforts of United Nations, NATO, international  organizations and the biggest countries to eliminate the Bosnian  conflict produced the results. We support the idea of passing  Sarajevo's administration to United Nations and expansion of the  peace zones in other parts of Bosnia.    Although Lithuania is separated from Bosnia by more than a  thousand kilometres, we are not indifferent to the senseless  massacre in Europe. Unfortunately, in some other European  countries the situation is not stable as well, so similar  conflicts should be prevented beforehand.    Lithuania is interested in peaceful, but determined and more  coordinated actions of the international community in regulating  the conflict in Bosnia.</p>

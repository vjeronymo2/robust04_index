			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Ministers set to act on legal right to silence CHANGES TO the law governing the defendant's right to silence in English criminal cases may come as soon as the next parliamentary session starting in November. With the need to restore confidence in the justice system acute after a series of wrongful convictions, ministers are keen to press ahead and implement the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice's less controversial and less costly recommendations without undue delay. The inclusion of a wide-ranging criminal justice bill in the next session's legislative programme should give the government an early opportunity to do this. The commission  - chaired by Lord Runciman and charged with conducting the most far-reaching review of the English criminal justice system for a century  - is set to report in just over two weeks. Though rapid action to implement the commission's ideas on fraught subjects such as disputed confessions and the right to trial by jury is unlikely from a government still smarting from last month's climbdown over means-related fines, ministers are minded to force the pace where there is more consensus. One such area is the defendant's right to silence. Another is the question of miscarriages of justice, where the commission is likely to recommend the creation of an independent tribunal to take the investigation of suspect cases out of the hands of the Home Office. If, as expected, the commission advocates that the defence be required to disclose its case early in pre-trial proceedings, ministers may act to incorporate the necessary legislative changes in the new criminal justice bill. These would be designed to outlaw the so-called 'ambush defence', where an accused person remains silent throughout an investigation but offers an explanation at trial. There would be no question of defendants being forced to incriminate themselves, however. The commission's research found that silence may have hampered the conviction of the guilty in 2 per cent or 3 per cent of cases  - enough, ministers believe, to make the case for reform a matter of priority. Moves towards swift implementation of some of the Runciman proposals would be one way for Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to demonstrate he has taken a grip on his new department in advance of what will be a busy legislative session for the Home Office. Measures to restrict a defendant's right to silence would be an issue on which the currently fractious Tory party could unite for the next session's legislative timetable.</p>

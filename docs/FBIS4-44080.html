			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to sources at the  12 states summit, which ends in Corfu today, the EU state and  government leaders failed today to agree on the new Commission  president to succeed Jacques Delors. The same sources also  noted that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that his country,  which will take over the EU Presidency on 1 July, would like to  convene an extraordinary summit on 15 July to settle the issue.  The deadlock in appointing Jacques Delors' successor is caused  by Britain's opposition to the candidacy of Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. British Foreign Secretary said that  the names of other candidates will also be discussed. Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Commissioner on Trade  Affairs Sir Leon Brittan have withdrawn from the race for the  Commission presidency.    The Greek presidency expressed its displeasure at Britain's  stand toward the Belgian prime minister's candidacy. Government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece does not see what  can change by 15 July when the next extraordinary EU summit will  convene. He added: The Greek presidency proposed the renewal  of Jacques Delors term of office.    Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Petros  Petridhis reports that the Greek proposal is being explored and  that Mr. Venizelos did not give any further details on the  proposal. At any rate, Mr. Delors' consent will be needed for  the proposal to be realized.</p>

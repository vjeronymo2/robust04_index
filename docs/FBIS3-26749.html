The stipulations of the Administrative Method are as  follows:    -- All commodities imported by selling units (including  commodities imported through border trade at ports) must be  reported to and checked by or registered with organs of  commodity inspection in Hainan within prescribed time, with such  documents as contracts, invoices, packing lists, bills of lading  shown.    Import commodities related to security and public health  must  be imported according to law in China.    Regarding import commodities that must be checked according  to law by commodity inspection organs, no one is allowed to sell  them without prior checking or without getting a pass at the  inspection.    -- For selling units that directly import the following nine  electromechanical products: automobiles, motorcycles,  motorcycle engines, television sets, refrigerators, air  conditioners, refrigerating compressors, air conditioning  compressors, and kinescopes, it is necessary to produce valid  "import commodity safety permits" provided by suppliers, and  signed and issued by the PRC State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, and to bear the  "CCIB" mark authorized by the State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. Commodities  arriving in Hainan must be reported to and checked by commodity  inspection organs promptly. The "commodity inspection label"  will be issued after getting a pass in the commodity inspection.  Only when the label is put on the outside package can a  commodity be sold to consumers in the market according to  relevant laws and regulations stipulated by industrial and  commercial administrative departments.    -- When producing invoices of import commodities sold,  selling units should state clearly the countries of origin,  specifications, and models of commodities.    -- Commodity inspection organs and industrial and commercial  administrative departments spot check, supervise, and administer  import commodities in the realm of circulation according to law  and can spot check, at any time, import commodities to be sold  in the realm of circulation, but selling units must never, under  whatever grounds, reject the spot check.</p>

EMI CDC 754424-2 THE longest day of the year falls this weekend and midsummer music is in full swing. The blossoming of music festivals has become one of the most agreeable features of the English summer and it is difficult to picture June without them - sun-drenched walks along the beach at Aldeburgh, picnics at Glyndebourne, the gentility of Buxton and Georgian elegance of Cheltenham soon to follow. One of the favourite works at this time of year is inevitably Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The music always wins a ready following, but it is only the more adventurous festivals that perform it with Shakespeare's play, as intended. At home a recording of text and music together might seem an unsatisfactory prospect and yet this is what EMI has just issued and with conspicuous success. Of all the sets of incidental music, this is perhaps the most intricate. Mendelssohn sprinkles a magical dusting of music over the whole play. The arrival of Titania and Oberon, for example, provokes a short greeting of sprite-like delicacy and their ensuing conversation is accompanied by a myriad little phrases of will-o'-the-wisp orchestral filigree. Jeffrey Tate and his Rotterdam orchestra give an agreeable account of the score and actors from The Peter Hall Company speak the text. The two halves, moreover, have been put together in a convincingly atmospheric acoustic. Purcell's The Fairy Queen is also a Midsummer Night's Dream entertainment, though in this case music and play remain pretty well separate. There is little argument for including the text on a recording, but it is a shame that when Benjamin Britten recorded the piece in 1970, he saw fit to make a drastic arrangement of the music. Most of the score is re-ordered; some is omitted altogether. There is always a case for hearing what Britten made of another composer's music and this Decca re-issue remains an important set; but not all the singing matches the best that we have heard since. There are echoes of Britten and - even more - Walton in Summer's Last Will and Testament by the never-quite-forgotten Constant Lambert. This is a choral work with orchestra, written in the 1930s to words by the Elizabethan poet Thomas Nashe. In his poetry summer becomes an evil season when plague and pestilence start to spread (Nashe himself is believed to have died of the plague c1601). There is plenty of jazz-based energy in the score and Lambert's distinctive fingerprint is on every bar. But in the end this is a disturbing work, which shows for once the depressing depths that lurked beneath the composer's sunny exterior. Strangely memorable. In Haydn's Die Jahreszeiten ('The Seasons') summer arrives in a blaze of D major. This is the noon-day sun at its height, celebrated by a chorus of villagers in music of radiant affirmation. The mood, however, soon changes: a tenor solo in the minor tells of the drought that follows, of 'wilting flowers, parched fields and fountains run dry' - a reminder that summer had its downside long before the phrase 'global warming' had ever been invented. In that passage on Archiv's new recording Anthony Rolfe Johnson is the marvellously sensitive tenor and he is but one of three exemplary soloists. Barbara Bonney is the wholly delectable soprano and Andreas Schmidt an eloquent baritone, just a mite short on open-hearted rustic vigour. The standard of choral singing and playing under John Eliot Gardiner is as immaculate as one might expect and little, in terms of pictorial vividness or expressive feeling, seems to escape the conductor's notice. In 1991, for the Mozart bicentenary year, the Glyndebourne Festival invited five British composers to write wind serenades loosely based on that festival's Mozart operas. The most successful of the pieces drew an appreciative, if small, audience in the gardens and now EMI has gathered them together on an imaginative new disc. It is difficult to imagine a less painful way to get an introduction to some of our brightest younger composers. I especially enjoyed Robert Saxton's dramatic paraphrase on Idomeneo and Stephen Oliver's haunting, pensive octet derived from La clemenza di Tito. Best of all, though, is the Figaro serenade by Jonathan Dove - open-air music, breezy, glinting with evening sunshine. This is perfectly conceived summer garden entertainment: a different choice for midsummer night this year, if Mendelssohn does not mind.</p>

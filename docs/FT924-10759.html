			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at auction are continuing to drift very gradually and erratically into lower ground, although there is no all-round decline and there are instances of a firmer tendency at times. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached a new low point for the season of 498 on October 28, but this is only 8 cents lower than a week earlier. Hope of reviving Russian demand for wool have subsided even in New Zealand, where attempts by the Wool Board to resume trade directly have been aborted after problems with payment and accelerating depreciation of the rouble.</p>

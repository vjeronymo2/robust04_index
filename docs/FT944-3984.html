			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Eggar gives approval for gas pipeline: Pounds 440m link will boost exports A Pounds 440m pipeline linking Britain with the European natural gas grid received the go-ahead yesterday, paving the way for large-scale gas exports from the UK by the end of the decade. Nine companies, led by British Gas, agreed to fund the pipeline, known as the interconnector, which will run from Bacton on the East Anglian coast to Zeebrugge in Belgium, one of the hubs of the Continental gas grid. Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, yesterday said the pipeline 'will be of great strategic benefit to the UK and the rest of Europe'. He predicted that the interconnector would 'give an important stimulus' to attempts to open up access to monopoly gas pipelines on the Continent. Liberalisation of the Continental gas market has lagged well behind the reforms taking place in Britain. British Gas yesterday said the interconnector should 'open up new opportunities for the company in Europe'. The company, which has substantial gas reserves in the North Sea and off the west coast of Britain, expects that a surplus of gas might develop later in the decade. A planning application for the pipeline will be submitted early next year, in time for construction to begin in the spring of 1996. The pipeline is likely to be completed in the autumn of 1998. It will carry 20bn cubic metres of gas annually. Officials close to the project believe the flow of UK gas to continental Europe will last for between 10 and 15 years. The likely depletion of British reserves after that could then result in a reversal of the flow, officials say. Gazprom, the Russian company which is the dominant exporter of gas to western Europe, has a 10 per cent stake in the project, even though the prospect of exporting gas to the UK is some way off. The construction of the pipeline will also open up the possibility of Norwegian gas exports to the Continent being routed through the British gas grid. The Frigg line currently runs from Norway to Scotland. Such a development may, however, necessitate considerable expansion of British Gas's national, high-pressure transmission system. Officials at TransCo, British Gas's pipeline subsidiary, have estimated that hundreds of millions of pounds may have to be spent on the grid to cope with the additional flows of gas. The companies participating in the scheme include Amerada Hess of the US, British Gas, British Petroleum and its Norwegian partner Statoil, Norsk Hydro, Conoco of the US, Belgium's Distrigaz, Elf of France, Ruhrgas of Germany and Gazprom of Russia.</p>

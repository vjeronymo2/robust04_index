			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis to step up expansion of sugar side Saint-Louis, the French food and transport group, plans to accelerate its expansion within the European sugar industry, according to Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman. Mr Dumon told Le Figaro, the French newspaper, that he was interested in increasing the company's sugar activities in France and in the emerging eastern European markets. The chairman also affirmed that the group, which suffered a fall in net profits last year, was on course for recovery in 1994. Saint-Louis is already in negotiations to augment its western European sugar interests by raising its stake in General Azucarera, the Spanish sugar concern, from the present level of 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The deal involves the acquisition of a holding now owned by the Banco Central Hispano-americano banking group. The talks with Banco Hispanoamericano have been under way for some months. Mr Dumon said that the two companies were about to resume negotiations in earnest after a lull during the summer holidays. When the General Azucarera deal is completed, Saint-Louis, which is understood to be able to spend more than FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) on acquisitions, will turn its attention to expansion elsewhere in Europe. One priority is eastern Europe, where it already has projects under way in Poland and the Czech Republic. The group has already announced that it might sell its 2.4 per cent stake in Danone, another French food group, to finance its future expansion. Mr Dumon estimated the value of the Danone holding at about FFr1.3bn. He also forecast a 'substantial improvement' in net profits for Saint-Louis this year. The group last year saw net profits slip to FFr717m from FFr774m in 1992. The chairman envisaged static profits from sugar during 1994, with an increased contribution from prepared meals and a significant upturn from the paper business.</p>

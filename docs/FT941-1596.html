			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace rises on back of motor side A stronger contribution from its motor distribution operations enabled Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust to record a 19 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.4m for the year to end-December. Although the motor side's contribution to overall turnover was static at Pounds 138m, the division benefited from greater operational efficiency and enhanced margins and lifted profits by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.43m. The leisure and holiday activities increased market share but trading conditions remained difficult. Their contribution to profits fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.27m. Group turnover expanded from Pounds 227m to Pounds 233m. Earnings worked through at 22.7p (19.1p) and a final dividend of 8p raises the total by 1p to 11p. Looking ahead, the directors anticipated a further improvement in profits during 1994, 'particularly from the motor operation which has had an excellent start to the year'. They were also looking for complementary acquisitions to enhance all divisions. Year-end borrowings were reduced by 21.5 per cent to Pounds 15.9m and a further reduction was looked for in 1994. The company's ordinary shares closed 18p lower at 605p while the A shares shed 12p at 314p.</p>

Our  correspondent was at the airport and spoke to Faustino Muteka,  head of the government delegation. He did not disclose anything  new.    [Begin recording] [Muteka] We are negotiating. It has been  agreed that there should be discretion. So, I would not like to  hinder the talks in any way.    [Reporter] If it depended on the government delegation, how  long it would take to find a settlement?    [Muteka] If the other side adopts an unwavering attitude, we  will need more time to study ways of reaching consensus and  signing an accord.    [Reporter] Does the government delegation has enough powers  so that it will not need to return to Luanda to receive new  instructions?    [Muteka] It is not like that. The government team has full  powers. It is the government delegation...    [Reporter, interrupting] Is there any consensus?    [Muteka] We must discuss any new developments with the  government. [end recording]    So, the delegation remains discreet. The composition of the  government delegation has not been disclosed. There are no  details about the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola delegation, although it has been reported that its  members are in Kinshasa. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special  representative in Angola, has asked that the talks should resume  at 1600 tomorrow because he intends to fulfill his schedule.  This morning he was in Libreville and in the afternoon in  Kinshasa. He intends to meet the U.S. Congress delegation  tomorrow morning.</p>

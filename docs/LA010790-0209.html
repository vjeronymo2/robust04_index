			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUINTET OF YOUNG PLAYERS FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A DEFINITE REJUVENATION IN ACOUSTIC JAZZ  -- PARTICULARLY OF THE MAINSTREAM PERSUASION, WHERE THE MUSIC'S TRUE ROOTS  RESIDE, BUT ALSO IN THE AVANT-GARDE. SOME ARTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO CONCOCT  STYLES THAT INVIGORATINGLY AND INVENTIVELY BLEND THE TWO STYLES. CALENDAR'S  JAZZ WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS AS THOSE MOST LIKELY TO  HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS REVITALIZED AREA IN THE COMING DECADE.;  </P> <P> BILLY CHILDS  </P> <P> The youthful Los Angeles keyboardist Billy Childs is well on his way to  creating a singular voice in jazz as an instrumentalist and improviser, as a  composer and as a bandleader -- just as his chief influence, Herbie Hancock,  did early in his career. Classically trained, Childs couples formidable  technique with musical situations that challenge him, resulting in a player who  grows and grows.  </P> <P> "Twilight Is Upon Us," Childs' second Windham Hill Jazz release, is replete  with thought-filled, exciting modern music that reaches for the future yet  remembers jazz's noble, swinging past. Already widely respected locally and  nationally among his peers -- he's played with Freddie Hubbard, Gerry Mulligan,  J.J. Johnson and Branford Marsalis -- Childs should establish an international  reputation in the next decade. ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

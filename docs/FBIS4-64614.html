			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Parliamentary sources said Thursday [28  April] that the recent friction between the United States and  Turkey on emptying the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline could  jeopardize a new extension of the mandate for coalition forces  based in Turkey to protect the Iraqi Kurds.    The debate was highlighted after Turkish Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin met with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, U.S.  permanent representative to the United Nations, in Washington on  Wednesday.    Albright reportedly expressed American concern over the  possibility of a violation of the U.N. embargo on Iraq, while  Cetin said he had fully assured the United States that Turkey  had no such intention.    Cetin recalled on Thursday though that Turkey was a country  which had been affected most by Gulf War losses and that its  direct and indirect losses had already reached $20 billion.  "Despite this," he said, "I told Albright that Turkey was  acting according to U.N. decisions."    Turkey is currently concerned that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik  pipeline is being damaged owing to its closure which has been in  effect since 1990 and wants to pump out the oil contained in the  pipeline. In Cetin's words, such an effort would not be a  violation of the sanctions but should be interpreted as only  maintenance work.    In early April, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary  Ozdem  Sanberk visited Baghdad where the Iraqi side agreed to Turkey  emptying the pipeline, leading to a strong reaction from the  United States.    Last weekend, U.S. Ambassador to Ankara Richard Barkley  visited Sanberk at the Foreign Ministry and reportedly told him  that a Turkish initiative to be taken on this issue without any  consultations could create problems in keeping promises which  had earlier been given to this country.    The Turkish press has dubbed these remarks as a "warning" or  a "note." Foreign Ministry officials prefer to refer to them as  "an American initiative."    Turkey argues that there are about 12 million barrels of oil  in the pipeline, which is now corroding away, and an amount  equivalent to 7.5 million barrels on the Turkish side of the  border. Along with the 2 million barrels in tanks in  Yumurtalik, the amount of oil on the Turkish side is currently  at around 9.5 million barrels or the equivalent of $60 million.    The 986-kilometer pipeline extends from Karkuk in Iraqi  territory to Turkey and 641-kilometers of the line runs inside  Turkish territory. Daily capacity before the closure was  1,200,000 barrels of crude oil or an annual 70.9 million tons of  crude.    Unless a solution can be found to the crisis, Turkey will  continue to lose some $5 billion a year and in Cetin's words,  "This is leading to feelings that Turkey is being punished."  The effects of these feelings have, in turn, been evident among  the Turkish electorate, leading rapidly to reactions in  Parliament.    Hints have been given that in the upcoming June meeting,  which is to decide on extending the mandate of the coalition  forces based in Turkey, Parliament is to take into account the  American attitude on its project to empty the pipeline and for  Turkey to use the 3.5 million barrels which it owns.    According to political sources in Parliament, even if Ciller  puts pressure on her group to extend the mandate, the reaction  of the electorate will be stronger this time, turning the debate  into the most difficult of all.    Turkey has had frequent problems in extending the mandate  since the Motherland Party (ANAP) was ousted from power in the  October 1991 elections.    The then new Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, who was  critical of Turgut Ozal's Gulf War policy, first reacted  adversely to the issue but was later persuaded into agreeing to  an extension.    The former social democrat deputy prime minister, Erdal  Inonu, as well as his predecessor, Murat Karayalcin, were also  convinced by highlevel state staff of the necessity of extending  the mandate.    But the friction with the United States, the heavy losses  which have occurred owing to the pipeline closure and the  serious economic crisis Turkey is going through are now  reportedly putting more pressure on politicians. The recent  electoral victory of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), which  has been voting continuously against the extension, is cited as  another pressure.    In his commentary titled "The secret formula which angered  the U.S.A." mass circulation HURRIYET writer Sedat Ergin wrote  Thursday that Turkey's final trump card would be the Provide  Comfort Operation dubbed by the Turkish public as Poised Hammer.    Ergin also warned against the atmosphere in Turkey  immediately after the RP victory which was one opposing this  force.    In the words of one senior official, "Whatever we do and  whatever Mrs. Ciller does, this time there is the serious risk  that the DYP [True Path Party] group may not be persuaded."    Turkish officials believe that if the pipeline could be  emptied this would lift some of the economic burden being  shouldered by the people and would without doubt bring about the  conditions necessary for the government to extend the mandate.  In Ergin's words, "Turkey's bargaining chips are not as small  as some people think."</p>

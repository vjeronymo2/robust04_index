			<p>BFN     [Text] Organizations and enterprises in the light industry  and service sector in Pyongyang have carried out the work of  assisting [wonho saop] People's Army units on the occasion of  the festive day of April, the most glorious day of the nation.  Functionaries and workers in these sectors -- who have greatly  glorified the traditional trait of Army-people unity by  vigorously carrying out the slogan "Our post is our plant, and  our plant is our post" -- again visited People's Army units on  11 April with relief materials [wonho mulcha] they sincerely  prepared.    Functionaries and workers in light industrial plants,  including the Pyongyang Textile Machine Plant, the Koksan Plant,  the Shoe Plant, and the Children Knitting Plant, prepared  various gifts [wimunpum] with their warm, caring hearts and they  love the People's Army units as much as they love their real  brothers and sisters.    Functionaries of the plants, who visited the People's Army  units, have strengthened Army-people friendship [kunminui  chong], while explaining to soldiers the successes that the  working class brought about in implementing the party's light  industry-first policy in response to the great leader's New Year  address and the decision made at the 21st plenary session of the  sixth party Central Committee.    Their assistance work [wonho saop] has further inspired  revolutionary zeal and combatant courage among the soldiers who  strongly prepare to become one-a-match-for-a-hundred  revolutionary fighters.    Functionaries and workers in the commercial service  organization -- who have properly carried out the work of  assisting People's Army units -- also visited People's Army  units that day with relief materials [wonhopum] they sincerely  prepared. With their boundless loyalty to the party and the  leader [suryong], their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude, and their devoted spirit of serving the people,  functionaries in the service sector have resolved to further  improve and strengthen the commercial service activity and to  continue supporting soldiers, while soldiers have fully  displayed their burning zeal to firmly retain the posts of the  fatherland.</p>

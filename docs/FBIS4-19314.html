			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Steele report: "Bottomley and MI5 Chief on `IRA Hit </F> List'"]    [Text] The head of MI5, Mrs Stella Rimington, and Mrs  Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, were among potential  IRA targets on documents found at the home of an English  terrorist recruit after a Harrods explosion, a jury was told  yesterday.    Mrs Bottomley's name was in a notebook found in a jacket  allegedly belonging to Patrick Hayes, 41, accused of planting  the bomb at the Knightsbridge store, said Mr John Bevan,  prosecuting at the Old Bailey.    Two newspaper articles about Mrs Rimington, from THE  GUARDIAN, including one with her picture, were also found.  Hayes had allegedly written on them details of her supposed  address.    There were also, on cigarette paper in a vacuum cleaner  dustbag, details of senior Army officers, some taken from the  SHOOTING TIMES. Other documents recorded details of lavatories  in London hotels. Mr Bevan added: "Bombs in hotels are  obviously totally indiscriminate."    Mr Bevan said the notebook could "fairly be described as a  hit list."    The jury was told that the Canary Wharf tower in east  London,  Europe's second tallest building, "miraculously" escaped  devastation from a huge IRA fertiliser bomb when a detonator  went off but failed to ignite the main explosives.    The bomb was similar to other home-made IRA bombs which  twice  devastated the City of London and also wrecked the Staples  Corner junction of the M1 in north London.    Mr Bevan said Hayes, one of two Englishmen accused of being  IRA bombers, could be linked to the conspiracy to bomb Canary  Wharf.    Hayes is alleged to have planted a bomb which injured four  people at the Harrods store in Knightsbridge in January last  year. He was allegedly captured on video film with Jan Taylor,  51, a former soldier.    The pair are also said to have bombed a train from Victoria  to Ramsgate in Kent in February last year.    Their capture, at Hayes's home in Walford Road, Stoke  Newington, north London, in March last year after the Harrods  films were released to the media, enabled police to capture  guns, explosives and bomb-making equipment.    It also brought together two previously separate terrorist  investigations: Operations Brompton, springing from the Harrods  and Rarnsgate explosions, and Canary, probing the tower bomb and  other bombs found in Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park in  north London, the jury was told.    Hayes has refused to plead on what he says are "political  matters" but not guilty pleas have been entered for him, alone,  on allegations of three conspiracies to bomb Canary Wharf,  Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park.    Pleas of not guilty have also been entered for Taylor, of  Stepney, east London, jointly charged with Hayes of eight  further counts, including bombing Harrods and the train and  firearms offences.    The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

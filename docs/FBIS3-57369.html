Ivan Plyushch, the Supreme Soviet Chairman, told deputies  that opposing views had crystallized. Numerous deputies want to  keep the rights of the presidential representatives intact, not  delegating part of them to the elected bodies. Others insisted  on electing all local authorities.    Plyushch also said that if the Supreme Soviet did not make a  decision on the referendum, the president had a right to do so.    The proposal that a referendum on basic constitutional  provisions should be held had been made by the constitutional  conference held on January 14. These provisions include the  list of the powers to be exercised by the president, the Supreme  Soviet and the government.    By that draft, the president's functions would be only  representing the country on the international scene and  supervision of the government activities.    The Supreme Soviet would remain the highest legislative body  while the government would take over all the executive functions.    Parliament will continue the debate on January 26.</p>

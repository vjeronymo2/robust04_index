			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDEPENDENCE OF SOVIET UNIONS CALLED CRUCIAL;  </P> <P> LABOR: NEW FEDERATION SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS WORKERS IN A  MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY.  </P> <P> Worried about protecting the rights of labor as the Soviet Union uses market  forces to transform its economy, delegates representing 55 million workers met  Tuesday to establish an independent trade union system.  </P> <P> "There is great uncertainty about the future," Igor Y. Klochkov, chairman of  the new Federation of Independent Trade Unions of the Russian Republic, told  the opening of its second organizational congress. "Only an independent trade  union can represent the interests of workers."  </P> <P> Although he is a top official of the present Soviet labor union hierarchy,  Klochkov harshly criticized the country's existing unions as incapable of  representing worker interests. They have been used for too long by the ruling  Communist Party to carry out its policies, he said, and, consequently, are not  up to the challenge of capitalism.  </P> <P> Klochkov praised the program of radical economic reforms now under debate by  the Supreme Soviet, the country's Legislature, as "an effective instrument to  cure our sick economy."  </P> <P> But he demanded that the government negotiate with his federation about a  welfare structure to prevent the exploitation of workers under the new economic  system. Ivan S. Silayev, premier of the Russian Republic, last week held a  four-hour meeting with the new-style union leaders.  </P> <P> "We are on the eve of very deep changes that will touch all parts of our  society," Klochkov said.  </P> <P> The federation's main role, organizers said, will be to battle with the  government to set a minimum wage, a 40-hour workweek, higher pensions,  unemployment compensation and other social welfare programs to create a safety  net in the country's new economic system.  </P> <P> "As we move toward a market system, our No. 1 priority is to protect wage  earners," said Yevgeni V. Arapov, one of the federation's leaders. "We are in  favor of a market system with strict guarantees for decent living standards for  those who are not rich."  </P> <P> Delegates first met in March to try to establish the new federation, with the  goal of replacing the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, which for  nearly seven decades dictated the will of the Communist Party leadership to  local trade unions. However, political differences kept the delegates from  working out a program in March.  </P> <P> Coal miners, who organized the biggest strikes in Soviet history 14 months ago,  are still boycotting the congress.  </P> <P> The miners say the new union resembles too closely the old council, although  it, unlike the council, agrees that strikes can be used to fight for workers'  rights and is setting up a strike-support fund. Many of the federation's  leaders held posts in the old council, and some still do; Klochkov is a deputy  chairman of the old organization.  </P> <P> "The old leaders of the trade union apparatus cannot 'restructure' themselves  and start representing the workers at last," Vladimir A. Filenko, a member of  the miners' strike committee in the Arctic coal fields of Vorkuta, said in a  telephone interview. "We do not believe this kind of restructuring is humanly  possible. So, we are going to create our own truly independent union."  </P> <P> Leaders of the new federation, however, defended their ability to turn their  backs on the old-style union leadership, which was more concerned with  maintaining production quotas than with getting better wages for workers.  </P> <P> "Of course, we can change, just as the Soviet people will have to change,"  Arapov said. "The people who lived for 70 years under socialism will now have  to learn to live in a capitalist society. We aren't getting new people from  some other planet. The country can't find all new leaders, either."  </P> <P> Arapov is the head of public relations and human services for the new  federation -- the same post he held at the council.  </P> <P> Although organizers of the miners' labor movement criticized the federation,  they conceded that it is a step in the right direction.  </P> <P> "It's good that there's at least an alternative to the old trade union  organization, which never represented the workers' needs," Filenko said.  </P> <P> Yuri A. Bolderev, a leader of the miners' strike committee in the Donetsk  region of the Ukraine, said the new union federation adds yet another player to  the power game in the Soviet Union, which was formerly dominated by one player,  the Communist Party.  </P> <P> "Now there are many players," Bolderev said. "The game has become more  complicated, and that's good."  </P> <P> Nikolai Y. Akritov, the federation's press spokesman and not a party member,  said the new trade union council is a great change.  </P> <P> "Someone who did not belong to the Communist Party could never have held a  responsible post in union leadership," he said. "The fact that I head the press  section indicates a huge change."  </P> <P> The difference between the two organizations, he said, can be compared to a  pyramid that used to be upside down, teetering on its tip, but has been  righted. The top leadership in the council made all the rules and passed them  on to local trade unions. Now, workers and local unions will direct the  federation's leadership to fulfill their demands.  </P> <P> "The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions was never anything more than a  puppet of the Communist Party," Akritov said. "The federation is an umbrella  that will protect us from returning to the command system."  </P> <P> A flyer advertising the new federation shows it cutting the puppet strings that  the Communist Party used to control the labor unions.  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Perrier The battle for Source Perrier looks to have swung decisively in favour of Nestle thanks to yesterday's court decision to cancel a 13.8 per cent stake in the French water company previously controlled by the rival Agnelli camp. Combined with an earlier ruling, the effect is to reduce the Agnellis' voting stake from 49 per cent to 32 per cent, just below what is needed for a blocking minority. If the market is right and the heavyweight Swiss group wins the subsequent auction, minority shareholders will hardly complain. The current saga admittedly began with an attempt at creeping control, while the legal obstacle course facing the two sides has hardly proved to be good publicity outside France. On the other hand, the final price offered for Societe Generale de Belgique in 1988 demonstrated that on the rare occasions when bidding wars do develop on the continent minorities can be the winners.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Socialists snub Balladur reform France's opposition Socialist party yesterday refused to be co-opted into accepting anti-corruption reforms by the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, in advance of a parliamentary debate on the issue on Friday. The opposition wants to remain free to insist during the parliamentary debate that the conservative government reverse its easing of anti-corruption measures passed by its Socialist predecessor.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Quayle line on modern lifestyle causes furore IT NEVER ceases to amaze that a single sentence can spawn a million words. Vice-President Dan Quayle's comment in California on Tuesday about a fictional television character could yet break all records. It could also make or break a few political reputations. The furore surrounding his assault on the lifestyle of Murphy Brown - a forty-something white, wealthy career woman who chooses to have a baby out of wedlock - might be dismissed as just another example of the prevalent confusion between fact and fiction, but for its immediate political impact. It has demonstrated, above all, how concerned President George Bush's re-election campaign is about shoring up his political base among Republican conservatives, previously attracted to Mr Pat Buchanan but now under threat from the prospective independent candidacy of Mr Ross Perot. The clear strategy is for Mr Quayle, popular with such conservatives, to secure this heartland, while Mr Bush plays a more aloof role. The vice-president will be allowed to attack the media and all its creations, real and imagined. Mr William Barr, the attorney-general, has been designated a key supporting actor in the upholding of law and social order. The conservative message is that the collapse of traditional family values is the real dagger pointing at America's heart and a key factor behind the Los Angeles riots. 'It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown - a character who supposedly epitomises today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman - mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another lifestyle choice,' Mr Quayle said on Tuesday. In the city ghettoes of the US, it is a fact that well over half of black children are born out of wedlock, well over half of all families are headed by single women, and well over half of all families live below the poverty line. But the relevance of their plight to the Murphy Brown character, a television anchorwoman played by actress Candice Bergen, is distant. One survey puts the programme, although the third most popular nationally, 55th among black TV audiences. As for the election strategy obligation for Mr Bush to play a kinder, gentler role, events after Mr Quayle spoke laid bare one of the president's great weaknesses: his frequent inability, especially when impromptu, to articulate with any clarity what he does believe in. Mr Bush seemed embarrassed, almost hapless, in the face of a barrage of reporters' questions on the issue. Abortion, which the president now opposes, is at the heart of the row. It could be an Achilles heel for him this year. Only this week, Mr Bush announced that a new human tissue bank would not be allowed to use tissue from aborted foetuses. Yet an ambivalence, an apparent desire to have it both ways, remains. This leaves the president politically vulnerable to the more confident assertions of his opponents and even of his supporters. Mr Quayle does at least state what he thinks, with confidence, which is why some pundits have taken to referring to him as the stronger part of the Republican presidential ticket this year.</p>

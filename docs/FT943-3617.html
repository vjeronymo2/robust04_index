			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Polythene expands 30% - Shares climb in spite of price increase and warnings of more to come British Polythene Industries, Europe's largest polythene film producer, announced an average 15 per cent increase in industrial and retail product prices yesterday in the wake of raw material price rises. Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, said the company was raising sales prices to customers following a 25 per cent increase in polymer prices to over Pounds 500 per tonne in August. British Polythene increased pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from Pounds 6.61m to Pounds 8.61m in the half-year to 30 June. Turnover rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 96.6m to Pounds 116m with a Pounds 3m contribution from acquisitions. Operating profits were ahead at Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 7.77m) helped by Pounds 99,000 from acquisitions. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 12.29p to 14.82p. The share price closed up 7p at 488p yesterday. The raw material price increases reflected general upward pressure on prices in the world plastics market and further increases are likely in the near future, including a 10 per cent rise in October. 'In the short term these raw material cost increases present our customers and ourselves with pricing problems,' he said. However, in the absence of monthly rises in polythene prices, Mr McLatchie anticipated that margins would begin to improve again once prices had settled down. In the medium term the raw material prices would not have a detrimental effect on the business, particularly as prices were heading 'for the level where our recycling will start to show good returns'. The company was able to offer more competitive prices for its recycled material as virgin plastic prices rose. The directors said British Polythene continued its acquisitive strategy, buying a further seven businesses this year with total pre-acquisition turnover of Pounds 25m. Gearing rose from 18 per cent last time to 28 per cent with net borrowings of Pounds 23m. Acquisitions included Nelson Packaging, a specialist carrier bag business, the remaining UK polythene assets of Nyborg Plast and Megafilm. An interim dividend of 4.5p (3.75p) was declared. COMMENT British Polythene demonstrated it is a credible business yesterday when its shares closed up 7p despite its price increases and warnings of more. It is a credit to the business that the market also believes price rises should not be regarded as a major problem per se. If rises in raw material costs can be passed on efficiently, the possibility remains that margins might even improve. Acquisitions have blurred the company's results but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge and organic growth of 4 to 5 per cent was achieved this time. Forecasts put profits between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18.5m next year and Pounds 19m and Pounds 21m in 1995. The shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 15 and look a safe bet for the the medium-term investor.</p>

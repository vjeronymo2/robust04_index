			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Heseltine plans to be back at his desk this month MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is set to return to work at the end of this month after a rapid recovery from the heart attack he suffered in Venice in June. The return of Mr Heseltine, one of the cabinet's most forceful communicators, will boost government hopes of political recovery this autumn from the disasters of the past year. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will look to Mr Heseltine to carry the government's message to the country in a way that few other ministers are able to manage. However, Mr Heseltine is expected to restrict himself to light duties for some time, suggesting that he remains less than fully fit. He has been sent important papers in the past few weeks, but is not receiving the boxes of government papers which form a large part of the ministerial workload. Mr Heseltine is said to be listening carefully to medical advice on the extent of his workload, and is likely to avoid highly stressful situations, at least initially. This means that he may decide not to deliver a platform address to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool next month - an event which is normally a conference highlight. However, he is said to be keen to attend the conference, and he may decide to address one or more smaller gatherings on the conference fringe. Mr Heseltine will return to a busy departmental schedule, including the need for decisions on coal privatisation and the terms of reference for a forthcoming review of the nuclear power industry. He will also have to decide whether to accept the recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the break-up of British Gas. The department will also receive the results of its studies into the elimination of red tape later this year, and Mr Heseltine will want to be closely involved in the development of an omnibus deregulation bill for the next parliament. Mr Heseltine will also want to give a further impetus to the delayed negotiations on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in which he takes a keen interest. He is said to be keen to get back to work, and determined to retake the reins of at the Department of Trade and Industry as quickly as poss-ible. Speculation that Mr Heseltine might be moved by Mr Major to replace Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party, is said to be unfounded.</p>

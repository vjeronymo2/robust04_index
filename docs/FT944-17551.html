			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK food brands fail to whet the investor's appetite: Impressed, but do they want to buy the company? Why make do with just a cup of Tetley's tea or a dab of Colman's mustard? If you really like the products, you can buy their makers. They are but two of the UK food manufacturers officially for sale, and many more businesses could be bought if the right offers were made to their increasingly reluctant parents.  Northern Foods, Unigate, Hillsdown Holdings, Albert Fisher, Dalgety, Grand Metropolitan and Unilever are some of the companies the City believes would entertain offers for selective subsidiaries. The last time the industry saw so many assets on the block was in the late 1980s. Most deals then were driven by ambitions to get into food manufacturing. It was seen as a growth area protected by strong brands and highly processed foods. This time the pressure is on the sell side. Some companies such as Allied Domecq, seller of Tetley and the rest of its food activities, and Reckitt &amp; Colman, seller of the eponymous mustard plus the rest of its UK food and drink lines, have decided to redeploy their capital in spirits and household cleaners respectively. The sellers also include companies, still committed to food, which are disposing of some brands to focus their food portfolio more sharply. Dalgety, for example, is making food a solely UK business while pushing its international ambitions in food ingredients and petfoods. The trading environment is making food manufacturers reconsider their strategies. 'A number of companies are finding it too hot to stay in,' says Mr Ian Davis, a director of McKinsey, the management consultants. Food price deflation, increasing competition from supermarket own-label products and price-conscious consumers have combined to shred manufacturers' profit margins. Crisps, baked beans and bread are just three products where prices have been driven down to uneconomic levels. Each manufacturer has its own bete noire. For Associated British Foods, the largest UK baker, it is the supermarkets. 'Supermarkets' own labels leave us branded fellows adrift,' says Mr Garry Weston, ABF's chairman. He is now more interested in food ingredients than foods, and preferably outside the UK. To that end, ABF bought its first US manufacturing plants this week. Not all products are similarly afflicted. Some, such as prepared sauces, are fast growing. Strong niche sectors such as mustard are too small to attract an own-label onslaught. On the downside, though, packaged ambient foods are losing out to chilled and frozen foods. Some products need reviving. Tea and cakes, for example, look stodgy in the face of newer drinks and snacks. Given the industry's problems, who would be buyers? The obvious ones are multinationals wanting to build up UK operations. CPC and Heinz from the US, and Danone (formerly BSN) and Nestle from continental Europe are mentioned most often. Among UK companies, Northern, Unigate and Hillsdown are likely to turn buyers now they are close to selling off the last bits they do not want. Allied Domecq's food ingredients business could appeal to Dalgety and ABF at the right price. Other companies are keen to buy brands or plants which bring economies of scale to manufacture and marketing while building market shares. But it is hard to find a company to buy to get you into fast growing areas, says Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive of Dalgety. The rare targets are typically 'small companies that can't fund their own growth'. The UK also remains an efficient place to make food for foreign sale, where its value justifies the transport costs. ABF, for example, is sending frozen garlic bread to Holland. The debate over prices is becoming heated. Some sellers 'have stretched their profit margins to glory relative to own-label products,' says one food manufacturer, expressing surprise at high asking prices. 'The sellers are still hankering after the prices of yesteryear but the buyers are looking to the low margins of tomorrow,' says Mr Michael Landymore, a Henderson Crosthwaite analyst. A study by Smith New Court of food acquisitions shows Cadbury Schweppes paying 15.5 times cashflow and two times book value for Trebor. The purchase gave it a big leg up in sugar confectionery and a mint brand to compete against Nestle's Polo. In contrast, Hobson bought the Co-op's largely own-label food business, for seven times cash flow and 1.3 times book value. Where bid and ask prices are far apart, realism could prevail in many cases. The restructuring pressures are too great to ignore. 'People are realising they are not the right owners of some of their assets,' one strategist says.</p>

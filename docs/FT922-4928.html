			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fall at Powell Duffryn less than City had feared SHARES IN Powell Duffryn, the distribution, storage and engineering company, jumped 30p to 396p yesterday on news of far better-than-expected profits of Pounds 24.6m pre-tax in a year of wide-ranging restructuring. The profits, which were struck on turnover Pounds 25.5m down at Pounds 749.3m, represented a 15 per cent decline on the previous year. Analysts had been expecting a much sharper decline to Pounds 21m for the year to March 31. The dividend - maintained for the third year at 22.6p via a same-again 16p final - also helped to support the shares, although cover fell from 1.4 to 1.1 times. During the year, PD shed its quarrying interests, shifted its marine transport focus to land-based services with the acquisition of Tees and Hartlepool port, expanded its engineering businesses and quit foundries. The refocusing - which included several disposals - left the group with gearing of less than 20 per cent. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the group's strategic activities had been more important than the actual results. However, he added: 'A 15 per cent decline in a . . . group which is 80 to 90 per cent reliant on the (depressed) UK . . . is a figure not to be ashamed of.' The largest factor in the group's decline was attributed to the Pounds 4m loss at Powell Duffryn Standard, which is developing a railway freight wagon base - known as a bogie - for use on both sides of the Channel. Orders for traditional railway wagons - which normally run to between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m annually and were expected to offset losses on the new bogies - had disappeared, Mr Hubbard said. Profits at the engineering division overall fell to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 13.9m). A further large fall came in UK petroleum products, where operating profits tumbled to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 8.3m). A mild winter and the depressed automotive industry had cut overall profits at fuel distribution from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 9.5m. Shipping services contributed Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.2m), buoyed by the inclusion for two months of PD's share in Tees and Hartlepool. The port is estimated to have contributed Pounds 1.1m. Retained profits rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 23.8m, helped by an Pounds 8m extraordinary net gain on disposals and closures. Earnings per share fell from 30.7p to 24.5p. COMMENT Cinderella may have found her ticket to the ball. Never known for being a glamorous stock, Powell Duffryn is drawing some ardent admirers. The rapid changes of the last eight months have given it a solid base from which to grow and appear to have confounded the sceptics over PD's dividend policy. The acquisition of the Tees and Hartlepool port looks especially encouraging and will require far less investment than the shipping businesses would have needed for similar growth. The coal division, meanwhile, is growing on British Coal's drive for efficiency and is likely to retain the benefits after privatisation. Forecasts are pitched at about Pounds 29.5m - for a prospective p/e of about 13.7 times - with the dividend likely to enjoy its first increase in four years. Even taking into account last night's 8 per cent advance in share price, there could still be more to come.</p>

The Togolese Foreign Ministry called on Ghana to intervene  against "armed elements coming from Ghana," saying in a radio  statement at midnight (0000 GMT) that it had seized the Ghanaian  charge d'affairs at 2130 GMT Thursday.    The government has alleged that a group of unidentified men  who led a failed assassination bid against Togo's military ruler  Gnassingbe Eyademe Wednesday came from Ghana. [passage omitted]    Reached by telephone early Friday morning, residents living  close to the border post which separates Lome from its twin town  of Aflao in Ghana said that shots and explosions resembling  artillery fire had shaken the area shortly before 0100 GMT.    The Togolese Foreign Ministry denounced what it termed "a  flagrant act of aggression," which was "against all  international law." It said that despite holding the Ghanaian  charge d'affairs, shooting was "still coming from Ghanaian  territory."    "The government calls on the international community to bear  witness and asks Ghana to put an immediate end to these acts,"  the statement added. [passage omitted]</p>

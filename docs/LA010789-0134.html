			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: HAZE DOESN'T HAVE TO LEAVE YOU IN A FOG  </P> <P> Those who watched last Saturday's National Football League playoff game between  the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles in Chicago saw the problems fog can cause  camera operators.  </P> <P> It was extremely difficult to see what was going on because the long lenses in  television cameras condense the fog, making it look very thick. That's an  example of how a camera can work against you.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, reader Mary Kay Stein of Laguna Niguel wrote asking for  suggestions on shooting pictures on foggy days. With the right amount of  knowledge, you can turn just about any circumstance into an opportunity to  create some interesting pictures.  </P> <P> A day of adverse weather is a great time to experiment. Of course, there are  times when the fog is just too thick to do anything. But most of the time you  can use the fog to diffuse the light in your picture.  </P> <P> Fog is nothing more than water vapor condensed in very fine particles. Fog  usually occurs when there is a large contrast in temperatures. It is usually  found around water on cold days because the air is much colder than the water.  It can also be found in valleys because the warmer temperatures surrounding the  valley trap the cold air.  </P> <P> Fog can help your photography in three ways: First, it can create a mood;  second, it lowers the contrast in your photo and, finally, it helps isolate  your subject by eliminating the background.  </P> <P> A picture taken in the fog often has an eerie or surrealistic mood. Notice how  many horror films use fog to create a feeling of impending danger. If this is  what you're looking for, you don't have to wait for a foggy day. Many  professionals either have or rent fog machines to create this kind of mood.  </P> <P> Fog can also lower the contrast in your photos, which can be of great benefit.  You don't have to worry about harsh shadows caused by the sun.  </P> <P> Exposure is an important factor when considering contrast. It's important to  know what you want to highlight in your photograph. If you are looking for an  overall scene, you should get a light reading off the fog. If you're trying to  capture a subject that is small in the frame and the meter reading is off the  fog, the subject will be very dark or a silhouette. That can be an effective  technique.  </P> <P> However, if you want a normal exposure of your subject, you should move in  closer to get the proper light reading. But this will brighten or blow out your  background. Always use several different exposures because it's almost  impossible to get what you want in one try. The right exposure is not always  the best exposure because the film may interpret a scene differently than your  eye does. This is especially true when using color slide film.  </P> <P> Fog is also very effective at isolating your subject. It gives you the same  effect as using a large aperture (f/2 or f/2.8) with a long lens. The longer  the lens, the more diffused your subject will be. A similar effect can be  achieved if you use a soft-focus filter.  </P> <P> There is one drawback to shooting in the fog. If it is especially damp, keep  your camera in a case when it's not in use. Avoid setting it down on the ground  because the moisture can erode and rust parts of your camera.  </P></p>

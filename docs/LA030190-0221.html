			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A WHALE OF A GAME FOR GOALIE LIUT  </P> <P> In his last start against Montreal 11 days ago, Hartford goaltender Mike Liut  stopped only four of eight shots before being lifted early in the second  period.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, things were different. Liut stopped 31 of 32 shots as the  Whalers downed the Canadiens, 3-1, at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> "Any player, a goalie, defenseman or forward can have an off night," Whaler  Coach Rick Ley said. "That game was an off night."  </P> <P> Liut, who was still rusty after knee surgery in the 7-3 loss at Montreal on  Feb. 17, agreed. "I let in a couple of bad ones and I just wasn't there," he  said. "Since then, I've played and practiced regularly and I'm better for it."  </P> <P> Liut was beaten only by Stephane Richer who scored his 41st goal of the season  late in the second period.  </P> <P> Scott Young keyed the Hartford attack with two goals, including his fifth  game-winner of the season with 5:08 remaining.  </P> <P> Young broke a 1-1 tie with a quick wrist shot from the lower left circle after  passes from Pat Verbeek and Ron Francis to give Hartford only its second win in  six games this season against Montreal. Verbeek added an empty-net goal with 23  seconds to play.  </P> <P> Vancouver 7, Philadelphia 7 -- Tim Kerr scored his second goal of the game with  31 seconds left in regulation as the Flyers rallied to tie the Canucks at  Vancouver.  </P> <P> Kerr scored his 19th goal of the season after the Flyers pulled goaltender Ron  Hextall with 42 seconds left. His shot from outside the faceoff dot in the left  circle deflected into the net off goalie Steve Weeks' skate.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Quebec 4 -- Vince Damphousse had a goal and three assists as the  Maple Leafs edged the Nordiques at Toronto.  </P> <P> Tom Kurvers, Gilles Thibaudeau, Gary Leeman and Daniel Marois also scored for  the Leafs. But Leeman, the Leafs' leading scorer, went to the dressing room and  did not return after straining his right shoulder while throwing a punch at  Paul Gillis in a melee 38 seconds into the third period.  </P> <P> Detroit 4, New York Islanders 3 -- Rookie Daniel Shank scored with 1:31  remaining to lift the Red Wings over the Islanders at Detroit.  </P> <P> Shank took a pass from Gerard Gallant near the New York blue line, outskated  defenseman Joe Reekie and beat Mark Fitzpatrick from close range to end the Red  Wings' five-game winless streak.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 2, New Jersey 1 -- Mark Recchi scored with 1:26 left in the third  period as the Penguins defeated the Devils at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The win moved Pittsburgh into second place in the Patrick Division, one point  ahead of the New York Islanders.  </P> <P> Recchi took a 15-foot shot that trickled through the pads of Chris Terreri to  end Pittsburgh's two-game losing streak. The Penguins have won five consecutive  home games.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 3, Washington 2 -- Troy Mallette scored the tie-breaking goal  49 seconds into the third period as the Rangers defeated the Capitals at New  York.  </P> <P> Mallette broke a 2-2 tie on a breakaway as the Rangers beat the Capitals for  the second time in six days. They are 6-1-1 in their last seven games against  Patrick Division teams.  </P> <P> After Mallette gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead, New York's penalty-killers held off  two Washington power plays, including a two-man advantage for 34 seconds.  </P></p>

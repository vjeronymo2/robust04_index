			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Cash trusts chase savers' money - Bethan Hutton examines a challenge to the building societies and finds there are definite advantages INVESTORS with a few thousand pounds who want to earn a reasonable rate of interest but need the money to be accessible often assume that their only real option is a building society. But a growing number of people are turning to cash unit trusts. These offer rates as good or better than the societies, are equally secure and have no interest penalty for withdrawals. Cash unit trusts invest in the money markets where banks and other financial institutions lend and borrow. This means they can offer yields very close to bank base rates. From the consumer's point of view, they operate in a very similar way to building society postal accounts, with deposits and withdrawals carried out through the post. Some even allow withdrawals to be arranged over the 'phone. Most charge a 0.5 per cent annual management fee, but yields are quoted net of that. The interest rolls up within the trust to increase the price of the units (the exception is Fidelity, where the unit price stays the same, and the investor's holding of units increases). Indeed, Fidelity was the first to launch a cash unit trust in the UK, in April 1989. Since then, more than 30 have been started, ranging from tiny funds with only a couple of hundred thousand invested, to Fidelity - still the biggest  - with Pounds 126m. Govett's MIS cash fund was set up to cater for private client brokers and other professionals, with a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000. Since April, though, the minimum has been cut to Pounds 2,000 to appeal to a broader range of investors. 'I think the general public are beginning to realise that there are alternatives to the old-fashioned high street deposit accounts,' says Govett's Ian Taylor. In the US, cash unit trusts (known as money market mutual funds) for savings are common, especially following the collapse of large numbers of thrifts - the equivalent of building societies. In the UK, societies are seen as a very safe bet but, because fund managers check their investments carefully and spread the risk between a number of institutions, cash unit trusts can be just as secure. Fidelity's recently got a triple A rating from Moody's, higher than the banks and building societies in which it invests. In fact, investors of large amounts are likely to fare better if a unit trust collapses than a building society, as they are covered by different compensation schemes. Depositors can claim only 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 invested in a failed society whereas trust investors can claim all of the first Pounds 30,000 plus 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. One potential disadvantage to non-taxpayers of cash unit trusts is that income is paid net, so tax has to be reclaimed, unlike income from building societies, which can be paid gross. But the last Budget gave trusts a slight advantage over comparable society accounts for basic-rate taxpayers. Income from trusts is subject to corporation tax, which was cut from 25 per cent to 22.5 per cent for this financial year, and 20 per cent next year. Once this has been paid, there is no extra income tax liability for basic rate-payers. Building society interest is paid net of basic rate income tax, which remains at 25 per cent. James Higgins, of independent financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe, points out, however, that the benefits of cash unit trusts compared with building societies can be marginal, and says trusts may see them as a way to draw in investors who can then be sold other products. Fidelity's cash account, which yields 5.3 per cent, has followed societies into offering additional facilities. Around 5,000 of its 12,500 customers have cheque-books, which are offered to any investor with a balance of more than Pounds 5,000 (the minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 a month), as are gold MasterCards. Fidelity is now test-marketing a cash card. Govett, like most of the cash unit trusts, does not offer a cheque-book or other extras. It charges an initial 0.5 per cent, 0.5 per cent annually, and yields 5.1 per cent. Prudential's Cash Haven makes an 0.5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual charge on minimum investments of Pounds 1,000. It is the second-biggest fund, with Pounds 122m invested, and also yields 5.1 per cent. Scottish Amicable Maximum Income is unusual in that it is sold through agents; because of this, it makes an initial charge of 2.5 per cent to allow for commission but it yields 5.46 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and additional sums deposited must be at least Pounds 500. Capital House caters for those with a smaller amount to invest - its minimum initial deposit is Pounds 500, or Pounds 30 a month, and it yields 5.21 per cent. Mercury's cash fund, which yields 5.46 per cent, has a minimum deposit of Pounds 1,000. It does not offer a cheque-book but the company is examining options to find out what customers want. Shopping around can unearth some building society accounts offering interest rates higher than cash unit trusts on similar balances. Birmingham Midshires pays 6.75 per cent on balances over Pounds 500 in its First Class postal account. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's London Share postal account offers 6.25 on more than Pounds 2,500, while Bradford &amp; Bingley's Direct Premium postal account pays 6 per cent on more than Pounds 1,000. But figures from Moneyfacts show that many instant access accounts at major societies offer less than cash unit trusts. Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 4.65 per cent on Pounds 5,000 in its instant access account, the Woolwich 4.1 per cent on the same sum, and the Halifax 4.6 per cent. So, it could be worthwhile for many investors to switch.</p>

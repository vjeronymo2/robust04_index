			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- Yesterday President Aliyev  met with Vladimir Kazimirov, a special Russia's representative  for Nagorno Karabakh.    Kazimirov left Tehran for Baku on Saturday evening, where he  has discussions in Iran Foreign Ministry for the settlement of  Armenian-Azeri conflict.    During the meeting Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan states the  continuation of mediatory activity with satisfaction. "But this  work should not stop and ceasefire should be used for completion  of negotiating process", noted President.    According to Aliyev, contacts of Jan Eliasson -- head of  CSCE  Minsk group, Kazimirov, Vladimir Shumeyko -- head of Russia's  Council of Federation and Anatoliy Adamshin -- deputy of  Russia's Foreign Ministry in Moscow are of great importance.  "It is a good moment in negotiating process and it is necessary  to join efforts of CSCE Minsk group, CIS and Russia to make this  process more efficient", noted Aliyev.    Eliasson's and Kazimirov's joint appeal to the Presidents of  Armenia and Azerbaijan was appreciated by Aliyev. "This appeal  meets our interests, we think it was right and we accept it",  noted Aliyev. According to him Azerbaijan will firmly support  ceasefire.    "According to Eliasson, who was in Yerevan, Armenia also  insists on active participation of CSCE Minsk group in the  conflict's settlement and stands for ceasefire. But Armenian  troops attacked towards Sadarak region (Nakhichevan Autonomous  Republic) and in a few days attacked borders of Kazakh region on  June 19-20. In result, six Azeri soldiers were killed and there  were a lot of wounded", noted Aliyev.    "Such incidents are unavoidable and each time they should be  localized in order not to impact the situation", said Kazimirov.  He also noted that the incidents on the borders anxired [made  anxious] mediators. "The joint appeal to the presidents of  Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as to Robert Kocharyan [Karabakh  leader] was caused by these incidents. We appealed to them in  order not to sharpen the situation", told Russian diplomat.    According to Kazimirov, Russia supports consultations with  Iran Foreign Ministry. "We will have consultations also with  Turkey in near future" he noted.    Aliyev named these consultations "natural moment in  negotiating process". According to him, two countries  neighbouring with Armenia and Azerbaijan, can not be indifferent  to the events in the region.    Kazimirov told Aliyev that his meeting with Eliasson, within  the framework of the "nine" of Minsk group together with  participation of representatives of warring parties will take  place, in early July in Vienna. Then, meeting of CSCE  Interparliamentry Assembly will take place on July 4 in Vienna  and during the period from July 5 to July 8 a session of CSCE  Minsk group for the conflict settlement will take place.    "It is very important to move towards the Big Political  Contract during this period. If this time is used for  propagandic war, that time will be wasted and will cost people a  pretty penny", noted Kazimirov. According to Kazimirov, the  attempts to contradict CSCE to Russia is also a waist of time.  "But we don't see any contradictions in the settlement plans of  CSCE and Russia, there some contradictions not in the essence,  but in the details", said Kazimirov. He noted that Russia is  ready to mutual cooperation with CSCE.    According to Aliyev, Azerbaijan's terms in the settlement  process remain unchanged. "The withdrawal of Armenian troops  from the captured territories and return of the refugees to  their houses is the very important term. After that,  restoration of communications and security of Armenians of  Nagorno Karabakh, as well as discussion of Nagorno Karabakh's  status will have some logical meaning", noted Aliyev.    Kazimirov had negotiations in the Turkish embassy in  Azerbaijan late at night yesterday. The negotiations lasted  more than three hours. On June 27 Kazimirov left Baku for  Yerevan.</p>

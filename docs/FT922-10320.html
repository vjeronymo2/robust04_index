			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Japanese housing starts fall 19.4% OVERALL housing starts in Japan fell 19.4 per cent to 1.23m units in the fiscal year to the end of March, reflecting property market instability and the intense financial pressure on property companies and their bankers. But, for March, starts were down only 2.3 per cent on the same month last year, adding to evidence that the residential property market is close to touching bottom after 17 consecutive months of decline. Leading developers report that their stock of unsold properties, which expanded rapidly last year, has stabilised, while Tokyo condominium sales in March rose 19.5 per cent on the same month last year. Property prices are reckoned to have fallen by an average 30 per cent in the past 18 months, though the drop has been uneven. Prime commercial space stayed in demand, while some apartment prices in western Japan have fallen by more than 50 per cent. Starts in March of housing for sale fell 33.9 per cent to 20,462 units, the seventh consecutive decline and a sign that property speculators are still in severe pain. The market in the Osaka region, a centre of speculative building, remains hardest hit. Owner-occupied housing starts in March rose 14.7 per cent to 39,536 units.</p>

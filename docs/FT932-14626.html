			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance Whatever the fine details of the business plan being prepared for the Lloyd's insurance market, it must not fail to attract fresh capital. A Pounds 2bn loss for the 1990 underwriting year would mean a serious erosion of capital. Lloyd's cannot be far from the point where it is simply not viable as a marketplace for big international risks. There is a good opportunity to attract corporate capital while insurance rates are hardening, but new entrants will need insulating from mistakes of the past, such as long-tail claims on pollution and asbestosis. The idea of leaving underwriting years open right across the market seems to have been rightly dropped. That would have been unfair on profitable syndicates. A central fund to manage such long-tail risks would be a more equitable solution. What remains open is quite which risks should be covered  -and exactly how it should be funded. New entrants might readily accept a levy, but only if they can expect a decent return on capital. Tackling Lloyd's bloated cost base is thus an obvious place for the business plan to start. Central overheads are only part of the problem. The complex system of managing agents and members' agents entails too much duplication of effort. That leaves the sensitive question of pricing, especially the solvency requirements applied to different forms of capital. If that can be cracked too, Lloyd's would have at least a fighting chance.</p>

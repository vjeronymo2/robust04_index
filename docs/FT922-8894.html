			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Allies, not members Sir, Mr Anthony Kinch is wrong to claim that 'Tory members of the European parliament are . . . joining the Christian Democrats' (Letters, May 2). We are joining the group of the European People's party (Christian Democrats and allies) as allies in the same way as former French president Giscard d'Estaing has done. While I accept that the name 'People's party' sounds odd in English ears because of its loony left echoes, the group of the EPP, as it is generally known in the European parliament, is the only convincing counter-balance to the largest group in the European parliament - the Socialist Group in which the 45 British Labour MEPs have a commanding voice. The alliance of Conservatives with the EPP had the blessing of Mrs Thatcher when she was leader of the Conservative party and has the blessing of Mr Major as well. Indeed, but for his relationship with Chancellor Kohl, the alliance could not have been sealed. The advantage for the EPP in having 32 British and two Danish Conservatives will be a more serious and disciplined approach. Unfortunately, the EPP has too often been weak because its members lack discipline. Their absence from crucial votes has, on occasion, unnecessarily handed victory to the left in the European parliament. Mr Kinch's suggestion that the EPP expects British Conservatives 'to stand as Christian Democrats at the next European election in 1994' is absolute nonsense.

On the contrary, Latvia endorses Russia's participation in  various European institutions to manifest its understanding of  partnership and responsibility for the current processes, said  Gorbunovs.    The anticipated citizenship law should provide a gradual  growth of the body of citizens, said the Saeima speaker. If  naturalization of non-citizens is too swift, the motion will  bring on a great political counterreaction by ethnic Latvians.    Hurd noted that political instability could also be provoked  by a vague status of a large group of population.    Gorbunovs agreed that the status of people who are not  entitled for immediate naturalization should be politically and  economically balanced.    As reported, Hurd met Wednesday with the Baltic foreign  ministers and high-ranking Latvian officials.</p>

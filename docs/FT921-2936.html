			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Belgium to use VAT in deficit battle BELGIUM'S new centre-left coalition government yesterday unveiled value-added tax rates, higher excise duties and budget savings to tackle the country's large budget deficit, Reuter reports from Brussels. The government, sworn in just over a week ago after more than 100 days of political stalemate, has made reducing the deficit, one of the highest in the European Community, its top priority. A statement issued after a special cabinet meeting said the standard value-added tax (VAT) rate would be raised half a percentage point to 19.5 per cent and excise duties on fuel increased from April 1. This would raise government revenue by BFr6.6bn (Pounds 110m), the statement said. Another BFr6bn will be saved by cutting government administration costs by 5 per cent, freezing new spending on defence and limiting civil service recruitment. The total is still far from the BFr94bn in additional revenue and savings the government has to find to bring the 1992 deficit into line with the target of BFr405bn. The government said it will also scrap the top VAT rates - 33 per cent for luxury goods and 25 per cent for electrical goods - which will be charged at the new 19.5 per cent.</p>

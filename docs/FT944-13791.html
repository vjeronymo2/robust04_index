			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Paying up for pensions Hercules cleaned the Augean stables by diverting a river through them. Sadly, there is no comparable short cut for Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) in dealing with the mis-selling of personal pensions. Moreover the potential scale of this extraordinary regulatory disaster continues to increase. The SIB's initial assumption was that the problem was primarily concerned with poor pensions advice being given to people on leaving their jobs or on being made redundant. Many were transferring into personal pensions when they would have been better off taking deferred benefits from more generous occupational schemes. It has since become increasingly apparent that the biggest problem may be to do with two different groups: those who were advised to opt out of occupational schemes while remaining in the same employment, or who took out personal pensions instead of joining more generous occupational schemes for which they were eligible. Given that personal pensions are a much more expensive form of provision than defined benefit occupational schemes and offer an uncertain future return, the circumstances in which they are likely to be the best choice for those other than the self-employed are limited. Yet consulting actuary Bacon and Woodrow estimates that there were more than 850,000 employed people who made such a choice on the advice of personal pensions salesmen. It is hard to believe that a majority of them will not have suffered actual or potential loss as a result. Inevitable pressure To its credit, the SIB shows no sign of backsliding in its detailed proposals to provide redress, despite inevitable pressure from elements of the financial services industry. Clearly it will be helped if occupational pension schemes are prepared to take back those who have been ill-advised. The National Association of Pension Funds is sensibly urging this course on its members and some public sector schemes have already accepted the argument. Yet the SIB has no jurisdiction over pension fund trustees. And even where they are prepared to act, companies responsible for mis-selling will have to meet the 'fair' cost of reinstatement. Where no reinstatement is possible, redress will be offered direct to the investor. Compensation will only be required where there are actual or potential losses and poor advice can be seen to have played a causal role. It will not be given in the case of losses where the investor understood the character and size of the risks being run. Calculating redress The SIB's specific methods of calculating redress inevitably involve big assumptions in valuing benefits - for example, in relation to future salary increases, discretionary benefits and so forth. But these have been reviewed by the government actuary and do not look unreasonable overall. Since part of the object of the exercise is anyway to minimise the need for the victims to go to court, the SIB has had an incentive to ensure that the redress is adequate. There are questions about the adequacy of the coverage of the review of personal pension sales. There will, for example, be no automatic requirement for a review of advice to those who had the option to join occupational schemes but chose personal pensions instead. The larger worries concern, first, the thoroughness with which companies will go about the monumental task of reviewing their own mis-selling; and, second, the quality of monitoring and enforcement by self-regulatory organisations such as the newly formed Personal Investment Authority. The cost for the banking and insurance sectors will be huge. The bill, for which outside estimates range as high as Pounds 2bn, anyway results from clear breaches of the regulatory standards in force at the time by the industry at large. For those with efficient systems the problem will be readily manageable within the SIB's timetable, which aims for a full solution by the end of 1996. For the weaker insurance companies, that deadline looks pious. The coincidence of this review with the SIB's new disclosure rules looks like one more nail in their coffin.</p>

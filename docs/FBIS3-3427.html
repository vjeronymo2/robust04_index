			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Pyongyang and Seoul  exchanged accusations today over the collapse of inter-Korea  talks, each side urging the other to change positions.    The eighth working-level contact between the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea broke down at  the truce village of Panmunjom, deadlocking the planned  inter-Korea exchange of special envoys.    Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK delegation, told reporters  after the one-hour meeting that the collapse occurred because of  a "sudden change" in South Korea's position.    The south would "take a strong position" against the north,  restore suspended joint military exercises with the United  States, go ahead with its plan to deploy "patriot" missiles in  the south, and take part in international sanctions against the  DPRK, Pak said.    Chief South Korean negotiator Song Yong-tae accused the  north  of blocking the exchange of special envoys, warning that if the  nuclear issue remains unsettled, Pyongyang would face  "unpredictable consequences."    However, his North Korean counterpart denied the charges,  saying his country was ready to respond to either dialogue or  war.    Each side called on the other to soften its tough stand, but  no date was set for the next round of talks.    South Korean Deputy Premier and Minister of National  Unification Yi Yong-tok issued a statement this afternoon  expressing his disappointment over the failure of the talks.    Seoul will cooperate closely with the international  community  in seeking a solution to the problem arising from the suspected  North Korean nuclear weapons development program, Yi said.    He added that there was no change in South Korea's position  on finding a peaceful solution to this problem through dialogue,  and hoped that the north will return to the negotiating table as  soon as possible.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov: "Goodbye Hyperinflation! </F> Hello Hypercrisis?"]    [Text] For the first time in a long period monthly  inflation rates have dropped to 10 and even 8 percent. Russia's  President Yeltsin is also optimistic. In his recent interview  with the journal SPIEGEL he announced that this year would  become a year of stabilization for the country's economy.    However, experience suggests that to trust the optimism of  politicians, especially those at the helm, is a risky thing. How  stable can the emerging process of decline in the level of  inflation be considered? This is the question.    On the one hand, if for some time the government succeeds in  holding back the rates of rise in prices and even in lowering  them a tiny bit, this will signify the fulfillment of our  obligations to the world financial community. Consequently, we  will have the right to expect new 1.5 billion dollars from the  International Monetary Fund and a reduction in the rate [of  interest] on international credits. Both "gifts," if we get  them, will be most timely for Russia.    However, first, how many times has the International  Monetary  Fund already failed to live up to our expectations, putting off  again and again under various formal pretexts the presentation  of expensive "gifts"? Second, I am afraid that we ourselves can  give it such a serious reason for the next delay that it will  need no formalities.    The crisis in industry is growing. Instead of the expected  10  to 12 percent of reduction in the general industrial level of  production, during the first quarter the real decline made up 25  percent of the level during the first quarter of last year.  Whereas in January it made up 23 percent, in March, already 27  percent.    With due regard for inflation the annual volume of sectors'  profit decreased to one-third! Only the fact that for now the  authorities have not brought themselves to turn on the  bankruptcy mechanism in the country to the extent to which it is  stipulated by corresponding legislation saves sectors from the  inevitable collapse. However, will Staraya Ploshchad be so  undecided for long? Last week Russia's president sent a letter  to the premier, in which he recommended that the bankruptcy  procedure be used more actively for the solution of the  nonpayment problem. If the cabinet of ministers heeds the  supreme counsel, one can say with confidence that in the textile  industry alone one-fourth of the enterprises will be auctioned  off.    The situation in other sectors is not much better. Hundreds  and hundreds of enterprises all over the country are being  closed for the May--more accurately, Easter--"vacation," which  promises to extend over several weeks.    The curtailment of production, inevitably, will be followed  by a new price jump: Goods will appear on counters, but demand  will remain at the previous level. This will provoke the next  inflationary wave. This is price stabilization for you...    "We must get used to living in a state of constant crisis.  This process of convulsions in the economy will last more than  one decade"--such is the opinion of the famous Russian economist  Nikolay Shmelev. To be sure, this is a gloomy forecast.    Only massive, including foreign, investments in industry are  capable of reviving production. In our country during all of  last year they totaled a little more than 1 billion dollars. For  comparison: In China they exceeded 150 billion dollars and even  in Hungary, so tiny as compared with Russia, they reached 5  billion.    There is nothing surprising here: Few people who want to  invest a great deal of money in enterprises, which will collapse  any day now, will be found.    As it seems to me, the following conclusion suggests itself:  Of the two evils--inflation and production decline--inflation,  of course, on a moderate scale, should still be picked.</p>

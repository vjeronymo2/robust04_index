			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIVING BY SALTON SEA  </P> <P> Robert Jones' column ("Salton Sea -- Victim of Salt and Apathy," May 23) on the  Salton Sea correctly describes the deteriorating condition of the sea, but, I  feel that his statements on recreational activities, visitors and local  residents are misleading and distorted.  </P> <P> Recent increases in boating and fishing activities have been dramatic, as I  have observed personally on almost daily visits to Johnson's landing in Salton  City (on the west shore), where fresh water is available for those wishing to  clean their boats after outings on the sea. In addition to boaters we have many  visitors from as far as Michigan, Illinois and the Pacific Northwest who winter  in Salton City. For years large numbers of recreational vehicle enthusiasts  have been flocking to our area. These visitors are not poor.  </P> <P> So far, in 1989, seven homes have been -- or are being -- constructed in Salton  City, capping several years of increasing housing construction. Most local  residents bought property along the sea because they love open spaces, desert  sunshine and the seascape. They also had faith that the state would not allow  the sea to die.  </P> <P> Among our residents are a retired professional golfer, a former movie  executive, a retired journalist, a former owner-manager of the American  visitors' bureau of Madrid, Spain, several active and retired contractors and  many military retirees.  </P> <P> Salton City also houses the headquarters of the largest -- or at least the most  advertised -- roofing contractor of the Coachella Valley and a recently  established and already profitable branch office of Borrego Springs State Bank  (recently listed as one of a number of the best-operated banks in the state of  California).  </P> <P> We do not complain about the 1930s time warp in which we are said to live and  in which neighbors -- in the best American tradition -- come to the aid of  others in distress.  </P> <P> We also welcome members of ethnic groups who come to us as visitors or  residents, and we believe it is wonderful that so many people of modest means  have a large recreational area in which to disport themselves.  </P> <P> We do not believe "gentrification" of the area will occur, as the sea and  surrounding area are far too large. At most this process might affect the north  shore area, but we would be delighted to see even this happen if it would save  the sea.  </P> <P> L.E. DYE JR.  </P> <P> Salton City  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Akers' departure marks desperate battle for change: Big Blue is a prisoner of its history MR John Akers, whose announcement of his impending resignation as chief executive of International Business Machines shocked the business world, had hoped to lead the world's largest computer manufacturer through the Dollars 100bn (Pounds 65.7bn) annual revenues barrier. Instead, he has written a less exalted page in business history. Mr Akers, 58, is the first IBM chief executive to leave his post before the statutory retirement age of 60 and the first to go because of the company's deteriorating performance. His resignation after an eight-year tenure is the most dramatic evidence that IBM is serious about solving the problems that have reduced it to a shadow of its former credibility and influence. Only two months ago Mr Akers' position seemed secure, when he claimed to enjoy the unanimous support of the IBM board. Last week, however, IBM announced the greatest annual loss - Dollars 4.9bn - in US business history. It was the computer giant's second year of losses in succession, with no suggestion that waves of expensive restructuring initiated by Mr Akers would lead to improved performance this year. In December, he had already announced that 25,000 jobs would go and that factories would close in 1993 at a cost of Dollars 6bn. Yesterday, the board cut the quarterly dividend from Dollars 1.54 to Dollars 0.54, and Mr Akers' fate was sealed. Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the news: 'The investment community was looking for a change in management,' said one broker. 'They are looking for someone who can cut costs quickly.' Although many wondered how long Mr Akers could resist the pressure for his departure, his resignation was unexpected. That was chiefly because of his publicly expressed determination to oversee the company's recovery and the lack of any alternative stratagem that could return IBM to profitability more rapidly. 'I do not know how to put somebody in who could do better from inside or outside the company,' Mr James Burke, former head of Johnson &amp; Johnson and one of four outside directors on the IBM board, said last year. Mr Burke chairs the committee that will select Mr Akers' successor. Increasingly, observers have detected signs of desperation at IBM's Armonk, New York State, headquarters. Last month Mr Akers recalled two former vice-chairmen, Mr Paul Rizzo and Mr Kaspar Cassani, both retired, to help the company through the crisis. Now Mr Rizzo, who retired from IBM in 1987, is replacing Mr Frank Metz, who is also leaving before retirement age, as chief financial officer. Mr Akers, a former Navy pilot who combines a brusque business exterior with considerable personal charm, is shouldering the blame for difficulties that analysts believe are as much the responsibility of his predecessors, Mr Frank Cary and Mr John Opel, as his own. IBM is a prisoner of its history, tied to areas of the computer market that are neither the fastest growing nor the most technologically interesting. Mainframe computers, a sector IBM dominates and on which it used to make huge profits, are in decline. The company is the market leader in personal computers, but the slim profit margins there are insufficient to support its sprawling bureaucracy. Mr Akers' plan was to transform IBM from a ponderous manufacturing megalith to a loose confederation of lean, fast-moving business units close to customers and the market, with an emphasis on the rapidly growing software and services sector. Yesterday, Mr Akers said that the strategy would remain unchanged. IBM would continue to redirect investment toward growth sectors of the computer market and make its individual business units increasing autonomous. Few are offering alternative strategies. One that has gained some currency is to break the company up into its constituent businesses. IBM's outside directors now have 90 days to find an individual to carry through the company's transformation. In a departure from tradition, the board has said that outside candidates will be considered for the job. 'With two executive positions open at IBM - the chief executive and president - the probability is high that at least one will be filled from external sources,' said Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers in San Francisco. A chief executive from outside IBM's culture would be at an advantage in pushing through necessary but unpopular measures such as involuntary redundancy - which was prohibited in IBM's glory days. Speculation about who will replace Mr Akers ran wild yesterday, according to company employees. With most now expecting an outsider to be appointed, the future of several of the company's senior executives was in question. Before yesterday's announcement, individuals regarded as serious candidates from within IBM included Mr Robert LaBant, 47, vice-president and general manager of IBM North America and Mr Ned Lautenbach 48, a senior executive at IBM World Trade. There was also increasing speculation that Mr James Cannavino, 48, senior vice-president and general manager of IBM's personal systems division, might be elevated to president, replacing Mr Jack Kuehler, 60, who yesterday relinquished that title and became vice-chairman. Mr Kuehler had been expected to retire in October. The management changes at IBM are not expected to be confined to the top level. 'That would be akin to President Clinton retaining the cabinet and top officials from the Bush administration,' said Mr Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, an industry consulting group. 'The problems at IBM run very deep,' he said. 'Changing the man at the top will not solve its problems. With Akers gone, IBM is still a huge company that is difficult to manage. With Akers gone, IBM still has the problems created by a world economy in which buyers are postponing purchases of mainframe computers.' Widespread management changes now seem inevitable. 'It is going to be ugly, but it has to happen,' Mr Shaffer predicted. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Health trust managers strive for a new relationship: Lisa Wood and Catherine Milton on the effects of government reforms on industrial relations in the NHS ONE OF THE most immediate effects of government reforms to the National Health Service is likely to be on employee relations. Many personnel managers in the new self-governing trusts, which are allowed to set their own pay and conditions, are examining ways of leaving national agreements. But a Financial Times survey of more than half of the first 57 NHS trusts which came into existence just over a year ago shows that most are initially moving with caution. Mr Bob Rotchell, director of operations at West Dorset Community NHS Trust, said that nationally agreed terms and conditions in the health service had been a 'personnel manager's nightmare'. Like most trust managers, however, he said the devolution to trusts of managerial responsibility for industrial relations was not easy. 'Any group who thought when they established a trust that setting local pay and conditions would be easy must have been very naive,' he said. Nevertheless, greater flexibility should eventually mean a smaller, better-trained NHS workforce. Within weeks of becoming self-governing a year ago, Guy's and Lewisham Trust in London announced plans to shed several hundred jobs to cut Pounds 5m from labour costs. The trust is now balancing its books and has given lower-paid staff an extra Pounds 5 per week above national rates, but Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive, expects the trust to operate with up to 20 per cent fewer staff in Guy's hospital in five years. Such reductions are likely to become widespread in the health service. The jobs of its many unskilled ancillary workers and of some laboratory and other technical staff will be at risk. The FT survey also highlights managers' ambitions for an overhaul of the traditional negotiating machinery. Most trusts want a single pay spine, or scale, for all their employees. That would replace the dozen or so present scales, including those negotiated by the Whitley Councils, which have traditionally set pay and conditions in the NHS. It would also replace the newer pay review bodies for nurses, doctors and professions allied to medicine. An overhaul would facilitate local pay bargaining. The government says it will not abolish national machinery, but it could become redundant or, at best, a 'benchmark' for local deals. Bradford Hospital Trust said: 'Nobody will be worse off. Whitley is regarded as a minimum.' All trusts in the survey agreed that pay would not be squeezed as a result of the changes. Most said they were affected by skill shortages and the need to attract staff, but Southend Health Care Trust warned: 'In some cases we will pay more than Whitley and, if we don't need to, we won't' Harmonising conditions for employees could, in the short-term, increase pay bills. But the process is likely to be linked to greater flexibility. Several trusts are taking on new healthcare assistants to assist trained nurses in wards from which student nurses are being removed. United Bristol Healthcare Trust said: 'As the number of people available as nationally trained nurses falls, so we will be forced to take on more people who are trained locally.' Other findings of the survey include: Only a few trusts have negotiated formal recognition agreements with unions. A few were reluctant to discuss the issue, including Central Middlesex Hospital and Nuffield Orthopaedic Trust. One, West Dorset Community Health Trust, has successfully agreed and implemented a pay package, including a local performance pay deal, with unions this year. Homewood Trust in Chertsey, Surrey, has agreed with unions a package that includes what is in effect a no-strike deal. But no local pay offer has yet been agreed. Northumbria Ambulance Trust has awarded employees a local pay deal this year, but it was negotiated with the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel (Apap), a union not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. Apap has been given sole negotiating rights at the trust. No other first-wave trusts plan to give sole rights to a union, although most want single-table bargaining, in which several unions appoint representatives to conduct joint negotiations. Cohse, the health-service union, says that only 15 trusts have signed formal agreements with unions to negotiate over pay and conditions. Acas, the conciliation service, sees great strides in employment relationship among trusts. It adds, however, that 'there often remains a lack of expertise in this area among local managers and trade union representatives alike'. Most trusts in the survey offered slightly different conditions of employment in contracts offered to new staff. Mr Brian Carpenter, personnel director of South Devon Healthcare Trust, said it had introduced changes to time off and had brought in performance-related pay for senior managers. Changes made by other trusts include limiting appeal rights and adjustments to maternity leave. Many trusts are using outside consultants to investigate job evaluation. Nine trusts in the south-west of England are working together on investigating job evaluation, a system trusts say could add to wage bills. Mr Rotchell of West Dorset said he had been told by consultants that the exercise could add 5 per cent. Most trusts want a single pay spine covering all staff although a few said such ambitions would be hard to realise because of the complexity of arranging so many groups of staff on one scale. Southend said it would like five or six spines and proposed big changes such as abolishing the increment related to length of service. It did not plan to introduce performance-related pay. Harmonisation of terms and conditions is favoured by trusts, but all agreed that such a move would incur costs.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): High hopes are dashed - Inheritance Tax - I FOR MANY middle-class homeowners, inheritance tax (IHT) reform was the dog that did not bark in the Budget. Last October, Conservative ministers dropped heavy hints that IHT was in for sweeping reform. Speculation buzzed that the tax could be abolished altogether, or that the threshold before IHT is payable could be doubled from its present level of Pounds 140,000. The tax could even have been made more progressive - at present, there is only one rate of tax, which is 40 per cent. An extra band might have made sense. In the event, the changes announced would be good for owners of small businesses and farmers (see article below). But they did not appear in the Finance Act and are unlikely to be enacted by Labour. If the Tories are re-elected, they can be reintroduced and applied retrospectively. The threshold before any tax is payable was raised in line with inflation to Pounds 147,000 by statutory order. On reelection the Tories would further increase this to Pounds 150,000, still below some pre-Budget hopes. There may have been good political motives behind this small increase. Pressure for IHT reform was largely caused by the house price surge which took many middle-class families above the threshold. Now house prices are falling, the new threshold could remove many from the IHT net. Also, the advantages of loosening IHT would have gone to society's wealthier members - the introduction of a lower rate income tax band was a more astute political move. Where does this leave your IHT planning, if you have an estate in excess of Pounds 150,000? We now know what the Conservatives intend to do to the tax by the end of the 1992-93 tax year. However, Labour is less equivocal than the Conservatives about its plans for the tax. If Labour is elected, wholesale reform is unlikely in the first year, but after this the party wants a recipient-based tax  - people would be taxed on the basis of what they receive. At present, the tax is levied on an estate and falls in equal proportions on those who inherit money from it. A recipient-based tax would create an incentive to distribute wealth as widely as possible. So the situation for estate-planners remains fluid.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: Major must break pattern of delay and clarify objective Sir, Unfortunately, the short history of Mr Major's occupancy of Number 10 and his earlier period in Number 11 show one common theme: delay. From the start, there was a failure to recognise the immense damage that 15 per cent base rates were doing to the economy and, in particular, to consumer and industrial confidence. As a result, the easing in monetary policy was too little and too late. And, in the current situation, once again there has been the failure to seize the opportunity created. Once the UK had pulled out of the exchange rate mechanism, interest rates should have been reduced far more quickly. The opportunity was there. Unfortunately, by delaying the decision, the government has all but lost the chance. Meanwhile, the talk is of tightening up fiscal policy. Here again there seems to be confusion. Forgiving Mr Major for some pre-election slippage, the main problems with government finances are the problems of recession - slow growing tax receipts and fast rising benefit payments. To suggest that the cure for the yawning public sector borrowing requirement will be found in cracking down on public sector current spending or even in raising taxes seems to be missing the point. Rather than helping solve the problem, both measures could help prolong the recession and thereby exacerbate the mismatch between government expenditure and revenue. So what is the solution to the current dilemma? First, it must be emphasised that the confidence of the markets will not be gained until government policy is seen to have a clear objective. That objective must be to re-establish growth in the economy. Anything else must be treated as a sideshow for the present - even inflation which, all the evidence suggests, is negligible in the private sector. Second, the Treasury must rid itself of its fixation with the currency. Whether it likes it or not, history shows that it is virtually impossible for our monetary authorities to control movements in the exchange rate. It also shows that when policy is so focused, it is the real economy that suffers (we only have to look at the experience since the 1987 general election to confirm this). So the solution? The government must act now to reduce interest rates. Not only will this help restore confidence in the economy, it will also impress on the markets that the authorities will not be held to a growth ransom by the currency. Ironically, the long-term impact of rate cuts might even help the government to achieve some of its other objectives: faster economic growth would help close the public sector budget deficit and would also be reflected in substantial productivity gains which would help hold down inflation. And, in the end, by making the UK economy a more viable longer-term investment prospect, lower interest rates might actually help stimulate inflows of investment capital, helping to bolster the pound. Certainly, with the pound collapsing in anticipation of an easing in policy, it seems a nonsense to delay a rate cut on the argument that it would unsettle the currency markets. The prime minister has created the opportunity; he must now use it, even if it requires a sacrifice of sterling near term.

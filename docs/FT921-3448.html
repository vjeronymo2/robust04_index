			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: Weighing the balance of power - A hung parliament looks more likely now than it has for 20 years It is as difficult to predict a hung parliament as it is to forecast an outright victory for the Conservatives or Labour. As the election campaign gets under way, the protagonists still have ample scope to make the mistake or to discover the wheeze which loses or wins the election. Advance judgments on how the different players will respond if both Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock are denied an overall majority are more precarious still. The political pressures on parties large and small after an inconclusive election would rapidly submerge the public pronouncements made before it. What can be said with certainty is that the relative standing of the two main parties as they enter the campaign makes a hung parliament look more likely than at any time since the early 1970s. You do not need to search hard at Westminster to find a cabinet minister or his Labour shadow ready to predict that there will be two general elections in 1992. After wild gyrations during the first four years of the present parliament - the Conservatives' standing fluctuated from as high as 50 per cent in the heady aftermath of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1987 victory to as low as 28 per cent at the height of the poll tax row three years later - the opinion polls have settled down. Ignoring the statistical blips and occasional fluctuations around the margins for error, every survey since last autumn has reinforced the view that the electorate has already made up its mind. A little less than 40 per cent say they have decided that, in spite of the poll tax and the recession, they will stick with the Conservatives. The same number think that Labour, with its socialist past behind it, should be given a chance to do better. About 15 per cent - and more recently 16 or 17 per cent - say they want the Liberal Democrats to remain a force in British politics. If the voters stick to their guns until April 9, neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock will secure an overall majority. A hung parliament will oblige one or the other to do a deal with smaller partners - or force another election. By polling day, one the main parties must hold a lead of at least 3 percentage points to be sure of winning the 326 seats needed to command in the House of Commons. The arithmetic, though, is not quite that simple. In a perfect voting system, the same number of votes would deliver each party the same number of seats. But, as third-party leaders have long lamented, the British system is far from perfect. In 1987, the then Liberal-SDP Alliance won 23 per cent of the votes and took only 19 of the 650 seats. That misalignment between votes and seats diminishes rapidly when it is applied to the main parties, but it leaves the Conservatives still with a significant advantage. Labour tends to pile up votes where they are least useful - in its own strongholds in the north of the country and in seats in the south where its candidates have little chance of winning. The Conservative vote is distributed more efficiently between the constituencies it needs to win. So Mr Major can expect up to 20 more seats than his principal opponent for the same number of votes. In a closely fought election, such a margin might well be decisive. The chart above underscores the effect. If Labour took 41 per cent of the vote on April 9 it would need to be five points clear of the Conservatives to be sure of an overall majority. But if Mr Major's share was 41 per cent he could be certain of returning to Downing Street with only a three-point lead over Mr Kinnock. It would be a mistake for the Conservatives to draw too much comfort from this change in the electoral landscape. It may underscore the immense task Labour faces in securing an overall majority. But the large number of dark squares (representing a hung parliament) indicates how much easier it would be for the opposition to deprive Mr Major of his overall majority. It is then that the ground becomes precarious. If he were just a handful of seats away from the magic 326, it is not hard to see Mr Major doing an informal deal with the Ulster Unionists (who can expect to hold 13 seats) in order to retain at least, temporarily, the keys to Number 10. The Unionists would initially demand abrogation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but might well settle for a commitment to re-open negotiations on the agreement with the Dublin government. But if Conservatives held, say, 315 seats or fewer, Mr Kinnock's claim on Downing Street might well be stronger - even if Labour had won fewer constituencies. The political judgment would be that Mr Major had lost the election. Whatever they say now, a substantial majority of the MPs from the smaller parties - in 1987 they won a total of 45 seats - would be happier sustaining a minority Labour government than keeping the Conservatives in power. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, insists that he would support whichever of the two leaders was ready to offer a commitment to proportional representation and agree a full programme of government. In practice, his colleagues admit that the terms exclude a deal with Mr Major and that the party would be reluctant to vote down Mr Kinnock even if he offered significantly less - in particular the creation of a Scottish assembly. The Welsh and Scottish Nationalists and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern Ireland could also be expected to back Labour rather than the Conservatives. So in practice Mr Kinnock could hope for the support - tacit or active  - of more than two-thirds of the MPs from minority parties. That could sustain him in government temporarily even if Labour had won fewer than 300 seats. The arithmetic is complicated further by the constitution. As leader of the largest party, Mr Major might push ahead and present his legislative programme in a Queen's Speech. If that were voted down, he could ask the Queen for a second election. Constitutionally she could refuse and instead give Mr Kinnock the chance to form a minority government. No monarch this century has declined a request to dissolve parliament. Either way, if the electorate does not deliver a definitive verdict on April 9, the odds are that it will be asked to try again later in the year.</p>

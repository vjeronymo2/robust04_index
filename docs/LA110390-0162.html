			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAINTENANCE;  </P> <P> KEEPING THOSE GARBAGE CANS SPICK AND SPAN  </P> <P> Simple maintenance can keep your garbage cans in good repair, odor-free and  safe from raids by dogs and raccoons.  </P> <P> Here are some tips:  </P> <P> You'll get longer wear from garbage cans if you keep them under cover and away  from moisture in a shed or garage. This is true of both metal and plastic cans.  </P> <P> To prevent odors, line the cans with plastic garbage bags and drain all garbage  before throwing it into them. When full, the bags can be closed with a tie and  easily lifted out for disposal.  </P> <P> Wash out the cans frequently. Use a garden hose to blast out loose soil and  trash remains. Then, using a broom, scrub the cans with an industrial-strength  detergent, preferably one containing a disinfectant, or with hot sudsy water  with a little chlorine bleach or ammonia added. (Caution: Do not mix both  bleach and ammonia in the same solution.) Let the cans dry in the sun, or at  least in fresh air.  </P> <P> To keep metal garbage cans free from corrosion, coat their insides and  undersides lightly with used motor oil. This will have to be reapplied  occasionally. An application of asphalt roof cement, which can be purchased at  building supply centers, will provide longer protection.  </P> <P> To repair damaged cans:  </P> <P> Patch small holes in metal cans with an epoxy-base mending compound, available  from hardware stores.  </P> <P> Repair larger holes with 20- to 24-gauge galvanized sheet steel, available from  hardware and building supply stores. Fasten the patch in place with epoxy  compound.  </P> <P> You can also attach the patch with stainless steel pop rivets. Pop rivets are  installed with a rivet gun that works somewhat like a stapler. Rivet guns are  available at modest cost in hardware stores.  </P> <P> Here's how to repair with rivets: Align the patch over the hole. Use a center  punch to mark the rivet positions on the patch. Drill holes slightly larger  than the pop rivet diameter going through both the patch and the can. Insert  the long end of the rivet (the mandrel) in the gun and the rivet in the hole,  holding the gun flush with the surface. Squeeze the handles to form the rivet  head and break off the mandrel.  </P> <P> Repair splits in plastic cans by sandwiching them between strips of aluminum  roof flashing, available at building supply centers. Or, cut open and flatten a  couple of aluminum beverage cans. Use aluminum pop rivets to fasten the patches  in place.  </P> <P> To deter animal raids, secure the lids to the can handles with elastic shock  cords, with a hook at either end, available in varying lengths at auto supply  stores.  </P> <P> Fasten one end of the cord permanently to the can by drilling a hole in one of  the handles and hooking one cord end through it. Crimp the hook closed with  pliers. Then hook the free end to the other handle.  </P> <P> Some plastic garbage cans have molded lid grips. Groove a rectangular block of  wood, about the size of the grip, across its narrow width. Then, screw or bolt  the block, groove side down, to the grip. Run a length of rope or a shock cord  through the groove and fasten its ends to the can's handles.  </P></p>

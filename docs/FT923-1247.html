			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: Colquhoun and MacBryde - Theatre The tale of Colquhoun and MacBryde, as John Byrne tells it in this new play, is basically not new: two Scotsmen drink themselves through their early successes and then into their steady decline. Three ingredients make the story piquant: the two were artists; they were lovers; and their story actually happened - in living memory. As detected at the Royal Court, both Robert Colquhoun (1914-62) and Rober MacBryde (1915-66) were robust, funny, uninhibited characters, ambitious to the degree of considerable self promotion and ultimately self-destructive. If, like myself, you knew little of them beforehand, you may be grateful for what the play tells you - especially in its first half, which ends during the Second World War - and for the way it puts them in context. David O'Hara and Ken Stott both give excellent performances, relishing at first the romping comedy, then realising sharply the helpless drunkenness that follows. All that is on the one hand. On the other is the fact that Colquhoun and MacBryde is not much of a play. Written in a rapid stream of brief scenes, with Colquhoun providing intermittent commentary during early episodes, it feels like a string of 'Do you remember?' anecdotes. And the anecdotes - though usually featuring only Colquhoun and MacBryde on stage - give us an outsider's view of both artists. Though the play's main interest lies in the fact that these were homosexual artists, the treatment of their love life is sketchy, that of their painting extremely vague. Psychologically, everything is always superficial. The action touches much too briefly on MacBryde's jealousy of Colquhoun, finds their ambitions entertaining but not revealing; and only hints at any connection between their self-promotiveness and their self-destructiveness. Though they were an unusual couple, Byrne handles them very conventionally. Most scenes end with such easy punch lines that the events on stage soon seem unhistorical. The dialogue is neatly dotted with jokes and with salacious detail; Byrne works so hard to make the story an entertainment that he even has the drunken MacBryde try to get the audience to join in a song. The most intentionally riotous scene in which uninvited guests turn a quiet supper into a vulgar farce is just the drunks' version of standard custard-pie comedy. Some of the blame for this depressing slickness must go to the director, Lindsay Posner. Everything about the depiction of the artists' gradual decline is obvious. 'What are you staring at?' says MacBryde, at some point in the 1950s. Colquhoun, gazing at a huge Abstract Expressionist daub by Jackson Pollock, says, 'The future.' The rest of the play is endless drunk scene, with fights, recriminations, tears - all treated with wretched glibness. To bring real people to life in drama requires an effort of the imagination; and it is in precisely that department that Byrne's play falls flat. Royal Court Theatre, until October 13.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent  on 27 April, the Ukrainian presidential press service official  in charge of domestic policy matters, Mykola Mykhalchenko,  described as "irresponsible" the statement by Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov, Sevastopol Council Chairman Viktor Semenov, and  Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin regarding the breakdown  of the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations on the problem of dividing  the Black Sea Fleet. The statement emphasizes, in particular,  that "the disintegration of Ukrainian statehood is possible and  attempts are being made to make the Republic of Crimea  responsible for that process, and penalize it harshly because of  this. It is not difficult, with the aid of provocations, to  create an unstable situation in the Republic and capitalize on  this to introduce a state of emergency, thus pushing relations  between Russia and Ukraine to the brink of war." In the view of  the statement's authors, "urgent steps are needed to prevent a  threat of the emergence of a new Yugoslavia." Mykola  Mykhalchenko said: "These people are in fact outsiders. Yuriy  Meshkov is losing prestige on the Crimean peninsula. There are  rumors that Eduard Baltin cannot resign for the same reason,  i.e., because of his unpopularity among the sailors [sentence  as received]. It is clear that Viktor Semenov needs to score  points ahead of the election of Sevastopol's mayor."</p>

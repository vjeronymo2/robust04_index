			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro lends itself to broking  -What's in a new name? The decision by ABN Amro, the dominant bank in the Netherlands, to use its name on a network of investment banking operations around the world is a further step on an ambitious route. 'We are a bank that takes small steps, but many, many of them,' says Mr Jan Kalff, chairman. It is characteristic of ABN Amro, formed by the merger of Algemene Bank Nederland and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank four years ago, to have taken time to blow its trumpet. For the seventh-largest European bank - bigger than Barclays and Dresdner - it has kept a low international profile. But by re-naming its equities, fixed-income and some of its corporate finance activities ABN Amro Hoare Govett - after the London broking firm acquired in 1992 - ABN Amro has sent a signal. It wants to be recognised as one of the banks that compete with US securities firms such as Goldman Sachs. ABN Amro already has a claim to being global. It has 1,690 branches in 60 countries. It also owns the Dollars 24bn asset La Salle bank in Illinois, and the Dollars 6bn asset European American Bank on Long Island. This means that 40 per cent of its assets were held outside the Netherlands in the first half of this year, while 45 per cent of pre-tax profits were international. But its claim to being a global investment bank is weaker. It does little equity underwriting outside the Netherlands, and is still organising a broking network. Like Swiss banks which have also expanded internationally, ABN Amro faces intense margin pressure in a small domestic market. And, like them, it has ambitions to put down roots in a second European 'home market' by buying a bank or savings bank in a country such as Belgium, France, Germany or the UK. Yet ABN Amro is accustomed to making slow, steady progress. Mr Kalff estimates that it is 'two-thirds to three-quarters' towards achieving the Fl 600m (Dollars 343m) cost savings it said it could get from its merger. It has also built up the La Salle group steadily from its first acquisition in Chicago in 1979. The merger was intended to create a bank strong enough to compete globally. 'It was obvious that we could not go on acquiring banks, and charging large amounts of goodwill, as ABN had done, without it hampering growth,' says Mr Kalff. The most significant investment banking step ABN Amro has taken since the merger has been to build up a broking network. This includes firms such as Riada Stockbrokers in Ireland, Massonaud-Fontenay-Kervern in France and Hoare Govett. Equities have been run from London since the start of this year. ABN Amro wants to meld the broking operations into a single network, and use it to strengthen its corporate finance arm. As evidence of how the strategy could work, it points to its lead management of the Fl 7bn flotation of KPN, the Dutch post and telecommunications company. Its network of brokers - notably Hoare Govett - allowed it to distribute KPN equity. Yet it will be a much harder task to break into primary equity business elsewhere. Mr Kalff says he is optimistic that its huge client list of large companies and commitment to other countries will help it to prevail. 'I am optimistic that we will make an inroad one of these days if we show our capability and commitment,' says Mr Kalff of the chances of lead managing equity in France. Making its broking network function as a unit could also take time. 'Sometimes the French have problems listening to Amsterdam, and now they must listen to London, which may be even more difficult,' says Mr Rijnhard van Tets, board member for global investment banking. Like other parts of ABN Amro, investment banking must meet a range of targets. As well as wanting to gain 50 per cent of pre-tax profit internationally, the bank seeks 12 per cent return on equity, a cost-income ratio of 62.5 per cent, and capital ratios at least 30 per cent higher than the minimum. This makes for a difficult balance. The bank has avoided a strong push into derivatives, and does less financial markets trading than its counterparts in Switzerland. But this places it under stronger pressure to break into markets like equity underwriting to justify international investments. 'We are very risk conscious. We are not averse to risk, but we do not take something on unless we are sure we can manage it,' says Mr Kalff.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / VAT computer will replace 60m forms A NEW computer system linking the EC's national tax administrations should be ready by November 2, to enable Community businesses to prepare for the new single market regime for monitoring value added tax (VAT) on cross-border sales, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. European Commission officials said yesterday they had signed contracts with SOF-X Marben Group, a Franco-Belgian software company, which will work on the system with NCR and Interpac. They would not reveal the value of the contract, but the Commission will spend up to Ecu8.7m (Pounds 6.2m) this year on development, on the hardware itself and on initial running of the system. From January 1, 1993, border VAT checks should disappear and the computer system will replace some 60m forms, currently used for monitoring VAT returns on cross-border trade. Under the transitional VAT regime, cross-border sales will still be zero-rated for VAT provided the customer and seller are registered, and the customer will pay VAT at local rates. Each quarter, traders will have to provide their registration number and those of their customers to their national tax authority, as well as the value of sales made to each intra-Community customer. The computer system will be used by member states to exchange information, and, from November, traders themselves will be able to confirm the VAT status of their customers via the computer. At the end of 1996, the EC should move to a definitive VAT system, under which customers will pay the tax at the rates applicable in the country from which they buy the goods. The decision to move to a final system will require unanimous approval from the 12 member states.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Brasway falls to Pounds 0.8m despite cost cutting AFTER A period of cost cutting and structural change, pre-tax profits of Brasway showed a sharp decline, from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 776,000, over the year to May 1. The result was bolstered by an exceptional profit of Pounds 751,000 on the sale in April of Brasway Tube, which incurred a loss of Pounds 167,000 over the period. Group turnover fell Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 30.4m. The company said that of this decline Pounds 2.5m was accounted for by Brasway Tube. Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said that despite the disappointing figures a final dividend of 0.27p is proposed. This will make a total of 0.51p (0.58p) for the year, payable from earnings per share of 0.69p (1.15p). Following the disposal of the Brasway Tube business the group acquired Winster Hose for a sum not exceeding Pounds 2.41m. Winster, which makes hoses, couplings and assemblies for the mining, agriculture and construction industries, will be integrated with the group's Europower business. Mr Swaby said that after the restructuring the balance sheet remained healthy, with gearing of 33 per cent at the end of April.</p>

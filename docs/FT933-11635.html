			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Asarco hit by production setbacks ASARCO, the US integrated copper producer, lost Dollars 24.1m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter after production problems at its recently-expanded Arizona mines and processing plants led to a fall in output. The company also continued to be hit by declining base metals prices. Asarco earned Dollars 4.4m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1992. Sales were Dollars 416.6m, against Dollars 487.7m last year. For the six months to June 30, Asarco reported a loss of Dollars 55m, or Dollars 1.32, down from Dollars 10.8m, or Dollars 1.30. Sales for the first half were Dollars 875.6m, down from Dollars 946.6m last year. During the quarter the company's average realised price for copper fell 18 cents from a year-ago to 85 cents per pound, with lead and zinc prices also lower. Its average realised price for silver rose 10 cents to Dollars 4.21 per ounce, and for gold, Dollars 10.45 to Dollars 374.39 per ounce. In addition to lower prices, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said earnings were hit by the shutdown of the Company's Troy silver/copper mine in Montana and higher costs and lower production rates at its Arizona copper properties. He said rains which flooded the Ray mine in the first quarter continue to dilute the solutions from which copper is extracted, reducing second-quarter copper cathode production by 3m pounds.</p>

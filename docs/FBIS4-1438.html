			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D. Issacson] </F>   [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] intends to complain to American President Bill Clinton  about remarks made by a U.S. election monitor on South African  television on Wednesday [27 April] night. IFP spokesman Ed  Tillet said the remarks were partisan and uninformed.    He said U.S. monitor Nellie Bailey referred to IFP President  Mangosuthu Buthelezi as having "colluded with the racist regime"  and was also critical of the party's late entry into the  elections.    "We do not expect foreign observers to interfere in South  Africa's domestic affairs or deliver hostile political judgments  against any political party or leader during the transition to  democracy," Mr Tillet said in a statement.    The IFP would ask the U.S. ambassador to forward the  complaint to Mr Clinton.</p>

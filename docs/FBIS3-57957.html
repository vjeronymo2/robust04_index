			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cologne [no date as received] (DPA) -- Heribert  Hellenbroich, former president of the Office for the Protection  of the Constitution [Bundesverfassungsschutz], views the letter  claiming responsibility [for the death of Christian Democratic  Union politician Bernhard Saelzer] as "a bad joke perpetrated by  amateurs." He told the Friday [31 December] edition of the  Cologne daily EXPRESS that the writers had made three decisive  mistakes that had unmasked them: "First, the letter is very  different from the confused linguistic style of the Red Army  Faction [RAF]. Second, real terrorists would never claim to  have tampered with the victim's car. They act professionally and  do not talk about it. And third, they look for symbolic figures  for their attacks. Mr. Saelzer was neither well known nor  powerful enough to be a target for terrorists."</p>

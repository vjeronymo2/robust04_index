			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R.P.: "Television and the Military Court"] </F>   [Text] Radio Television of Serbia [RTS] has refused to  broadcast free of charge during prime time an advertisement to  popularize the Yugoslav Army, i.e. to recruit young men to be  trained at military academies and military high schools.    At first glance one could say there is nothing controversial  about this; every advertisment has to be paid for; television  cannot waste its valuable time and does not have to make  exceptions. Anyway, one second of prime time for an ad costs,  depending on the program, an average of 50 dinars.    However, RTS did broadcast the military ads for a certain  period of time. It is true that it aired the ads during programs  that do not have a large number of viewers, such as "Dozvolite"  [Allow Me] and "Srbija Danas" [Serbia Today], but then it  decided not to show them anymore. While large television  stations decided to take this step, the small ones continued to  air the ads. Free of charge, of course.    The Montenegrin and all the local Belgrade television  stations agreed to run the ads free of charge. It is said in the  army that POLITIKA TV and Studio B were the first to respond:  They understood the situation of the Yugoslav Army. As soon as  the request by General Momcilo Perisic arrived, they agreed to  provide several spots daily, although the financial status of  these television stations is not particularly good.    On the other hand, the state television did not yield to the  army's request to have a few seconds alloted for the armed  forces even though the airing of the ads on military schools is  of public interest.    The army has calculated that it would have to pay 50,000  dinars (German marks) to state television for it to agree to  broadcast the ad on four RTS channels, and this only for a few  days.    Of course, such a sum was simply shocking to the Army, which  asked the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]  to do something through his "connections."    FRY President Zoran Lilic made a request to RTS, but even  this did not help.</p>

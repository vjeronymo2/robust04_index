			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLUTONIUM THREAT OF GALILEO PROBE  </P> <P> I find it sadly ironic that soon after we marveled at the ability of the  Voyager spacecraft to return images from Neptune, the Christic Institute and  two other citizens groups have filed suit to block the launching of the Galileo  probe to Jupiter (Part I, Sept. 28-29). If successful, this suit may halt the  exploration of the outer solar system for years to come.  </P> <P> The groups do not seem to consider rationally the risks involved in the launch.  For there to any chance of radioactive release, a major disaster would have to  take place during either the launch or the Earth flyby. Even if such a disaster  occurs, the plutonium is so well encapsulated that an accidental release is  virtually impossible. In the three previous failures of U.S. spacecraft using  "radioisotope thermoelectric generators" (RTGs), only one released any  radioactive material, and that was very finely distributed in the upper  atmosphere. The other two, which used the new encapsulated design, released no  radioactive material whatsoever.  </P> <P> Given these safety measures, the chances of a dangerous radioactive material  release are extremely low. The risk is not zero, however, and so this hazard  needs to be evaluated in comparison with other risks. Consider the number of  people killed in auto accidents or plane crashes, not to mention natural  disasters. Given the extremely low odds of a Galileo disaster and the small  number of fatalities expected from an accident, why does the Christic Institute  not concentrate upon airline safety or hurricane preparedness? I think Lanny  Sinkin (a Christic Institute lawyer) answered this when he said, "Our real  bottom line is, go find an alternative to plutonium." We have developed such a  fear anything "nuclear" that it becomes impossible to consider the risks  realistically; we fall victim to nuclear paranoia.  </P> <P> While there are many valid concerns regarding nuclear power here on Earth, or  even in Earth orbit, a long-range planetary probe faces unique problems. At the  distance of Jupiter, Galileo will receive only 4% as much sunlight as it would  at Earth, which would necessitate impossibly large solar panels. Chemical  batteries and fuel cells would not last the required 8-10 years. A nuclear  source is the only viable option for the foreseeable future. Given the small  risks involved, the use of plutonium RTGs seems justified on Galileo, and on  planned missions such as the Ulysses solar mission, and the mission to Saturn.  </P> <P> One can only imagine how the exploration of the Americas would have been  impeded if 15th Century Europeans had an irrational fear of the magnetic  compass. Let us hope that our nuclear fears do not lead us to close the door on  much of the solar system.  </P> <P> DAVID BURBACH  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

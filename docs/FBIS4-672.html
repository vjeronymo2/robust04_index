			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The adoption of a new Constitution has not  dispelled the clouds over the political scene in Zaire. [passage  omitted]    In a communique issued in Brussels, the "Zairian Opposition  Committee of the Forces Supporting Change" (COFAZAC) condemns  the complicity of some members of the international community  and calls on the opposition to regroup around Etienne  Tshisekedi, the prime minister elected by the CNS [Sovereign  National Conference]. For its part, the USORAS (Sacred Union of  the Radical Opposition)- Benelux thinks that "Zaire is at a  crossroads faced with the delaying tactics of Mobutu and his  men," and refers to "USORAS' right and duty to have an armed  force for self-defense and the protection of the people."</p>

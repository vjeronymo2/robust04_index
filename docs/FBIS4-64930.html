			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Isolation a Worry in Iceland"] </F>   [Text] Reykjavik -- "This is a historic last meeting. The  next time we Nordic foreign ministers meet, Sweden, Norway, and  Finland will be involved in the European Union [EU] as  observers."    Niels Helveg Petersen, a happy Danish foreign minister, was  cheering on the Nordic area in the EU after yesterday's meeting  in Iceland.    But the meeting's host, Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon  Baldvin Hannibalsson (Social Democratic Party), had a bitter  comment to make:    "Iceland, the Faeroes, and Greenland will become even more  marginalized within Nordic cooperation. Now everybody is saying  that `the whole of the Nordic area is part of the EU.' When we  Icelanders come to future Nordic meetings, will we have to sing  `Who can sail without wind?'"    The conclusion that Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson has reached is  that Iceland too must give consideration to membership. He is  engaged at present in an intense domestic battle to this end, in  which he does nothing to spare David Oddsson, his prime  minister, from the nonsocialist Independence Party. Oddsson's  party is deeply divided on the EU issue, as is the left-right  coalition government. The fisheries minister, for example, is  an opponent of EU membership.    Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson's weapons in his battle are three  opinion polls that have been carried out since the negotiations  in Brussels and the results the Norwegians achieved in the talks  on fisheries. These show that a majority of Icelanders now want  to investigate the possibility of EU membership. A year ago  only one-quarter of those interviewed had a positive view of  membership.    "It is said that politicians lead the people. But here in  Iceland the people lead the politicians!" Jon Baldvin  Hannibalsson told his Nordic counterparts.</p>

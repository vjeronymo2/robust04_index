			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Economic Planning  Board will eliminate 17 jobs for grade one through nine  officials, instead of the originally planned seven positions for  grade one through four officials, under its downsizing plan.    Under the reorganization which will be implemented  immediately after President Kim gives the go-ahead next week,  the Economic Information and Education Bureau will be reduced to  a division responsible for economic information in the Economic  Planning Bureau.    The three bureau chief-level coordinators under the  assistant  minister for international policy coordination will be trimmed  to two, while a new job of defense budget examination will be  created under the assistant minister for budget.    The system of sending a bureau chief-level official to a  foreign educational institution for study will be scrapped.    Several bureau-class offices will be rechristened: For  instance, the Fair Trade Policy Bureau of the Fair Trade  Commission will be renamed the Policy Bureau.    The reorganization plan will also affect some 20  division-class offices: For example, in the Economic Planning  Bureau, the manpower development planning division and the  social development planning division will be merged into a new  manpower division.</p>

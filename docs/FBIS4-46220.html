			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Savill, in Belfast: "IRA `Wanted Iran </F> Missiles'"]    [Text] Iran called in Britain's senior envoy to  formally deny any plot to arm and fund the IRA. Mr Jeffrey  James, charge d'affaires in Tehran, was told the allegations  were unfounded but British officials say they have information  linking top Iranian intelligence figures with the IRA.    The IRA may have been attempting to procure a large shipment  of weapons from Iran in preparation for taking the terrorist  campaign into the next century, security sources said yesterday.    Despite the Anglo/Irish peace initiative, the sources  believe  a hardline faction within the IRA remains intent on replenishing  and updating its arms.    High on its list of priorities are sophisticated  surface-to-air missiles capable of being used against military  helicopters in Northern Ireland, the sources believe. Twenty  SAM-7 ground-to-air missiles were found among a cargo of  Libyan-supplied arms on board the IRA gun-running vessel, the  Eksund, which was captured off France in 1987.    As a result of the Eksund discovery, military helicopters in  Northern Ireland were equipped with protective devices and  pilots were forced to switch flying patterns.    Recent evidence in the American courts suggest the IRA has  tried to obtain the more advanced Stinger ground-to air missiles  which security sources acknowledge would pose a serious threat.    Helicopters are used to carry VIPs during visits to Ulster  and the Army depends on them to operate in the so-called "bandit  country" along the border.    A security source said the IRA would probably like to  acquire  more anti-aircraft type weapons and the reason they had not been  successful in using them so far was a lack of training.</p>

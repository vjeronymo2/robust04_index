[passage  omitted]    A working commission was asked to prepare and draft the  joint  conclusions of today's meeting of the HZDS republican  leadership. Part of the statement should refer to proposals on  how to deal with the disciplinary procedure against two members  of the government and nine parliamentary deputies who have all  signed the program of the Alternative [of Political Realism].    Press Agency of the Slovak Republic reporters have learned  from reliable sources that the prime minister is inclined to  accept the view that, if elections were inevitable, the earlier  [they are held] the better. He would also find acceptable a  referendum on two questions: the deputies' mandates and early  elections. Vladimir Meciar is also believed to support the  expulsion of Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik from the HZDS  because they did not adhere to the movement's rules and  endangered the unity of the government.

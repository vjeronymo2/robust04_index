			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a news release, Chamber of Deputies President  Frantz Robert Monde deplores the carelessness with which Arthur  Spiegelman of REUTERS reported on the 1 March meeting of the  delegation of Haitian parliamentarians Frantz Robert Monde, Duly  Brutus, Jean-Eddy Talendier [Desjardins], and Dr. Antoine Joseph  with the Army high command.    For the record and as president of the Chamber of Deputies  and president of that delegation, Bob Monde makes a point of  explaining that Deputy Joseph Lambert, who was quoted by  (Spiegelman) as the source who provided information, was not  part of the delegation and was not present at that meeting; that  Colonel Dorelien's intervention simply hinted at civil war if  the parties do not decide to find an acceptable solution to the  crisis; and that General Cedras -- despite his reservations and  questions -- stated during this meeting that he is not attached  to the post of commander in chief and that the sacrifice of his  career is conditioned on guarantees for the institution he heads  and for improved living conditions for the Haitian people who  have been so harshly afflicted by the embargo.    Monde went on to say: As president of the Chamber of  Deputies, I have decided to continue dialogue with all sectors  interested in [finding] a solution to the crisis, especially  with the high command of the Haitian Armed Forces, whose  flexibility I could test during this meeting. This is signed by  Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and  dated 10 March.</p>

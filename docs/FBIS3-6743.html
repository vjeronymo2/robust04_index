The white paper says although there had been numerous  political charlatans in South Korea, there has been no such a  special-class turncoat well-versed in flip-flaps like Kim  Yong-sam who gratified his greed for power by traveling between  the ruling and the opposition and repeatedly changing his  political views.    It further says:    No sooner had Kim Yong-sam entered upon his political career  than he found himself among the one hundred thirty-six  initiators of a "constitutional amendment bill" to make the  traitor Syngman Rhee, a pro-American dictator, a "life  president" in November 1954 and when the bill was voted down at  the "National Assembly", he became one of the twenty "National  Assemblymen" from the "Freedom Party" who rattled the bill  through the parliament by phony calculation such as counting as  one fractions of .5.    Later, informed about the truth behind "Operation Ever  Ready", a plot weaved by the U.S. to remove Syngman Rhee, Kim  Yong-sam lost no time but broke away from the "Freedom Party" in  December 1954 and joined the opposition Democratic Party.    After shifting to the side of the opposition, the political  charlatan had resorted to every conceivable means of political  frauds, swindle and tricks to disguise himself as a "champion of  democracy against dictatorship" for 35 years till he came to be  embraced by the dictator through the merger of three parties.    In January 1990 Kim Yong-sam partook of the U.S.  imperialists' grand compromise strategy intended to totally  block the anti-U.S., anti-fascist action of the popular masses  and maintain and prolong the pro-American "military government"  by merging the ruling "military government" and the  conservative opposition force and thus saved the No Tae-u group  from the blind alley to which it had been driven, and committed  a criminal act of laying a stumbling-block in the way of the  movement for independence, democracy and reunification.    Seating himself at the helm of dictatorial power, Kim  Yong-sam openly backpedaled on the fine-sounding commitments to  "democratisation" he had made before his assumption of office  through a fascist frenzy of the "civilian" dictatorship.    The traitor has brandished the sword against the people  while  unhesitatingly granting unprecedented leniency for the former  dictators, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, with the assurances that  "the unsatisfactory past would no longer be made a topic for  discussion".    The Kim Yong-sam group placed on the backburner its promise  to "do its utmost for the growth of minor enterprises" and  concentrated more than sixty percent of the treasury funds on  big businesses. As a consequence, more than 4,300 minor  businesses went bankrupt last year, leaving one million people  jobless.    Kim Yong-sam went the length of invoking the fascist  "emergency arbitration power" which even those of the "Fifth and  Sixth Republics had not dared to do, in brutally suppressing the  workers' struggle for their right to existence.    On the plea of "eradication of corruption", Kim Yong-sam  increased his family property by more than 590,000,000 won in  six months or so and his secretaries collected 39,000 million  won as political funds at the backroom of "Chongwadae"  [presidential office].    The so-called "doctrine on the superiority of the nation"  uttered by the traitor Kim in his "presidential" inauguration  address turned into a "doctrine on the inferiority of the  nation" and a "doctrine of hostility against the nation", and  his "policy of improving relations" with the North was replaced  by a "policy of aggravating relations".    The white paper brands the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a  political charlatan who has no philosophy of his own, no  political view and has no regard for the nation and people, and  as a two-bit shyster who has not an iota of conscience as a  human being and no creed as a politician.    The white paper says that all the people must immediately  topple the traitor Kim Yong-sam whom they need not to watch or  expect from any longer, and open a broad avenue for  independence, democracy and reunification.</p>

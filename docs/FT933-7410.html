			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Block deal in RBOS A BUSY week in the banking sector was rounded off yesterday when a large block of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBOS) changed hands. The deal was executed by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French-owned stockbroker to Royal Bank. CLL declined to comment on the deal. An institution sold 20m shares at 286p. They were later placed in the market at 287 1/2 p. The placing was said to have gone through very smoothly, with institutions keen to take on the shares. There were suggestions in the market that Banco Santander, the Spanish bank, was the seller of the block of shares, around 2.5 per cent of RBOS, but this was discounted by banking specialists who believed the stock had come from a big UK institution, which was believed to have adopted the view that it was overweight in the stock. Santander was last shown as holding 9.89 per cent of RBOS while Scottish Equitable Life held 5.24 per cent. RBOS shares, marginally easier from the outset of the trading session, were unmoved by the share sale, closing a net 4 off at 290p. Turnover, representing double counting of the big institutional share sale, totalled 41m, the biggest single day's business in the stock since Big Bang in October 1986.</p>

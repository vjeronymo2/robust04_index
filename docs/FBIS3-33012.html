			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the editor by Defense Minister Jose Gallardo </F> Roman]    [Text] From the minister of defense to the editor.    In the daily newspaper under your able direction, of today's  date [date of the letter], the columnist Mr. Javier Ponce, in an  article titled "Not That Way, Don Marcelo," says the following:  "No sir. These deaths (of the soldiers and policemen killed on  the Putumayo River) cause us as much sorrow as they cause you.  But what we do not accept is that prisoners were taken without  cause, just to allow the minister of defense to have the  audacity to say that these captures prove that our borders are  well defended. And there is nothing else to say. Nothing to  prove. Nothing more to lie about...because the remains of lies  are the truths of power."    Mr. Ponce's remarks are a gratuitous and unfair accusation  against the honesty of the minister of defense and the acts of  an institution that has earned the trust of the Ecuadoran people.    What basis does Mr. Ponce have to accuse the minister of  defense of lying and of behaving with audacity?    We cannot believe that his conduct is due to an incredible  ingenuousness, but rather to the sickness of the most benighted  sectarianism.    Of the 11 prisoners taken in the Putumayo River sector, six  admitted that they were guerrillas and that they had taken part  in the massacre of 13 members of the security forces, who were  doing their duty, trying to protect their fellow men from the  scourge of drugs, and five admitted that they were collaborators  of the narco-guerrillas. These 11 persons were not arrested by  chance or on a whim, but on the basis of evidence verified by  experienced professionals--for example, a watch belonging to one  of the victims was found on one of the prisoners, and also after  questioning hundreds of persons. In order to prevent subsequent  malevolent charges, the military forces filmed the  interrogations in which the captured guerrillas admitted the  details of their participation in the ambush, including the  coldblooded murder of four members of the security forces at the  order of a certain Commander "Pedro," who required them to  commit this crime or pay for their disobedience with their  lives. I invite Mr. Ponce and the human rights defense  organizations to verify with their own eyes what the video  clearly shows.    Despite the fact that the Armed Forces, from generals to  conscripts, feel sincere respect for individuals and are under  strict orders to avoid committing any violations, the Armed  Forces command from the very first moment of this action issued  written and oral orders to avoid any brutality or cruelty.    As soon as the investigation was completed, which  necessarily  had to be carried out at the scene of the crime, the prisoners  were transferred to Quito to be turned over to the police  authorities. Not because the "minister of defense was going to  shine by showing off prisoners within 48 hours," as Mr. Ponce  irresponsibly says, but so that they could be tried by competent  judges and have the opportunity to defend themselves. The  civilized and law-abiding manner in which the Armed Forces have  behaved, and that deserves the recognition of the Ecuadoran  people, is shamefully denigrated by Mr. Ponce.    The unquestionable fact that the narco-guerrillas have not  penetrated, and coca and marijuana cultivation has not  proliferated in such a difficult geographic area, inhabited by  many illegal immigrants and not a few drug traffickers and  criminals, is the result of devoted and persevering military  patrolling that honors the Armed Forces, although Mr. Ponce may  say that the prisoners were taken so that the minister of  defense could have the audacity to say that the borders are well  defended. The ambush did not take place in the interior of  Ecuador, but on the banks of a border river.    Credit cannot be denied the Armed Forces so arbitrarily, as  Mr. Ponce so impudently does, while conferring it, also  arbitrarily, on confessed malefactors. What is the aim of this  type of behavior? Is it to destroy the credibility of the forces  responsible for maintaining the law and security so that the  Ecuadoran people will remain defenseless before the aggression  of the narco-guerrillas? This is why the words of Mr. Ponce who  says, referring to the murdered policemen and soldiers: "those  deaths cause us as much sorrow as they cause you," sound  completely insincere and false.    Anyone, not to mention someone who writes for an important  newspaper, knows that a person accused of murder will resolutely  deny committing a crime punishable by 16 years of imprisonment;  and he also knows that the guerrillas, the bolder and more able  they are, know how to conceal themselves among the people, in  whose eyes they seem peaceful citizens. They dress in the  clothing of simple peasants, they work just as other country  people do, but one day they dig up their weapons and kill  without pity. If the Armed Forces were so ingenuous and  unprepared as to allow themselves to be fooled by these tricks,  they would not deserve the trust of the people, but rather their  repudiation and the most severe sanction.    The prisoners are in the hands of justice, before whom they  will have to prove their innocence. Justice is not being denied  them. The Armed Forces are in no way interested in incriminating  innocent people, but neither can they become accomplices to such  a horrendous crime.    I think it is necessary to emphasize that the prisoners were  turned over by the Armed Forces to the appropriate authorities,  in the presence of journalists, and with individual medical  examinations. None of the prisoners was in poor health, so as to  make one think that they had been subjected to brutal treatment.  The impressions on their wrists are to be found on those who  have been bound or handcuffed for long periods because they are  dangerous; signs of chafing on their bodies are the effect of  carrying heavy burdens or weapons for long periods, or they are  caused by traveling through the forest. They are impressions  found very often on the body of a soldier or a guerrilla, and  they are indications of the activity that person has engaged in.    Even before these accusations against military personnel  were  made, the minister of defense and the Armed Forces command  ordered a complete and impartial investigation of those events.  Our institution has the most interest in seeing that it not  contain sadists or criminals, since we well know that these are  the seeds of self-destruction.    There is in the Armed Forces a sincere feeling of respect  for  the dignity of the Ecuadorans, and we feel that this dignity is  the principal object of our efforts to protect security. For  that reason, the agreement that the Armed Forces has with the  Latin American Association for Human Rights, whose purpose is to  encourage respect for those rights, and the agreement with the  Ecuadoran Red Cross to foster international human rights, are  evidence of the purest and most sincere desire to ensure that  Ecuadorans live in complete dignity.    I believe that this letter also allows me to direct myself  to  my comrades in the Armed Forces, to ask them never to allow  themselves to be led into criminal or abusive behavior, however  brutal the narco-guerrillas and other criminals may be, because  military commanders will take the necessary measures to ensure  that the Armed Forces always keep their honor and credibility  clean.    Mr. Editor, I believe that the minister of defense, chief of  the military front, has every right to have this letter  published on the same page on which the article by Mr. Javier  Ponce appeared.    Confident in your sense of justice, I am pleased to  reiterate  to you my sincere consideration and respect.    Cordially, Jose Gallardo Roman General of the Army Minister  of National Defense</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Pit calculations ignore damage to confidence in economy Sir, Andrew Glyn's letter (October 20) represents the first clear statement of the cost-benefit calculation involved in shutting down the 31 pits. He states that the 31 mines produce annually 30m tonnes at a production cost of Pounds 40 per tonne when the world market price is Pounds 30 per tonne. Hence the opportunity cost of keeping the pits open is Pounds 300m per year. Using a real interest rate of 5 per cent, this implies that the cost of keeping the pits open is Pounds 6bn in present value terms. He then states that the cost of closure is Pounds 1,320m in the first year and a recurrent annual cost of Pounds 600m per year thereafter, so long as the redundant miners remain wholly unemployed. By this reckoning, the redundant miners could spend up to twelve full years in unemployment and still the present value of the cost of closure would be less than the cost of keeping them open. Only if the redundant workers remained wholly unemployed for 13 or more years would it be cheaper to keep the pits open. These calculations ignore the unquantifiable damage to confidence in the economy caused by announcing closures in the middle of a recession and possible knock-on effects in other parts of the economy. They assume the gap between the production cost and the market price does not change and they also do not attempt to put a value on the personal consequences to miners and their families of abandoning mining. However, they do represent the basis on which any well managed business would make the decision. This has nothing to do with the price of gas, the government's cowardly reliance on the choices of a rigged market or bogus appeals to a nebulous national interest.

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS EXPEL U.S. MILITARY AIDE AS SPY IN TIT FOR TAT WITH WASHINGTON  </P> <P> The Soviet Union shot back in an espionage war with Washington today, ordering  a U.S. military attache expelled and saying the atmosphere of "spy mania" bodes  ill for relations with the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said that Army Lt. Col. Daniel  Francis Van Gundy III, an assistant military attache at the U.S. Embassy, is a  spy and that he must leave the country in 48 hours.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said Moscow was responding to Washington's expulsion last week of a  Soviet military attache it accused of trying to buy computer secrets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First in 2 1/2 Years  </P> <P> Van Gundy's ouster was the first Soviet expulsion of a U.S. diplomat in almost  2 1/2 years, a period in which superpower relations have markedly improved.  </P> <P> It clouded relations with the Bush Administration even before the President,  who took office in January, announced the results of a review of American  policy toward the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Administration is revealing its foreign policy, and we have this  problem of spy mania," Gerasimov told reporters.  </P> <P> He cited a recent Time magazine cover story on the 1987 Marine spy scandal at  the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and said American leaders uninterested in improving  relations had tried to incite fears of espionage.  </P> <P> "We're not the ones who initiated this process," Gerasimov said, tacitly  acknowledging the connection between last week's incident and the expulsion of  Van Gundy. "It does not fit in with the trend for the positive development of  Soviet-American relations."  </P> <P> Van Gundy, 42, of Marina, Calif., had served in Moscow nearly two years, the  normal diplomatic tour.  </P> <P> He had been expecting the expulsion order since the State Department last  Thursday ordered Soviet Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov to leave the United States.  Van Gundy held the same military rank and occupied the same diplomatic post in  the Moscow Embassy as Pakhtusov did in Washington.  </P> <P> Van Gundy, who lived on the U.S. Embassy compound with his wife, Susan, and two  of their three daughters, declined to answer reporters' questions.  </P> <P> Gerasimov, speaking at the Foreign Ministry Press Center, charged that Van  Gundy attempted "to enter a closed area, deliberately diverting from the  officially permitted route, clandestinely photographed military sites and  committed other gross violations" of the rules of diplomatic conduct. "Warnings  had already been issued to the lieutenant colonel," he said.  </P> <P> In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Anita Stockman, said without  elaborating that U.S. officials are "considering our response."  </P> <P> Pakhtusov was accused of receiving sensitive information about how the U.S.  government protects computer secrets. The State Department said he was caught  in a six-month FBI probe after he approached an unidentified American employee  of a firm that deals in classified information.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said the expulsion of Pakhtusov was "an artificially cooked scenario  clumsily carried out by the FBI."  </P></p>

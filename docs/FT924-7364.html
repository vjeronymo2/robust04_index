			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Banks are frustrating UK strategy for growth Sir, Despite welcome reductions in bank rates, the banks are still charging 17.5 to 21 per cent for overdrafts. They are frustrating the government's strategy for growth by refusing to pass on the benefits of reduced rates to customers. In Saturday's papers First Direct announced that with base rate reduced to 7 per cent, its overdraft rate is unchanged at 17.5 per cent. What is the point of increasing its margin at a time when the country desperately needs low real rates of interest? It is now charging overdraft customers 250 per cent of base rate. When are the banks going to realise that reductions in base rates are meant to benefit the customer, not the banks? Paul Hudson, 29 Carr Lane, Rawdon, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS19 6PD</p>

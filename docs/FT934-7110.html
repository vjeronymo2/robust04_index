			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Monday FT: A new start to the week - Richard Lambert, the editor, explains changes to features and services Today's Monday FT has a number of new features and services. Our aim is to provide readers with a lively and authoritative guide by highlighting the events and trends which could shape their week. The new Monday FT will include: The FT Guide to the Week Ahead on the back page of section II. Significantly expanded coverage in section II of what could be in store for companies and markets. Peter Martin, financial editor, explores global investment trends. A special table analyses worldwide investment returns. Peter Norman, economics editor, and Edward Balls of our leader writing team look at emerging economic policy debates. Special reports on the week ahead for companies, the international bond, equity and foreign exchange markets. A new page taking a fresh look every week at the increasingly popular emerging financial markets, especially in Asia and Latin America. The FT Guide to World Currencies, normally published on Tuesdays, will now provide this comprehensive exchange rate information at the start of the business week. Four new features in the first section of the newspaper: a business travel guide, a column about international executives and jobs, a profile of a leading business figure and an international press review. As a result of these improvements, several features will move or disappear. We hope this will not inconvenience our readers. Michael Prowse's column on America moves from the back page of section II to the main features pages. The Monday interview will come to an end, but regular interviews will now appear on the features pages on Tuesday. The international economic indicators will appear on Tuesday. The FT/Isma bond price table will continue to be published during the week but not on Monday. The construction contracts feature will disappear. Large construction contracts will be reported on the news pages. I would welcome readers' views on these changes.</p>

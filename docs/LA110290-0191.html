			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HELP-WANTED AD INDEX WEAKENS  </P> <P> A national index of help-wanted advertising weakened further in September,  indicating the labor market slump shows no sign of easing, the index's authors  said today.  </P> <P> The Conference Board, a private business research organization based in New  York, said advertising volume was hit by rising layoffs and general  unemployment.  </P> <P> "The slumping labor market shows no sign of abating. Layoffs remain elevated,  unemployment is slowly rising and want-ad volume continues to decline at a  significant pace," said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.  </P> <P> Advertising volume fell in seven regions and rose in only two. The Mountain and  West South Central regions registered "modest" increases of 3.15% and 0.6%,  respectively. The hardest hit was New England, with a 7.6% fall. It was  followed by the Pacific, with a 6.9% decline, and West North Central, down  5.7%.  </P></p>

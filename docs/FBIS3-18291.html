The same deputies formed a parliamentary interparty  initiative on Greek issues "to meet the needs of changing  times," they said. They all signed a declaration aiming at  salvaging Hellenism outside Greek borders as well as on Imbros  island.    The above were announced yesterday by these deputies during  a  news conference held together with members of the association of  Greeks from Imbros and Constantinople (IKTAR) at the Foreign  Correspondents Union room.    The declaration calls on Greeks everywhere to coordinate  action in support of human rights, not only in Imbros, but also  among all people, and calls attention to the danger of losing  traditions. At the same time, the declaration calls for  recognizing the rights of Greek Orthodox people outside Greece's  borders and for maintaining their identity, freedom, and dignity.    The declaration also urges implementing international law  and  the principles of UN decisions and the international accords in  Cyprus, Imbros, Tenedos, North Ipiros, and everywhere there are  Greeks.    The deputies noted that in Imbros, there are no schools,  church or doctor. PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] deputy  Konstandinos Bandouvas noted that the island's doctor was killed  last September in a peculiar traffic accident.    During the news conference, the deputies stressed that  everybody demands the establishment of Greek schools in Imbros  as well as a position for a Greek consular employee. PASOK  deputy Dhimitrios Vounatsos promised to see that the Greek  Government raise the issue of schools officially with the  Turkish Government and international organizations.

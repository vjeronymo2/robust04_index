			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Book Review: Why pay should be linked to success The Truth About Top Executive Pay By AP Williams Kogan Page, Pounds 25 'Executive remuneration is both a highly complex and a highly emotive subject,' is Anthony Williams's conclusion to this guide to executive pay. About that there is no argument, and a book that is able to establish both the facts of the matter and a coherent approach deserves a wide circulation. The studies quoted by the author demonstrate beyond doubt that something has happened to top executive pay over the past 10 years or so that is not accounted for by inflation. Nor can it be more than partly explained by the catch-up needed after a decade in which executives' net pay fell in real terms. Large institutional investors such as PosTel are often accused - as Williams does in this book - of being critical of executive remuneration. That is a misrepresentation of our position, however. Apart from requesting that reward is related to the success or otherwise of the company, as seen by shareholders, we make no such sweeping statement. Except in extreme cases, institutions cannot pontificate about the levels of pay that a board votes for its executives. I have enough difficulty in determining the correct pay levels for my own executives, let alone those in industries of which I have only a sketchy knowledge. Where the investor has a legitimate concern is in ensuring that the interests of the executives and the shareholders are aligned in determining the structures by which pay is determined and the various rewards available. In the past, many senior executives had substantial shareholdings in the company for which they worked. Shares were held by family members, not by professional investing institutions. It is the rise of the professional manager that has created the need for new structures. The investing institutions demand a check on the otherwise unfettered power of the executives, who might be tempted to live well at the shareholders' expense. A remuneration committee, made up of independent non-executive directors, is a body that should give us that confidence. Unfortunately, it does not always do so. Too often these committees seem to be reactive rather than to think for themselves. They interpret the mantra of remuneration policy - that a package should be able to recruit, retain and motivate good management - as an invitation to follow the consensus on what the marketplace demands. This is where the consultants, among whom Williams is counted, must take some of the blame. As he says: 'There is at least one well-known firm of consultants which is believed to be used by certain companies . . . because it recommends the high figures that their chief executives prefer.' Almost every company falls into the trap of wanting to reward its executives at top quartile levels (fund managers offer similar promises to potential clients). Yet three-quarters of companies will not be in the top quartile: it reminds me of the Labour cabinet minister of the 1970s who longed for every worker to be paid more than the average wage. Linking executive pay to average market levels is simply a game of leapfrog. Each company and each job is different, and a different combination of reward will be needed to recruit the right management. On what the combination should be, Williams's view is broadly compatible with PosTel's: A reasonable base salary, out of which a senior executive can lead a comfortable - but not excessive - existence. A short-term bonus, of limited size, dependent on demanding short-term targets on internal forecasts or budgets being met. A long-term bonus, perhaps capped only at a high level, dependent on the performance of the company, as perceived by the shareholder, over at least three years. The hurdle for the latter might be a measure of shareholders' total return, against a suitable peer group. Boots, for example, uses a mixture of retailers and drug companies for comparison. There is no place here for conventional share options. They were a reasonable device when marginal income tax rates were between 80 per cent and 98 per cent, but have no clear role today. Many companies now prefer to create trusts in restricted shares, to which executives get access after a period of service. The scheme run by Reuters, the news agency, for example, allocates shares after three years, but the shares cannot be sold for another two years. This is a better way of retaining the services of a successful executive than any contract. Williams and I do not disagree much on the question of executives' contracts either: the three-year rolling contract is almost impossible to justify. A three-year fixed contract which is succeeded by a one-year 'roller' should be enough to attract someone away from a secure job and offer protection against a breakdown in relations at an early stage. A good executive, asked to leave for reasons other than lack of competence, will not find it difficult to be recruited elsewhere; the market knows the truth. The way to ensure that executives take the risks necessary to build businesses is to offer substantial rewards when their risk-taking has borne fruit in the long-term performance of their company. The 1994 Hay survey of executive contracts shows a fall in their average term, with three-year contracts no longer in the majority for directors other than chief executives. Perhaps that will convince the 37 per cent of companies which are waiting to 'see what others will do, and will follow the market norm' that their time has come to move.

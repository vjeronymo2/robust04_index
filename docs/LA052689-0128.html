			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam has replaced his entire military high  command, tightening his grip on the rebellious armed forces after last week's  attempted coup. Deputy Prime Minister Addis Tedla, an air force major, was  named commander in chief of the armed forces, according to a statement from the  president's office. Tedla replaces Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, a leader of the  coup attempt who was killed in a May 16 gun battle at the Ministry of Defense.  No successor has been named for Defense Minister Haile Giorgis Habte-Miriam,  who was killed while resisting the abortive coup.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Junia Januaria in Manaus, Amazonas State] </F>   [Text] The 3d Helicopter Squadron has joined the Navy's  effort to patrol rivers in the Amazon region. Captain Napoleao  Bonaparte Gomes, the helicopter squadron commander, said the new  military unit is designed to strengthen the Navy's presence in  the region that, within the context of Brazilian national  security, remains quite vulnerable.    The 3d Helicopter Squadron will initially operate with five  Esquilo helicopters equipped with machine guns and rockets.  These helicopters will be primarily used for patrolling rivers,  police operations, and support for communities located on the  river banks.    The Navy has more than 1,000 men and seven ships -- five  patrol ships and two hospital ships -- in the Amazon region.</p>

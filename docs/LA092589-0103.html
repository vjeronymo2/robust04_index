			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROVA SAXOPHONE QUARTET IN UCI SYMPOSIUM  </P> <P> The final concert of the UC Irvine's all-day Electronic Music Symposium was a  performance of Alvin Curran's "Electronic Rags II" on Saturday night. This not  inconsiderable feat was ably accomplished by the avant-garde saxophone quartet  ROVA, with frequent associate Scot Gresham-Lancaster joining the composer at  the computer controls.  </P> <P> The work consists of 30 three-minute miniatures that combine a small measure of  improvisation with written music and electronically generated sound. Performers  may opt for the entire set, or may create abbreviated versions. On this  occasion, held at the Nelson Research Center in a remote corner of the Irvine  campus, the duration was 75 minutes.  </P> <P> Those minutes did not pass quickly. Yet lack of variety was not to blame. The  quartet -- John Raskin, Larry Ochs, Steve Adams, and Bruce Ackley -- indulged  in staccato squawks. They bravely bent pitches. They united for frantic  screaming sessions. They separated for mournful, jazz-influenced solos.  </P> <P> Behind ROVA's acrobatics, the electronics gave intimate response prompted by a  computer program that interfaced with the saxophone score.  </P> <P> Electronics offer infinite possibilities, most of which seemed to have come to  fruition Saturday night. The electronic background was chimes. It was a  steaming boiler to the quartet's open railroad-imitating intervals. It was the  whole railroad. There were male and female voices that spoke or sang  unintelligibly. There were eerie Spielberg-type sound effects and an array of  peculiarly electronic sounds all aptly related to the amplified acoustic  instruments.  </P> <P> Still, with all this activity, a sizable portion of the audience of 85  abandoned their posts, though one would assume they did not wander mistakenly  or uninitiated into an out-of-the-way electronic music symposium.  </P> <P> The remaining stalwarts squirmed, scratched and looked generally glassy-eyed  (when they weren't looking surreptitiously at their watches). The problem was  that this humming hive of activity produced a sticky sameness.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the most effective moments of the work were the instants of  silence juxtaposed against a sea of sound. Indeed, silence is an important  component in all music, but how often does one yearn for the relief that only  absolute quiet can provide?  </P> <P> And what was the fitting conclusion of Curran's tour de force? It stopped.  After 75 minutes, the members of ROVA -- whose appearance had been sponsored by  the Newport Harbor Art Museum as the beginning of its 1989-90 concert season --  simply stopped, graciously shook the composer's hand and thanked their weary  audience.  </P></p>

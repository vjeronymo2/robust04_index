			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Return to the family: Two Hong Kong residents looking forward to China's takeover in 1997 talk to Simon Holberton For Dr H. Y. Lee, 53, the discovery of his Chinese roots came late in life. In Beijing two years ago, he was awed by the historical monuments and by walking among what he calls 'real Chinese'. 'I just felt really proud to be Chinese; I was among my people,' he says. Mr Tsang Yok Sing's epiphany occurred much earlier, in 1966, during his first visit to Guangzhou (Canton), southern China, to meet his family. He was 19. 'It was love at first sight,' he recalls. 'I talked to older people and to younger ones like me. They were all inspired by some higher goals that were simply lacking in Hong Kong.' Both men live in Hong Kong. By character they are very different - Dr Lee, a medical doctor educated in England, is conservative by instinct, while Mr Tsang chairs the 'pro-Beijing' Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong. But they are both looking forward to the end of British rule and China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Uniting them is a shared ethnicity and nationalism. With the hand-over approaching, voices such as Dr Lee's and Mr Tsang's are becoming louder, signifying an apparent change of mood among Hong Kong's predominantly Chinese population. As Governor Chris Patten continues his brinkmanship with China - Hong Kong's Legislative Council is currently debating his proposals for democratic reform and he will discuss the confrontation with UK Prime Minister John Major in London next week - the ground is shifting beneath his feet. Both Dr Lee and Mr Tsang illustrate the divided loyalties of many Hong Kong Chinese - not so much between the Chinese and UK governments, but between the values of a China still ruled according to feudal traditions and western ideas such as the importance of the individual. Mr Tsang, for example, would not necessarily make a good Beijing communist: he is keen on argument and discussing ideas and, unlike the typical Beijing mandarin who is suspicious of debate, he does not think that political disagreement need lead to turmoil. Nevertheless, his anti-colonial instincts are clear. 'For people like me it is always exciting to think about the end of colonial rule,' he says. 'There has been a lot of change in the way the government rules Hong Kong and the way white people behave, but in my adolescent years - when one is most sensitive to injustice - I had an unpleasant impression of white people, especially British people. They belonged to the upper class. As for the Chinese upper class, they lived in English ways and spoke in English. When I was growing up it was impossible to have equality between the English and the Chinese.' Mr Tsang's objections to British rule have fuelled his Chinese nationalism to such an extent that he does not perhaps appreciate the irony of his affection for modern China, where a person's status in society and class are still important. On his first visit to Guangzhou, Mr Tsang, educated at Hong Kong University, felt part of the Chinese nation. It was 'a feeling of belonging to this vast country; it was a strange and pleasant feeling. 'This doesn't mean that I'm entirely happy with what has been happening in China, or that I think the Chinese government will be better than the Hong Kong government . . . But to me that is secondary; for better or for worse, China is our country.' Dr Lee would sympathise with many of Mr Tsang's views; but his attitudes to 1997 betray the ambivalence of most Hong Kong Chinese. For instance, he dislikes the idea of British rule, but appreciates its emphasis on justice and its relative lack of corruption. He sees the impersonal system of English law as superior to the Chinese method of resolving conflict, usually through personal connections and the payment of money. At the same time, his cultural identification is with China. That does not mean he likes the Chinese government, but for him 1997 means the end of the domination of Hong Kong by the gweilos (a derogatory term for foreigners). 'This doesn't mean the gweilos didn't do a good job, but the feeling is that Hong Kong will be ours. It's not that I like the communists, but they've got the same colour skin.' Dr Lee, who hopes to open a clinic in China this year, has found much to dislike about China since his first visit. 'I hate doing business there. Guanxi (connections) is so important and I hate that. But as a Chinese I look forward to being part of China.' His fear is that corruption will spread in Hong Kong after 1997. He comforts himself with the thought that he is not a 'big timer' and that corruption might not permeate to his level. But he says: 'You have no redress; that is the sad part about China.' Dr Lee's hope is that Hong Kong, in the way a child might influence a parent, will have a positive influence on China's development. But for him the 1984 Joint Declaration between Britain and China provides little guarantee post-1997. 'The Chinese interpret any document in their favour in any argument they are going to win,' he says. But then he adds: 'Maybe the son can influence the father. Hope, hope, hope.'</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Pounds 250m earmarked for urban regeneration THE government's Urban Regeneration Agency will ensure that the programme for bringing 150,000 acres of derelict land back into use is more focused and effective, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said yes-terday. In a consultation document on the powers the agency should be given, published in preparation for legislation due in the autumn, Mr Howard said the URA would work with local authorities and Training and Enterprise councils, but would have reserve compulsory purchase and development control powers. The agency is expected to begin work in about a year's time. It will assume responsibility from the Department of the Environment for administering city grants and derelict land grants, and will also incorporate English Estates, which is sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry to help to provide land for commercial development in certain areas. Its annual budget will be about Pounds 250m, but ministers emphasised that they expected it to stimulate up to five times that amount in private-sector investment. The agency will be run by a board of at least six members, and its cor-porate plan will have to be approved by Mr Howard and Mr Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry. Sir Idris Pearce, the chairman of English Estates, is to be deputy chairman, under Lord Walker, the former Tory cabinet minister. Ministers see the URA as part of the urban development programme, along with the 11 urban development corporations. Lord Walker is to join the 11 UDC chairmen at their regular meetings, which will be chaired by Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister. Co-operation will extend to the agency's helping UDCs as they wind up their ac-tivities and transfer their assets. Labour has denounced the initiative as merely a gimmick. Mr David Blunkett, the party's local-government spokesman, warned that ministers were creating layers of bureaucracy. If ministers were really concerned to avoid duplication of effort, the various schemes should be replaced by 'a single, expanded and flex-ible urban programme administered by the Department of the Environment', he added.</p>

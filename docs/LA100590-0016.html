			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: NO DKLA -- YET  </P> <P> Donna Karan shipped her spring '91 DKNY sportswear collection to Los Angeles  this week to shoot an ad campaign. "We're calling it DKLA, just kidding" said  Karan's media director, Patty Cohen. The clothes, along with Karan's regular ad  photographer, Peter Arnell, and her favorite model, Rosemary McGrotha, have  been skittering from the Hollywood sign and Mann's Chinese Theatre to Muscle  Beach in Venice shooting ads for February issues of fashion magazines. Karan  stayed in New York, but gave these last-minute instructions to the L.A.  contingent: "Just make me smile."  </P> <P> * TRIM, PERM AND A BOYFRIEND, PLEASE: The newest twist in full-service hair  salons is matchmaking. Daryl Rapoza, the owner of Personne Complet, a Woodland  Hills hair and body salon, is starting a dating service for her clients  beginning Oct. 11. Registration in the service is free but when members select  or accept a date through the service they will be charged $35 for an  introductory meeting. Membership perks include an optional 10-minute session  with the salon's psychic counselor and an upcoming singles event.  </P> <P> * FOREVER QUEENLY: Princess Anne of Britain and Queen Noor of Jordan behave  less, well, royally than Hollywood royalty when it comes to their famous faces.  Take it from Olivier Echaudemaison, the Paris-based makeup artist who has  "designed" their makeup for weddings and royal photo ops. Echaudemaison was in  town for the launch of the new Givenchy cosmetics collection, which he helped  create. It is now available exclusively at Saks. Between strokes of orange and  violet eye shadow he did allow that royals never hire him to apply their makeup  before splashy parties as Hollywood types are known to do. "They don't disturb  you for that, not like TV stars," he said. "A TV star is afraid tomorrow she is  not a star, but a royal is royal forever."  </P> <P> * YOU ARE HERE: Melrose Avenue appears to be aspiring to theme-park status.  Shopping as a recreational sport is so popular on the street that the Merchants  on Melrose association has printed a colorful brochure and map locating all the  must-shop stores and restaurants on the famed avenue between Fairfax and La  Brea. The first run of 50,000 copies is destined for hotel lobbies, travel  agents and tour guides. They will also be available in the stores. Hopefully,  the second printing will include tips on parking space.N  </P> <P> * PRESCHOOL PRINCESS: Looking for great Halloween costumes in all the usual  places? Try an off-beat location, such as the Mt. Washington Elementary School  (3981 San Rafael Ave). Tomorrow from 12 to 5 p.m., Los Angeles designer Karolyn  Kiisel-Fraser and a group of mothers are holding a fund-raiser for a future  preschool in the area. Kiisel-Fraser says she asked eveningwear pros, including  Bob Mackie and Bill Travilla, for glitzy yardage for the project and was  originally going to make just a few fairy princess costumes. But "everyone was  so generous," she has been able to turn out about 50 outfits, ranging from  charmed princesses to black cats and capes for Dracula. The tentative price  list is $8 to $35, but could climb higher. COMPILED BY THE FASHION STAFF  </P></p>

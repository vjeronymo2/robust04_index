			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (13): More hope for a troubled marriage - ISDN Services: a chance to exploit the combination of voice and data communications THE MARRIAGE of computers and telecommunications has long been a troubled one. The respective cultures - the fast-moving, short-termism of the computing industry and the lumbering, long-termism of telecommunications - have found it hard to meet on common ground. Furthermore, the couple are fundamentally incompatible; telecoms talk 'analog' and computers talk 'digital.' The couple can only communicate through a cumbersome translation device called a modulator/de-modulator or modem. Not only does this reduce the speed and richness of the dialogue, it also costs more and is unreliable. As computers cannot possibly talk anything else, the answer was for telecom networks to learn how to talk 'digital.' For the last quarter of a century, telecommunications suppliers have worked towards this goal and built digital networks alongside the old analog voice networks. While these have served the needs of large international companies and institutions who could afford to lease digital lines from the telecom suppliers, they have not advanced the cause of universal digital telecoms. Furthermore, it makes no sense at all to have two independent networks operating side-by-side, with double the installation cost and twice as much maintenance. The answer is to combine them in a single piece of wire or optical fibre and carry voice and data down the same digital 'pipe.' This is a crude definition of the answer that the computer and telecommunications industries have come up with: integrated services digital networking (ISDN). Although ISDN has been around for some years now, it is only recently that it has attracted the attention of users. There are two main reasons. Firstly, ISDN services are now available to a greater number of potential users. In the UK, British Telecom is expanding the ISDN service quickly with a total of 9,000 subscriber lines for the two-channel basic ISDN service now installed. Secondly, the increased demand for networking of all kinds has meant that ISDN has found a place alongside existing leased digital lines both as a back-up service and to enable new applications. Furthermore, standardisation across Europe means that ISDN can be used for international telecoms. In the past, the lack of a standard method for sending ISDN signals has slowed progress. But Germany, France and the UK have now adopted the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) 300/075 Eurofile transfer standard for ISDN, which makes it possible to use the service for transnational digital communications. It is expected that all European countries will have this standard in place by 1995. 'ISDN is the only internationally-available digital voice/data network. It enables international data exchange and can cut costs dramatically,' says Mr Peter Slade, sales director with the networking specialist, Maxim Networks. 'ISDN goes across all markets, too; we have identified 34 potential vertical markets for ISDN-based applications in Europe,' he goes on. The spread of the ETSI standard is likely to be accompanied by a significant rise in the use of ISDN. Market researcher Dataquest puts the value of the European market for ISDN terminal equipment at about Dollars 79m in 1991 and expects this to rise to Dollars 270m by 1996 - growth rate of 20 per cent a year. This will be accompanied by a proliferation of ISDN 'lines' - growing from a 80,000 primary rate lines at the end of 1991 to a million by 1995. Germany and France are leading the way, with the UK expected to grow fast. The growth in the use of ISDN is unlikely to have a great impact on the existing market for leased lines. Large users will continue to use leased lines for the foreseeable future, unless telecom suppliers change their tariffs. Many large users do, however, use ISDN as their back-up network to save them the cost of two leased lines - one of which would be redundant most of the time. Where ISDN really comes into its own is in the area of 'casual' use - that is, where connections are only required for a few minutes at a time or for up to three or four hours a day. Such applications do not warrant the cost of a leased line but need the speed and performance advantages of digital communications. Dial-up ISDN can achieve this. 'In addition to cutting costs, ISDN provides access, availability and the extra bandwidth for applications. It provides more efficiency on the back of existing applications,' explains Mr Paul Sirikal, marketing manager with the networking company Ascom Timeplex. But ISDN is more than only a better way to handle existing communications. It also offers the opportunity to build new applications which exploit the combination of voice and data communications. 'Customers have an increased requirement for access to on-line data - as well as back-up and overflow capacity. ISDN can meet these needs and meet the demand for 'casual' connection. The advantage of ISDN is that you can adjust the size of the 'pipe' to suit the application,' says Mr Sirikal. The trend toward automation of 'remote' working - where staff are away from their offices - is key. 'We see the remote office as one of the main applications of ISDN,' says Nigel Oakley, UK product marketing manager for networking company, 3Com. The electronic office is expected to be one of the leading applications of ISDN. Employees on the move with laptop computers can plug into the ISDN network and communicate with their central office far more efficiently than with existing modem-based communications. They can also send and receive 'voicemail' messages and process types of data (large database files, video, high-resolution graphics) which would have been impossible with the older technology. Office systems will not be the only beneficiary of improved digital communications. BT and IBM, for example, are set to launch a personal computer-based videophone system in the UK later this year. This uses ISDN to carry digitised video from one PC to another and has strong potential in a variety of applications. ISDN is an important part of a fundamental change in the infrastructure of global telecommunications. In the long-term, we will see most network traffic being transmitted digitally with all of the advantages this brings. We may also see a successful consummation of the marriage of computers and telecommunications.</p>

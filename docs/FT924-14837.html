			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Blueprint for Hong Kong: New institutions offered to keep growth on track MR PATTEN'S economic plans embrace the icons of the past, but at the same time offer novel prescriptions - including commitments to tackle head-on the problems of monetary stability, inflation, and skills shortages. He proposed creating a number of important institutions: a Governor's Business Council to advise 'on how best we can sustain our economic growth'; a formal Monetary Authority to help in ensuring monetary stability; and an Efficiency Unit to enhance public sector efficiency. Mr Patten talked optimistically of 'a 'trade wind' that promises to sweep the region, creating in its wake an economic revolution as great as any seen in Europe or North America since the start of industrialisation'. 'Hong Kong's position is strong; but it is not impregnable,' he said, announcing plans to 'mobilise the very best talent and experience that Hong Kong has to offer' to advise on maintaining future growth. The Business Council will be mandated to advise on: how the territory might remains 'the most business-friendly location in Asia'; the impact of government policies on business; how to maximise the potential of Hong Kong's location and resources; promotion of trade and industry. The assault on inflation, now in double figures and being driven by economic growth expected to average 5 per cent over the next five years, will focus on enhanced efficiency. This involves a commitment to prevent public spending from growing faster than the economy as a whole. Control of inflation has been hampered by the need to retain the politically stabilising link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. It has been maintained at this level - despite sometimes-fierce pressure to revalue - because of the need to maintain confidence in the currency during any political turbulence in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. Mr Patten repeated unequivocally that the exchange rate link 'must and will remain'. 'The political risks of tampering with the link would be enormous,' he said. The Monetary Authority, brings together the Office of the Exchange Fund and the Banking Commission. He felt this would 'enhance our ability to maintain monetary stability in the years to come'. In tackling labour and skills shortages, Mr Patten announced a Retraining Fund, endowed with HKDollars 300m (Pounds 22.7m), but funded thereafter by levies on employers when they seek permission to import workers. This fund is expected to enable the government to retrain 15,000 workers over three years. The government will also boost funding of the Research Grants Council from HKDollars 122m this year to HKDollars 180m in 1994-95.</p>

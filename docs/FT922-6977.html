			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Westpac It is difficult to escape the conclusion that something has suddenly gone terribly wrong at Westpac, Australia's largest bank, after yesterday's ADollars 2.65bn provision. Non-accrual loans rose 26 per cent in the past six months; loans with interest more than 90 days overdue rose 63 per cent. The bank has come unstuck on international loans to the Maxwell empire, Olympia &amp; York and Macy's, but most of the problems are in domestic property. After outside valuation of its property exposure, it has increased its provision rate from 28 to 47 per cent. Yet there is a chance that yesterday's announcement marks the beginning of the end of Westpac's troubles. Having been slow to provide as the property market fell, it has now leap-frogged some of its competition. Strictly speaking, its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue is unnecessary. After the provisions its capital ratios would still fall within the rules set by the Bank for International Settlements. With the extra equity, the ratios will be within the Australian norm. It thus looks as though the bank is positioning itself for recovery. Overheads have been cut by 1 per cent in the past year. The provisions rate should fall from now on. It may even be possible to write back some of the latest provisions. That would allow for more flexible management of the loan portfolio. The proviso remains, though, that there should be no further falls on the Australian property market. This risk will increase if other banks follows Westpac's example and raise provisions to the point where they can afford to sell property assets cheaply. Similar behaviour by banks in the US has certainly slowed property market recovery there.</p>

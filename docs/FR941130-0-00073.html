			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Section 201&hyph;20.305(a) is amended to require agencies to provide GSA the position title and organizational identity of offices authorized to submit agency procurement requests for DPAs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;1 is amended to clarify that a delegation is not required for FIP supplies even though they may be part of an acquisition that contains other FIP resources. It will serve to correct an error in FIRMR Interim Rule 2 appearing in the October 24, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Section 201&hyph;20.305&hyph;1 is also amended to clarify that, when an agency elects to use SBA's 8(a) Program to acquire FIP resources, the FIRMR policies and delegation thresholds for obtaining DPAs apply. This final rule is responsive to agencies' concerns about when the DPA thresholds apply; explains the difference between a requirement ``available from only one responsible source'' and a ``sole source'' acquisition issued under SBA's 8(a) Program; and explains that the thresholds apply to all FIP resource acquisitions (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts). The FAR contains general policies that apply to all acquisitions. The FIRMR, which is the primary regulation for FIP acquisitions, contains policies and procedures that are unique to FIP resources. In acquiring FIP resources, acquisition personnel must follow the policies and procedures in the FAR except in those areas where the FIRMR prescribes special policies and procedures. This applies to acquisitions using SBA's 8(a) Program for FIP resources. To apply DPA thresholds to acquisitions conducted through SBA, an agency needs to determine if the requirement is (i) a specific make and model, or (ii) a requirement for which only one source of supply or service exists. If a requirement fits into either of these categories, a delegation is required if the value of combined FIP resources (including optional periods and quantities) exceeds the regulatory delegation threshold established in the FIRMR for the agency for a specific make and model or a requirement available from only one responsible source, unless the agency has a specific agency delegation at a different level. In all other cases, the higher regulatory delegation threshold established for the agency applies, unless the agency has a specific agency delegation at a different level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Section 201&hyph;24.101&hyph;3 is amended to (i) provide a new address to which requests for exceptions to the use of FTS2000 are submitted, and (ii) clarify procedures when an agency's intercity telecommunications may fall outside the scope of FTS2000. Requirements for intercity telecommunications within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands must be submitted to GSA for inclusion in the FTS2000 program or for a final determination as to whether a requirement is outside the scope of FTS2000. The changes will ensure that agencies follow appropriate procedures when acquiring intercity telecommunications services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Section 201&hyph;24.104 is deleted to remove the POTS Program from GSA's mandatory programs. Agencies are encouraged to consider use of POTS, since the contracts are competed and provide cost-effective services. This change allows flexibility to agencies to acquire telecommunications resources that are most advantageous to their individual needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Subpart 201&hyph;39.8 is amended to remove provisions that require mandatory use of the POTS contracts. The POTS contracts are available for use on a nonmandatory basis as an optional source of supply. The name of the program is changed to ``Purchase of Telecommunications Services.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The FIRMR Index is amended to reflect references changed or added by this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) This rule was submitted to, and approved by, the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. The rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 41 CFR Parts 201&hyph;3, 201&hyph;4, 201&hyph;9, 201&hyph;18, 201&hyph;20, 201&hyph;21, 201&hyph;23, 201&hyph;24, and 201&hyph;39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Archives and records, Computer technology, Telecommunications, Government procurement, Property management, Records management, Federal information processing resources activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 201&hyph;3_THE FIRMR SYSTEM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

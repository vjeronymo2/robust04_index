This proposal would require that certain landing gear brakes be inspected for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the specified wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This proposal is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by March 23, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Investigation revealed that there were failed pistons on each of the eight brakes, with O-rings damaged by over-extension due to extensive wear. Fluid leaking from the damaged pistons caused the hydraulic fuses to close, releasing all brake pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This accident prompted a review of allowable wear limits for all brakes installed on transport category airplanes. The FAA and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) jointly developed a set of dynamometer test guidelines that could be used to validate appropriate wear limits for all airplane brakes. It should be noted that this worn brake accountability determination validates brake wear limits with respect to brake energy capacity only and is not meant to account for any reduction in brake force due solely to the wear state of the brake. The guidelines for validating brake wear limits allow credit for use of reverse thrust with a critical engine inoperative to determine the energy level absorbed by the brake during the dynamometer test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has requested that airframe manufacturers of transport category airplanes: (1) Determine required adjustments in allowable wear limits for all of its brakes in use; (2) schedule dynamometer testing to validate wear limits as necessary; and (3) submit information from items (1) and (2) to the FAA so that appropriate rulemaking action(s) can be initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> British Aerospace has conducted worn brake rejected takeoff (RTO) dynamometer testing and analyses on various brakes installed on Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. Based on the results of that testing and analyses, the FAA has determined that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes equipped with brakes manufactured by Allied Signal Aerospace Company (Bendix) are acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. The FAA also finds that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes are not acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. Consequently, the FAA has determined that the brake wear limits for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes and the new brake wear limits for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes must be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that, in order to prevent loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO, the following maximum brake wear limits are necessary for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,xs50,10,r50 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> British Aerospace Model Bac  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1&hyph;11&hyph;200  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;400  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Series Airplanes Equipped With Bendix Brakes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Airplane Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Brake part No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Maximum brake wear limit (inch/mm) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2601225&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.75 inch (19.1 mm). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2601240&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.0 inch (25.4 mm). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.

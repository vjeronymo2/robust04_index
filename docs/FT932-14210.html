			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: NHL wins approval for Eurobond repayment NATIONAL Home Loans, the mortgage lender, yesterday won approval at a bondholders meeting to repay a DM150m (Pounds 61m) Eurobond issue on schedule in June. The agreement means that NHL will face no debt repayment obligations until November 1995, according to Mr Nigel Terrington, the group's finance director. Earlier this year, NHL had abandoned plans to reschedule the D-Mark Eurobond. But in order to redeem the bonds at maturity, NHL had to gain the approval of its dollar bond holders, whose bonds were restructured along with NHL's bank debt last year, in order to extend their maturity to December 1995. The company has a second D-mark Eurobond outstanding, which falls due in November 1993. NHL was rescued by its banks from collapse last year, and is now paying interest of 200 basis points over Libor (the London interbank offered rate) on its Pounds 400m of bank debt, compared with 30 basis points over Libor, prior to the restructuring. It is also paying 200 basis points over dollar Libor on its rescheduled dollar bonds. Since last year, NHL has been running down its mortgage business and concentrating on repaying its debt. It now has a mortgage book of Pounds 325m, after removing more than Pounds 2bn of mortgages from its balance sheet through securitisation.</p>

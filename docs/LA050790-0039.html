			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARINE'S MURDER FUELS FEAR OF MORE VIOLENCE;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: U.S. OFFICIALS WORRY THAT LEFTISTS WILL KEEP ATTACKING AMERICANS  TO PROTEST FOREIGN BASES ON THEIR SOIL.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said Sunday that they fear additional attacks on American  diplomats or military personnel in the Philippines following the shooting death  of a U.S. Marine sergeant by suspected Communist assassins outside Subic Bay  Naval Base.  </P> <P> With sensitive talks due to begin May 14 on the future of the six U.S. military  facilities in the Philippines, the officials fear the Friday night shooting may  signal a new campaign of leftist violence to force the bases out.  </P> <P> "The expectation is this attack will be followed by others in the next several  weeks," one analyst said Sunday.  </P> <P> Said a second official: "Everybody is very nervous."  </P> <P> About 40,000 U.S. military personnel, civilian base workers and their families  remained confined to their bases Sunday, and Subic Bay spokesman Lt. Cmdr.  Kevin Mukri said that Americans connected to the Defense Department who live  off the bases were ordered not to stop while driving to and from work.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy warned American tourists and business travelers to stay away  from U.S. installations and from more than a dozen rural provinces. Officials  also restricted travel for about 300 Peace Corps workers in the country.  </P> <P> "We're trying to alert American citizens of the increased risk," Victoria  Middleton, an embassy spokeswoman, said.  </P> <P> Officials here said the State Department is considering adding the Philippines  to its list of "most dangerous" countries for U.S. diplomats. The list now  includes Lebanon, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Colombia and Peru.  </P> <P> The designation, which would add 20% hazardous-duty pay for about 400  diplomats, could have political ramifications since the Bush Administration  remains committed to President Corazon Aquino's struggling four-year-old  government.  </P> <P> Several U.S. diplomats have been transferred or have sent their families home  in recent months because of the increased threats. For security, embassy  officials now are urged to vary their routes when they go to work, to change  license plates, use different cars or ride in armored embassy vehicles.  </P> <P> By early today, no group had claimed responsibility for the killing of Gunnery  Sgt. John S. Fredette, 34, of Buena Park, Calif., who was shot once in the back  of the neck. But police and U.S. Embassy officials said they strongly suspect  the New People's Army. The Communist group had repeatedly threatened to attack  American officials before the talks and had named Subic Bay as a target.  </P> <P> Tensions were heightened last week after tens of thousands of people marched  against the U.S. bases in annual May Day demonstrations. The protests drew  widespread publicity after Philippine military police severely beat several  protesters and local reporters at the gates of Clark Air Base.  </P> <P> Clark and Subic Bay are among America's largest overseas bases.  </P> <P> Fredette was killed as he walked down a dimly lit residential street near the  raucous nightclub district in Olongapo, about 50 miles northwest of Manila. He  had arrived at Subic Bay one week earlier on a training mission with Marine  Fighter/Attack Squadron 323 based in El Toro, Calif.  </P> <P> "He was not robbed, so that makes it more likely it was a political murder,"  one analyst said. "It looks like the poor guy was in the wrong country at the  wrong time."  </P> <P> In the past, the Communist rebels had said they would target only those  Americans involved with counterinsurgency or intelligence operations. Analysts  said the latest shooting suggests that enlisted men and women may be targets  now as well.  </P> <P> If the rebels were responsible, Fredette would be the sixth American killed by  guerrillas since Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a counterinsurgency expert, was  assassinated in suburban Quezon City in April, 1989.  </P></p>

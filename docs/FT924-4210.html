			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TT in Pounds 13m bid for AB Electronics TT GROUP, the industrial holding company, yesterday ended five months of friendly talks with AB Electronics by making a recommended Pounds 13m bid for the Welsh-based group that has been mauled by falling contract assembly, defence and automotive markets. TT's offer of 10 new shares for 37 AB shares has the unusual feature of valuing its target's shares at 49.2p, or nearly 7p below the market price before the bid. In July TT took a 6.3 per cent stake in AB, which pushed the share price up to 90p, since when it has slipped back. It now controls an 8 per cent stake. TT is offering a full cash alternative of 45.1p, underwritten by Samuel Montagu. In conjunction, Samuel Montagu is raising Pounds 7.7m through a placing of 4.59m shares at 167p, subject to clawback by existing shareholders. TT's gearing is likely to rise to 60 per cent as a result of the deal, which comes hard on the tail of the acquisition of Magnetic Materials in July. Mr John Newman, TT chief executive, said the offer price reflected AB's trading outlook. He said the two companies had compatible businesses. TT is likely to focus on the costing and range of AB's products and integrate distribution and manufacturing facilities. Sir Peter Phillips, AB's chairman, said in a statement that his company had faced tough trading conditions coupled with rationalisation and reorganisation costs. There was also evidence of a 'faltering in the recent improving trend in order taking'. Mr Newman is the third ex-Hanson employee to launch bids in the past few months. He follows Mr Greg Hutchings at Tomkins, which is bidding for RHM, and Mr Chris Miller at Wassall, who is bidding for Evode. For 10 years after leaving Hanson's acquisitions department in 1977, he ran private companies before reversing two of them into Tyzack Turner. Since then, the renamed TT has developed a reputation as an acquisitive industrial mini-conglomerate. But the purchase of Crystalate in 1990, Magnetic Materials earlier this year and now AB, has effectively transformed the group into an electronics product group for the time being. AB's fall, from a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 120m in 1987 to less than Pounds 16m yesterday, has been in line with the waning fortunes of the electronics industry. Based in the Rhondda Valley in Wales, AB has been a large contract assembler of electronic systems and surface mount boards (SMT) for blue-chip customers such as IBM, Olivetti-Acorn and Jaguar. But AB has been hit hard in all three of its markets. Demand for board assembly has fallen with demand for computers; its automotive division has been hit by a fall in demand for sensors, particularly from the luxury end of the market; and its components side has been hit by the slowdown in defence spending. Sir Peter Phillips has been invited to join the TT board, at least until next year's AGM. NM Rothschild has advised AB shareholders that the TT offer is fair. TT's share price fell 4p to 182p yesterday. See Observer</p>

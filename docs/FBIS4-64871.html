The general coordinator of the United Left (IU)  called an emergency press conference two hours after the prime  minister's appearance. Anguita accused Gonzalez of being  "Spain's biggest problem" today.    The IU leader demanded that the prime minister call a  confidence vote in parliament and that the Catalan and Basque  nationalists use that opportunity to dare to maintain support  for the government and "take on their share of the blame for  maintaining this state of corruption."    The IU coordinator felt that Gonzalez's statements  maintaining that both the president of Catalonia, Jordi Pujol,  and the leader of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], Xabier  Arzalluz, are continuing to support him cannot remain  unanswered. For Anguita, it is preciseley as an exercise in  democracy and transparency that the parliamentary  representatives of both nationalist leaders should demonstrate  their support in the confidence vote. "Let it be clear whether  or not they support him and let them brave the consequences of  their support in a debate," the IU leader said.    Anguita feels that Gonzalez is responsible for practically  everything: unemployment, economic ruin, a policy of nonsense  and flight from reality, the ideology of the "pelotazo,"  society's lack of ideals and, lastly, for being the "person most  responsible for the corruption." The IU leader feels that the  press conference offered Gonzalez a leader's rendezvous "with  his dignity and the future of his country." Given the outcome  of the prime minister's speech, which Anguita followed on the  television next to the staff at his office, "this rendezvous has  been neither a drama nor a tragedy; it has become grotesque," he  said.    Anguita cannot repeat his demand that Gonzalez resign every  day, although he will raise the matter again next Wednesday in  parliament, when the prime minister appears. For him, as long  as Felipe Gonzalez is the head of government, "this request will  not be withdrawn."</p>

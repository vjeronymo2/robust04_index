FMLN Spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano said that the victims were  members of the same family and that the incident occurred on 29  December in the town of Ochupse, in the jurisdiction of Santa  Ana Volcano.    According to the FMLN version, several heavily armed men  stormed the victims' house and killed Lorenzo de Jesus Cabrera,  Santo Feliciana Venegas, and Ruben Eduardo Escobar--tattooing  the letter M on his body after beheading him.    The victims were rank and file FMLN militants in Santa Ana  Department, and the sources said this was another political  crime.    "Nothing was stolen from the house; they came expressly to  kill them," said Zeledon Rodriguez, FMLN representative in Santa  Ana.    The former guerrillas demanded an investigation in Santa  Ana,  which was one of the regions that was viewed as a bastion for  the death squads during the past armed conflict.    According to FMLN statistics, in 1993 approximately 40  members of that organization, including rank and file militants  and leaders, were killed by presumed death squads.    A special commission consisting of two delegates from the  Salvadoran Government, one from the United Nations, and the  ombudsman is investigating political murders that have occurred  after the signing of peace agreements in January 1992.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 0014 on 7 January  transmits a report stating that "the FMLN reported on 7 January  the murder of another member in the western Department of La  Libertad." The report adds that "an FMLN spokesman identified  the victim as Vicente Soto, a member of the Farabundo Marti  People's Liberation Forces (FPL)."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V. Kuchin report; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Kamchatka mass media reported that the Far East  Maritime Steamship Company had stopped allocating vessels for  transporting containers to Kamchatka, and that Vladivostok had  decided not to renew business relations with Kamchatka in the  area of petroleum products delivery. Things have gone so far  that Kamchatka cargoes are now being sold in the Maritime Kray  to pay for debts incurred, without regard for who in Kamchatka  owns it. This correspondent asked Kamchatka Oblast Governor  Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov to comment on these reports. He  said that as far as Kamchatka and probably other northern  territories were concerned, such an imperious policy toward the  outlying regions still dominated certain circles of the Maritime  Kray. Vladivostok exploits its geographical location and its  transportation links with the center of Russia, and it no longer  considers the needs of these northern regions. This especially  applies to the fuel and energy resources meant for Kamchatka.  [passage omitted] However, it is only proper to note that talks  with the Maritime Kray over the last few weeks give some hope  that such events will not be repeated.    The Far East Maritime Steamship Company is reluctantly  allocating ships for the Vladivostok-Petropavlovsk route, but as  for passenger routes, no one even mentions them; it is as if  they have never existed. [passage omitted] The Maritime Kray  shipowners find it more profitable to work with Bangkok, Manila,  Singapore, and Pusan than with Russia's northern ports.  [passage omitted]    Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov added that the administration  is continuing its talks with foreign partners on delivering  petroleum products, some of which, sadly, are cheaper than  Russian ones. [passage omitted]    As for marine transportation links, let me add that those  Kamchatka residents who decided to leave the peninsula for good  have become hostages. The number of these people increases  daily; no matter who you ask, they want to leave Kamchatka.  Delays in the payment of salaries, stoppages of enterprises,  high prices, unemployment, a high crime rate, and unbearable  climatic conditions augmented by freezing apartments and the  lack of hot, and often even cold, water forces people to make  such sad decisions.

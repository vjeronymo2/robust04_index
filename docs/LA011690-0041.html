			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NO SURE PATH TO LATINO POWER;  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING: CONCENTRATED OR DISPERSED, MINORITY VOTING STRENGTH CAN BE  UNDERCUT. A BETTER ROUTE IS A LARGER BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.  </P> <P> The trial of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors over the method they  used in 1981 to redistrict the five supervisorial districts raises two  fundamental questions that go beyond this particular case: What is the best way  to empower a group, and how can political effectiveness be maximized for  everyone?  </P> <P> The supervisors have been charged with drawing their district lines so that the  county's Latino voters were spread over three districts rather than being  concentrated more heavily in one or two. The plaintiffs contend that under the  supervisors' plan, Latinos were denied a reasonable opportunity to elect one of  their own because their voting strength was diluted among three districts.  </P> <P> The first question is how best to empower a group, giving it a role in the  decision-making process. Is a group better served if its members are lumped  into a single district, thereby increasing substantially the possibility of  electing a member of that group? Or is the group better represented if its  people and voting strength are dispersed throughout the county, although not in  sufficient numbers to constitute a majority of voters in any one district?  </P> <P> Both approaches to political empowerment rest on assumptions that are appealing  but questionable. If a district is created for a particular group, that may be  the quickest way for it to gain formal office and to begin to build an  effective base for further electoral victories.  </P> <P> A single seat, however, may not ensure that the people can achieve their  objectives. The board member may be politically isolated, or if all of a  group's power is concentrated in one district, other board members may pay even  less attention to that group's views.  </P> <P> The other approach to acquiring decision-making authority is dispersing a  group's voting strength throughout the county. It does not need a majority or  even a plurality to influence the outcome of elections. In fact, in very close  elections, it can considerably increase its voting power by being a swing bloc.  </P> <P> There is the potential, therefore, for a group to be influential in more than  one district, but essential conditions must exist, and these are difficult to  ensure. It must either be cohesive in close elections or large enough to make  major candidates pay attention to the group.  </P> <P> The success of either empowerment approach, therefore, is dependent upon  several variables. Selecting one strategy over the other cannot guarantee that  true political power will be achieved automatically.  </P> <P> The second political question stemming from this controversy is, how can all  people in the county attain greater political effectiveness? A large part of  the answer lies in changing the board itself.  </P> <P> The number of supervisors should be increased to at least seven. Each of the  supervisors today represents about 1.5 million people. By comparison, each of  the 15 Los Angeles City Council members represents about 200,000 people. By  adding two supervisors, the voting influence of everyone in the county is  increased because the districts will be smaller. As a consequence, supervisors  will be less geographically and politically removed from most of their  constituents.  </P> <P> The 2 million Latinos in the county should benefit immediately in several  districts because of their population distribution. Yet all people in the  county will have greater opportunity to make their votes count more than they  do now. This in turn should make supervisors more responsive and accountable.  </P> <P> Had the Board of Supervisors carried through with two reform proposals made in  the 1970s, this current trial might have been avoided. It was suggested then  that the board membership be increased and that a separate office of county  executive, elected by the voters, be created.  </P> <P> The justification for the additional supervisors was the same as we read today:  to get more diverse representation and to draw supervisors closer to the  electorate. The rationale for the executive, a county mayor in effect, was that  there should be separation of power and checks and balances in county  government. Without an executive branch, the five supervisors act as both  county legislature and executive.  </P> <P> The major argument against these proposals was the added cost to the taxpayer.  Less publicly, some of the supervisors did not want their political power  diluted by new supervisors or assumed by the county executive. Hence, there was  little political support for the ideas and they faded.  </P> <P> No single reform or court decision can correct all the structural deficiencies  of the board. Regardless of the ultimate disposition of this court case, some  political changes should be made not just to provide representation for one  group but to improve representation for everyone. Increasing the number of  supervisors can be an important first step.  </P> <P> This trial and the public discussion of the issues can be the impetus for  requiring Los Angeles County to change its 19th-Century structure to one more  democratic to meet the increasing challenges facing government in the 1990s and  beyond  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guy Rogers] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 15 SAPA -- The Freedom Front [FF]  says Thursday's [14 April] TV debate between President F W de  Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela was a microcosm of South  Africa's present politics -- "an NP[National Party]-ANC go it  alone show".    The debate was a sterile shadow-boxing contest, the FF said.  "History will show the NP-ANC relationship is similar to that of  the blackwidow spider using and discarding its mate..."    The African National Congress would discard the NP once a  transfer of power had been completed, the FF said.</p>

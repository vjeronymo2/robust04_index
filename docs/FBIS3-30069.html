Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says the defense  minister has explained the thinking behind the principle and  ways and means to proceed in arms deals. Mr. Aphisit says only  major arms purchases will be subject to barter trade policy. He  says the government does not intend to interfere in regular  operation of the Armed Forces and small purchases will not have  to be negotiated.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri says the Armed Forces' plan  to buy transport planes from Italy has to be delayed until Italy  has a new government.    Deputy Minister of Commerce Chaiyot Sasomsap also says the  armed forces should ask Italy to remain committed to the quota  prices until April as there will be a trade meeting between the  two countries next month. He expects the meeting to be  beneficial to the arms deal as well. Deputy Minister Chaiyot  says his ministry has invited the Thai Chamber of Commerce and  the Federation of Thai Industries to consult on trade measures  and cooperation with Italy on February 24.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Manufacturing shows surprise fall A DROP in the production of cars, chemicals and materials for the building industry caused a surprise fall in UK manufacturing output in May, adding to doubts over the prospects for economic recovery. Contrary to City expectations of unchanged production, the Central Statistical Office yesterday reported that manufacturing output declined by 0.6 per cent in May compared with April. Output of the energy and water industries fell by 2.2 per cent in the month, to result in a 0.9 per cent drop in overall industrial production. The seasonally-adjusted data for May were further evidence that Mr John Major's election victory failed to boost economic activity. Figures for the latest three months, which the government considers a better guide to recent trends, painted only a marginally better picture. The CSO puts the latest estimate of trend growth in manufacturing output at 0.5 per cent a year. Manufacturing output between March and May was 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, but 0.9 per cent lower than in March to May last year. Reflecting the vagaries of North Sea maintenance activity, energy output in March to May was down 3.1 per cent compared with December to February, but 2.7 per cent up on the year before when the repairs to the Piper Alpha oil field were being completed. Overall industrial production was 0.4 per cent lower in the latest three months compared with December to February, but unchanged compared with March to May last year. In manufacturing, yesterday's statistics showed a 0.7 per cent increase in consumer-goods output between the two latest three-month periods, while production of investment goods grew 0.2 per cent and output of intermediate goods dropped by 1.1 per cent. The metals, engineering and allied industries, textile and clothing and 'other manufacturing' industries, which include paper and publishing, increased their output by about 1 per cent in the March to May period compared with December to February. Food output was unchanged while drink and tobacco production rose by 1.3 per cent. Chemicals, a strong performer last year, showed a 0.5 per cent drop in output between the two three-month periods. In spite of a fall in production in May, car output between March and May was 7.4 per cent higher than over the previous three months.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Tea but little sympathy for Lamont - Paul Cheeseright hears the views of a group of professional women THE first titter came even before the tea was poured. The chancellor's promise of 'a Budget for recovery' set it off. The first laugh came when he laid the ground for raising the government's borrowing. Incredulity came with the second cup. That was when Mr Lamont began to talk of investment in infrastructure. But the only surprise was his method of providing an income tax break. Seven professional women met in Birmingham to listen to the chancellor. Seven professional women left for home distinctly unimpressed. The cake from the baker tasted better than the offering from London. They felt there was little to enhance the immediate possibility of economic recovery. They were more ambivalent about whether Mr Lamont had produced a vote winner, although they could see him casting seed on the electoral waters. 'It'll be attractive to the marginal voters, it will win them the election,' stated Jo James, consultant anaesthetist at East Birmingham Hospital. Linda Comfort, director of Allied Provincial Securities, asserted the opposite. Madeleine Simms, who runs her own urban regeneration consultancy, said: 'I'm not certain people will be voting with their pockets. They're thinking wider.' 'It's not pushed the Conservatives one way or the other,' said Sandra Nutley, lecturer in public sector management at Aston Business School. Catriona McFadden, public relations manager at Birmingham's Hyatt Regency hotel concluded that people would 'just say 'well, eh?''. 'It will be an easily attackable Budget,' predicted Jane Skinner, chief executive of Birmingham Settlement, a long-established city charity. If Norman Lamont is to be on the end of an offensive from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, suggested Anne Avian, manager of the Sandwell Chamber of Commerce, it will be because 'it's terribly depressing.' None of the women disagreed because, in the West Midlands, the crucially dependent motor industry is suffering, there are few signs of any end to urban poverty and because, in Birmingham and the Black Country, nearly half those in work are on wages designated as low pay by the Low Pay Unit. Ms Skinner noted that the income tax relief 'would be noticeable in a small pay packet', but Ms Simms believed 'it's daft to give it to everybody - we (that is the relatively well-paid) wouldn't notice'. The fact that there was nothing in the Budget to assist with child care or help those caring for the elderly was worrying - as was the absence of measures to encourage training. 'It's a traditional Budget. If you're earning well, there's something in it for you,' said Ms Skinner. Ms Simms added: 'But there's no help to women coming back into the labour force,' while Ms Comfort observed: 'A lot of women will be put off having children this year.' 'I personally didn't want to be made any better off,' said Ms Nutley, expressing what was a general lack of interest in the moves about inheritance tax. Rather the women would have preferred the chancellor to have spent his ingenuity on looking at help for industry and urban social and economic problems. Certainly, said Ms Avian, he had not gone far enough in reducing car tax to 5 per cent. 'It is hardly here or there. The West Midlands car industry will lose 40,000 people this year.' Nor, she added were there any incentives for start-up businesses. Capital raising for small business worried Ms Comfort. 'The venture capital industry will not be prepared to fill the gap left by (the abolition of) the Business Expansion Scheme. It's not interested in the small business end.' 'If you consider the withdrawal of the banks from the inner cities, this means there is an inner city (financing) gap of growing proportions,' chimed in Ms Skinner. Local authorities, of course, have been wrestling with the problems of unpaid poll tax from the inner city areas. Now, with the changes in the uniform business rate Ms Nutley predicted they will have further cashflow headaches. 'Mr Lamont said he would top up the business rate pool, but I'm suspicious - what are the implications for the long term?' she asked, hinting at a further erosion of local authority powers. Against the background of rising unemployment and homelessness, the women felt the chancellor should have done more to stem the tide of repossessions. He should also have allowed local authorities greater freedom to use their capital receipts from council house sales. The women wondered about the sharp rise in the public sector borrowing requirement. Where was it going, they asked, and responded with their own answer - to fund a higher level of unemployment. They could find some good in the smaller elements of the Budget - the administrative changes on VAT, for example. But the only thing they really agreed on was that it made sense to bring the government's spending and income statements together in December 1993. It was scant praise for a putative election-winning Budget.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Ad that had it licked Sir, I find the use of Haagen-Dazs and the Conservative party as comparative advertising campaigns somewhat confusing ('The medium is the message', April 16). The relative merits of high or low budget are surely irrelevant for two such different products. After all, one is popular, high quality, satisfying and leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth, whereas the other is ice cream. George Humphries, 4569 Leavenworth Street, San Francisco CA 94324, US</p>

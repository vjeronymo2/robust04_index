			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S SEDATIVE MAY BE CARCINOGENIC, FDA TOLD  </P> <P> Food and Drug Administration officials said Monday that they were looking into  reports that a drug commonly used to sedate children may cause cancer.  </P> <P> The concerns were raised by California Health Director Kenneth Kizer, who said  that, if carcinogenity is confirmed by an Environmental Protection Agency  study, the FDA should issue a warning.  </P> <P> In a letter to FDA Commissioner David Kessler last week, Kizer said interim  results from the EPA study found cancer in mice that had been given oral  chloral hydrate.  </P> <P> "Interviews with health-care professionals who prescribe, dispense and  administer chloral hydrate, including neonatologists, pediatricians,  pedodontists and hospital pharmacists, indicate that these practitioners are  unaware of the carcinogenic risks of this drug," Kizer wrote.  </P> <P> Kizer sent with his letter brief summaries of more than 20 studies conducted  during the 1970s and 1980s involving chloral hydrate. The findings ranged from  changes in cell development to genetic mutations. In one study, young mice  developed cancer after a single dose.  </P> <P> FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said that the agency had received the letter but  that "at this point we have no comment."  </P> <P> EPA officials conducting the study in Cincinnati, Ohio, had left for the day  and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Chloral hydrate has been sold for many years as a branded and a generic product  for use as a hypnotic and sedative.  </P> <P> It is used by doctors and dentists as a sedative for children to keep them  still for examinations. Also, neonatologists give it to newborns on  ventilators.  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: OSE clamps down on derivatives NEW measures to dilute the impact of trading in Nikkei 225 stock futures and options on the cash stock market were implemented yesterday by the Osaka Securities Exchange, the second largest stock exchange in Japan. Derivatives trading on the OSE has been blamed for the volatility in the cash market. Alarmed authorities, especially those at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which has seen trading commissions plunge due to low volumes, have been pushing for controls on derivatives trading. The move comes at a time when tensions between the OSE and the TSE are mounting. Trading in the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 futures index rose 2.7 times last year, and accounted for 56.2 per cent of the OSE's trading revenue. At the same time, revenue at the TSE plunged as small-lot investors have become intimidated by the price fluctuations claimed to be created by futures-linked arbitrage. Traders said the OSE's move would not affect derivatives trading drastically. The closing time of futures and options trading is being shortened to match the close in stock trading after criticism that speculative futures trading after the stock market closed often affected prices on the following day. New Japan Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, said it would close four domestic branches at the end of March. Market report, Page 29</p>

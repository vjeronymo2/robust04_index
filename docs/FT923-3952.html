			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Sarajevo 'soon out of supplies' FOOD stocks in Sarajevo are dwindling rapidly and the city could run out of supplies by the end of the week, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday. However, UN officials warn that international relief flights to the Bosnian capital, suspended last Thursday after the loss of an Italian transport aircraft, are unlikely to be resumed in the next few days. The UNHCR has stepped up road convoys to Sarajevo from Split in Croatia to offset the airlift suspension. But a shortage of trucks and drivers means the city is receiving only half its daily food needs of 190 tonnes. Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UNHCR, said yesterday that only 100 tonnes of flour and 90 tonnes of rice remained in its Sarajevo warehouses. Ms Foa said 200 trucks were needed to transport the 14,400 tonnes of food a month needed for nearly 1m people in southern and central Bosnia, including the 380,000 residents of Sarajevo. To transport other essential supplies, including shelter materials for the winter, would require 500 trucks and drivers. The UNHCR has fewer than 50 trucks, though more have been promised. Representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina will today give UN officials in Geneva their response to proposals to improve the security of humanitarian flights. These include a ban on military flights, better co-ordination on the ground to ensure relief flights are correctly identified, putting all anti-aircraft weapons under UN supervision and expanding the UN weapons monitoring zone around the airport. However, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia now permanently in session in Geneva, said it was 'probably unrealistic' to assume that the meeting would result in an immediate resumption of the airlift. Any assurances given by the combatants would first have to be weighed by the 19 governments involved in the airlift operation.</p>

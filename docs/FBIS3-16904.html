			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 53/94] </F>   [Text] The economic police is to bring charges of  mismanagement against Director General of the Estonian Radio  Herkki Haldre in the nearest future, Commissar of the economic  police Jaak Hindriksson said. Haldre will be charged with the  waste of state funds. The State Inspection Office accused the  radio management in paying excessive wages and meeting  questionable travel expenses.    The situation is complicated by a legal inadequacy since  there is no legal procedure for dismissing the head of the  radio. The national broadcasting statute stipulates that the  radio is subordinated to the "Presidium of the Supreme Soviet",  a body that no longer exists, while no document determines the  relations of the radio director and the Riigikogu. Chairman of  the parliamentary culture commission Sulev Alajde explained that  the commission may recommend the Riigikogu to approve a new law  on broadcasting and to keep Haldre in office for the time being.    Haldre is currently abroad and the Estonian Radio is headed  by Paul Himma.</p>

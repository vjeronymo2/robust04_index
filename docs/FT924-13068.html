			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Stock-index option expiries help lift Dow Wall Street ALTHOUGH FRESH declines in IBM and Philip Morris depressed US stock markets in the morning, demand related to the afternoon expiration of stock-index options and futures helped share prices end mostly firmer, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 0.27 at 3,174.41, well off its lows for the day when it had been 32 points lower. Secondary indices performed much better, with the more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finishing up 2.12 at 411.72, the Amex composite up 1.70 at 367.33 and the Nasdaq composite up 3.97 at 582.61. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 234m shares. Rises outpaced declines by 945 to 803. The economic fundamentals remained bearish, including an unexpected widening in the trade deficit and a 0.2 per decline in September industrial production, and the market was also troubled by another rise in bond yields. Prices picked up during the afternoon, however, as trading linked to stock-index futures and options expirations had a positive impact on stocks. The story of the day, however, remained the weakness in IBM and Philip Morris which, along with Westinghouse (which also fell sharply), accounted for most of the losses on the Dow. IBM ran into heavy selling from the outset, plunging to new lows for the year as the negative reaction to the company's third quarter performance intensified. By the close IBM had fallen Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 in turnover of 5.6m shares. Philip Morris suffered under a stampede of sellers, dropping Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 77. 1/4 in turnover of 12m shares, although there were signs of buying support when it shares reached Dollars 75 3/8 . The stock has been sold on disappointing news about domestic cigarette sales. Westinghouse was also a feature, falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 11 3/4 in turnover of 5.8m shares on concern that problems at the company's credit unit could continue to affect earnings. Airlines were markedly firmer on hopes that the price war may be coming to an end. Delta rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57 3/4 , UAL put on Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 116 3/4 , and AMR firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 . Cray Research fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 20 on the news that the company plans to cut 65 jobs. On the Nasdaq market, Apple rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 49 in turnover of 4m shares in the wake of a 23 per cent surge in fiscal fourth quarter profits to 81 cents a share. The company also reported strong sales of its PowerBook notebook computers, and announced plans for an aggressive new product release schedule for the coming fiscal year. Everex Systems dropped Dollars  5/16 to Dollars  15/16 after the company estimated it would report a loss of Dollars 35m in the fourth quarter which ended in early August and revealed that it was in violation of some loan agreements. Canada TORONTO stocks finished stronger, buoyed by recoveries in the precious metals and transportation sectors. The TSE 300 climbed 11.56 to 3207.7 on volume of 29.54m shares valued at CDollars 259 million. Advances outstripped declines 274 to 256 with 265 issues unchanged.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Gardening: Bulbs for long-term growth - Tulips offer satisfying returns to the careful investor All year, tulip-growers have been celebrating the 400th anniversary of the tulip's first flowering in Holland; today, we celebrate its birthday with theological correctness as a chapter in the history Mammon Within 40 years of the tulip's first flowering, people were already speculating in it madly. Instead of planting it, they bought tulip-futures, sold them to the next man and left the bother of delivery and gardening to the last mutt in the chain. Perhaps we should reintroduce them for non-gardening readers in the winter. After the market crashed, one great academic could never look a tulip in the face again. So many fortunes had been lost that he would attack the tulips with a stick whenever he passed them. I will be doing the same with dollars, if they carry on down. Meanwhile, non-speculators ought to be planting their tulips during this weekend and the next three. They prefer a sunny, well-drained soil and at least 3 ins of it above the tops of their bulbs. If you plant them up to 9ins deep, they are safe from passing forks and can be left in the ground for years. Nonetheless, many of them will not persist. Deep or shallow, they will flower in the first year, dwindle in the second and disappear in the third. The growers tell us to dig them up each year in late May, bury them lightly in a secondary bed and then pick them over in autumn to eliminate those which have shrunk. These bulblets can then be replanted and grown on for up to three years, like a small business, until they are ready again for public display. I have never had the patience for this routine. Instead, I add a dressing of potash fertiliser and dig it lightly into the surface of the soil after planting. It helps to delay the dwindling. Why do tulips deteriorate? I know three reasons. They miss the rich, silty soil of Holland or Lincolnshire where the sellers grow them. There is nothing we can do about that unless we move to the Netherlands. Alternatively, they may have been eaten by slugs; an expert grower tells me that this problem is much more widespread than other experts realise. Last winter, slugs ate the leaves on all my scillas and I bet they had a go at the tulips. The best defence is deep planting, down to 9ins, below the slug-line. A top dressing of slug killer is worth the effort. The third reason is the most regrettable. Many of the most impressive modern varieties are simply not tough enough for full-size flowering after a year or two in Britain's unimpressive garden soils. I have learned to prefer proven varieties and choose the easier of the wild forms which are much tougher. If you want one persistent hybrid tulip, choose the one which has lasted longest in the lists: pink Clara Butt. She has become less familiar nowadays but she outlasts all others in her class. I also find that the lily-flowered varieties retain their size of flower for many years. I have three proven favourites: the yellow West Point, which is a real winner, the deep satin China Pink, and the tall White Triumphator. So many of the other colours shrink from year to year but if I was speculating for one season I would always choose white Carrara, pink and white striped Marilyn, which looks so stylish in pots, and the lovely lemon yellow Sweet Harmony, which is edged with white. This spring, I saw several gardens where four or five well-chosen varieties had been mixed in a multi-coloured cluster. The effect was fresh, a change from those solemn lines of yellow, then pink which you see in parks or on the mudflats by Dutch windmills. Nurserymen's mixtures include some awful carmines but you can mix a selection for yourself. The best value of all is found in the smaller forms which are closer to the wild. The white tulip which lasts longest is the short Tulip fosteriana Purissima; the most persistent striped form is the plain Water Lily tulip, or kaufmanniana, which is a mixture of ivory yellow and red. Avoid its other forms, seductively named after great musicians, because most of them are not harmonious. Recently, I have learnt to value the lilac and yellow flowers of Tulip bakeri Lilac Wonder, whose flowers open widely in April and have persisted very well in a sharp, sunny soil. You would not expect a wild tulip from central Asia to be reliable in the British midlands but I have also had long life from the lovely soft yellow Tulip batalinii. The nearer you return to the wild, the more stamina you find in many tulips. They grow naturally from Greece to central Asia but it is extraordinary that the ancient Greeks never mentioned them, although they lived with their flowers each spring. They seem to puzzle their successors too. Not long ago, I looked across a Greek olive grove of wild tulips in the company of two great ancient historians who remarked that they never realised that the Greeks imported so many tulips from Holland. Perhaps these non-botanists would prefer tulip-futures instead, but we would have to take away their walking-sticks if they lost bets.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Treading in the vintage - Giles MacDonogh takes off his shoes and socks in the Douro valley Vila Nova de Gaia is the showroom for port wine. It lies opposite Oporto on the south bank of the Douro just before the river debouches into the Atlantic. There the big companies have their lodges and visitors may go on special tours and taste the wines. Port, however, comes from miles away up river, beyond the high Serra do Marao. The mountains have the advantage of keeping out the Atlantic climate which can make Oporto such a cussed, drizzly place. There it is generally hot all summer, resulting in what is called 'Douro bake'; hard on humans, but marvellous for the thick-skinned black grapes destined to be trodden (well, ideally) for port. The Douro is one of the remotest places in modern Europe. In spite of all that has happened in the past century; in spite of the revolution of 1974, the region still has a feudal feel. At the centre of the feudal structure is the quinta: a farm estate planted with vines and occasionally olives. Pretensions to architecture are rare, quinta houses are large, solid, white-washed buildings. Every now and then they are distinguished by a baroque chapel or a few stone dressings around the windows. There live the lords of the Douro. Some are directors of port houses in Vila Nova. In the majority of cases, however, the owners remain independent of the port business, preferring to sell their grapes for the best price. Either way the structure remains the same. Life in the Douro Valley can never have been easy. The soil is thin and stony - suitable only for vines and olives. Even today transport is slow and, occasionally, hazardous. Not so long ago the only way down to Oporto was by river. The limited vocation of Douro agriculture explains the jubilation which surrounds the vintage. The villagers arrive with their friends and relations and pick the grapes. Once the harvest is in the villagers gather around the shallow, stone lagares; there the bunches destined for the very best wines are trodden underfoot. Only a few years ago only port houses such as Taylors continued to tread a percentage of their grapes. Recent studies, however, have shown that footwork is simply the best way to derive the maximum colour and extract in the shortest period of time. This is a vital consideration with port, where the still-fermenting juice must be run off on to brandy after only two or three days in the vat. Treading the grapes in the lagares has another advantage: It gives the villagers the chance to enjoy the harvest in their traditional way. Much of the fun takes place in the vat itself. Arriving at Taylors' Quinta de Vargellas on the last day of this year's vintage, we were taken down to see the locals at work in the lagar. At first glance they seemed rather gloomy. A lugubrious character had taken on the role of sergeant and was drilling his little squad backwards and forwards through a thick mass of grapes. When we returned after dinner the scene had been transformed. Someone had got hold of a synthesiser; a few bottles of rough local brandy had been cracked; and there was dancing in the vat. We jumped in too. It was not easy to dance in a cold, sticky stew of grapes, pips and husks, but the villagers were clearly enjoying it; nor did they seem much inhibited by the presence of the squire and his guests. Within moments we were clamped in the arms of the stout village women. The next day the vintage was over. The occasion was marked by a procession up to the quinta house beaded by one of the prettier of the younger women flanked by a man with an accordion. The woman carried a cross with a bunch of grapes at the centre surrounded by seven red roses. This was presented to Alastair Robertson, of Taylors, to keep as a talisman until the next vintage. It was the cue for the Robertsons to turn the quinta over to a sort of saturnalia: the lords waiting on the villagers: providing them with food and fetching them drink. Once the dancing had stopped, Robertson took his guests on an excursion to the other side of the river. I should have gauged from the look on his face that he intended to surprise us when we docked beside a bar-cum-restaurant called the Cafe Sa da Ribeira. A wild-looking character wearing a greatcoat and the Portuguese flag on his head greeted us at the quay, then followed us to the cafe where a shiny brass plaque informed us that John Major, the British prime minister, had lunched there on August 30 1993. The cafe owner informed us that Major had eaten grilled chicken with chips and drunk a simple white wine. We were all so chuffed at our scoop that no-one remembered to ask who had paid the bill. Nor was it explained to us whether Major was attracted by the remoteness of the Douro Valley or by its surviving feudalism. What was, however, clear, was that he had chosen the wrong year: 1993 was a wash-out, one of the worst in living memory. On the other hand 1994 was a peach and come 1996 Taylors might well to decide to declare a vintage. If that happens I shall like to think that my sore feet played a small part in its success.</p>

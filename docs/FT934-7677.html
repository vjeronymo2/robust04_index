			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (9): In need of the professional touch - Better recognition of portfolio management is the aim of a newly-established institute SWISS banks are estimated to manage about half the world's international portfolio business and European institutions, as a whole, a good deal more. Yet, unlike their American counterparts, Europe's financial circles have been slow to recognise portfolio management and financial analysis as a profession in its own right requiring special skills and qualifications. Most of those now tending other people's money - in banks, pension funds, insurance companies or asset management institutions - have learned what they know on the job. Mr Thierry Lombard, a partner in the private bank of Lombard Odier, and his colleagues in the Fondation Place Financiere in Geneva hope to change all that. In September this year the FPF and the Paris-based European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies (EFFAS) set up the European Institute for Financial Analysis and Portfolio Management, with the aim of promoting high professional standards and qualifications throughout Europe, stimulating research and encouraging the exchange of ideas between the profession and academia. 'The European investment business needs competent professionals,' says Mr Lombard, adding that creation of the institute 'should lead to more efficient and safer investments'. He would like to see something equivalent to the American diploma of Chartered Financial Analyst, widely held in the US and increasingly exported around the world. Mr Lombard, who chairs the FPF, set up two years ago by the Geneva stock exchange to promote Geneva as a financial centre, also hopes that establishment of the institute will strengthen the city's reputation as an international centre for asset management. This forms part of the FPF strategy to find a distinctive role for Geneva when the open-outcry exchange shuts down in 1995 to be replaced by a nationwide electronic bourse system. The city is now home to some 200 financial companies employing 20,000 people, including most of Switzerland's private banks. The institute itself will not train students, but will co-ordinate current efforts and act as a catalyst for new initiatives. Among its first priorities is the establishment of a network of experts to aid EFFAS in designing and improving European-wide standards and qualifications, including the exchange of teaching and examination materials. The institute also plans itself to develop specialised training courses, refresher courses and seminars on new financial developments, such as new derivatives products or the latest portfolio management techniques. In addition, the institute will sponsor publications and conferences, and support exchanges of ideas and information, including the translation of publications for broader distribution. (EFFAS' member societies use 12 different languages.) It has already initiated work on a comprehensive guide for portfolio managers on taxation of investments throughout Europe, which it hopes to publish early next year. One of its most important tasks, says Mr Lombard, will be to improve exchanges between theorists and practitioners, for instance to harness recent academic work on portfolio theory to develop advanced asset management techniques. 'If we managed only to halve the gap between academic research and professional techniques, that would be a very high achievement,' he says. For the time being, the institute is staffed by one part-time director, Mr Philippe Sormani, and a full-time assistant. The work will be done mostly by members of the institute's founding organisations, the FPF and EFFAS, or by outside professionals and academics. The FPF has given the institute a cash primer of SFr1.3m, apart from which its activities are required to be broadly self-supporting. Training of European financial analysts and portfolio managers has already made rapid progress over the past few years under the auspices of EFFAS, which has member societies in 17 European countries covering 10,000 professionals. In 1986 EFFAS established a training and qualification committee to lay down qualification standards that could be recognised across Europe. In 1990 it set up an accreditation board to certify the national courses being offered. The emphasis has been on post-graduate training leading to an advanced diploma qualification. Switzerland and Britain were the first to be accredited by EFFAS; they have since been followed by the Netherlands, France, Norway and Austria between them turning out about 500 newly qualified students a year. Mr Lombard thinks it will soon be standard practice to require qualifications for new entrants to portfolio management, and to enrol existing staff on refresher courses. 'Given the speed at which financial activities are evolving, financial professionals - like doctors - need to master the new developments in new products or new market regulations', he says. Companies will see a competitive advantage in better qualified staff. At the same time, he does not believe more universal qualifications will make competition any less intense. 'There is a world of difference between acquiring the basic language and knowing how to use it skilfully', he says. 'But you need the first to learn the second.'</p>

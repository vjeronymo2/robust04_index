			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Shaham: "For Our Future, Not Under </F> Pressure"]    [Text] Begin knew how to say it in Latin: Agreements must  be honored. When this maxim is rephrased in a different form by  the present prime minister it makes one nervous. And not only  because, as a learned colleague noted here last week, he has  already stated that: "no date (in the agreement) is holy," and  whoever starts out on that tack would be forced to agree that no  paragraph in the agreement is holy, but because of something  much more important--something connected with a basic  understanding of what an agreement is.    First of all, a basic principle in any agreement is that the  parties to an agreement can agree to nullify all its obligations  or add to them. There is no restriction in any agreement on  coming to an additional agreement. Beyond that, what must be  honored in an agreement is the obligation that you take upon  yourself. You can cancel your obligation only if the other side  agrees. But you can always add an obligation that you did not  take upon yourself in the agreement or nullify a right that you  have. It is only necessary that the other side not see injury to  itself in the additional obligation that you take upon yourself.    Instead of talking theory, let us take a simple example: You  agreed to sell an apartment. The agreement says you will hand it  over empty. For some reason you decide to leave the air  conditioner and the gas range. Have you broken the agreement?  No. You are not required to leave the air conditioner and the  gas range, you simply may do so. On condition that the purchaser  does not object.    Let us consider some examples. Let us talk about Hebron and  the settlements, and about Rabin. The agreement says that the  settlements will remain in place until the end of the transition  period. The Palestinians are obligated not to demand their  removal before the end of this period. But is it an obligation  on the part of Rabin not to remove any settlements? Of course  not. Rabin can dismantle any settlement he wants. True, the  Palestinians, perhaps, cannot demand it (i.e., they can always  make demands but are not entitled to have them fulfilled), but  the prime minister can decide to move them for his own reasons.  And if Rabin wants to move them and thinks it important to do  so--he should not say there is an agreement and he cannot move  them.    One more bit of advice for Rabin: Do not say you have to  move  the Jews from Hebron because it is impossible to protect them.  That is not true. It is possible to surround them with a tank  battalion 24 hours a day and send select vehicle patrols between  the tanks. It is possible, but is it worthwhile? Does this  presence justify the price? Is it justified?    After all, Rabin himself called the settlement in the heart  of Hebron "stupid" and said it is a "time bomb." Even before the  elections he dared to say that many other settlements were  "political." So, stupid things should be abolished. The time  bomb must be dismantled on time. The settlement that was set up  for political reasons can be moved for political reasons. There  is no need to be confused by the crocodile tears of those who  cry "transfer" and their demagogy. Transfer is when you take a  people and send them out of their land to a foreign country. A  political decision about Jews who were settled in the heart of  Hebron for political reasons (the chief reason among them--to  prevent any possibility of peace based on territorial  compromise) being moved to another place, a place within their  own homeland, is not transfer. It is simply the correction of a  political mistake, the correction of a stupid act, the  dismantling of the time bomb.    Returning the Jews from the center of Hebron to somewhere  else in Israel is not a violation of the agreement with the  Palestinians. Do the Palestinians object to such a measure? If  not, it is consonant with the agreement. True, Rabin is not  obligated to the Palestinians to do it, but he is obligated to  us; to use an expression with a little more pathos--to the  future of our children and grandchildren.    So enough talk about the moving of Jews from the center of  Hebron being contrary to the agreement. Gad Ya'aqobi also should  not say it abroad where they simply laugh at him. Rabin has to  do it now, not within the framework of negotiations with the  Palestinians, as a concession under pressure (by doing so we can  teach them that what is not accomplished by force is stronger),  but by an independent sovereign decision of an independent  sovereign state. Not because the Palestinians demand it, but  because it is good for the Jews.</p>

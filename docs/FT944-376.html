			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US dollar/Yen The US dollar's long-term depreciation against the yen appears to have stopped - at least for the moment. Most indicators are supporting the dollar. In spite of the 15 per cent year on year increase in Japan's current account surplus during November, the underlying trend remains downward. For the first 11 months this year, the politically contentious surplus fell nearly 10 per cent in yen terms and 1.9 per cent in dollar terms. Interest rate differentials are also moving in the dollar's favour; as long as Japanese interest rates remain at their historic lows, and the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy, the US currency should become increasingly appealing. The only thing limiting an immediate dollar rally is the continuing reluctance of Japanese investors to buy dollar-denominated assets. Japanese institutions discovered to their cost this year that the marginal benefit offered by real US interest rates can be destroyed in a single day through adverse currency movements. They need to be substantially compensated for the risk by more than a couple of percentage points. Unless the US interest rate cycle peaks at a higher level than the consensus, the Japanese may continue to be reluctant to invest in the US. That reluctance could significantly limit any appreciation of the dollar early next year. Any respite for the US currency is likely in any case to be temporary. While the interest rate cycle may support the dollar in the short term, the yen's long-term appreciation remains assured. Japan's inflation record is far superior to that in the US. The country's ability to improve productivity should ensure the trade surplus does not shrink excessively; and with Japan's overseas investment income forecast to reach Dollars 1,000bn a year by the end of the decade, the current account surplus's continued growth is assured. The dollar may briefly appreciate this year, but it is not out of the woods.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: British Steel to spend Pounds 97m on US mini-mill British Steel yesterday announced its biggest single investment project for four years with a plan to spend Pounds 97m building a 1m-ton-a-year plate mini-mill at Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary. The plan, which has been under consideration for several months, is the strongest evidence yet of British Steel's more expansionist investment policy after years of restricted spending during the recession. It will also mark the first time the company has made steel in a wholly-owned overseas plant. Tuscaloosa is currently a rolling mill, using slabs of steel - the raw material for plates - supplied mainly from Teesside and Port Talbot. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the expansion was designed to create an internationally competitive mini-mill to produce quality plate in coil and cut-length form. 'Tuscaloosa's objective is to become the most cost-effective supplier in the US plate market, and this investment is an important step forward in British Steel's overseas expansion plans,' he said. Tuscaloosa produces about 500,000 tons a year of steel plate, with annual sales of about Dollars 190m (Pounds 120.2m). Employment will rise from 290 to about 420 when the expanded plant starts operating in late 1996. The expansion will allow Tuscaloosa to produce wider, thicker plate, serving a broader range of applications. Industry experts praised the move. Dr Rod Beddows, chairman of Beddows &amp; Co, the international consultancy, said it was potentially profitable. The mini-mill would be able to offer a higher-quality, lower-cost product than conventionally produced plate. Tuscaloosa uses 250,000 tons of slabs a year. British Steel said there were no job implications for UK steelworks from the future loss of business.</p>

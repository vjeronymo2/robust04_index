			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "A Silent Commemoration"] </F>   [Text] Mate Boban has gone, but the Declaration of the  Chamber of Representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  has not announced any significant changes in the Herzegovinian  view of the uncertain future of all the Bosnian Croats. Both  Zagreb and Livno have thus stopped for a step, in the attempt to  give a political answer to the impossible question of "the  chicken or the egg," and thus sacrificed only what a great part  of the world and a significant number of Croats, both in Bosnia  and in Croatia, have labeled a rotten egg that could stink up  the entire basket. Mate Boban has gone, Karadzic is still  firmly in the saddle, and Alija Izetbegovic has not yet been  significantly threatened by Fikret Abdic's rebellion, so it was  only the Croats (read: the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community])  who roamed around and lost their way among the idealist Stjepan  Kljujic, the trouble-making Ivo Perinovic, and the extreme Mate  Boban, in which the curve kept jumping and trembling between  impotence and stupidity. Thus Mate Granic, whose feet Mate  Boban was constantly under, like a tongue-tied sidekick (because  he does not know a word of English), has finally had to appear  in Livno in the role of an elegant executor who, in the  long-awaited scene, paraphrases the famous Shakespeare verses:  "He was an honorable man, but...."    What can Mile Akmadzic, who for months had been prepared for  the role of heir apparent, do now? The international media,  which can sometimes expose things to the bone, claim that Mate  Boban was very useful when the Croat defense had to be organized  during the conflict with the Serbs, but very harmful when he  became involved in the war with the Muslims, which has brought  Croatia before the wall of international sanctions. Those who  have met him privately claim that he even secretly admired the  Serbs, while he never gave an inch to the Muslims, something  literary connoisseurs had discovered as early as in Boban's  attack on cardinal Franjo Kuharic, in which he used a literary  example from which it follows that the killing of a Turk is not  a thing for which an honorable man should go to confession. It  was most probably the conflict with the friars, with Kaptol [the  Zagreb see], and the Vatican, which can not agree with such  views, that encouraged many Bosnian Croats from Bosanska  Posavina, Sarajevo, and central Bosnia to conclude they should  finally get organized and found associations, assemblies, and  political bodies that would reject Mate Boban and dispute  "Herceg-Bosna."    The grief-stricken session in Livno, at which even Vice  Vukojevic [HDZ representative in Croatian Parliament, military  official in Herceg-Bosna] and Ivan Aralica [Croatian writer, HDZ  representative in Croatian parliament] had to hear Drazen Budisa  out [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party], moved  between political self-defense and a silent commemoration, and  one could guess what the matter was about only from between the  lines. "When a Muslim in Livno or a Serb in Mostar have the same  rights as the Croats, then Herceg-Bosna will be a truly  democratic state," said Boban's former protector Gojko Susak  [Croatian defense minister], while Boban's successor Mile  Akmadzic gloomily concluded: "The Church is our mother, and a  mother's hand is the same when it scolds as when it caresses."  Playing the role of the innocent who does not even know why he  is being charged, Mate Boban made public the tragic list of  Croat victims, Croat losses, Croat defeats, and Croat  misfortunes, and in doing so he never once asked if the policy  that was befallen by this entire encyclopedia of suffering could  at all be proclaimed successful and the only possible one.    Boban is leaving, but the "Declaration" stays, confirming  that people are replaceable, but the spirit remains. It  promises the continuation of the irreconcilable war over Mostar,  which has been proclaimed "the capital city of a sovereign  state-forming people" and "an indivisible entity," as if Mostar  has not become Vukovar already, as if before the war there were  not Croats, Muslims, and Serbs in the city, as if it had not  been decided in principle that it should be placed under  international management, as if the State Department has not  announced that the "Croat cleansing" of Mostar was what caused  the Croat-Muslim conflicts. The nontransience of cultural  monuments was also suddenly discovered, while no one knows if  the investigation against the "three members of a tank crew"  that destroyed the Old Bridge has moved from a standstill.  (Izetbegovic is even shooting his bandits.) The international  court for war crimes and the protection of humanitarian convoys  are supported, while no one accepts responsibility for what has  happened so far. "Everything that happened were only  consequences," says Boban, "and the consequence is always less  punishable than the act in the cause."    This way of thinking is what has led to his final downfall.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / How to lead the world without becoming its policeman: The US dilemma in a new world order THE FALL of the Berlin Wall may have ushered in a 'new world order', but the international community has not yet worked out how to meet its challenges. For the US these are principally to do with when and how the world's only remaining superpower should use its military might around the world. Academics, diplomats and lawyers have been preoccupied by the issue since the end of the cold war removed some of the certainties from international relationships. With US troops now patrolling Mogadishu, and with the suffering people of Sarajevo on US television screens every day, it is an issue that is also engaging public opinion. President George Bush will have disappointed those who were looking to his farewell speech at the West Point military academy on Tuesday for a cogent articulation of his 'new world order'. Arguing that the US must be the world's leader, but not its policeman, he said the relative importance of America's interests could not determine when military force should be used, and warned that there could be no easy formula for making this determination. 'Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in for disappointment. In the complex new world we are entering, there can be no single or simple set of fixed rules for using force.' General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agrees. 'Having a fixed set of rules for how you will go to war is like saying you are always going to use the elevator in the event of fire in your apartment building,' he wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs. Few, in fact, argue for such a set of conditions to be rigorously met before US military forces should be engaged - although some right-wing intellectuals, such as Mr Andrew Cowin of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, warn ferociously against letting the United Nations lure the US into 'military entanglements where Americans have no interests at stake'. Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary under President Ronald Reagan, spelt out in 1984 a set of six tests for the use of military force: The occasion must be vital to US interests. There must be a 'clear intention of winning'. Political and military objectives must be clearly defined. The operation must be continually reassessed and adjusted. Popular and congressional support must be assured. Force must be a last resort. But Mr Weinberger himself says he never used the tests as an inflexible checklist. 'I didn't start with a pad of paper and check them off one after another, but I certainly referred to them,' he says. Today, when conflicts inviting possible US intervention are likely to be regional in nature or even intra-state, the decision may be more blurred. The decades-long struggle against the Soviet Union provided the US with an invitation to virtually any conflict around the world, because of its interest in combating communism wherever it arose; but it also provided a curb, because of the threat that any local conflict could escalate into a more global war. Neither Somalia nor Bosnia, however, would pass all of Mr Weinberger's tests without argument, although he favours intervention in both cases, and argues for a general US interest in making it clear that aggression will not go unpunished. Nor does either case, or the protective zone established in Iraqi Kurdistan, fit easily into the framework of international legal opinion  - principally based on the UN charter - whose balance between the competing claims of national sovereignty and human suffering has been gradually shifting. Mr Richard Gardner, formerly a senior US diplomat and now professor of international law at Columbia Law School in New York, notes that few international lawyers would assert a unilateral right to intervene militarily in another country to correct human rights abuses. 'The Security Council is more likely than it was before to deal with mass repression when it can reasonably find a threat to 'international peace and security'. . . .What the members of the Security Council will not do is authorise military intervention in a country on human rights grounds alone,' he writes in a recent paper for the Institute for Strategic Studies. China, but also India and some African and Latin American countries - and, for that matter, the UK - are particularly sensitive about setting precedents for outside interference in their domestic affairs on human rights grounds. Some lawyers and diplomats, however, are looking for a framework that would authorise swifter and more pre-emptive action. Even where the political will and legal justification for intervention exist, US military leaders, with the lessons of the Vietnam war reinforced in their minds by the bombing of the US Marines barracks in Beirut, remain chary of commiting their troops in any conflict where they cannot be assured of a quick and crushing victory - as they were in the Gulf war. The Pentagon's doubts about the wisdom of committing ground troops to Bosnia have been shared by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of state. 'It's again what got us into Vietnam. You do a little bit and it doesn't work . . . what do you do next?' he said last year. But Mr Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives armed services committee and Mr Clinton's nominee to be secretary of defence, argues that the balance has tilted against this 'all or nothing' school. This shift has come, he says, because the collapse of the Soviet Union has 'removed some of the pressure for escalation that accompanies any limited military venture', but also because technological advances have made possible effective air strikes with little loss of life either on the US side or among the enemy's civilian population. But Gen Powell says that 'when the 'surgery' is over and the desired result is not obtained, a new set of experts then comes forward with talk of just a little escalation'. Military officers also warn that without forces on the ground to verify strikes you run the risk that a bombed weapons factory can be transformed into a children's hospital before the first television camera has arrived. But the Pentagon has been hoist by its own petard: after letting the public believe during Operation Desert Storm that they could drop a smart bomb down a chimney pipe or make a cruise missile turn right at the traffic lights, the generals are not believed when they say they cannot be sure to hit a mortar battery on a Bosnian hillside. Mr Aspin cautions that, with the decline of the Soviet threat, US public opinion may not tolerate paying Dollars 250bn or even Dollars 200bn a year for a military that is not very useful. 'It may be that to maintain a military for the extreme contingencies, it will be necessary to show that it is useful in lesser contingencies,' he says. But US public opinion will also depend on the success or failure of military intervention in Somalia and, perhaps in the months to come, in Bosnia; if either turns into a Vietnam or a Beirut it would do more to shape America's will to exert its might around the world than any presidential speech.</p>

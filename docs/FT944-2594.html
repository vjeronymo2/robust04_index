			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Kenyan action on bank theft A former senior civil servant in Kenya has been charged with conspiring to steal Ks5.76bn (Pounds 82m) from the central bank in a move timed to reassure a donors' meeting in Paris of the government's commitment to stamp out corruption. Mr Wilfred Koinange, the powerful permanent secretary at the treasury until his retirement in May, is the most senior government official to be charged in connection with a series of financial scandals which robbed the Exchequer of over Ks30bn last year - the biggest embezzlement of public funds in Kenya's history. Mr Koinange denied the prosecution charges and has been remanded in custody until his bail application is heard next week. The International Monetary Fund is understood to have warned President Daniel arap Moi that it would not sign a new loan agreement unless his government took firm steps to bring wrongdoers to justice. Without the IMF's seal of approval, neither the World Bank nor bilateral donors would be likely to pledge more aid at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris today. Kenya is seeking up to Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m) in aid for 1995.</p>

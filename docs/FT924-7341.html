			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Chill wind of change at Mirror - Raymond Snoddy on the Maxwell culture's decline NEWSPAPER editors live by the sword and usually die the same way. A dip in circulation, a new proprietor or chief executive with different ideas is usually enough to swell the ranks of former national newspaper editors. The abrupt removal of Mr Richard Stott, the editor of the Daily Mirror as his replacement Mr David Banks was flying in from Sydney, where he had edited the Telegraph Mirror - has much wider significance. It is the latest and most dramatic example of a revolution at Mirror Group Newspapers. The revolution is designed to purge those allegedly tainted by 'the Maxwell culture' - though many people remain from the Maxwell era - and cut costs and push up profits. The impetus for change has come from the group of banks that effectively own 54 per cent of MGN, held as collateral for loans made to the private Maxwell interests now in administration. The banks have been persuaded that greater savings are possible and that editorial costs at the left-of-centre popular newspaper group have survived in their pre-Wapping purity. The late Robert Maxwell, the argument goes, sorted out the printers with consummate toughness but was soft on editorial because he believed he was a journalist too. Mr Banks stressed the importance of 'commercial dynamism ' as he took over his new paper and there was an immediate ban on casual shifts. MGN executives say several hundred casual shifts a week are worked. In future the paper will be brought out largely by its staff journalists. Ironically, the process of change almost certainly stemmed from a consortium being put together by Hambros Bank to bid for MGN, a consortium that never actually got anywhere. The consortium included Mr David Montgomery, now chief executive of MGN, and Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and chief executive of MAI the media and financial services group and a non-executive at the Mirror. Mr Montgomery has been talking to Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman, for months and shadowing everything the group did. The banks want to give themselves the widest range of options to either sell out at a later stage to a single buyer, or sell their stake in tranches to institutions. Last month MGN announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m for the six months to end-June. Popular newspaper sales have been soft and in the depths of a recession, MGN is believed to be Pounds 1m behind budget. Some bankers are already anticipating a period - sometime in 1994 - when the shares could 'suddenly start to motor.' After new printing plants are successfully installed at the Scottish Daily Record and Evening Mail, group debt will fall dramatically and cash flow increase. At present the Scottish titles have to turn away advertising during busy times of the year because they are limited to 48 pages. 'He (David Montgomery) is doing exactly what needs to be done,' said Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson. Mr Terrington believes the share price could reach 130p by the end of next year, ahead of the original Maxwell offer price of 125p. The analyst believes the banks will wait until the share price is between 125p and 150p before they get out. Some banks may not want to wait so long. Daily Mirror journalists take a more apocalyptic view of the changes, saying yesterday they amounted to 'the beginning of the end of the Daily Mirror as we knew it.' Although assurances have been given that the Daily Mirror will continue to try to help the election of a Labour Government, some of the old guard fear an element of idealism will inevitably be lost. Lord Hollick said yesterday any fears that the Daily Mirror's support for the Labour Party would be diminished were totally misplaced. 'The task now is to have a strong and highly successful newspaper which supports the Labour Party and which can be independently owned,' Lord Hollick said.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 8 April carries in its  regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the continued  fighting in the republic.    Correspondent Sead Custovic from the 1st Corps Information  Service, says that "by [word indistinct] shelling the urban  areas of Sarajevo the Chetniks have only added to the long list  of violations of the cease-fire agreed upon in this area some  (?50) days ago. The population of Kosevo, Kosevsko Brdo, Breka,  Pionirska Dolina, and Blekin Potok had a sleepless night as  Tromblon grenades and rockets from portable launchers showered  these districts. It was a return to the grimmest days of the  war and confirmed that Karadzic's rabble -- who have violated  every single peace agreement -- do indeed belong in the hall of  fame of criminals. The everyday provocations from all types of  weaponry, which often result in the wounding of citizens,  clearly indicates what the aims and desires of the (?aggressor)  are. The anemic reactions of the UN Protection Force in the  face of civilian casualties and the shelling of residential  areas encourages the aggressor to increase and intensify his  activities and expand his arsenal. The cease-fire agreement  reached yesterday has not deterred the criminals' artillery and  snipers, who are doggedly beating a path straight to the  international Court of Justice in The Hague. The morning is  deceptively calm, and that is why caution should be exercised  when moving around the city."    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "in the  course of the alleged cease-fire between us and the aggressor  side, the Chetniks have continued their bloody march toward the  encircled Gorazde. They have never before perpetrated such  fierce and deadly attacks on the innocent population and  refugees. The result of this rampage is five killed and nine  gravely wounded people. Therefore, Gorazde is paying an  extremely high price for its number one spot on the  international media listings. In addition to the chemical  agents used yesterday in the village of Vitkovici, the Chetniks  also attempted to break through the defense lines in several  places with combined artillery and infantry attacks. The  situation was also extremely grave overnight on the right bank  of the Drina River. From Nisan to Uhodici [words indistinct]  heavy Chetnik artillery. The aggressor also attempted to  infiltrate a terrorist group [passage indistinct], taking out  their fury on (?local) women and old people. This was  particularly pronounced in Ogleceva and in the villages of  Zamedjedi, Gojcevici, and Surovik situated in the wider region  of Ustipraca. The population of these villages is fleeing in  panic toward the town."    Reporting from Bihac, correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says  that  "[words indistinct] in the Bihac commune, where the victims  continue to be mostly civilians. In the past 24 hours, six  people have been killed, while 33 were slightly or severely  wounded. Karadzic's terrorists continued to destroy buildings  and communication links in Bihac and the Cazin outskirts. The  intensity of the [Serb] attacks abated somewhat overnight, but  the paramilitary forces of the so-called Kladusa autonomy  intensified their attacks on all the demarcation lines.  Artillery and infantry attacks were carried out in and around  Krivaja and Gajici in the Cazin commune, and [name indistinct]  in the Velika Kladusa commune. After midnight, the areas of  (?Kosovo) and (?Pecingrad) were relentlessly shelled."    An unidentified correspondent from the 4th Corps Press  Center  reports that "the main characteristic of the day [7 April] in  the 4th Corps' theater of operations [in the Mostar area] was  the mutual observance of the cease-fire between the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on all  fronts. However, the forces of the Serbian aggressor were active  in Sector North. The past 24 hours on the defense lines of the  Bosnia- Herzegovina Army and in residential areas in regions in  and around (?Zdjelinic) and Glavaticevo were marked by Chetnik  small arms' and antiaircraft machine gun provocations. The  evacuation of bodies of the HVO and Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did  not go ahead as planned, but was postponed for today [8 April]  at 1500. The announced visit of General Rose to the 4th Corps  has also been postponed, most probably owing to the critical  situation and the continuing Serb aggression on Gorazde."</p>

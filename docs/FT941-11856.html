			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Arts: A composer who takes his time - The latest work by Pierre Boulez For Pierre Boulez, composition has in recent years meant as much re-composition as brand-new invention. The few works issuing from this most fastidious of musical pens have all been premiered in a form best described as provisional - either admittedly incomplete, or else with an attached health warning to the effect that further elaborations of the same material should be expected in the future. There have been two principal ways of viewing this process of slowed-up creation, in an artist who in his younger days seemed the unstoppable figure of French music: avant-garde iconoclast and prime minister all in one. The first is that it stood for a creative impasse - which, along with his development into one of the world's most sought-after conductors and his foundation in 1974 of IRCAM (the Paris Beaubourg electro-acoustic laboratory), Boulez was, with his endless compositional self-examination, attempting to circumvent. The second is that it marked for him a way of freeing himself from that very impasse, itself the product of the avant-garde doctrines, dogmas and prohibitions of the early postwar years - all self-generated - that had threatened to land him in a creative dead end. It would no doubt be highly improper to use the account of . . . explosante/fixe . . . which this week the Ensemble InterContemporain gave at the Paris Chatelet - in a form announced as 'derniere' - to produce a final verdict on the cas Boulez. The temptation is strong, all the same, for the impact of the music, exquisite, effervescent, and wonderfully beautiful, was not to be related to any artistic cul-de-sac. A necessarily simplified history of what is now 30 minutes and three movements long is in order. The work started life, in 1972, as one of the tributes to the recently-dead Stravinsky published in Tempo - a page of instrumental solo-parts which could be put together in various ways. Initially, Boulez fixed a version for three wind-instruments; soon he put together longer ones, more fully scored, and electronic means began to enter into the scheme. A chain of small pieces composed in the 1980s has now been connected up to the earlier. . . explosante/fixe . . . material: Memoriale for flute and small ensemble, Anthemes for solo violin, a piece for vibraphone written for the 80th birthday of the conductor Paul Sacher. The basic original idea was that 'explosions' of musical matter, such as the work's 'signature' of fast-skittering flute above a chattery ensemble, are pinned into shape by variation-forms within a fixed compass of notes. Now that the final linkage has been achieved, the artistic seemliness of the conception can be heard and felt to filter through the whole format. An exotic, weightlessly sensuous character - which pairs this 'late' Boulez with an early work like Le Soleil des eaux - shines equally through the Messiaen-like melodic unisons, with their flicks of oriental decoration, and the witty spurts of catch-as-catch-can between groups. The electronic element, whose sudden enlargements of perspective arrive with extraordinary subtlety, underpins the basic conceptual contrast. The finale, based on Memoriale, slows for reflection the previous propulsive outpouring. In sum, the final version of . . . explosante/fixe . . . represents the fruition of a patiently explored idea making nonsense of any notion of Boulezian sterility: in the most flattering Mae West sense, this is a composer who takes his time] Boulez the conductor, taken ill shortly before the concert, ceded the baton to the excellent David Robertson, the Ensemble's musical director. The London South Bank Centre aims to programme the piece in next year's planned electronic weekend; a long time to wait] I hope those plans also include a slot for the work filling the first half of this Chatelet concert - La Partition du ciel et de l'enfer ('The Score of Heaven and Hell') by Philippe Manoury (b. 1952), a 45-minute voyage between precisely depicted spheres symbolising Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto. In a manner very different from Boulez's - bolder in gesture, more grandiose in instrumental groupings - this piece demonstrated again the best aspect of IRCAM-devised electronics. Indeed, the textural sheen, wide range and sophisticated delicacy of Manoury's musical imagination proved light-years distant from the plink-plonk sounds which too many ordinary music-lovers still associate with the domain of Electronic Music.</p>

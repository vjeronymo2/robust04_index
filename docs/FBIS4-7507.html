			<p>BFN     [Text] The signing of the agreement and the promulgation of  the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina are  already yielding good results in the Zepce Commune. After the  cooperation in the field between the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] was established and  (?two-day) mutual visits of civilian population made possible,  the HVO concentration camp in Zepce was closed yesterday. Under  the auspices of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Sector  Command in the region, the HVO Command released all the  remaining prisoners, members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  who then freely decided to travel to free territories or to  remain in Zepce with their families.</p>

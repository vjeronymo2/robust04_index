			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / IFC calls for trebling of sub-Saharan investment A TREBLING of private investment is required in sub-Saharan Africa if the region is to achieve long-term economic recovery, Mr William Ryrie, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said in London this week. Mr Ryrie, speaking at a conference chaired by Mr Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank, said achieving the target figure of 15 per cent of GDP was 'doubtful at best'. 'In most countries, even with the best will and the best policies, it will probably be the first decade of the 21st century before we begin to see real results - that is to say steadily rising private investment, sustained higher rates of growth and job creation', he added. Mr Ryrie said the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, was investing approximately Dollars 200m a year in about 35 companies in sub-Saharan Africa. He estimated that projects in which the IFC had recently participated accounted for around 10 per cent of total private investment, domestic and foreign, in the region. Much of the IFC finance has gone into a few large investments, he acknowledged. 'What is lacking is a flow of medium-sized investments in manufacturing businesses,' Mr Ryrie said. He said private investment in sub-Saharan Africa has been running at about Dollars 8bn a year, with foreign private investment contributing less than Dollars 1bn a year. Net official development assistance to the region between 1980-89 had been Dollars 105bn, or about Dollars 30 per capita each year. He said the flow of aid had 'no parallel in history' but standards of living had continued to fall.</p>

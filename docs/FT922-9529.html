			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (8): Struggle to stay at the top - The problems of Swissair SWISSAIR may be a widely admired airline, but as a shareholder-owned company based in a small country, it has a struggle on its hands to keep pace with the giant groups taking shape in its industry. Last year, in common with most international airlines, the group suffered from a substantial slump in traffic. Total passengers carried were down 8.2 per cent to 7.9m and cargo volume eased 3.3 per cent to 271,000 tonnes. However, thanks to cost-cutting and more than normal aircraft sales, the group was able to show a substantial gain in net profit from SFr48m in 1990 to SFr83m last year. Still, as Mr Armin Baltensweiler, the retiring chairman said, this was 'not a brilliant result by any means', with return on equity a dismal 3 per cent. On the other hand, the group has a relatively strong financial position for an airline, with debts of SFr5.3bn supported by SFr2.8bn of shareholders' equity, and its fleet of 60 aircraft has an average age of only six years. Swissair's major problem is that it has a small national customer base. This makes it hard for it to muster enough passengers to fill the non-stop flights that customers demand these days. New medium capacity aircraft with long-haul capability, such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, have helped the group remain competitive, but its main strategy for dealing with this problem has been to form pacts with other airlines. Late in 1989, it formed one with Delta Airlines of the US and Singapore Airlines for long-haul routes. In May 1990, it formed another with Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines, called the European Quality Alliance. The idea was that the airlines would share facilities and route management and exchange strategic share- holdings, but they have found that working together is easier in good times than in a recession. 'Alliances are not enforceable,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, says wryly. 'And when things are bad, a company's first thoughts are for its own problems.' There were, for example, plans for SAS and Swissair to combine forces on aircraft purchases, but they have been scuttled because of SAS's financial problems. Similarly, the depressed state of the shares of both companies has delayed a planned share swap. Swissair's role as the distribution and collection point for Delta in Europe was undermined when Delta acquired Pan American's European routes. However, that does not mean the alliances have failed. Mr Muller claims the co-ordination of Swissair and SAS schedules has contributed to a big increase in Swissair's business from Scandinavia to and from Africa. SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines have set up a jointly operated station in Vilnius, thus saving costs. Also, Swissair has won a contract to service Delta's 21 Airbuses, 'our most important maintenance contract in 10 years,' Mr Muller says. Swissair's other big headache is a political one. The airline is terrified about being left out in the cold when EC-wide air transport policies are made. 'If Switzerland remains isol- ated from the rest of Europe, our ability to compete will be further handicapped,' Mr Otto Loepfe, the airline's president, said last month. 'Swiss integration in Europe is a matter of survival,' he added. Most other Swiss companies have already insulated themselves against the possibility that Switzerland will not join the EC by setting up subsidiaries and factories within EC countries. However, Swissair cannot do this, because EC transport policy requires that EC airlines be owned and controlled by EC nationals. The country will hold a referendum later this year on the plan to build new tunnels through the Alps. This is a vital element of the Alpine transit treaty negotiated last year with Brussels. Also in the treaty is a provision for bilateral air transport negotiations. Swissair desperately hopes the treaty will be approved by the Swiss people. 'We are telling all our employees to be sure to vote and to get their families to vote too,' Mr Muller says. 'It is not a matter of politics; it is a matter of jobs.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Eyquem's Turbine Ignition Shows </F> that French Ideas Are Exportable"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] Eyquem has just sold its patent for thyristor  ignition to Lucas, a move that may help it penetrate the very  closed market of American enginemakers. Here are the details of  its innovation.    The French may not have oil, but they have ideas. This  fashionable 1970s slogan fits Eyquem to a tee. The  company--better known among the general public for its  automobile spark plugs--also has an aeronautics division, which  supplies complete systems (ignition devices and spark plugs) to  all of France's engine manufacturers.    As the first company to devise and patent a wholly  electronic  ignition system for turbines, Eyquem might have hoped that its  technological breakthrough would earn it a toehold in the  American engine manufacturer market. But that would be  underestimating the conservatism (and sometimes implicit  protectionism as well) of a profession that stands on its  traditions. Especially as the massive arrival of new standards  such as the ETOPS norms works in favor of already installed  equipment. Indeed, ETOPS standards, which seek to authorize the  operation from any alternate airport of passenger twinjets for  120 to 180 flight minutes over the ocean, force manufacturers to  prove the reliability of their engines and components. This is  always easier to do on the basis of flight sheets than the  promises of new technologies, even if the innovations have been  designed to be more robust.    At the heart of Eyquem's patent is the notion of replacing  traditional discharger tubes with one or more thyristors. Such a  solution is likely to become the only possible one as discharger  tubes gradually disappear from component catalogs for lack of  applications. As a consequence, the French patent interests many  people, starting with Lucas Aerospace, whose "Switchgear and  Ignition" division decided to purchase a North American license  from Eyquem a few weeks ago. The acquisition gives Eyquem's  technology a real chance to penetrate Pratt &amp; Whitney-Canada  and  Allison engines, which Lucas supplies.    Strictly speaking, the French patent's claim does not  concern  the use of thyristors as a switch component, but rather a  particular way of using them in ignition systems subjected to  the harsh environment of engines. Engines commonly reach  temperatures of 100C, making it impossible to cool  thyristors using classic radiators. And in the first experiments  conducted in Eyquem's laboratories in the mid-1980s, thyristors  lasted no more than one or two hours.    After countless laboratory experiments and simulations,  Eyquem engineers made the paradoxical discovery that it was not  so much during the first few microseconds of the discharge (and  thus the spark in the plug) that the thyristor suffered. Rather,  damage was more apt to occur during the off phase, when the  condensor that stores the energy needed for the spark charges  itself. In fact, during the condensor's charge period, voltage  at the thyristor's terminals gradually climbs to 2 or 3 kV,  generating a roughly proportional leakage current. The whole  process results in an escalation of heat in the component, which  released early.    Since thyristors seemed well suited to very short discharges  but not slow charges, Eyquem engineers came up with the idea of  electronically controlling the condensor's charge cycle to keep  it as short as possible. The solution has since been laboratory  tested at 125C for 7,000 hours without any observable  thyristor failure, and patented. The reliability edge has  shifted to the thyristor camp, since, unlike discharger tubes,  thyristors are not subject to electrode erosion and the  accumulation of dirt.    In addition, doing away with discharger tubes makes it  possible to consider cheaper industrial processes, such as  automatic component insertion, wave welding, or surface assembly  of components. Some of these methods have already been used to  make the ignition cases for Turbomeca's Arriel 2 and Arrius 2  engines. But the most interesting possibility raised has to do  with the control flexibility thyristors can bring to ignition  systems. The condensor's charge cycle can be modulated to create  frequency flexibility, and timing the triggering of the  thyristor can make for flexibility in energy levels and spark  voltage.    Thyristors can thus be used to modulate the spark's energy  and frequency, to conserve the spark plug's potential. Though  spark plugs may seem fairly long-lasting now, this is because  relatively few demands are being placed on them. That could  change shortly, as the operational environments of spark plugs  become harsher and harsher with the introduction of ever hotter  and more compressed engines. In addition, for obvious safety  reasons, users increasingly tend to keep ignition going during  takeoff, landing, and even stable flight phases, to prevent the  engine from dying. Thyristors could reconcile two  criteria--safety and operating costs--that are often at odds.  <H5>  Boxed Material: How a Turboengine Ignition System Works </H5>   Unlike inductive-discharge-based automobile ignition, the  so-called "high energy" ignition of turbines is produced by a  condensor discharge.    In turbine sparking circuits, a string of impulses generated  by a converter charges the condensor. The converter itself is  supplied by the aircraft's 28 d.c. volt main supply. To reclose  the discharge circuit that will trigger the spark in the plug,  engineers have traditionally used a discharger tube. The tube is  made of two electrodes inserted into an airtight glass bulb in a  manner similar to lightning rods. When a certain charge voltage  -- which depends on the shape of the discharger -- is exceeded,  an electric arc forms between the two electrodes, and the  discharger acts as a short circuit. Approximately one joule of  energy is released in the spark plug at that instant, for a  current of several thousand ampheres lasting 30-40 microseconds.  In the Eyquem patent, one (or more thyristors in a row)  replace(s) the discharger. To limit the joule effect in the  thryistor, the condensor's charge impulses are modulated to  reduce its charge time. The thyristor is maintained in a relaxed  state for over 90 percent of its operating time. Its voltage  rise can be calculated in milliseconds.</p>

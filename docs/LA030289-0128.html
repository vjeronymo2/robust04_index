Japan's giant domestic  telecommunications company said the production of the 26 gigahertz receiver was  made possible by the firm's development of a new uniplanar circuit  configuration for monolithic-microwave integrated circuit, or MMIC. The firm  said the uniplanar MMIC can help reduce cost and size and improve reliability  of super-high-frequency equipment.  </P></p>

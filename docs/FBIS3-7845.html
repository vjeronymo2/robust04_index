UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Bill Aikman said  there would be "no major change in our operations" after NATO  planes Monday shot down four Serb jets bombing a factory in Novi  Travnik in central Bosnia.    UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia British General Michael Rose  had said Monday that the NATO intervention to enforce a  no-flight zone over Bosnia should not affect the UN mission on  the ground, which is a humanitarian, peacekeeping effort.    Aikman confirmed that jets had bombed Monday a second site,  in Bugojno, 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Novi Travnik,  which is about 70 kilometres (42 miles) northwest of Sarajevo.  He did not provide further details.    He said that while a ceasefire was generally holding in  Sarajevo there had been "several incidents worth mentioning,"  namely reports of trench-digging by mainly Moslem government  troops in attempts to advance their lines.    Aikman said one site of the advance was in the Jewish  cemetery area in southern Sarajevo, a site where both French and  Russian UN troops are present.    He said the attempted Bosnian advances had drawn rifle fire  from Serb forces besieging Sarajevo and added that Rose was  "very concerned (about the ceasefire violations) and will be  taking it up with senior officials" on both sides.    He also reported that a Bosnian electrical repair crew had  been shot at by Serb troops on Monday. Ukrainian UN troops  protecting the repair mission had returned fire and a civilian  bystander was wounded in the incident, he said.    A Moslem-Croat ceasefire in central Bosnia was "holding but  that there were some incidents," he said. There was an "honest  effort" by both sides, however, to observe the truce.    Aikman said that on Monday, 14 artillery rounds had fallen  near Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia.    The airport has been shelled almost daily since UNPROFOR  said  in February that it planned to open it to humanitarian flights  in March.</p>

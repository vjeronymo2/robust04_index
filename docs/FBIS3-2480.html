			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 24 February broadcasts the  33-minute 8th of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures,  and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture  Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the  Economic System."    The 8th lecture entitled "(Reform of the) Foreign Trade  System" is presented by Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign  trade and economic cooperation.    Shi Begins by saying: Profound changes have taken place in  China's foreign trade system after 15 years of reform. Reform  of the foreign trade system effectively promotes the development  of China's foreign trade. In 1978, China's total import and  export volume ranked 32d in the world; it rose to take the 11th  rank in 1992. The ratio represented by China's total import and  export volume in its gross national product has increased by  nearly 40 percent.    After enumerating various shortcomings of the old foreign  trade system, Shi points out that reform of the foreign trade  system became imperative especially in the face of keen  international competition after China implemented reform and  opened its doors to the outside world. The State Council  carried out two major reforms after 1984: first, the  implementation of the contract management responsibility system  among enterprises specializing in foreign trade from 1988 to  1990; and, second, beginning from 1 January 1991, the  readjustment of the exchange rate mechanism to create an  environment for competition on equal terms and the cancellation  of export subsidies for foreign trade enterprises. However, Shi  notes, certain undesirable aspects still exist in China's  foreign trade system which must be improved to meet the needs of  the drive to establish a socialist market economy.    "The resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee determined the orientation for reform  of the foreign trade system, namely, seek unity of policies,  delegate management power to enterprises and institutions,  compete on equal terms, integrate industry and trade, and  implement agency systems," states Shi. The objective of China's  reform of its foreign trade system is to establish a new foreign  trade system that conforms to the international economic norms  and meets the requirements of a socialist market economy. Major  points of the reform are as follows:    1. The exchange rate control system will be reformed to  bring into full play the important role of exchange rates in  regulating and controlling foreign trade. The State Council  decided to merge the dual exchange rates used in the past and to  implement a controlled, unitary floating exchange rate system  for the renminbi on the basis of market supply and demand,  starting 1 January 1994. Shi stresses: "We really grasp the key  issue by reforming exchange rates under the circumstances. It  will surely promote development of China's foreign trade.  Reform of the foreign exchange system will create a favorable  environment for competition on equal terms among various export  enterprises; is conducive to reasonably compensating  enterprises' export cost and to enhancing the competitiveness of  China's export commodities; will greatly accelerate  transformation of export enterprises' operating mechanisms; will  effectively bring into full play the function of exchange rates  as an economic lever in regulating foreign trade; will make  China's foreign exchange and foreign trade system meet the  requirements of a socialist market economy and conform to the  international economic norms; and, therefore, will play a  positive role in promoting the process of China's entry into  GATT and its participation in the international economic  activities. In addition, the reform enables the renminbi to  take an important step forward to gradually becoming a  convertible currency."    2. Legal and economic means will be employed to improve  management of foreign trade. These means, such as expediting  the legislation of a foreign trade law, regulations on control  of import and export commodities, anti-dumping provisions, and  so forth, will be supplemented by necessary administrative  means. Shi urges all departments in charge of foreign trade to  enhance consciousness of legal system and to exercise control  strictly in accordance with the laws. Efforts will be made to  establish a relatively complete system of laws on foreign trade  in about three years. The state will implement a quota system  to control huge quantity of important import and export  commodities that have a bearing on the national economy and on  the people's livelihood. The state will adopt policies on duty  drawback and export loans to encourage export and to stimulate  its growth. Foreign trade management power will be delegated to  state-owned manufacturing enterprises and scientific research  institutions. Shi urges enterprises to make the growth of  exports their conscious action. Control over imports will also  be reformed through economic means, such as gradually reducing  administrative intervention to give play to the role of import  in promoting national economic development, adopting  anti-dumping measures, and so forth. In addition, it is  necessary to establish a relatively good system for management  of enterprises' overseas branches to increase economic returns  and to achieve healthy development of foreign trade.    3. The following measures will be taken to enable foreign  trade enterprises to accelerate the transformation of operating  mechanisms. First, state-owned foreign trade enterprises will  be reorganized in accordance with the modern enterprise system  to turn them into business entities really responsible for their  own decisions about their operations and expansion and for their  own profits and losses, to bring into full play the initiative  of such enterprises and their employees, to keep expanding  imports and exports, and to ensure that the value of state-owned  property is maintained and increased. The import and export  agency system will be vigorously implemented. Second, foreign  trade enterprises whose conditions are ripe will be gradually  reorganized into limited liability companies or liability stock  companies. Foreign trade enterprises, manufacturers, and  scientific research institutions are encouraged to cooperate  with each other and to form large enterprise conglomerates on  the basis of equality and mutual benefit. All areas and  departments must not interfere in voluntary associations and  mergers among enterprises. As the pace of the formation of  regional economic blocs has quickened and as trade protectionism  is on the rise in the world today, the merger among enterprises  and the formation of large enterprise conglomerates is necessary  for China to cope with international competition. Third,  supervising bodies will be set up at all large and medium-sized  foreign trade enterprises owned by the state to supervise their  business operations and the increment of the value of  state-owned property. They will not interfere in enterprises'  normal operations or decisionmaking. Fourth, we must bring into  full play the role of chambers of commerce of importers and  exporters in providing coordination, guidance, and services for  foreign trade. All enterprises authorized to conduct foreign  trade are required to participate in a chamber of commerce and  to comply with its coordination activities. Arbitration bodies,  information service networks, and necessary lawyer, accountant,  and auditing offices will be set up across the country to  provide foreign trade-related services for enterprises. All  administrative departments must strive to create a favorable  environment for fair competition among enterprises. And, fifth,  we must maintain unity among varous foreign trade policies.  Implementation of unified policies, rules, and regulations on  foreign trade across the country is a necessity for the  establishment of an integrated big market nationwide, and  conforms to one of the norms of international trade. "Aside  from those that must be promulgated by the National People's  Congress and State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation is authorized by the State Council to  announce all laws, rules, and regulations on foreign trade in a  unified way and to organize their implementation." "During the  negotiations on restoring China's status as a signatory to the  GATT, some signatories doubted if China is able to maintain  unity in its foreign trade policies and management system." It  presents an issue that merits our close attention, Shi stresses.  "All laws, regulations, and policies on foreign trade and  economic relations as well as all relevant provisions on  services for foreign firms shall be promulgated so long as they  do not involve national security and industrial secrets," Shi  says.    Finally, Shi calls for joint efforts to promote development  of foreign trade and solicits supervision over and assistance  for the work of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation.    The lecture concludes at 0638 GMT.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (3): A riverside renaissance - Laganside Corporation is transforming a run-down piece of land THE Laganside Corporation is charged with regenerating 120 acres of inner city property and land along 1.5 miles of the River Lagan which has fallen into dereliction and disuse as a result of industrial decline. In this, the corporation is similar to development corporations in Merseyside, Newcastle, Manchester and even London docklands. The idea is that by using a modicum of government money to improve access to rundown dock, riverside or canalside areas, private sector investment will be levered into housing, offices, shops, concert halls and exhibition centres. The difference is that the River Lagan is in Belfast. Not only is the city a place apart in that - unlike the other industrial cities in decline on the mainland - it does not lock into a highly populated business hinterland, it also has a security problem. The chances of a visiting businessman meeting a violent death are no doubt greater in Chicago or New York. But the troubles in Northern Ireland have for a long time been a disincentive to investment in property. This began to change in the second half of the 1980s. Mr Michael Roberts, director of marketing at the Laganside Corporation says: ' Everything in Belfast in the property sector is grace of the IRA. But you can see for yourself the changes that have been made in recent years.' Compared with the early 1980s, Belfast is much changed. Then, the city was a web of security barriers and barbed wire. Few new property developments in the city centre were embarked upon. But since 1985, buildings of all kinds, offices, shops, houses, wine bars and cinemas have sprung up in the centre. The renaissance started with retailing. Belfast, which was dominated by local stores, such as Robinson and Cleaver, began to see the arrival of the big chains. By 1990 - with the Castlecourt Centre, the York Centre and the Kennedy Centre - 700,000 sq ft of retailing space had been added to the centre. Office space was also built, as government departments were moved out of cramped and inadequate space at Stormont, the old parliament outside the city. Mr Kevin Milhench of the leading local estate agents Lambert, Smith, Hampton estimates that the take-up of office space in the past two years has been more than 650,000 sq ft. The clients have been predominantly government departments. 'Traditionally, the take-up of office space in Belfast would be no more than 150,00 sq ft a year', Mr Milhench says. It would be difficult to describe Belfast as normal. The heavily fortified law courts, which stand between the city centre and Laganside, are reminders of the abnormality. 'When you talk about developing Laganside, it is like having Fort Knox between the city and the River,' Mr Milhench says. However, in spite of these reminders of the troubles, the terrorists have been either unwilling or unable to destroy the city centre. This has allowed further property development. The question is now arising as to whether the spurt of building in recent years has created an oversupply of property in Belfast and whether development of Laganside would lead to a flood in the market. Using the grandiose original plans, this would have almost certainly been the case. In 1989, when Laganside Corporation was formed, an investment of Pounds 750m was talked of in the seven main sites - the Abercorn Centre, the Abercorn Basin, Clarendon Dock, Laganbank, Ravenhill Reach, Bridge End and the Gasworks. Developments would have included more than 1m sq ft of office space as well as facilities such as a concert hall, shopping centre, cinema complexes, houses, parks and museums. With a changed economic climate - Northern Ireland has not been immune to recession - ambitions have been scaled down. By 1996 it is hoped that Pounds 200m will have been invested, with Pounds 150m coming from the private sector. Improvements to the infrastructure have already taken place. The weir across the Lagan, at a cost of Pounds 14m, will will trap water and cover up the unsightly mudflats. The weir was financed directly by government with help from the European Regional Development Fund. Spending by the Laganside Corporation - funded by the Department of the Environment of Northern Ireland - has been running at between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m a year. Much of this has been spent on developing walkways along the river banks. In the private sector, the main development has been an office block of 70,000 sq ft on the Abercorn Centre site. If development continues at its present pace, by the mid-1990s, the derelict area of Belfast's docklands should well the way to being transformed into a lively attractive precinct.</p>

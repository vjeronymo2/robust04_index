			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Skaugen records NKr170m loss SKAUGEN, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, has made a pre-tax loss of NKr170m (Dollars 26.5m) for 1991, against a profit of NKr68m in 1990. Behind the reversal was lower chartering rates for ships and weaker markets, the group said. Skaugen made an operating loss of NKr95m, compared with a profit of NKr125m. Gross freight income slipped to NKr2.348bn in 1991 from NKr2.383bn in 1990. Skaugen said a NKr50m charge was made against 1991 accounts to cover restructuring. The company reduced its fleet during the year to 52 ships from 85. In all, 12 ships were sold last year and another one sold this year. Skaugen owns 22 ships and operates 30 under contract. 'The result for 1991 is not satisfactory,' said Mr Erik Gloeersen, managing director. He said 1992 would be a difficult year with lower earnings in several of the company's ship divisions. 'We expect an improvement in other areas,' he said.</p>

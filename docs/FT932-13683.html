			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Personal View: A slimming programme for fat cats Company board compensation committees across the UK are under pressure. There is a widespread perception, articulated even by such establishment figures as the head of the Institute of Management, that pay structures for company directors are driven by greed and avarice rather than logic and incentive. But is it true that most top managers are greedy? The answer turns out to be less than sensational, though it is a complex and tricky problem to resolve. Compensation for the top team is not set by management themselves. It is usually proposed by an outside firm of compensation specialists, working to guidelines set by the board's compensation committee (itself usually composed only of outside directors). The committee is anxious to accomplish two things - first, to attract, motivate and retain good talent to run the company, and second, to protect the interests of the shareholders by making sure that only the minimum of compensation necessary to meet these aims is paid. Our recent survey of top management compensation schemes* in the UK's largest 400 companies has identified a single, well-intentioned decision, common to some 70 per cent of the plans surveyed, which one can demonstrate will inevitably lead to above-inflation raises for top management, year after year. We asked whether organisations wished to set base pay at the average level (vis-a-vis the competition) or above, or below, average. Imagine you are a member of a board compensation committee. Do you want to attract average talent? Of course not. You want to attract superior people, so you will want to pay above average to do this. So far, so good. Here's the snag: some 70 per cent stated that they desire the base pay of their top team to be either somewhat, or a lot, above average. However, the compensation committee is then told by its compensation consultants that it is failing to achieve its objective - pay is not above average, it is only average. For the committee to meet its objective, it needs to give everyone in top management a significant pay rise. In 12 months the compensation specialists are called back to report whether, as a result of the weighty pay increases of the previous year, the scheme is now meeting its objective of paying above average. Unfortunately, since every other company did the same, top management pay is now, in each firm, still only average - another significant rise is necessary] This expensive roundabout continues indefinitely, year after year. The result has been an exponential explosion in top management pay. If the average company continues to want to pay above average, the exponential growth will not end. How can this vicious cycle be broken? Is the board to declare a pay cut of 20 per cent for its top management, and risk losing all its best people to companies which have not made the cut? Or should it modify the objective, seeking merely to match top management pay to the competitive average (with all that implies for the board's perception of its management's perceived value)? At PA we can see only one solution. The main driver of compensation must cease to be comparison with competitor companies: instead the focus must be on increasing shareholder value. The company's objective can then be changed to pay only the competitive average, or even below average, for base salary. The way, nevertheless, to attract superior people is to balance such a package by offering a significantly higher potential bonus, although only if shareholder value is significantly increased. To underline this approach, the form in which compensation is paid has to be more vigorously oriented towards aligning the interests of top management with those of shareholders. To do this, part of the bonus would be paid in shares, say in restricted stock that cannot be sold until the results of the manager's efforts are having an impact - good or bad - on the stock price. Crafting such a programme is not simple. The transition from the existing to the realigned programme carries the dangers of upsetting good managers and distracting them from the task of running the business. Communicating the programme is also difficult because it is likely to be more complex than the existing scheme. The benefits, however, are significant. Managers' interests will be closely aligned with those of shareholders. Top managers themselves will be profoundly grateful that they will no longer be subjected to accusations of 'greed'. And the UK might be able to escape the unproductive vicious spiral of ever-increasing top management salaries. The author is group chief executive of PA Consulting Group. *To be published shortly</p>

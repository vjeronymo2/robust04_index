			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / US direct investment challenges Japanese in Asia INCREASED US direct investment in developing Asian economies is challenging the conventional wisdom that US corporations must take second place to their Japanese rivals as investors in the region, according to a report by Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage. In an analysis of investment statistics in its latest Asian Economic Commentary, Merrill Lynch notes that US net direct investment in Asia, excluding Japan, rose 37 per cent last year to Dollars 2.29bn (Pounds 1.16bn) in spite of the US recession, while worldwide US investment fell 52 per cent. 'US companies took a surprisingly aggressive stance on non-Japan Asia,' the report says. 'US investments to all other parts of the world fell significantly.' Flows of Japanese investment to Asia remained high at Dollars 5.94bn in the fiscal year ended in March, but were down 16 per cent from the previous year. Although the investment figures issued by Japan and the US are not strictly comparable, Merrill Lynch said, the fact that US investors' commitments grew at a time when their Japanese counterparts were cutting back is confirmed by investment approval statistics from recipient countries. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines all recorded increased approvals for US investments in 1991, and decreased approvals for Japanese projects, which suggests the trend of higher US and lower Japanese investments will continue. One reason for the increase in US investments is probably the renewed regional emphasis on the energy and petrochemical sectors, where US companies are strong. US investments in the future could also be boosted by the development of financial and computer service industries in Asia and the demand for recreational products such as films, books and even theme parks, Merrill Lynch suggests. The outlook for investments in the manufacturing sector is more mixed, with US companies continuing to focus on medium- and higher-end industries requiring skilled manpower; the bulk of the Dollars 1.2bn of US manufacturing investments in the area in 1991 went to Singapore and Taiwan. 'In the long run, Asia could benefit from a more balanced mix of US and Japanese investments,' Merrill Lynch says.  ------------------------------------------------------------------          DIRECT INVESTMENT - % change over previous year  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Recipient:       Asia (exc   Europe   N America   Japan   World                     Japan)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Japan              -15.8     -34.4      -30.8        -    -26.9 US                 +36.5     -62.9          -    -23.4    -51.6  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: Japan figures are FY91/92 vs FY90/91, US figures are 1991 vs 1990.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Sources: Merrill Lynch/US Commerce Dept/Japan Finance Ministry  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

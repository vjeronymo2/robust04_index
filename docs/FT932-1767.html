			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: French rate cut prompts concern over Germany A SURPRISE cut in French short-term interest rates yesterday set the European government bond market alight as economists became increasingly concerned for Germany's position as Europe's currency anchor. Analysts said the French repo on Friday had not signalled a quarter-point cut in the key intervention rate and it was only yesterday morning that the market began to scent the possibility of an easing. Nevertheless, government bond investors took the cut well and after a brief bout of profit-taking, the September futures contract on the Matif rallied to close 0.26 points higher at 119.36. In the cash market, the 10-year French OAT-German bund yield spread narrowed still further. The spread moved from 15 basis points at the end of last week to only 10 basis points at the close of trading yesterday, with some economists predicting parity within the next few months. The crossover of French and German rates has now moved sharply along the yield curve, with French five-year rates conclusively below their German equivalent and seven year rates hitting parity. GERMAN government paper suffered from growing currency worries and disappointing money supply figures. Bund futures for September fell 22 basis points at one stage as the Bundesbank reported that M3 money supply growth had grown at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 6.7 per cent in May, the top end of the target range. Bunds were also under pressure from the continued strength of the dollar against the D-Mark, which is seen as undermining the Bundesbank's desire to ease monetary policy. September futures rallied to close 8 basis points lower at 95.27. IN THE UK, gilts were helped by the French rate cut and the overspill from last week's encouraging financial data. Government bond futures jumped from 105.23 to 106.06, consolidating last week's surge that followed news of inflation hitting a 33-year low. Short-dated bonds were slightly firmer, but a rise in short sterling was principally attributed to a bounce following aggressive selling at the end of last week. Sunday newspaper comments that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor of the exchequer, was poised to announce a half-point cut in interest rates ahead of the Christchurch by-election were discounted. 'Most of the Christchurch electorate are holders of net assets - an interest cut would not be very tactical,' said one economist. PORTUGUESE government bonds rose sharply after a 25 basis point cut in the Bank of Portugal's key money rates sparked interest rate cuts across the board. The reduction was a further signal of the ability of European central banks to cut rates independently of those in Germany. The intervention rate easing sparked a fall in money rates across the board. Overnight money eased to 12 per cent from 12.25 per cent on Friday and all Libor interbank rates slipped below 13 per cent. FUTURES-led buying lifted longer-dated US Treasuries as the short end of the market readied itself for a sizeable infusion of fresh supply. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 104 1/2 , yielding 6.768 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.124 per cent. Most of the activity was confided to technical trading by dealer accounts, with long prices rising after the September Treasury bond contact rose through a key resistance level. Remarks from a senior Federal Reserve governor that he was encouraged by the recent inflation data, the dollar's rally, and good news on the progress of President Bill Clinton's deficit-reduction package through Congress also gave longer-dated securities a boost. Retail investors, meanwhile, were mostly absent from the market, awaiting today's sale of Dollars 16bn in two-year notes and tomorrow's sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. The impending auctions meant that shorter-dated maturities traded quietly throughout the day. THE Balladur Bond', the French government's new FFr40bn four-year bond issue, is to be launched this Friday, raising funds for the country's economic recovery programme, writes Sara Webb. French banking sources expect the coupon and commission to be set later this week. The bonds, which mature on July 16 1997, can be converted into shares of newly-privatised companies. The conversion rights are open to investors in France and other EC countries. Bond analysts expect the coupon to be set at around 6.25 per cent, although the recent rally in French government bonds fuelled speculation that it may be set lower. However, market participants are still anxiously awaiting details of the bond's conversion rights. The government has said bondholders will have the right to convert into shares in newly-privatised companies as the privatisation programme gets under way. Subscription for the bond runs from June 25 to July 10. Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) will be lead managers and Caisse des Depots Et Consignations (CDC) will be co-lead.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: CML falls 11% on static sales EXPECTATIONS at CML Microsystems that the second half would show a similar level of growth to that achieved during the opening six months were not fulfilled. For the 12 months to March 31 profits of this USM-quoted manufacturer of electronic devices fell to Pounds 4.3m pre-tax, some 11 per cent down on the previous Pounds 4.85m. Sales were static at Pounds 14.3m. First half profits grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.37m. Directors said the second half saw a sharp deterioration in markets served by the UK semi-conductor operation and that evidence of earlier customer over-stocking emerged. However, to reflect confidence in its strength and growth prospects the dividend is lifted from 2.9p to 3.7p.</p>

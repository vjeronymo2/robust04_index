			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Cars and cycles YESTERDAY'S spate of bad news from Ford, Volkswagen and Peugeot about job cuts and financial losses in Europe will provoke fresh anxiety about the depth of the European recession. But while the recession is real enough, there is more to it than that. The problems of the world motor industry are not confined to Europe. Nor is it clear how far they are caused by recession, as against being uncovered by it. As it happened, Nissan this week announced plans to increase its UK car output. So did Rover, which is now closely associated with Honda. Yesterday also saw the official opening of Toyota's first European plant in Derbyshire. But while the build-up of Japanese competitive pressure ahead of the single European market is plainly part of the story, the Japanese producers are not enjoying life either. Nissan is in loss worldwide, as are several of its smaller competitors. Toyota, whose profits last year were almost halved, has just made a further cut in its profits estimate for this year. In the US, while there are glimmers of hope in the market place, most of the producers are in no better shape. General Motors, the biggest car maker of them all, is in worse. Not only is its organisation in turmoil, it has just summarily got rid of its boss. Around the world, the industry is suffering from twin afflictions. It has high overheads which are not flexible enough to cope with fluctuations in demand. Meanwhile, the competition is hotting up, with global producers expanding into each others' markets faster than the markets themselves can cope with. These problems are not confined to the motor industry. But in one respect, the travails of the motor industry are particularly instructive. In the past couple of years, there has been much talk of the so-called 'lean production' technique employed by Japanese car makers. Supposedly, this offers two particular benefits. Its flexibility allows for frequent variations in model within a relatively small output, and its responsiveness means that the least possible inventory is built up through the supply chain. In the event, this seems to have had its limits. Japanese car makers, like their counterparts in consumer electronics, have found that extreme proliferation in models was a mere frippery of the late 1980s, designed to tempt the consumer into yet more excessive consumption. The emphasis is now on a smaller range of models, changed less often and lasting longer. And despite the supposedly lower inventories carried by the industry and its reduced working capital, its collective overheads are still too high. There are only two ways to address this problem: either the industry gets even leaner, or some of the weaker fry get out.</p>

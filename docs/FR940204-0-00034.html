			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air quality in the Cleveland area is unhealthy and the area should remain nonattainment and the requirements not be relaxed. If nothing is done now, the problem will get worse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Ohio submitted air quality modeling and monitoring data as a part of their redesignation request. These data show that the area is currently in attainment of the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide (CO) and is expected to remain in attainment for at least the next 10 years. The primary NAAQS are established to protect public health. Since, the State has met the redesignation requirement to demonstrate that the air quality meets the NAAQS, USEPA believes the air quality is sufficient to protect the public health. USEPA cannot reject the redesignation request on this basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the redesignation is approved, it would discourage the public transportation system in the area from making improvements to its fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) has provisions for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Programs. Under these provisions, funding has been made available for ozone and CO nonattainment areas for certain actions that can improve air quality. Since the air quality in Cuyahoga County remains nonattainment for ozone, they can apply for these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oxygenated gasoline creates less pollution and should be mandated in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : While oxygenated fuel lowers CO levels, the State has shown that the CO levels are below the standard and are expected to remain below the standard for at least the next 10 years in the County, without using oxygenated fuels. Since the State has demonstrated maintenance without the measure and an oxygenated fuels program is not an applicable requirement for purposes of redesignation, EPA cannot mandate the program in this area. However, if a violation were to occur the State has committed to implement oxygenated fuels in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The area should not be redesignated because it would then be required to use reformulated gasoline during the winter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reformulated fuels are required in certain ozone nonattainment areas, and oxygenated fuels are required in certain CO nonattainment areas. These are two distinct requirements. The redesignation of the area to attainment for CO will not result in the county having a reformulated fuels requirement for controlling CO. Furthermore, under the CAA none of the areas in Ohio are currently subject to the reformulated fuels requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining public comments received (over 120) were all in support of the redesignation and, therefore, will not be addressed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amended Clean Air Act established new submittal requirements with respect to various programs. Therefore, USEPA reviewed the State's submittal, to determine whether the State met the applicable requirements of the amended Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 187(a)(4) of the Act establishes the I/M requirements applicable to moderate CO nonattainment areas. Section 187(a)(4) requires the State to have submitted an I/M program immediately upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. USEPA has interpreted this provision to require submittal of a commitment to USEPA by November 15, 1992, see 57 FR 52950 (Nov. 5, 1992). This commitment would commit to the submittal of an actual program by November 15, 1993. Therefore, November 15, 1992, is the date on which the I/M requirement became applicable. Although Ohio is not required to submit an  approvable I/M program in order for USEPA to determine that the State has met the applicable requirements of part D, the State must have an approved I/M program prior to redesignation because it has relied on such a program to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The redesignation request can now be approved as meeting conditions of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation, since: (1) The I/M regulations have recently been fully approved as a part of the CO SIP; (2) the State has submitted a schedule for implementing the contingency plan; and (3) the State has committed to maintain an acceptable CO monitoring network in the maintenance area. The State has also met the terms of the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the Cleveland area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

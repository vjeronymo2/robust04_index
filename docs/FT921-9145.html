			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Britannia puts legal system's resources on trial: The problems caused by long and complex trials have been highlighted this week by the collapse of the second Guinness case. Paul Cheeseright looks at the costs and strains of the longest trial of all, which ended last week THE COURTROOM is being dismantled. The computer screens disappear. Eleven jurors have been left to pick up the threads of their lives. The lawyers have swiftly moved on to other cases. The UK's longest criminal trial is over. It took 17 months, or 252 working days, to reach the verdict. The state paid for the investigation. The state paid for the prosecution. It paid for the court. It paid, through the legal-aid system, for most of the defence. The only thing for which it did not pay was the loss suffered by victims of the fraud that led to the case in the first place. This was the Britannia Park fraud case. It was heard in two offices, converted and joined together, on the top floor of the Nottingham Crown Court building. Not a luxurious conversion, but bespoke nonetheless. Ms Elizabeth Folman, the East Midlands courts administrator, recalled: 'We invited the prosecution and defence counsel to come to an empty room and say what they wanted.' They chose tables and chairs and six computer screens for the jurors. A 'portacourt' was brought in to give Mr Justice Potter, the judge, a bench. Here, with a view of a multi-storey car park, the immediate future of Mr Peter Kellard and some fellow directors and business associates of Britannia Park was played out. This week Mr Kellard and three other directors are starting prison sentences ranging in length up to four years. It was then, a successful prosecution. 'It is always worth it if you're bringing wrongdoers to justice,' said Mr Don Dovaston, assistant chief constable of Derbyshire police, which spent Pounds 2m between 1986 and 1989 interviewing 390 witnesses in the UK and around the world, compiling 5,000 pages of statements and obtaining 2,600 documents as exhibits. Derbyshire police's involvement began after the Britannia Park theme park at Shipley, near Heanor in Derbyshire, collapsed in 1985 with debts of Pounds 9.34m. The park was open but unfinished and designed to honour British achievement. Police rapidly enlarged their inquiries to encompass fraud. Mr Bernard Carnell, a partner in Offenbach and Co, the London solicitors which acted for Mr Kellard, said: 'More than one person has said the case was as serious as Guinness One (the first trial concerning the Guinness takeover of Distillers), but more complicated.' Pursuing the case put the legal system under strain. Professor Michael Levi of the University of Wales said: 'Nobody would argue with the proposition that the system finds it difficult to cope with these complicated issues.' He is examining the conduct of fraud cases for the Royal Commission on criminal justice. The strain was evident during both the investigation and the trial. Mr Dovaston explained that a squad of 10 officers had to be set up, drawing in officers from the Derbyshire force with fraud experience. The number rose to 40 when arrests were in the offing. According to the inspector of constabulary the problem for Derbyshire police was that the force had been under-funded for the past nine years, and the Britannia Park case swallowed resources. So did the trial. The Lord Chancellor's Department has a notional figure of Pounds 1,900 a day to cover the basic accommodation cost and the expenses of judge and jury. That would mean merely holding the trial cost nearly Pounds  1/2 m. The Crown Prosecution Service has calculated that its spending on lawyers was Pounds 1m. The legal aid bills have yet to be delivered. All but one of the five defendants received legal aid. Seven firms of solicitors were involved. Their costs alone might total about Pounds 1m. Four defendants had a queen's counsel in court, two had junior counsel. The length of the case means that both barristers and solicitors will have to put in special bills. The longer the trial went on, the more apparent became the intellectual tour de force of all those involved. Mr Timothy Barnes, the crown's prosecuting counsel, said: 'Every part is magnified by a factor of 10 from one's normal experience.' For him 'normal' is half-a-day's cross-examination of a witness. He cross-examined Mr Kellard for 60 hours over 17 days. His opening speech took 44 hours, his closing speech 33 hours. The jury, praised by Mr Justice Potter for their 'quite remarkable care, attention and patience', saw the seasons change outside. One of 12 had to withdraw because of a family illness. Had another been forced to withdraw the trial would have stopped and been held again. The 11 saw summer heat induce the lawyers to take off their wigs. They saw a 'flasher', chased by a policewoman, fall to his death off the top of the car park. The question of their ability to absorb all the evidence - for the prosecution 158 witnesses and 118 statements, and for the defence 28 witnesses and six statements - has quickly been posed. Mr Carnell said Mr Kellard wanted to appeal. 'The Court of Appeal will be asked to consider: can a court ever be sure the jury has assimilated the facts, how can you be sure they have taken into account the evidence of October 1990 and been able to balance it off against the evidence they heard in October 1991?'</p>

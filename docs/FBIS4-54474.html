			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 29 (TANJUG) -- A report that leaked  out recently from sources close to the CIA says that U.S.  humanitarian airdrops to Bosnian Moslems contained not only arms  for fighting the Serbs but also blood plasma contaminated with  the deadly AIDS virus, the Belgrade daily EKSPRES POLITIKA  writes on Friday [29 April]. The paper says that U.S. President  Bill Clinton was informed about that by the CIA branch in  Frankfurt in mid-April. The CIA, the FBI and the German Military  Intelligence have launched a thorough investigation into the  matter after it was established that a container with 4,158 bags  of blood plasma suspected of being infected with the AIDS virus  had been sent to Bosnian Moslem fighters.    The red alert was given when the wounded Moslem soldiers  from  central Bosnia, 243 of whom were later found to have been  contaminated with the HIV virus, started arriving to a military  hospital in Bad Told 80 km from Munich. Germany, which has so  far whole-heartedly supported Bosnian Moslems, now insists that  the United States immediately remove from its territory "the  deadly cargo." The Turks, who had been helping their Moslem  brethren in Bosnia in both troops and weapons, say it is out of  the question that some of those who have tested positive for HIV  be treated in Turkish hospitals.    Iran, which has so far vowed to send mujaheddin to kill all  Serbs "in the name of Allah," has also flatly rejected to help.  Although all German papers are bound to know about the deadly  U.S. airdrops to Bosnian Moslems, they are keeping their mouths  shut probably because no matter how much they would like it they  cannot blame the Serbs for the terrible mistake of others, says  POLITIKA EKSPRES in conclusion.</p>

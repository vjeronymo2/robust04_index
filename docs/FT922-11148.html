			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: Scania-Poland bus accord SCANIA, the Swedish truck and bus maker, has reached an agreement in principle to assemble vehicles in Poland, Kevin Done writes. It is to form a joint venture with Capena, a Polish company maintaining and repairing heavy buses and special vehicles. The venture plans to assemble several hundred vehicles a year. Capena, located west of Gdansk, has a workforce of 500. Scania set up an importer/distributor, Eurowax, in Poland last year and has delivered about 150 vehicles there over two years. It has about 8 per cent of the Polish market for imported heavy commercial vehicles.</p>

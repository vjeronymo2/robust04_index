			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Green shoots too late to help the bankrupt (1) Sir, We are now officially out of the recession say Prime Minister John Major and Chancellor Norman Lamont, and the British people are expected to be grateful for this achievement of their government. Do they expect congratulations? When is this government going to give credit, never mind congratulations, to all those entrepreneurs and business people who have given their all and lost everything thanks to their policies. This is just about the final insult. Will they ever acknowledge the suffering they have caused to small and medium-sized businesses, to the hardworking and honest people who are now bankrupt because they have tried and failed? They expect to be hailed as heroes but the failed businessmen and businesswomen are treated as criminals for their efforts. I hope, but do not believe, that the 'green shoots of recovery' are appearing. Many businesses are still going down, thousands are losing their jobs, more people than ever are being made bankrupt; calls for support and advice to our association are still increasing alarmingly. Gill Hankey, national officer, The Bankruptcy Association, 4 Johnson Close, Lancaster LA1 5EU</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'COMPASSION FATIGUE' HITS PEOPLE WHO CARE TOO MUCH  </P> <P> Doctors, social workers and therapists are giving a new name to a syndrome they  say is draining their ranks: "compassion fatigue."  </P> <P> It strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other people's burdens,  leaving little time or energy for themselves. Victims become disillusioned and  depressed, and often start to show cracks in their professional veneer.  </P> <P> "Everyone that I work with is affected by it. I've felt it in myself," said  social worker Lydia Parsons of the Mid-Maine Medical Center in Waterville.  "I've had other people tell me about it, about me, before I was aware of it."  </P> <P> Compassion fatigue is gaining recognition. A half-dozen presentations were  devoted to it at a recent National Assns. of Social Workers conference. Dr.  Edward Poliandro of Mt. Sinai Medical School in New York said people "were  hanging from the rafters" to hear his workshop on stress management.  </P> <P> Some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress management  classes, longer staff meetings and even daily walks through the park.  </P> <P> As many as 20% of care-giving professionals suffer such burnout, said Dr. Lyle  H. Miller, head of the Biobehavioral Institute in Boston.  </P> <P> Typical victims sound almost like TV stereotypes of social workers or doctors,  working too much, sleeping too little, sacrificing their own lives and families  for case after case. "It's the best and the brightest and the most committed  and the most energetic that burn out," Miller said.  </P> <P> Parsons is a classic example. As director of the social work department at the  Redington-Fairview Hospital in Skowhegan, Me., she was running on empty so  often she couldn't do anything very well. "I always felt guilty even going for  lunch, because there was always someone waiting for me."  </P> <P> Parsons quit that job and, after a break in which she worked part-time, joined  Mid-Maine, where there are frequent staff meetings and peer-support sessions.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Welch, a former Catholic priest who left a Boston-area hospice  program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal with the prospect of  death, said that he had been happy with his work but that it was too consuming  to stay good at it for long.  </P> <P> "It's very heavy emotional material. It's not something that anyone should do  for a very long time," said Welch, who left both the church and the hospice in  1985 and now owns an Italian restaurant. "You get a sense that the whole world  is dying after a while. I heard a friend say I was a downer, I should find a  way to lighten up."  </P> <P> Compassion fatigue went unrecognized for a long time because of the stigma  attached to it, experts say.  </P> <P> "Very often people in any line of field would be looked down upon if they were  to acknowledge they were really stressed out," said Poliandro, who teaches  stress management at the Mt. Sinai Medical School.  </P> <P> "There's a double standard of being in the helping profession, that we should  be able to see it in ourselves" before anxiety becomes a crisis, Parsons said.  </P> <P> When perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an administrator's  nightmare, Miller said. They can develop headaches, backaches, fatigue,  depression and irritability. They might start to abuse drugs and alcohol, or  begin not showing up for work, Poliandro said.  </P> <P> The best way to fight compassion fatigue?  </P> <P> Take a vacation, Poliandro and Miller agreed.  </P> <P> Administrators can help, however. The boss can force workers to take lunches  away from their desks, outlaw working past 9 p.m. or forbid employees to work  weekends, Poliandro said.  </P> <P> At Mt. Sinai, personnel can enlist in the "wellness" program, which offers,  among other activities, daily walks through nearby Central Park. "It's a rapid  walk, to build up their health, but also they do it just to enjoy being outside  and away from the pressures of the office," Poliandro said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, professionals who help people have to teach themselves how to stave  off the needs of their own patients, said Miller and Poliandro.  </P> <P> "Humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient," said Poliandro. "They just  have to be able to replenish their energy."  </P></p>

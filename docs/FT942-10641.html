			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Farmers to test rapeseed car fuel Farmway, a co-operative of 2,500 farmers in north-east England, will this week begin running some of its cars and trucks on bio-diesel produced from rapeseed grown on set-aside land. British Bio-Diesel - a consortium formed by a group of Durham farmers; Farmway; specialist seed crusher Unitrition; and chemical manufacturer Chemoxy - has produced 4,000 gallons of bio-diesel, believed to be the UK's first. The trial, by seven Farmway vehicles normally run on conventional diesel, will test vehicle emissions. A North Yorkshire Peugeot dealer's courtesy car will also use the fuel to gauge public reaction. Engine performance will be evaluated by Perkins Engines and Lucas. The consortium believes bio-diesel is an environmentally friendly fuel which offers farmers a productive use for set-aside land. Farmway is paying members Pounds 98 a tonne for the rapeseed. That does not affect set-aside payments. The initiative was started by the farmers of the East Durham Bio-Diesel Working Group. They say bio-diesel is cleaner than conventional fuels and, if spilt, is 95 per cent biodegradable within three weeks and fully within five. Farmer Mr David Cowton said the quantity of bio-diesel which could be produced from UK set-aside land would not supplant ordinary diesel but it would be attractive in environmentally sensitive areas such as waterways. The consortium hopes the UK government will grant it pilot plant status for its production facilities in North Yorkshire and on Teesside. That would greatly reduce the fuel tax burden while markets are sought for bio-diesel and its rapemeal and glycerine by-products. If fully taxed, said Mr Cowton, bio-diesel would be about 50 per cent more expensive than ordinary diesel. Crop worries, Page 28</p>

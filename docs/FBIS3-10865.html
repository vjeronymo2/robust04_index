			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>   [Text] Without any scruples or modesty, U.S. leaders  attempt to take advantage of the current and future events in  Mexico (such as the elections in August, the Chiapas conflict,  and the illegal alien problem) to gain better political  positions and more votes from their voters.    Rodolfo Bacerril Suaffron, president of the Chamber of  Deputies Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday warned that the  attempt to create an institution that would engage the northern  neighbor in a "parallel count" of our elections would not only  "confuse' the work of the international media, it is insulting  and disrespectful to our government.    In all this series of "new attitudes" regarding serious  problems such as illegal aliens, and internal matters, such as  the elections, one can clearly see political interests by the  opportunistic forces that are only seeking votes, alerted Jorge  Tovar Montanez from the Popular Socialist Party.    Bucerril Straffon, who was interviewed separately, said  quite  annoyed that the mere pretension is "insulting" and demeaning  because no nation can assume the right to create institutions to  become the overseer of electoral rights, of human rights, and of  the political rights of another nation.    But the worst part, he said, is that many of these proposals  have been made by unscrupulous politicians who want to use  whatever conflicts exist in Mexico to create trouble.    Tovar Montanez said that this is just one of the actions  that  the neighboring country is beginning to carry out to create  signs of increased feelings of hostility in U.S. society toward  Mexicans in an effort to justify its economic setbacks.    This announcement, together with the one about carrying out  military exercises at the border near Ciudad Juarez, are events  without precedent that are part of a global policy of meddling,  the legislator said.    He stated: "Now they are announcing that in July there will  be a meeting with the chiefs of state of the rest of America to  discuss the suitability of structuring a military peace force  for democracy and in defense of human rights. This is a very  worrisome situation."    He concluded by saying that on the one hand they propose  militarization and erecting metal walls, and on the other they  want to supervise the domestic electoral process in the country  of people whose human rights are criminally violated every day,  and every time there is an illegal crossing of the border. This  is a contradiction, he affirmed.</p>

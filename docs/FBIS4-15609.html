			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Odessa, 11 Apr -- According to the Black Sea  Fleet press center, about 120 Ukrainian naval servicemen stormed  the Odessa conservation division of the Black Sea fleet between  2100 and 2300 on 10 April. [passage omitted]    Sources close to Ukraine's Navy headquarters said the action  was a response to the unlawful conduct by the Black Sea Fleet  Command Conservation Division 318 and the command of the  Cheleken hydrographic vessel. The Black Sea Fleet press center  report on the course of the aforementioned incidents is  therefore biased and will only aggravate the tension.</p>

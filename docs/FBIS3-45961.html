In the past ten years a total of 31 military airports have  been expanded and renovated with funds jointly supplied by local  governments and the military, and are usually jointly managed.    Last year alone 11 military airports completed their  expansion work.    The opening of Gonggar airport, a military airport in Lhasa,  capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, to civilian use has  helped the city to operate a dozen domestic air routes to  Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other major cities.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most members fail to act on cocoa pact repayments SWITZERLAND, Belgium/Luxembourg and Gabon were the only member countries of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) to meet the March 31 deadline for partial payment of arrears to the pact's buffer stock fund, an ICCO official said in London yesterday, reports Reuter. Arrears on payments to the fund, set up to maintain the cocoa accumulated in the ICCO's buffer stock under the last price-supporting International Cocoa Agreement, amounted to just under Dollars 146m at the end of 1991. Most of this was owed by the world's two largest producers, the Ivory Coast and Brazil. The Dollars 146m total was after 3.5 per cent of total arrears had been paid by most debtors as agreed at the November meeting of the ICCO council. The second tranche of 3.5 per cent was due to be paid by March 31, with two further repayments of 1.5 per cent scheduled for the end of June and September this year. Repayment of arrears is seen as a crucial issue for consuming country members, who have suggested that financing for a stock withholding scheme to support prices under a new agreement should be provided out of the buffer stock fund. Negotiations of a new cocoa accord with economic clauses are scheduled to begin on April 21 in Geneva.</p>

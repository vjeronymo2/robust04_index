			<p>`Completely   Misunderstood'   <F P=102> AU1805105494 Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  SONNTAGSZEITUNG in German 15 May 94 p 5 (Tentative) </F>  <F P=103> AU1805105494 </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  SONNTAGSZEITUNG </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Sabine </F> Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Cornelia von Wrangel; place and  date not given: "One Cannot Put Everyone Into Detention Pending  Trial"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Von Wrangler] Apropos young  people: Does the so-called hashish ruling pave the way for a  more liberal drug policy?    Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: The ruling of the  Federal Constitutional Court on soft drugs has been completely  misunderstood by the public, because the Federal Constitutional  Court just confirmed our law, according to which the possession  of small amounts of drugs for one's own consumption is also  punishable. Then the Federal Constitutional Court said that  punishment may be unnecessary if small amounts are involved.  Actually, this is precisely the situation that we have at the  moment. Among the justice ministers of the laender we have  dealt with the question of what is to be defined as a small  amount. The Federal Constitutional Court has not answered this  question. There are very different ideas, ranging from two to  30 grams. So far, we have not been able to agree on a uniform  line and, therefore, we will meet again this year.    Von Wrangler: Will you agree on an amount below  10 grams?    Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: Yes, I think so.    Von Wrangler: Thus, the next political step will  not be the complete release of hashish? Or the release of  heroin, as North Rhine-Westphalia Justice Minister Krumsiek  advocates?    Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger: No, the legislature  will not legalize soft drugs in the foreseeable future. What  applies to soft drugs must also apply to heroin and other hard  drugs. The ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court does not  apply to the latter, which means that there is no suspension of  punishment for the possession of small amounts of hard drugs.

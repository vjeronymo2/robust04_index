			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / GRE doubles its trading profits Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance company, provided more evidence of the strong recovery in the UK general insurance market when it announced interim trading profits of Pounds 131m, doubled from Pounds 65m last year. After taking into account net realised and unrealised investment losses of Pounds 417m, the group reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 286m, against a profit of Pounds 307m. Unlike its main competitors, GRE includes capital gains and losses in its profit and loss account. Mr John Robins, the group's new chief executive, said the decision to increase the interim dividend by 7.5 per cent to 2.85p (2.65p) reflected 'not only the group's trading performance worldwide but also its sound balance sheet and strong cash generation'. A UK underwriting profit of Pounds 24m was 'the engine behind the improvement', said Mr James Morley, finance director. Underwriting profits of Pounds 47m, up from break-even last year, were achieved on home, motor and other personal lines business, offsetting a Pounds 10m loss (Pounds 24m loss) on commercial lines and a Pounds 13m loss (Pounds 16m loss) in the London market. Results benefited from premium rate increases, more selective underwriting and improved claims experience. In its motor business, frequency of claims has fallen from 30 for every 100 cars insured in 1991 to less than 25 in June 1994. Mr Morley said Guardian Direct, the telephone insurer launched in March, received premium income of Pounds 2m against expenses and claims of Pounds 8m. GRE's German operations cut its loss from Pounds 28m to Pounds 15m. Losses were also reduced in Canada and Ireland, but increased in the US South Africa. Life profits rose to Pounds 13m (Pounds 11m), but the group is continuing to reorganise its life businesses, following the loss of more than 300 jobs in the past 12 months. Net investment income rose to Pounds 150m (Pounds 149m). The decline in the equity and fixed income markets during the first six months led to fall in the value of shareholders funds. These amounted to Pounds 1.39bn by June 30, compared with Pounds 1.35bn at the same stage last year and Pounds 1.68bn at December 31. Overall premium income amounted to Pounds 2.01bn (Pounds 1.77bn).

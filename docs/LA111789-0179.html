			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ITALY NAMED OWNER OF 'GARDENER'  </P> <P> A court ruled Thursday that the Italian government has ownership rights to Van  Gogh's masterpiece "The Gardener," thus preventing its sale to the Peggy  Guggenheim Collection in Venice.  </P> <P> Under the ruling by the administrative court of the province of Lazio, the 1889  oil painting valued at $8.5 million will remain at the National Gallery of  Modern Art in Rome.  </P> <P> The ownership dispute dates to 1977 when Ernst Beyeler, an art collector from  Basel, Switzerland, bought the painting for 600 million lire -- about $1  million then -- from an Italian nobleman.  </P> <P> The painting remained in Italian museums, and Beyeler tried to sell it last  year to the Guggenheim Collection, one of the most renowned modern art  galleries in Europe. The sale price was $8.5 million.  </P> <P> The Italian Culture Ministry, however, blocked the sale. It charged Beyeler's  1977 purchase of the painting was illegal, saying it was bought in another  person's name. The ministry said that Beyeler was not the legal owner and that  the government had rights to the painting.  </P> <P> Beyeler took the case to court, which ruled against him Thursday. The court  will announce the reasons for its ruling later.  </P> <P> Guggenheim officials were not involved in the court case.  </P></p>

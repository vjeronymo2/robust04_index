			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NACHOS UPSTAGE SUPERSTARS  </P> <P> Harrison Ford, Chevy Chase and Sean Connery are here at the annual convention  of theater owners, but the people at Proctor Cos. swear the biggest star around  is Proctor's new nacho cheese dispenser.  </P> <P> More than 80% of a theater's profits are generated at the concession stand, and  many of the 3,000 executives gathered for the National Assn. of Theater Owners  ShoWest trade meeting are seeking every opportunity to squeeze the snack bar  for a few more dollars.  </P> <P> Given that motivation, Hollywood superstars, previews of upcoming attractions  and endless cocktail parties take a back seat to such inventions as the $450  Hot Topper, which Proctor says can squirt out melted nacho cheese, fudge or  butter without mess and little waste.  </P> <P> And what food innovation will you see soon at a theater near you? Perhaps iced  cappuccino, which comes in three flavors -- chocolate, amaretto and classic --  and will sell for about $1.50.  </P></p>

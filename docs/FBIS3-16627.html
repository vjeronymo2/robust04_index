			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vassan Georgiyev commentary] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister of Pakistan Asif Ahmad Ali has  charged the United States with supplying outdated weapons to the  UN peacekeeping force in Somalia. Together with his country's  Defense Minister, Asif Ahmad Ali visited Somalia to inspect the  Pakistani contingent of the UN force. Now our commentary by  Vassan Georgiyev:    The United States and the other Western countries want to  withdraw their troops from Somalia by the end of this month.  The UN force remaining in Somalia will consist of troops of  Afro-Asian countries only. The Pakistani contingent will be the  largest, more than 5,000 people. As the Pakistani foreign  minister says, the United Nations troops remaining in Somalia  would be left with outdated weapons, the Cobra helicopters,  which have served their time, old models of tanks, and other  military equipment. Asif Ahmad Ali also called attention to the  shortage of drugs and dressings. The Pakistani foreign minister  described as racist such an approach to the United Nations  peacekeepers staying in Somalia. He accused the United States  of contempt of the lives and health of servicemen from Pakistan  and other states of Asia and Africa.The racism charges were  immediately rejected by the United States Defense Department and  Washington agreed to consider the issue of replacing outdated  weapons.    At this point one may consider the matter settled. Yet one  might consider at the same time whether out-of-date weapons were  the only source of the Pakistani foreign minister's irritation.  Until recently, as it received large amounts of weapons from  the United States, Islamabad could hardly afford to criticize  the Pentagon publicly. Yet the United States embargo on arms  shipments to Pakistan following its attempts to create a nuclear  bomb of its own, has changed Islamabad's policy toward  Washington. It should not be ruled out that as he criticizes  Washington for leaving outdated military equipment for the  Pakistani contingent in Somalia, the foreign minister of  Pakistan wants to remind Washington of the problem of his  country's army in general; it is no secret that it is still  equipped largely with American weapons but these weapons were  manufactured in the '70s. Islamabad wants the United States to  resume military aid to Pakistan, including the F-16 fighter  bombers and other latest weapons. It appears that the foreign  minister of Pakistan took advantage of the participation of the  country's contingent in the United Nations peacekeeping forces  to remind Washington of the needs of the Pakistani Army once  again.</p>

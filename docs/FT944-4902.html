			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mild weather undermines oil Oil prices weakened further yesterday as unseasonably warm weather persisted in many parts of Europe and the US. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for January fell to Dollars 15.90 in late London trading, more than a dollar down from Thursday's close. Recent temperatures in Europe have been 2' to 5' C above normal. Mild weather is also affecting the north-east and mid-west regions of the US, where demand for heating oil is 19 to 28 per cent below normal for this time of year. World crude oil prices were also dragged down yesterday by sharp falls in the price of petrol in the US. Petrol prices were affected by reports that some areas that were to introduce reformulated gasoline on January 1 were about to pull out of the programme. US cities with severe smog problems are required to introduce the fuel, but other areas have volunteered to join the programme. US refineries had been strong buyers of crude oil in recent weeks to ensure that adequate stocks of reformulated fuel were available. Fears of withdrawals from the programme left markets 'believing that reformulated gasoline will be in over-supply rather than under-supply', according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at the London office of US brokers Smith Barney.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Leading Article: No Erhard on offer THE LOSS of ministers from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition is starting to match the loss of steam in the German economy. The weekend resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, who admitted signing official letters promoting a product invented by his wife's cousin, was not, by itself, a very significant event. The minister's title of vice-chancellor reflected his now-dashed standing and ambitions in the Free Democratic party, the coalition partner of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, rather than his real political weight. Mr Mollemann's failure to make headway with his insistently argued support for free-market policies and a Gatt trade deal is adequate testimony to his junior status. Nonetheless, Mr Mollemann's departure provides another illustration of disarray in the German cabinet, which has seen the premature departure of five ministers in just over nine months. It strikes a jarring note in Mr Kohl's efforts to bring about improvement in economic policy. Amid increasing signs that Germany may be moving into serious recession, the government's problem-solving ability seems inversely proportional to its challenges. Mr Mollemann's much-publicised aims of cutting subsidies in the west of the country and encouraging a self-generating upswing in the east bore little fruit. For these failings, however, he is not the only person to blame. Onerous burdens Mr Mollemann has also played a central role in recent talks between trade unions and the government, aimed at reaching a 'solidarity pact' to curb inflationary pressures and put the financing of German unity on to a sounder footing. These negotiations, designed to reach agreement on wage restraint, public spending cuts and reallocation of tax revenues, have been faltering for several weeks, primarily because of a dispute over social security reductions. Recognising that a credible deal would greatly improve the chances of significant cuts in Bundesbank interest rates, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has urged the need for a successful conclusion this month. If his hopes are dashed, the burdens awaiting Mr Mollemann's successor are likely to be still more onerous - as will be the economic difficulties for Germany's EC partners. Waning star In an ideal world, Mr Kohl and his coalition partners would use the opportunity of Mr Mollemann's resignation to refashion the economics ministry's role and responsibilities. Mr Kohl's world is not, unfortunately, ideal. The ministry, presided over by Mr Ludwig Erhard between 1949 and 1963 and by Mr Karl Schiller between 1966 and 1972, became a byword for the liberal policies which powered West Germany's postwar revival. For 20 years, however, the ministry's star has been waning, while the men in charge have become accident-prone. Mr Mollemann is the fifth minister since 1977 to leave under a cloud. The ministry's monetary policy remit was transferred to the finance ministry in 1972. Its responsibilities have become increasingly focused on subsidising traditional industries like shipbuilding and coal, and new ones such as electronics and the Airbus: activities which neither have led to successes, nor sit easily with the old Ordnungspolitik credo. Yet even if Mr Kohl wanted to reshape the economics ministry's tasks, he lacks either the powers or the personnel to carry this out. Under the existing coalition agreement, the Free Democrats are free to choose Mr Mollemann's successor. There has been speculation that Mr Kohl might want to bring in a Christian Democrat politician such as Ms Birgit Breuel, the head of the Treuhand agency. But the chancellor will probably not risk a coalition squabble on this. Nevertheless, the new minister will need to command more confidence from industry than did Mr Mollemann. Whoever takes over must - like Mr Mollemann - make east Germany's economic rebirth a priority. But slogans alone will not work. Germany's economic and social rigidities represent a powerful handicap to the free-market policies which would represent the best chance for speedy east German renewal. Unhappily, politicians of Erhard's stature are no longer on offer and neither is the environment in which his precepts once flourished.</p>

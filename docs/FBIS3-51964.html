			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]  front blamed for killing 35 people in Apartado over the weekend  has denied its participation in the massacre by claiming the  culprits are the same people responsible for the killings at  Honduras, La Negra, and Pueblo Bello haciendas.    Today, the Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement said it will  not  withdraw from the Uraba political pact. The movement's topmost  leader, Senator Anibal Palacios, however, has said that FARC's  Bolivarian Militias are the ones that massacred 35 people in La  Chinita, Apartado, neighborhood. This is Palacios' reaction to a  letter FARC addressed to Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez  denying FARC participation in the massacre.    [Begin Gomez Martinez recording] We did not say that  Patriotic Unity is responsible, but rather that the Guerrilla  Coordinating Board and the Bolivarian Militias had a hand in the  La Chinita massacre. [end recording]    This afternoon, the movement leaders met with Government  Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, whom they have asked to be an  international observer for Uraba.    [Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish on 26 January  publishes a 400-word article on page 6-A reporting: "The Hope,  Peace, and Liberty Movement's decision to withdraw from the  follow-up table [mesa de seguimiento], which guarantees the  existence of the political pact signed in Uraba on 23 November,  produced an avalanche of reactions." The article also reports:  "Government Minister Fabio Villegas said the commitment has not  been broken" and he adds that the Hope, Peace, and Liberty  Movement still recognizes the validity of the political pact  that was signed."]</p>

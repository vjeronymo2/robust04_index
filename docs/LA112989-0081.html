			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'REVELATIONS' OF AMERICA WON'T BE SEEN IN L.A.;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: KCET CALLS THE DOCUMENTARY, A VIEW OF THE U.S. THROUGH THE EYES OF  ORDINARY WEST VIRGINIANS, 'MEAN-SPIRITED.' KOCE MAY RESCHEDULE THE PROGRAM;  OTHER PBS STATIONS ARE BROADCASTING IT.  </P> <P> It's as American as Coca-Cola.  </P> <P> Yet viewers in Los Angeles may never have an opportunity to see what is  arguably the season's best documentary hour to date, one that many PBS stations  either wisely aired Monday when it was distributed by the network or have  promised to air in the future.  </P> <P> "Revelations" -- a sometimes grim, often critical, but acutely honest and  meaningful view of the United States through the eyes of ordinary West  Virginians -- is scheduled to air soon on public TV stations in New York and  Boston, among many others.  </P> <P> But it's been vetoed here by KCET Channel 28, whose director of broadcasting,  Jacqueline Kain, finds the program "mean-spirited" and "condescending."  </P> <P> Not on your life.  </P> <P> At once reflecting the throbbing ache and sinewy strength of America's  heartland, "Revelations" is art with an edge, giving resonance to voices rarely  accommodated by television and taking viewers where they haven't been taken  previously. Isn't that what public TV is supposed to do?  </P> <P> "Revelations" was scheduled to run tonight on KOCE Channel 50 in Orange County,  then was preempted for a special "Frontline" documentary investigating the  crash of Pan Am 103. Program director Roberta Smith said she would try to  reschedule "Revelations." "I'm looking over my February schedule now," she  said. But no guarantees.  </P> <P> What's the fuss? Indeed. What is the fuss?  </P> <P> A high-achieving documentary arising not from such PBS giants as KCET, New  York's WNET or Boston's WGBH, but bold little WNPB in Morgantown, W.Va.? WNPB  deserves a medal, not a slap in the face.  </P> <P> KCET, for example, should be toasting "Revelations" -- which has already aired  in Britain, whose BBC co-produced it with WNPB -- instead of condemning and  withholding it.  </P> <P> Although the subject is intensely American, the guiding hand here belongs to  the program's British director, Paul Watson, head of documentaries for BBC  Elstree, who has a critical eye for the absurd as well as the profound.  Watson's films have angered people in the past.  </P> <P> A documentary without narration, "Revelations" is laden with irony and  symbolism, intercutting television's daily onslaught of flim flam with the  troubled realities of West Virginians trying to adapt to the changing world  around them.  </P> <P> Center stage are state trooper Larry Smith, his wife Rhonda, their 17-year-old  son Lacy, and Larry's parents, elderly Jenny and Guy Smith. Although mostly  shown passively watching a preacher on TV, Guy briefly weighs in on world  affairs ("This Gorbachev feller . . . .").  </P> <P> Much of "Revelations" is a sort of Appalachian "Our Town." It's about values --  religious values, conservative values, life-affirming family values movingly  expressed at Thanksgiving time. There are deep roots here, too, the continuity  of generations visible at the local cemetery, where 10 of the Smith clan are  buried. This Watson feller is respectful of their traditions.  </P> <P> For the most part, however, "Revelations" shows the dark side of rural America  that Charles Kuralt leaves out.  </P> <P> "Corruption is everywhere," Trooper Smith says while cruising on Interstate 79.  "My father had to pay a politician to get a job. My sister worked for those  politicians who were indicted."  </P> <P> Rhonda: "You just don't know who you can trust out here."  </P> <P> Deep in the forest, "Revelations" also finds a group of orange-clad hunters,  male comrades living out a cultural attachment to nature that is paradoxically  manifested in the destruction of life. There's lots of quick cutting: Hunters  drag a dead buck through the woods. Click. Shoppers in Charlestown chatter in  the climatically controlled atmosphere of a shopping mall. Click. Back to the  hunters. . . .  </P> <P> This is National Rifle Assn. heaven, the deer slayers representing a segment of  society for whom guns are considered a birthright. A stocking-capped,  red-bearded hunter: "I think everybody ought to have at least one or two guns  laying around. I've got a boy that's 7 years old and I've got one that's 3  years old, and both of 'em have had guns in their hands, and the 7-year-old can  come up here right now and shoot anything he wanted to shoot -- even you!"  </P> <P> Not show this hour?  </P> <P> KCET's Kain says she was "predisposed to like" the documentary before seeing it  in Stockholm last May at the 1989 International Public Television Conference.  "I look forward to cross-cultural viewing. But I found this mean-spirited and  cliche-ridden. I also found it to take a condescending attitude toward the  people it was depicting."  </P> <P> Barry Stoner, executive producer for international production at KCTS in  Seattle, is as critical as Kain, saying he finds the program "jaundiced,  shallow and a cheap shot at American culture."  </P> <P> It is anything but those, actually.  </P> <P> "You take from it what you bring to it," said Harry Chancey, vice president and  director of the broadcast center at New York's WNET, which will air  "Revelations" next month. "I didn't see it as negative. Work like this just has  to be given a chance. I look upon it as a new way of seeing things, a seminal  work in experiencing the icons and the society we live in."  </P> <P> "Revelations" was debated angrily at the public television conference in  Stockholm. "It was 90% Americans arguing with Americans," said WNPB's Mark  Samels, the co-producer and cameraman for "Revelations," who originated the  idea for the program and then two years ago recruited Watson to execute it.  </P> <P> Some Americans at the conference weren't enthusiastic about a foreigner,  Watson, controlling a program critical of America, Samels said. "One called  Larry Smith an aberration. Another one said you can't purport to make a show  about America set in a rural setting." And Stoner virtually begged European  broadcasters not to show it, Samels said.  </P> <P> "These were high-level people from public-TV stations. What the discussion  revealed was how intensely Americans need to be loved."  </P> <P> WNET's Chancey would like to see the "Revelations" concept extended, and he may  get his wish.  </P> <P> The West Virginia station is now assembling a consortium of  small-to-medium-sized public-TV stations for another BBC co-production that  would be titled "States of Mind," an eight-part series examining America from  the perspectives of families in other sections of the country.  </P> <P> It sounds exciting, just as "Revelations" is exciting and exactly the kind of  challenging and deeply indigenous work that fulfills the public TV mandate.  Except in Los Angeles, apparently.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Cirias; from the "National Newscast" -- </F> passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] German Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer, who  has been visiting our country since 13 February, said today  after meeting with President Violeta de Chamorro that German  cooperation will continue. He added that efforts are being made  to negotiate Nicaragua's debt with that European country.    In the meeting held this morning between FRG Deputy Foreign  Minister Helmut Schaefer and President Violeta de Chamorro, both  officials discussed the country's current situation. The German  deputy foreign minister said that the objective of his visit is  to corroborate that the friendship between the two countries  continues and that Germany is making efforts to maintain its  political presence here.    [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "I  have  known the president for many years. We maintain a friendship  and I have been positively impressed by this meeting. We  discussed bilateral relations between Germany and Nicaragua.  She delivered to me a message for the German president and we  have discussed ways to solve the foreign debt problem. We have  talked about German aid to Nicaragua and internal politics in  Nicaragua."    Schaefer said that despite the financial difficulties facing  Germany, efforts are being made to resolve the problem of  Nicaragua's debt with that country, which totals $600 million.    [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "In  general, I am optimistic we can reach a satisfactory agreement  in the negotiations."    He confirmed that German aid totalling about $25 million  will  be maintained.    [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "The  German cooperation will be maintained. However, the German  Economic Cooperation Ministry must make cutbacks in its budget.  These cuts are fundamental in view of the economic situation in  Europe and also in Germany. Unemployment in Germany has reached  rates unheard of following World War II.    "However, cooperation and funds for cooperation will  continue  to flow, although no increase can be made. There will not be  cutbacks or reductions. This is our objective and we will  continue to work in this direction."    Since his arrival last night, the German deputy foreign  minister announced he will meet with different Nicaraguan  sectors.    [Sergio Mario Blandon, Nicaraguan deputy foreign cooperation  minister] "It is a good opportunity to have the deputy foreign  minister here. As you may recall, last December we received the  visit of deputy minister (?Resvick). The constant visits of  German ministers and deputy ministers signifies their interest  in assisting our country."    At the Foreign Ministry, the renegotiation of the debt was  also discussed.    [Jose Pallais, Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister] "We have  insisted that the negotiation of this debt must be different.  Special treatment should be given to the military debt in  contrast with commercial aid or aid to support the balance of  payments."    This is the fifth time Mr. Schaefer has visited Nicaragua,  and today he was scheduled to meet with other government  officials and members of political parties.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / People: Non-executive directors Sir Clive Whitmore, 59, the former permanent under-sec-retary at the Home Office who took early retirement, is joining the board of merchant bankers NM Rothschild &amp; Sons. He has already joined the boards of Boots and Morgan Crucible and joins Rothschild as a non-executive director on December 1. Although he will be one of more than 20 non-execs at Rothschild, the merchant bank has taken the slightly unusual step of announcing that 'his principal task will be in the field of human resources'. Sir Clive has much experience in human resource work, not least in senior appointments and selection procedures. Rothschild has long had close ties to the Conservative government and Sir Clive is the latest in a growing list of ex-civil servants who have ended up in Rothschild's boardroom. These include Sir Frank Cooper, a former permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of Defence, Lord Armstrong, a former Cabinet Secretary, and Sir Derek Thomas, a former Foreign office official and ex-Ambassador to Italy. Sir Clive was principal private secretary to Margaret Thatcher for the first three years of her government and subsequently permanent secretary at the MoD and the Home Office. When he resigned from his last job there was speculation that his early departure may have been linked to policy differences with Michael Howard, the Home Secretary.</p>

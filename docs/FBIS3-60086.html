The Nigerian tourists, Mir Zafar, 32, and Amin Gaffy, 36,  who  are now visiting Thailand, said it was possible that smuggling  of narcotics out of Thailand had been suspended for the time  being as many key drug traffickers were arrested last month.    The two Nigerians were referring to an announcement made by  the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) last month that about 400  kg of heroin, including the 259 kg which was smuggled from  Thailand by sea to Nigeria, was seized in Lagos on December 30.    Heroin destined for Lagos from Thailand was seized on  several  occasions and a number of suspected Nigerian drug traffickers  arrested.    Tbe two Nigerian tourists who are interested in narcotics  affairs in Asia, especially Thailand, said that although major  narcotics routes from Burma, via Thailand, to international  markets are being blocked, it does not mean that the heroin  trafficking from this country to other parts of the world would  be halted in the longer run.    The two who arrived in Bangkok last week said Pakistani  mafias had played their key roles in recruiting Africans and  Nigerians as drug couriers and had formed a human rights group  to launch campaigns against the Thai government for alleged  inhumane treatment of foreign prisoners including Nigerians  serving sentences for drug offences.    The Pakistani drug ring leaders stil exist but they have  kept  a low profile since the large heroin seizures, the Nigerian  tourists said.    Officials from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board  (ONCB) said yesterday that they are following suspected foreign  drug couriers now in Thailand.    They will be arrested when sufficient evidence is acquired,  they said.</p>

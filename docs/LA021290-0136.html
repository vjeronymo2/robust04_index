			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TYSON BACK, RARING FOR REMATCH  </P> <P> Mike Tyson returned from Japan today, pledging to come back from his disputed  heavyweight title loss to James (Buster) Douglas.  </P> <P> "I've lost before," Tyson said as he was hustled through John F. Kennedy  Airport. "It's no big deal. I've always come back from a loss."  </P> <P> Tyson said he hopes to get back in the ring soon.  </P> <P> "I feel great," he said. "I have a slight swelling in my eye and, as soon as it  goes down, I'm ready to go back to training.  </P> <P> "I had a pretty bad performance, but I'm not going to make excuses. I'm just  going to go on and make better results."  </P> <P> Among those who met Tyson's Japan Air flight was Lou Duva, manager of Evander  Holyfield, who was scheduled to fight Tyson for the heavyweight championship in  June.  </P> <P> "When Tyson walked into the ring, I could see something was wrong," Duva said.  "He had no life. He didn't have that drive. He's not the fighter he was with  Kevin Rooney."  </P> <P> Tyson dismissed Rooney as his trainer a year ago. The Douglas bout on Sunday  was his third title defense without Rooney in his corner.  </P> <P> Tyson was accompanied by promoter Don King, who lodged a protest with the World  Boxing Council and World Boxing Assn. claiming Douglas had benefited from a  long count after Tyson knocked the challenger down near the end of the eighth  round.  </P> <P> King refused any comment.  </P> <P> Duva said the long count dispute was wrong.  </P> <P> "The ref is the boss in the ring at all times," Duva said. "I think it would be  a black eye for boxing if they take the title away from Douglas, but I know the  way they operate, they might order a rematch. But as far as I'm concerned, Mike  Tyson got knocked out."  </P> <P> Tyson said of the long count controversy: "The referee said he made a bad  mistake. Regardless of that, I'd be happy to get a rematch. I'll be better  prepared next time."  </P> <P> Airport crowds who recognized Tyson shouted encouragement, and Tyson responded  with a thumbs up sign as he climbed into a waiting limousine.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Electoral Tribunal, TE, from the </F> Atlapa Conventions Center in Panama City; read by TE President  Eduardo Valdes Escoffery; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] ...cast in the presidential elections, with only  32,842 or 3 percent of the votes annulled. In other words, a  turnout was 73.82 percent and the abstention rate was 26.10  percent.    From the time the first results were issued representing  only  11.8 percent of the voting tables, the figures have always  favored candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People  alliance.    Here are the latest figures available: Ernesto Perez  Balladares, 33.19 percent; Mireya Moscoso de Gruber [Democratic  Alliance], 28.86 percent; Ruben Blades [Papa Egoro Movement],  17.56 percent; Ruben Carles [Change 94], 16.36 percent; Eduardo  Vallarino [Christian Democratic Party], 2.15 percent; Samuel  Lewis Galindo [National Accord Alliance], 1.57 percent; and Jose  Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party], 0.32 percent.    The Electoral Tribunal must clarify that according to the  law, the National Vote-Counting Board must proclaim the official  results of the 8 May 1994 elections for president and vice  presidents of the Republic. Only 15 hours after the elections  and the closure of the polls, we have managed to unofficially  announce almost 90 percent of the results, which is  unprecedented in the history of Panamanian elections.    At this time, the TE's main office declares a recess until  1400 while the computer personnel continue to register the  results as they are received from the 547 tables that have not  yet been counted.    Issued in Panama City on 9 May 1994.    Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> SAN LUIS BARRIERS TO REMAIN  </P> <P> Temporary barricades installed on San Luis Street in April to discourage  drive-by shootings will remain in place for another 90 days while residents  consider other ways to deal with a gang problem.  </P> <P> The City Council this week heard from residents on San Luis Street who wanted  the barriers made permanent, and from residents on two neighboring streets who  objected because of added traffic on their streets.  </P> <P> Linda Bustos, who urged the temporary closure in April after a series of five  drive-by shootings, said there have been no shootings since. "I'm for keeping  the street closed because I feel safe," she said. But residents on adjacent San  Rafael and San Felipe streets said it is impractical to close every street  where shootings occur and that closures create traffic problems elsewhere.  </P> <P> Robert DeLoach, city public works director, recommended against closing the  street permanently because of the cost, estimated at $60,000, and the impact on  other streets.  </P></p>

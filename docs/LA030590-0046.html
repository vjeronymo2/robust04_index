			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: CULTURE'S ROOTS APPEAR MORE VEGAS THAN JAMAICA  </P> <P> Roots reggae is like 12-bar blues: The same elements are recycled with minimal  variation, so it's often a thin line that separates material laden with genre  cliches and music that powerfully evokes the best aspects of the tradition.  Culture's last two albums both landed well on the positive side of that border,  but the veteran vocal trio's hour-plus performance before a sparse crowd of  1,000 at the Hollywood Palladium on Friday reached those heights only  sporadically .  </P> <P> At times, Culture seemed to be veering surprisingly close to roots Vegas  culture. Lead singer Joseph Hill's blue cutaway jacket, silver sparkle tie and  matching handkerchief spoofed show-biz glitz, but the arrangements were too  techno-slick early in the set. Culture's finest moments came when it stripped  the sheen away and achieved reggae's characteristic trance dance behind the  mesmerizing harmonies of "Iron Sharpening Iron," "I'm Worried" and the  Rasta/gospel hybrid "This Train."  </P> <P> Second-billed Sugar Minott's effervescent work ethic was severely undercut by  the local AKB backing band, whose plodding tempos on the slower songs weighted  Minott down with a rhythmic anchor.

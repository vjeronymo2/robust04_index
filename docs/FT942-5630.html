			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Bronfman plays for Time against a critical audience: Bernard Simon explains why Seagram's new CEO is under scrutiny Edgar Bronfman Jr made no secret this week of his irritation with the speculation that has billowed around Seagram, the international drinks group controlled by the Bronfman family. Making his debut as Seagram's chief executive at the annual meeting in Montreal, Mr Bronfman hit out against 'inaccurate and baseless' reports about Seagram's intentions towards Time Warner, the powerful entertainment conglomerate in which Seagram has a 14.99 per cent stake. Mr Bronfman's concern is understandable. Seagram's new 39-year old CEO carries an immense burden. He needs to show Seagram shareholders - not least his father and uncle, who remain co-chairmen - that he can match the accomplishments of his grandfather, Sam Bronfman, who transformed a small Canadian liquor business into the world's biggest drinks company, and his father, Edgar Sr, who in his 23 years at the helm has greatly enlarged what 'Mr Sam' started. In particular, the younger Bronfman has to convince outsiders that Seagram's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) investment in Time Warner is a wise one. The entertainment group has been very much his project since Seagram secretly started buying shares in February 1993. Edgar Sr gave his son a ringing endorsement minutes before the annual meeting: 'He's got great judgment. For a young man of 39, he's got great wisdom.' During his 14 years with Seagram, Edgar Jr is credited with moving its liquor business away from mass-market, low-profit brands, and with spearheading two bold acquisitions. The 1987 purchase of Martell, the French cognac producer, has given Seagram a strong foothold in Asia. Another initiative was the 1988 acquisition of Tropicana Products, a leading US orange juice producer. Although Seagram had hoped for stronger earnings growth from Tropicana, it believes the rising popularity of fruit juices and Tropicana's high market share will pay off. Mr Bronfman provided further evidence of a fresh approach by unveiling a top-to-bottom 're-engineering' of Seagram's operations. Every part of the company will come under scrutiny in an attempt to cut costs and improve performance. None the less, the dalliance with Time Warner has failed to excite investors. The stake has barely been reflected in Seagram's share price, which stood at Dollars 31.13 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Critics are concerned that Mr Bronfman may be biting off more than he can chew, especially bearing in mind Time Warner's Dollars 15bn debt. They have been quick to cast doubt on the Time Warner investment by pointing to Mr Bronfman's fascination with show business, including his early career as a film-maker. These reservations have been fanned by the entertainment group's apparent reluctance to give its new shareholder a seat on the board. Mr Bronfman insisted this week that the concerns were 'unwarranted'. He maintained, as Seagram has all along, that the purchase of the Time Warner stock is a passive investment that follows the pattern set by Seagram's 25 per cent stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals group. Seagram has no plans at present to lift its Time Warner stake above 15 per cent. Mr Bronfman insisted: 'There is nothing wrong with anyone being interested in what is clearly the fastest-growing, most global industry in North America.' According to a recent article in the New Yorker magazine, the investment was the culmination of a lengthy process which included consultations with several outside advisers and a look at many other sectors, including luxury goods and fragrances. There is one important difference, however, between Seagram's investment in Time Warner and its stake in Du Pont. The chemicals group has been a motherlode to Seagram. Without Du Pont's dividends, which have totalled Dollars 575m over the past two years, it is unlikely that Seagram would have been able to afford Martell or Tropicana. The returns from Time Warner are unlikely to be so generous in the short term. But Mr Bronfman asked Seagram's shareholders for patience. He predicted that Time Warner's profits and share price would rise 'dramatically' over the next five to ten years. The stature of the third generation of Bronfmans will hinge on whether this prediction comes true.</p>

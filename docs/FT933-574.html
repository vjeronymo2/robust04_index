			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow helped by resurgent bond prices Wall Street PROGRAM trading and a surge in bond prices, which pushed long-term yields back below 6 per cent, provided a strong lift to US stock markets yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 24.59 higher at 3,567.70. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 4.17 to 461.80, nearing its closing all-time peak of 463.56 of August 31, while the American SE composite gained 1.91 at 456.44. The Nasdaq composite, which last week climbed to historic highs in spite of weakness in the wider market, maintained its surge and ended 5.30 stronger at a record 759.95. New York SE volume came to 245m shares. The week got off to a positive start, thanks primarily to the resurgent bond market. Last week's news that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee had shifted the bias of its monetary policy from an inclination to tightening back to a neutral stance was the fuel propelling the bond market yesterday. By late afternoon the 30-year bond was up more than one point, and the yield was back down to 6 per cent for the first time in several weeks. The bond rally heartened equity investors who, after seven days of flat or lower share prices, were in the mood to buy stocks again. Computerised buy programs kicked in almost from the start, and by the end of the first 30 minutes of trading the Dow was up 22 points. Investors were also encouraged by overnight gains on European equity markets, although the day's domestic news - a 1.3 per cent decline in August existing home sales - had a dampening effect upon sentiment. Paramount Communications rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 77 5/8 in volume of 2.4m shares on reports that the entertainment group's management, which two weeks ago accepted a Dollars 67.50 a share takeover bid from Viacom, is prepared to consider the rival Dollars 84.25 a share offer from the television shopping network QVC. Amid the uncertainty, Viacom advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 on the American SE, and QVC, listed on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 5/8 , a possible indication that investors believe that QVC will win the Paramount takeover battle. Falling interest rates were good for bank shares. JP Morgan, a Dow constituent, climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/8 , Citicorp added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 37, Chemical put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 44 7/8 , Chase Manhattan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 and Banc One firmed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 . The exception was BankAmerica, which declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 3/4 . Drug issues, still troubled by uncertainty surrounding President Clinton's health care reform plan, which was unveiled last week, mostly bucked the market trend. Pfizer eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 7/8 , Merck shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 and Warner-Lambert weakened Dollars  3/4 to 67 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks closed firmer for choice after moderate trading which was boosted by a large block trade in Czar Resources shares. The TSE 300 index gained just 1.5 at 3,983.8 and rising issues outnumbered declines by 397 to 334. Volume amounted to 52.1m shares valued at CDollars 485.5m. The day's turnover included a block trade of 8m Czar Resources shares. Ten of the 14 stock groups ended higher, with transportation up 1.06 per cent. The gold shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, falling 1.95 per cent as the New York spot bullion price receded USDollars 2.70 an ounce.</p>

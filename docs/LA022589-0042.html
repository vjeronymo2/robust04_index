			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE AND QUAYLE  </P> <P> I was enormously insulted by Greg Morrison's suggestion that Tom Cruise  obviously accounts for the popularity of "Rain Man" with female audience  members. ("What's Driving 'Rain Man?' Women," by Nina Easton, Calendar, Feb.  10).  </P> <P> Isn't this reminiscent of some members of the Republican Party suggesting a  cute vice presidential candidate like Dan Quayle would attract women voters and  close up the gender gap? I don't mean to suggest Tom Cruise in any way  resembles our vacuous VP, but I went to "Rain Man" because of the subject  matter and Dustin Hoffman's brilliance as an actor.  </P> <P> SUSAN MASON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

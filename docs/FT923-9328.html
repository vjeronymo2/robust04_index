Johnson, regarded as a virtual certainty to win gold before the Games began, ran a sluggish semi-final and finished only sixth. Britain's John Regis came second in the other semi-final to clinch a place in today's final. The race was won by American Mike Marsh, who came within a whisker of breaking the world 200m record of 19.72 seconds set by Italy's Pietro Mennea at altitude in Mexico in 1979. UK sprinter Linford Christie, in fifth place, failed to qualify.</p>

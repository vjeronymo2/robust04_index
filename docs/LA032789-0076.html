			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> NBC's "Saturday Night Live" got a dig in at a Christian group and two major  advertisers who had objected to language used on previous shows Saturday when  guest host Mary Tyler Moore said the word penis twice in her opening monologue.  Last week, Ralston Purina and General Mills had announced that they would no  longer advertise on the program after they received letters from the American  Family Assn., a Christian organization based in Mississippi that monitors  television programs for what it perceives to be morally offensive content,  protesting a sketch in which the word penis was used 28 times. Moore first used  the word discussing her longtime association with wholesome family  entertainment and assuring the audience that "that word" would not be uttered  on Saturday's show. She then concluded her monologue, saying, musical guest  "Elvis Costello's penis is here tonight, so stay tuned." ALEENE MacMINN and  STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

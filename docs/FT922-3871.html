			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / DTI launches inquiry into Mirror group A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the tangled affairs of Mirror Group Newspapers, the heart of the late Robert Maxwell's publishing empire, was launched yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry. The announcement of the inquiry by Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, more than seven months after Mr Maxwell's death could cause greater uncertainty for the newspaper group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People. It could also delay further the sale of the majority stake in the group which is now, in effect, controlled by a group of banks led by National Westminster. The DTI inspectors, Mr John Laugharne Thomas QC and accountant Mr Raymond Thomas Turner, have been asked to investigate 'the affairs and membership' of MGN and, in particular, the flotation in April last year of 49 per cent of the company's shares which raised Pounds 245.5m. A total of 196.39m shares were offered, with Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, offering 114m in the UK. Apart from employees' stakes, more than 78m shares were offered to institutional shareholders outside the UK by Salomon Brothers International. One of the key issues to be investigated will be whether the assurances given at the time by the company and its advisers that there would be a 'ring fence' separating MGN from other Maxwell interests were credible. Other issues are likely to include statements made in the flotation document about the state of the MGN pension funds and the company's property leasing arrangements. Yesterday's government announcement revived ironic memories of a previous DTI inspectors' report in 1971 which Robert Maxwell complained about for the rest of his life. That report concluded that Mr Maxwell had shown 'reckless and unjustified optimism' in making statements he must have known to be untrue. 'We regret having to conclude that notwithstanding Mr Maxwell's acknowledged abilities and energy, he is not in our opinion a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly-quoted company,' it said. The appointment of the inspectors yesterday came as Maxwell pensioners marched to the House of Commons to protest against the more than Pounds 400m missing from their pension funds. The issue is due to be debated today in parliament. Some in the City expressed surprise at the decision to set up an inquiry so many months after the scandal first broke. 'This owes more to the government's political timetable than the position of the company,' one banker said. Ministers said privately the decision had been taken because the inquiries of the Serious Fraud Office were going in a different direction. Ministers were keen that matters of corporate governance be properly explored. Key witnesses for the inspectors who have been appointed under sections 432(2) and 442 of the Companies Act 1985 will be senior executives of Samuel Montagu and Smith New Court, brokers for the flotation. Sir Michael Richardson, Smith New Court chairman, declined to comment. Samuel Montagu said it would co-operate fully. The news of the inquiry comes at a particularly difficult time for MGN. The company is in the final stages of negotiating a Pounds 250m two-year finance facility designed to meet its needs until its future has been determined. Full accounts were expected to be published at the end of this month in advance of a relisting of its shares, suspended since late last year. It is unclear whether the relisting will now be held up, although specialist advisers to the company said a delay was far from inevitable. A lot of the basic work has already been done which should help the DTI inspectors. At the beginning of this year the directors of MGN commissioned consultants Ernst &amp; Young to carry out a full study. MGN last night declined to comment other than to say it welcomed the decision to hold an inquiry and would co-operate fully with the DTI inspectors.

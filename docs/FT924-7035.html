			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lively export market boosts Chicago grains NEWS THAT the record US maize crop is being shipped overseas at a healthy rate has taken pressure off grain prices at the Chicago Board of Trade. Maize for December delivery surpassed Dollars 2.12 a bushel yesterday, and having passed that mile stone, continued on to score a high of Dollars 2.15 1/4 in late trading. Chicago wheat futures were continuing Monday's advance, also supported by export news. December futures contracts for maize and wheat in Chicago are close to expiry, and as next Friday's first notices for intended deliveries approach, commercial grain merchants and the investment funds that operate in grain futures for profit are engaged in their usual brinkmanship. The funds were said to be buying maize yesterday to cover previous sales. US grain prices have been on the rise in spite of the US Department of Agriculture's upward revisions of crop estimates last week. In its regular monthly report the USDA said the US maize crop would be a record 9.33bn bushels - a 4 per cent increase from its October estimate. The US soyabean harvest has also reached record proportions, and is now estimated at 2.17bn bushels, a 9 per cent increase over 1991. Traders said the huge crop had already been factored into futures prices and that as the harvest is completed quality factors would begin to come into play. 'Historically, the corn (maize) crop doesn't get any bigger (after the November USDA estimates),' says Mr Warren King, senior grain analyst with Cargill Investors Services. About 1bn bushels of maize remain in the fields and while the harvest could be completed this weekend, winter storms in Iowa and Ohio have left fields wet and in poor condition. The abundant harvest has forced some farmers to store their excess out-of-doors, and that grain, as well as some of the late-harvested maize, is expected to test poorly for starch and oil content and be subject to mould. 'I expect we will be paying a premium for quality corn next year,' Mr King said. In a regular weekly report on Monday, the USDA said wheat and maize shipments were running ahead of last year's. Last week 36.6m bushels of maize and 32m bushels of wheat were inspected for export, well above grain trade estimates. December wheat futures, which closed on Monday at Dollars 3.76 per bushel, have gained about 40 cents since the September announcement that the US Export Enhancement Program was itself being enhanced prior to the national elections. Of the 29m tonnes of wheat exports targeted for the programme, about 12m have been sold. Yesterday USDA approved EEP wheat sales to Algeria and Morocco. CBoT soyabean prices rose on fund buying and talk that China might be in the market for US soyameal as well as last week's large exports, traders said, reports Reuter. The rise was also aided by news that 22.97m bushels of soyabeans had been inspected for export.</p>

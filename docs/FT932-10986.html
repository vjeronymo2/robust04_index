			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Trading interests YEAR AFTER weary year leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries agree to complete the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and fail to do so. The contrast between their protestations and their achievements is ridiculous. Can anything be done to bring their actions in line with their words? Only last week, for example, the G7's finance ministers and central bank governors stated that 'the further opening of the international trading system is indispensable for maximising world growth. A successful growth strategy requires prompt and appropriate conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Protectionism retards growth and must be resisted.' Meanwhile, President Clinton himself pledged 'exceptional actions' to bring about such an agreement. So why has the round already taken six and a half years with no end in sight? The answer is that the leaders do not mean what they say. More precisely, they mean only half of what they say. They think it would be wonderful for the Uruguay Round to be crowned by the liberalisation of the trade policies of every country except their own. No wonder they find it so difficult to agree. Leaders need to be reminded about the chief purpose of trade, which is to widen opportunities for consumption. The report published this morning by the UK's publicly funded National Consumer Council provides such a reminder. It argues, for example, that EC consumers will pay an average of Pounds 740 extra for each Japanese car as a result of the export restraint agreed by Japan; that anti-dumping duties on electronics goods cost EC consumers some Pounds 1.3bn a year; and that the common agricultural policy raises the food bill of the average family of four by over Pounds 17 a week. Protection saves jobs, say its protagonists. This is a myth, counters the NCC. Jobs may be saved in one industry, but at the expense of jobs elsewhere. Just as mythical is the rather newer idea that free trade threatens the environment. Anyone who knows anything about the former communist countries will recognise this as nonsense. Poverty is an important cause of environmental degradation, while opportunities to trade are among the most important routes from poverty. Most of the NCC's recommendations fall into two categories. In the first are those for liberalisation - of the common agricultural policy, for example. In the second are those for transparency and accountability. How, for example, has it been possible for EC governments to make the Japanese form export cartels against EC consumers? How has it been possible to impose high anti-dumping duties without public fuss? The answer is that neither policy has been open to public debate and assessment. The most important NCC recommendation may, therefore, be its call for an independent body to undertake the evaluation of trade policy measures. Its proposed right of access to non-confidential information for consumer representatives could prove equally important. So long as even well-intentioned policy-makers are locked in a struggle with narrow producer groups, they will grant protection, while calling for liberalisation. The NCC suggests governments should empower consumer bodies to participate in the debate. This would help consumers. But it would also help governments themselves to do what they know they ought to do.</p>

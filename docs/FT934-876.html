			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph may buy into The Independent The board of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, gave the go-ahead yesterday for talks on a possible new minority shareholder. A number of potential investors ranging from Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group, which controls The Daily Telegraph, Lord Rothermere's Associated Newspapers and Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, have expressed interest. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, has also expressed an informal interest. The board yesterday approved in principle a three-year business plan drawn up by Mr Patrick Morrissey, the recently appointed chief executive. The plan is designed to rejuvenate the papers, which have suffered significant circulation loss over the past six months. Mr Morrissey last week made it clear that the aim was to approve the business plan and then go forward to arrange new financing for the company. After the board meeting the company said: 'A number of different options were examined which would allow a secure future to emerge from the restructuring process now being undertaken.' The statement continued: 'Considerable progress has been made and a further statement will be made early in the new year.' The options being considered range from raising necessary finance from existing shareholders through a rights issue through to bringing in a new minority shareholder to a full takeover by rival newspaper publishers. The leading option at the moment is bringing in a national newspaper proprietor to take a 20 per cent to 30 per cent stake. Mr Black is the most likely candidate if a way can be found of ringfencing the editorial independence of the titles.</p>

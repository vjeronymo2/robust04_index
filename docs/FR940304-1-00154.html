Economic Justification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Conventional ovens. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas non-self-cleaning ovens is $5.92; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $14.40, levels 3 and 4 are $29.75, and level 5 is $61.64. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric non-self-cleaning ovens is $4.21; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $8.45, levels 3 and 4 are $19.11, and level 5 is $100.12. See Technical Support Document, Tables 1.9 and 1.11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas non- self-cleaning ovens at level 1 is $13.84; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $36.56, levels 3 and 4 are $69.00, and level 5 is $161.09. For electric non-self-cleaning ovens the cost at level 1 is $8.84; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $18.73, levels 3 and 4 are $41.30, and level 5 is $213.80. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $8.38 for gas non-self-cleaning ovens; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $13.32; standard levels 3 and 4 by $14.82; and standard level 5 by $15.35. For electric non-self-cleaning ovens level 1 would reduce energy expenses by $4.22; standard level 2 by $6.07; levels 3 and 4 by $9.45; and level 5 by $14.63. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional ovens show that revised standards would have little or no effect on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.5 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar effects on long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conventional cooking tops. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas cooking tops is $0.78; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $15.57, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $41.71. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric-coil cooking tops is zero, since for this class level 1 is the same as the baseline; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $2.28, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $5.31. See Technical Support Document, Tables 1.4 and 1.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas cooking tops at level 1 is $1.63; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $113.38 and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $168.08. For electric-coil cooking tops, the cost at level 1 is unchanged, since it is at the baseline; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $4.79, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $11.24. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $0.95 for gas cooking tops; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $16.09 and standard levels 3, 4 and 5 by $16.68. For electric-coil cooking tops, level 1 would not reduce energy expenses since it is at the baseline; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $0.93 and levels 3, 4 and 5 by $1.15. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

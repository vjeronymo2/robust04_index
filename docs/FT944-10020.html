			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Unilever's lolly The Persil Power controversy has exposed weaknesses in Unilever's brand management skills but it has not had a significant impact on earnings. Third-quarter figures were robust, indicating that the profits momentum evident at the half-year stage is still in place. The figures suggest that buoyant returns from ice-cream and tea were offset only to a limited extent by the vicious competition in European detergents markets. The message is that across the vast and diverse Unilever empire more is going right than is going awry. The margin improvement - especially marked in the US as result of rationalisation in the detergents sector - is likely to prove sustainable after a long period of decline. The growth of businesses outside its main, mature markets is also an encouraging pointer for the future: in the 'rest of the world' category, which includes fast-growing emerging markets, sales were up by 18 per cent, with volumes and operating profits up by more than 10 per cent. But for rationalisation costs, margins would have risen sharply here too. Analysts expect Unilever to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.4bn in the full year, up from Pounds 1.9bn in 1993. Thereafter profits growth is likely to fall to single figures. This means that, in the medium term, earnings will grow more slowly than for the market as a whole. Even so, Unilever deserves to maintain its market rating because of its robustness and skill in extracting value from low-growth industries. The modest prospective yield of under 3 per cent will, however, limit pronounced outperformance.</p>

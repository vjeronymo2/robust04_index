			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: MUSIC FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION  </P> <P> Marc-Antoine Charpentier's harmonic vision, his ability to create splendid  contrasts between his vocal and instrumental forces, were part of a revolution  in French music that took place a century before the more celebrated (and  bloody) social and political Revolution of 1789.  </P> <P> The glories of Charpentier's style are exemplified in his 1692 "Te Deum," at  once music with the trumpets-and-drums swagger we associate with the Court of  Versailles and a work of the sweetest Italianate lyricism.  </P> <P> The performance of the "Te Deum," as centerpiece of a program of the composer's  liturgical works (on Harmonia Mundi France 901298), is by the vocal and  period-instrumental forces of Les Arts Florissants under the direction of  William Christie, who produced results that are both admirable for their  scholarship and irresistible for their joyous energy.  </P> <P> Among the music that was making the rounds at the time of the storming of the  Bastille was that of Etienne-Nicolas Mehul (1763-1817), whose four symphonies  are played by the Gulbenkian Foundation Orchestra of Lisbon under Michel  Swierczewski on a pair of Nimbus CDs (5184/5).  </P> <P> On present evidence, Mehul's most noteworthy quality, aside from the  aimlessness of his slow movements, is his general disdain for French models in  favor, variously, of Haydn, Weber, Rossini and particularly Mozart and  Beethoven, whose G-minor (K. 550) and Fifth Symphonies, respectively, are  tediously constant -- if not necessarily conscious -- points of reference.  </P> <P> It was as a composer of operas that the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini found  favor in his adopted French homeland around the time of the Revolution. But  while there are occasional revivals of his 'Medee" and "Anacreon" in Europe,  Cherubini's broader reputation today is based on Beethoven's admiration for his  works (the feeling was not reciprocated), for his having instructed an  ungrateful Berlioz in the rigors of counterpoint, and for writing a series of  powerful, if severe, works for chorus and orchestra.  </P> <P> The best known of these is the Requiem in C minor commissioned in 1817 to  commemorate Louis XVI's execution by guillotine a quarter-century earlier. It  is scored for mixed chorus (without soloists) and a late-Beethoven-sized  orchestra with the addition of bass trombone and tam-tam, both used to stunning  effect in the "Dies Irae."  </P> <P> The Requiem, which has past identifications with Arturo Toscanini and Carlo  Maria Giulini, has now been entrusted to the less exalted hands of the young  East German conductor Claus Peter Flor, who nevertheless leads it with  commanding sensitivity. His Berlin Symphony makes a brave sound, and the Berlin  Radio Chorus is well balanced and accurate. The live-performance recording is  gorgeously lifelike (RCA 60059).  </P> <P> Unlike Cherubini, Berlioz did not disdain martial pomp, as witness his  "Symphonie funebre et triomphale," written in 1840 to celebrate the 10th  anniversary of the July Revolution that toppled the absolutist regime of  Charles X.  </P> <P> In his memoirs, Berlioz recalls the disastrous premiere, which found him  conducting a military band of 200 musicians while walking backwards -- Berlioz,  not the band -- along one of Paris' main boulevards toward the Place de la  Bastille.  </P> <P> "As we were marching," Berlioz writes, "nothing could be made out more than 10  yards away. Finally, the National Guard, tired of standing in the blazing sun  in the Place de la Bastille, began to march off to the accompaniment of some 50  side drums maintaining a relentless barrage throughout the Apotheosis" (the  symphony's rabble-rousing finale).  </P> <P> "That," he continues, "is how they regard the role of public occasions in  France: By all means let it figure as an attraction -- for the eye."  </P> <P> Perhaps the best way to hear this music is on recordings, particularly when  presented as lustily as it is (on Nimbus 5175) by British trumpeter/conductor  John Wallace and his 60-odd member wind ensemble, the Wallace Collection.  </P> <P> Wallace augments the Berlioz with band music from the (first) Revolutionary  period by Gossec, Cherubini and Rouget de Lisle, his "Hymne a la liberte" -- a  k a "La Marseillaise" -- in Wallace's arrangement.  </P> <P> The last-named is sung with appropriate abandon, in a language purported to be  French, by the Leeds Festival Chorus, which also adds its obscure mouthings to  the "Symphonie funebre."  </P></p>

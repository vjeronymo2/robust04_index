			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hurd gives pledge over EC finances MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night signalled his determination to take a tough stance in negotiations on European Community finances if the Conservatives are re-elected, Ralph Atkins writes. Tories knew 'how to get the best terms for Britain', he said in a speech at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The Conservatives were 'committed but not uncritical' of the EC. Europe would prosper through widening opportunities for individual citizens and businesses, he added. Mr Hurd deliberately focused his speech to attack what he described as Labour's 'amazing contradictions and confusions' over Europe.</p>

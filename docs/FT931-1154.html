			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals downturn INTEREST charges depressed pre-tax profits at Community Hospitals Group, the private hospital and nursing home company, from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 1.86m for the six months to December 31. Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, blamed the conjunction of two events: the completion of two large developments resulting in higher interest and a fall in hospital revenues. Completion of the developments resulted in a charge to the profit and loss account of previously capitalised interest. Charges were Pounds 865,000, against a previous gain of Pounds 154,000. In January the group spent Pounds 5m to acquire three nursing homes. The 'best view' of profits for the full year showed a range of Pounds 6m to Pounds 6.5m, against Pounds 6.8m in 1992. The continuing care division raised operating profits from Pounds 540,000 to Pounds 660,000 in the first half while the hospital division reported static profits at Pounds 2.1m. Group turnover was Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 19.3m). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.4p, payable from earnings of 4.3p (6.2p) per share.</p>

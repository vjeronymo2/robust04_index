			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: CanPac outlook remains dim CANADIAN Pacific, the diversified rail, energy and resources group, said it did not anticipate any recovery in the Canadian economy until well into the second half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens. The company posted a loss of CDollars 914m (USDollars 768m), or CDollars 2.87 a share, for 1991, after special charges of CDollars 898m to cover write-downs in its investment in Laidlaw, spending cuts at its rail subsidiary, and a mill shutdown by its forest products unit. Canadian Pacific, in its annual report, said trading conditions would remain difficult in the current year, with low oil and gas, newsprint and pulp prices. However, the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, from a peak 89 US cents last year to around 84 cents, is expected to help foreign exchange profit earned by the resource units.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column by "citizen Mustafa Fahmi </F> al-Tamimi from al-Khalis, Diyala Governorate:" "Where Do the  Letters and Parcels of Iraq's Friends Go?"]    [Text] Many sincere friends from the Arab homeland and  other world nations have denounced the unjust blockade which has  been imposed on our struggling country in all fields, including  the cultural field. No doubt, they are right in their  denunciation. But if these sincere ones have denounced the  position of the Arabs who are colluding with imperialism and  Zionism, we are astonished about the position that has been  taken by others in imposing a different kind of blockade on us.  Do not be amazed, for here are the details.    We are members of the al-Khalis Youth Committee of the  Ambassador League for International Pen Pals, which belongs to  the General Federation of Iraqi Youths, Diyala branch. Our  league has succeeded in making a name for itself, pen pals from  different countries. It has also contributed toward breaking  through the cultural blockade that has been imposed on us, since  we have received many letters of solidarity with Iraq, the  Iraqis, and their beloved leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve  and protect him. The letters expressed sentiments of support  for the just Iraqi stand, thanks to our efforts in explaining  our position and answering our friends' many questions, which  revealed the extent of the false Western propaganda to which  they have been exposed.    Unfortunately, however, most of the valuable parcels coming  from our friends do not reach us, although they have been sent  by registered mail. At first, we thought that only our league  faced this problem, then we discovered to our great amazement  that many other pen pals face the same problem in the country.    So, I personally checked with the central post office in  Baghdad on 12 April. We asked them about the parcels. Their  answer was: Make sure about registered mail numbers. Yet, most  of our friends' letters carried registered mail numbers and they  also are surprised that the parcels did not arrive!! The answer  was vague. Is it right for these parcels to get lost so easily,  and who is responsible for this?</p>

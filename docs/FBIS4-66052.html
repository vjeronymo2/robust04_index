			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["UM/mdl."-attributed report: "Somber Prospects for Russia"] </F>   [Text] Halle/Berlin -- Boris Yeltsin's announcements that  he will order Russia's upswing by decree meets with skepticism  among the economic research institutes. "This fits into the  longstanding practice of constantly changing the tax laws," the  German Economic Research Institute (DIW) in Berlin says. The  fact that Russia is not making progress is primarily due to the  failed economic policy. All positive approaches are  "overcompensated for by escalating misdevelopments in central  fields of economic policy." The forecasts for an economic  upswing are, therefore, extremely restrained. Despite the  speedy reduction of corporate taxes, there is no sufficient  security for investors in Russia. One can hardly see any  progress in the necessary restructuring of the Russian economy.  The liberalization of export quotas, which has now been  promised, is only patchwork, too, because, in the view of the  DIW experts, all energy exports -- the main source of foreign  currency -- are not affected by it.    The research institutes DIW (Berlin), IWH [Halle Economic  Research Institute] (Halle), and IW [Institute of German  Economics] (Kiel) have listed the consequences that Russia is  facing because of that. Their devastating assessment of the  situation: Indications are accumulating that mass unemployment  is unavoidable.    The joint expert report judges Moscow's policy harshly. Even  though one can still notice "reform rhetoric," in reality there  is "no strength for the necessary structural change." The lack  of concepts of those who guide the economy can be seen in the  overall economic data. Thus, in 1993 the GDP declined by 12  percent, after it had gone down by double-digit rates during  each of the three previous years. With a drop of 16 percent  (1992: minus 18 percent), industrial production is hit  particularly.    The authors of the report criticize the fact that,  nevertheless, private consumption increased slightly last year.  Looking at the overall economy, one cannot speak of a decline  in the standard of living at all. Given the collapse of the  economic performance, the unchanged level of consumption  logically leads to a decline in investments (most recently minus  15 percent). This expresses an "avoidance of structural  change." The same goes for the labor market. There, the  unemployment rate of 5 percent does not adequately reflect the  obsolete structures.    The report describes the financial markets as completely  insufficient. The defects are the result of marked neglect in  terms of order policy. The financial system is abused to  preserve inefficient structures. One consequence: The illegal  export of capital, which was estimated at at least $15 billion  last year. At the end of 1993, foreign debts amounted to $80  billion.</p>

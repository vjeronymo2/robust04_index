			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vlado Trisic] </F>   [Text] The enemy offensive on Mount Majevica is not  abating. What is more, it is becoming increasingly intensive by  the day. Civilian houses are increasingly being targeted by the  enemy. According to reports that arrived this afternoon from the  East Bosnian corps of the army of the Serbian republic, today,  the 8th day of the offensive, the enemy has fired more than 200  shells at the Stolice relay station and stepped up  infantry-artillery attacks on Piperi and Miroslavci, north of  Lopare, from the direction of Celic. Members of NATO today  wholeheartedly extended help in the latest Muslim offensive on  Majevica. They have been carrying out intensive reconnaissance  flights and breaking the sound barrier by flying low around this  mountain. Despite the strong attacks, the Serbian positions  have remained unaltered. As we have learned, there were no  casualties among the Serbian fighters. As we report, which is  shortly before 1500, the fighting is still going on.</p>

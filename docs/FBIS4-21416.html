			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A number  of water conservation specialists of Guangdong Province  yesterday (21 March) warned against a water resources crisis in  Guangdong.    The specialists gave the warning at a meeting here on the  eve  of the ``World Water Day.''    At the meeting, the specialists sounded the alarm with a  series of figures. The average volume of water resources of  Guangdong Province is about 186 billion cubic meters, ranking  fifth in China, and the per capita volume is about 2,800 cubic  meters, ranking tenth in China, 20 percent higher than the  average for the whole country, but less than the world's average  by one-third. The specialists pointed out that these water  resources cannot be fully utilized because of extremely uneven  distribution in terms of time and place. Each year, 80 percent  of the water flows into the sea as floods, while the volume of  water is very small in dry seasons. Zhanjiang is one of the  five dry areas in China. Water pollution has intensified the  contradiction between supply and demand of water resources. The  water shortage will spread from coastal and economically  developed areas to other areas except the ``Xi Jiang corridor.''  At present, the economic development of coastal areas such as  Shanwei, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Honghai Bay, Daya Bay,  Shangxiachuan Island, Hailing Island, Donghai Island, and Haian,  have been seriously impeded by the shortage of water resources.    In view of the increasingly serious crisis of water  resources, the specialists urged the whole society to strengthen  the sense of water, and to change the practice of using water at  will and of using water free of charge. They called for unified  planning for water resources, rational development and  exploitation of water resources, saving water, and using market  mechanisms to protect water resources.</p>

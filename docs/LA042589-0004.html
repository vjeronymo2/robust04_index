			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israelis rampaged through the West Bank city of Hebron, witnesses said,  smashing shop and car windows after Palestinians stoned their tour buses.  Elsewhere in the occupied territories, Arab hospitals said that Israeli troops  shot and wounded 19 Palestinians on the third successive day of heavy  casualties. The rampage in Hebron, a stronghold of hard-line Jewish settlers,  was the second incident in three days in which Jews were accused of retaliating  against Palestinians who stoned their vehicles. Israeli troops broke up the  confrontation with tear gas and shots in the air, news agencies said. No  injuries were reported.  </P></p>

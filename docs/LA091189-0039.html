			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLEMP'S REMARKS ON AUSCHWITZ  </P> <P> The editorial certainly is a new low. How dare you put the Polish cardinal down  for speaking the truth! How dare the Jews try to tell the Catholic Church or  Poland where it can or cannot place a convent. A convent which houses nuns  praying for, among others, dead Jews. What harm is the convent doing? What evil  thing? In the first place, the convent is on the edge of Auschwitz, not smack  dab in the heart of it.  </P> <P> Second, aren't we talking about Polish land? What would the U.S. think if a  foreign group came here and tried to dictate where we could put what. Americans  would go through the roof and rightly so. The Jews who were beaten were  illegally trespassing. They were lucky that was all that happened to them.  After all, Palestinian children protesting Israeli occupation of their land  have been shot!  </P> <P> I think the Jews would serve their public image, not to mention moral ethics,  if they would leave the nuns to their prayers and concentrated a lot more  attention on the holocaust they are creating in the Middle East.  </P> <P> GERALD ROEMER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

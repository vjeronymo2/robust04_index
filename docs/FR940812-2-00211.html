			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. The expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds considered by the Boards include: elimination of certain duplicative expenses of separate funds and of separate legal entities; spreading of relatively fixed expenses across larger asset bases; potential increased sales of the surviving funds due to the ability of FAIF to offer a ``full line'' of funds; and facilitation of portfolio management. The potential benefits to the Adviser considered by the Boards include potentially reduced expenses for advisory fee waivers to the extent that the total expense ratios before waivers of the combined funds decrease as a result of the Reorganizations. The Boards found that the expected advantages to the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds outweighed the potential benefits to the Adviser. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Applicants have agreed not to make any material changes to the reorganization agreements that affect the application without the prior approval of the SEC staff. Applicants also have agreed not to waive, amend, or modify any provision of the reorganization agreements that is required by state or federal law in order to effect the Reorganizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of any other person is an affiliated person of that person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 17(a), in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered company, or any company controlled by such registered company, any security or other property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 17(b) provides that the Commission may exempt a transaction from the provisions of section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases or sales of substantially all of the assets of registered investment companies that are affiliated persons solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers, provided that certain conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. As noted above, the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds have a common investment adviser. Thus, the Reorganizations would be exempt from the provisions of section 17(a) by virtue of rule 17a&hyph;8, but for the fact that the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds may be affiliated for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. Boulevard Bank and its affiliates hold of record more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of each of the Acquired Funds and hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. Because of this ownership, each Acquired Fund is an affiliated person of Boulevard Bank under section 2(a)(3)(B). Boulevard Bank is an affiliated person of the Adviser because it is under common ownership and control with the Adviser. The Adviser, in turn, is an affiliated person of each Acquiring Fund under section 2(a)(3)(E) by virtue of its investment advisory relationship with these funds. Therefore, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of an affiliated person of each Acquired Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

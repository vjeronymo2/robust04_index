			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F> "Another Karabakh Settlement Attempt Fails. Baku Believes That  Middlemen Have Taken Armenian Side"]    [Excerpts] Negotiations on a settlement of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which took place on 4 and 5 May  in Bishkek under the auspices of negotiators of a CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group and the Russian  Federation Government, did not, as many observers predicted,  contribute to the solution of the sharp contradictions between  official Baku and the Armenian side. [passage omitted]    The call on the conflicting sides to cease fire on the night  of 9 May sounds at least strange given that by refusing to sign  the protocol Baku has effectively assumed no cease-fire  obligations. An official spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign  Ministry, who asked not to be identified, told your NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA correspondent that Russia and chiefs of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, who formally acted as middlemen at  the Bishkek meeting, have in many instances effectively backed  the Armenian side's demands, a stance that has become a factor  of pressure of sorts on the Azerbaijani delegation, which  nevertheless did not sign the final protocol. On the day when  consultations on the Karabakh settlement started in Bishkek, the  Azerbaijani leader left for Brussels, where a document on  Azerbaijan's joining the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program  was signed. According to available reports, NATO chiefs have  stated their organization's readiness to take necessary steps to  establish security and stability in the region. The fact that  on his way from Brussels to Baku Geydar Aliyev made a brief  stopover in the Turkish capital, Ankara, underlines the  importance attached by the Baku authorities to Turkey's support  in the current difficult situation.

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Motoring: Cars to spend your own money on Should motorists spending their own money buy new or used cars? Commonsense dictates used, if only to beat the hefty initial depreciation that affects all new cars. Indeed, about twice as many used cars are bought each year as new ones. Forget the financial arguments, though. There is something special about the feel - even the smell - of a new car. Three I have been driving would appeal to genuine private motorists who cannot resist the temptation of buying new but must watch initial cost carefully: the Seat Ibiza, Hyundai Lantra and Proton Persona. The Ibiza is the latest small car to come from the Volkswagen Group's Spanish subsidiary. Although its looks are individual, its mechanicals are mainly VW. I tried two Ibizas: first a 1.8 GLXi five-door (Pounds 10,495), and then a 1.9 CLX diesel five-door at Pounds 8,995. As this is Pounds 1,000 cheaper than a VW Golf LD with an identical engine, it is quite a bargain. There is also a three-door Ibiza diesel, no different under the skin and priced even more keenly at Pounds 7,595. The diesels do not have the 1.8-litre petrol car's electric windows but power-assisted steering is standard. Although, on paper, the 90-horsepower 1.8 GLXi is much nippier, the 68hp diesel has almost the same torque (pulling power at a given engine speed). This gives it such good pick-up that their performance feels little different. The diesel held its own on the motorway just as easily and was a clear winner at the pump, averaging 48 mpg (5.9 l/100 km) compared with the petrol car's 36 mpg (7.85 l/100 km). An Ibiza diesel would be hard to beat as an economical runabout with legs long enough for relaxed and economical holiday journeys. Build quality is good and the seats comfortable. Both the Malaysian Proton Persona 1.5 GLi and Korean Hyundai Lantra are Japanese-type cars in all but price. Well, almost. Compared with similarly-sized Hondas or Toyotas, there is a certain lack of finesse, and the Proton's ride was a bit knobbly on roughish roads. Low initial cost is a powerful argument, however, when a car is being bought out of taxed income or perhaps with a lump sum on retirement. For a modest Pounds 9,770, the buyer of a Proton Persona 1.5GLi five-door gets a vehicle comparable in size with a Ford Mondeo or Vauxhall Cavalier, which cost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000 more. The Proton lacked power steering. Nor did it have a sun roof, central locking or electric windows. But the radio/tape player did not sound like a cheapie and the five-speed gearbox had a delightfully light shift (as, for that matter, did those of the Ibiza and the Lantra). The 12-valve, 1.5-litre engine is like that of the old Mitsubshi Lancer and is, thus, a little long in the tooth. But it ran sweetly, and the fairly low overall gearing made acceleration brisk enough to satisfy all but those obsessed with performance. Consumption is around 38 mph (7.4 l/100 km). For those whose expectations (and resources) are greater, there are versions of the Persona with new 1.6-litre, 16-valve engines and power-assisted steering from Pounds 10,410. The Hyundai Lantra. I drove was the top of the range 1.8-litre CD. It had power-steering, with anti-lock brakes, a driver-side airbag, power sun roof and air-conditioning. It costs Pounds 13,299 (Pounds 14,098 with automatic transmission), which is about Pounds 2,000 less than you would pay for a European or Japanese equivalent. The Lantra, quite low-geared at 20mph (32 kph per 1,000 rpm) in fifth, was notably quick off the mark. High engine revolutions when motorway cruising do not help fuel consumption, though; the Lantra averages around 30 mpg (9.4 l/100km). A safety feature familiar to American motorists, but barely known on cars in Europe, is an interlock between the starter motor and clutch. Unless you press the pedal right down when you turn the key, the starter will not work. This is something that would be appreciated by absent-minded drivers who leave parked cars in gear.</p>

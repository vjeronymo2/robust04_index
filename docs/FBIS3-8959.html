He held talks  with leaders of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina  Hungarians, then travelled to Mol, the headquarters of the Vox  Humana aid organization.    Jeszenszky is visiting Vojvodina to mark March 15, and will  attend the ceremonies honouring the anniversary. He will also  hold talks with Radoslav Bulajic, the first deputy of the  federal foreign minister.    In a brief statement to MTI's correspondent, Jeszenszky said  March 15 is particularly important for the Hungarians in  Vojvodina. In 1848, there was fighting in Vojvodina during the  Hungarian freedom fight (the area was part of Hungary at the  time), and national conflicts, but the possibility of the  solution was also outlined at that time. This should be sought  today, too, from history, but much more so from the present.    In answer to a question on the autonomy possibility of  Vojvodina Hungarians, Jeszenszky said that in the course of his  meeting with the leader of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina  Hungarians, he inquired about any developments in this matter  since his visit to Belgrade.    Jeszenszky then travelled on to Subotica, where a ceremony  will be held on Saturday evening to mark March 15.</p>

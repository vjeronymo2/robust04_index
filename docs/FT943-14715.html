			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Enter at their peril: Europe's pride in itself is undermined by its treatment of asylum seekers The Euro-pean Union has a high opinion of itself. It likes to talk about 'European civilisation' and 'European values', suggesting that such things as freedom, democracy and human rights are European inventions, which other parts of the world either have learnt or should learn from Europe. But does the EU conduct itself, towards people approaching from outside, in a way that might convince them there is any substance to such a claim? The question is prompted by a recent paper from Amnesty International (AI), entitled Europe: the need for minimum standards in asylum procedures.* People who seek political asylum in Europe are taking talk about 'European values' seriously. Fleeing maltreatment in their own countries, they expect higher standards in Europe. So, if it sets any real store by its self-image, Europe has a responsibility to live up to its claims in dealing with such people. On AI's evidence, it is not doing too well. I have previously taken the UK to task for its treatment of asylum seekers, particularly the practice of detention without trial. After reading the AI paper, I have to say that Britain is not the worst European country in its treatment of asylum applicants. The paper does not deal specifically with the issue of detention, but it is clear that this practice is pretty well universal. About one country which we look forward to welcoming as an EU member next January, the authors observe that 'it appears to be the intention of the Austrian government to deal with practically all asylum requests while the person involved is in administrative detention', and 'in many cases the detention centre does not allow asylum seekers to make a telephone call'. Here are some other samples of continental practice: In France, an Algerian policeman and his young wife, who fled after receiving death threats from the 'armed Islamic movement', were refused refugee status on the grounds that 'manifestly, they have nothing to fear from the Algerian state'. In Belgium, lawyers representing detained asylum seekers obtained a court order requiring the government to give them 48 hours' notice of the date and time of appeal hearings. The minister of the interior announced he would fight this 'absurd decision' all the way on appeal and, if necessary, would bring in legislation to overturn it. Even in the Netherlands, which has a better reputation than most, 35 Zairean refugees were on the point of being sent back to Togo because the Dutch foreign ministry stated formally that it had contacted the representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Lome, the Togolese capital, and that UNHCR considered Togo safe enough for them to return there. UNHCR has no representative in Lome. All European states have taken measures to make it more difficult for asylum seekers to get to their countries in the first place. Airlines face fines if they bring into a country people who do not have the required visa and travel documents. Yet many bona fide refugees do not have travel documents, and many countries have imposed visa requirements with the express purpose of keeping refugees out. Why else would one European country after another, since mid-1992, have imposed such a requirement on nationals of Bosnia-Hercegovina? Every European state, it seems, now seeks to avoid considering the substance of each asylum application by asking whether there is a 'safe third country' to which the applicant could be returned because he/she passed through it on the way from their country of origin; an asylum claim is supposed to be examined in the first EU state the claimant arrives in. All too often this leads to refugees being bounced back and forth, as each state tries to claim they are not its responsibility. This should be called the Pilate Principle, after its most famous exponent.** One effect is to prevent the reunion of refugee families. You get absurd cases, such as that of the Bosnian refugee who was unable to join his wife and children in Switzerland because he had no passport. Instead he came to the UK, under a scheme for wounded or disabled Bosnians, but after 12 months he had still not been given refugee status, and his wife and children had not been allowed to join him.*** So far, efforts to co-ordinate policy have generally made matters worse. As the AI paper puts it, 'states have shown a tendency to stimulate each other in changing their asylum procedures in a way which has reduced the level of protection'. Protection of refugees, that is. States, of course, are more concerned to 'protect' themselves against unwanted immigrants, and fear that 'a good asylum procedure can be a 'pull factor' which would lead increased numbers of asylum-seekers to try to come to a particular country'. At least that fear could be allayed if all European states bound themselves to observe a common minimum standard of fairness in their treatment of applicants, as AI suggests. Instead of tightening up procedures for fear of seeming more attractive to refugees than their neighbours, states could adopt a more liberal approach, secure in the knowledge that their neighbours were doing the same. That would give the notion of 'European values' a more positive content. * Available from Amnesty International EU Association, 9 rue Berckmans, 1060 Brussels. ** 'When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.

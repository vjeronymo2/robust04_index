			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount  rate of 8.24%, up from 8.22% last week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month  bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.37%, up from 8.33% last week.  The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.41% on March 25,  1985, and six-month bills averaged 8.56% on April 8, 1985. The new discount  rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.53% for three-month bills,  with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,791.70, and 8.86% for six-month bills  selling for $9,576.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received  when government securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

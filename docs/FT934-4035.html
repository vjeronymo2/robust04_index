			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo - Collapse of the merger with Renault: French reaffirm plan to privatise Renault Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, yesterday confirmed the government's commitment to privatise Renault in spite of the failure of the merger with Volvo. He also expressed optimism about the French state-owned group's prospects. 'I am confident in the future of Renault which will become a private company and will win on the markets like it wins on the race track,' he said in an interview in the Journal du Dimanche,the French Sunday paper. He said Volvo's rejection of the merger was a mistake and that he could not understand how the deal had failed after having been agreed by the company's board. 'I am disconcerted by the management methods of Swedish business,' he said. 'How can a management board be opposed by shareholders who had been informed for several months of its strategy?' Mr Longuet said the future of co-operation between the two groups, based on a far-reaching industrial alliance and extensive cross-shareholdings, would depend on talks between the two and the direction taken by Volvo's new management. 'I am not in the front line in this affair. It will be up to the industrial groups to present new proposals' he said. But Mr Longuet warned that Volvo would be faced with problems. He said Swedish industry had received a temporary boost from the effects of currency devaluation. 'This situation is transitory, and when Volvo is again confronted by the harsh realities of the market the problems will reappear.' Mr Longuet rejected criticisms that the French state had played too large a role in the planned deal. He said the The Swedish people had not understood that with 35 per cent of the merged group Volvo would have been the principal shareholder.</p>

ITAR-TASS learned this from an  official source in the Kremlin, who also said that Yeltsin was  in favor of Nixon holding meetings with representatives of  different branches of power in Russia. However, the Russian  president himself will still be unable to receive the former  U.S. President because of the death of his wife's, Naina  Yeltsina's, mother several days ago.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by Nixon's aides  that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Robert Dole, the leader of  the Republican group in the U.S. Senate and one of the most  influential American legislators, approached the Russian head of  state with requests to settle the complicated situation around  this issue.    Representatives of Nixon have reported that on Monday [14  March] he will make a speech at a sitting of the Russian State  Duma Committee for International Affairs at the invitation of  the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market dips after hitting new record LONDON'S equity market extended its record-breaking run, punching its way through the 2,700 barrier and reaching another all-time high, before turning back sharply amid hints that the first of an expected rash of big rights issues is imminent. After a volatile session, the FT-SE 100-share Index settled 3.2 higher at 2,701.9. There was further encouragement with yesterday's turnover figures: swollen by yet another big share placing, the number of shares traded reached 784.3m, way above the depressed levels of last year and continuing the run of heavy post-general election activity. Since the election there have been only two trading sessions where the value of customer business transacted in the marketplace has fallen below the Pounds 1bn mark. One of those was just after the Easter bank holiday. There was further stimulation for the market from the latest economic data, which showed domestic car sales during April 9.1 per cent up on last year  - the first increase since October 1989  - while a number of UK building societies reduced their mortgage rates. Another boost to the market's confidence came from sterling's latest good showing. The UK currency, helped by a reduction in French interest rates and no shift in German interest rates, extended its recent strong performance, closing sharply higher against the dollar and D-Mark. The wave of overseas buying that drove the Footsie to the brink of 2,700 on Wednesday was evident again first thing yesterday, with the big US investment banks said to have been particularly aggressive. With the Footsie future continuing to hold up well, the cash market built confidently on a firm opening and gradually worked up from an opening gain of 4.6 to reach another all-time high of 2,714.1 ahead of Wall Street's opening. A slightly disappointing performance by the US market, which initially edged higher but quickly ran into a flurry of profit-taking, triggered similar selling in London. The selling, although never heavy, was sufficient to push the Footsie into negative territory, albeit briefly. It was around this time that the rights issue stories began to circulate. British Airways was one big name mentioned as a potential fund-raiser. First-quarter figures from BP, the oil giant, were also said to have been partly responsible for denting the market's confidence. Enthusiasm for BP shares, after the maintained dividend, was quickly eroded. Sears, the retailer, was another poor performer, with a veiled warning about the dividend upsetting the market and prompting a sharp decline in the shares. On the upside, BET climbed after a broker buy recommendation. The Scottish power generators, which have badly underperformed the utilities sectors and the market since their flotation last year, raced higher as marketmakers were caught short of stock. The current fashion for big share placings continued yesterday, with agency broker James Capel said to have placed 41m shares in Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group. Prudential Group was said to have been the seller.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: MOST TRADERS INVEST OWN MONEY CAUTIOUSLY  </P> <P> "Sure I'll tell you how I'm investing my own money," said a stock trader who  works at a mid-sized brokerage firm. "But you can't use my name because I'm  investing a lot more conservatively than my clients, and they'll give me  grief."  </P> <P> Once a year I take a small sampling of how some Wall Street pros are putting  their own money to work. Typically, the folks closest to the stock and bond  markets invest more cautiously than you might expect.  </P> <P> Some experts say it is because they can't monitor their own investments as  carefully as they do their clients'. Others admit privately that, even when  optimistic predictions about the markets are coming out of their firms, they  prefer to remain extra careful. This is their own money, after all.  </P> <P> With stock prices sinking steadily the past several months and interest rates  rising, the pros this year seem to be investing their own dough more carefully  than ever. Like the average small investor, the experts are looking to put the  bulk of their assets safely away, while keeping a small amount of "mad money"  for stocks or other investments that could hit the jackpot.  </P> <P> Here's what some of the pros are doing:  </P> <P> * Kim Rupert, a vice president at MMS International who's in charge of keeping  an eye on what the Federal Reserve is doing, is investing as if interest rates  aren't going much higher.  </P> <P> Rupert says she has 35% of her own money in long-term zero coupon Treasury  bonds and 65% in money market funds. A zero coupon Treasury bond is a note that  pays no interest but sells well below its face value. It attracts investors  with tax-sheltered income and long-term objectives. "The zero coupons are  pretty cheap nowadays, and I'm planning ahead for the next few years," says  Rupert, adding that "I like the over 9%" yields.  </P> <P> While she believes that interest rates could go up slightly from current  levels, she doesn't think that the increase will be so large that she'll regret  having locked up the 35% in zeros. Besides, she says, the 65% of her money  allocated to money market funds could quickly be shifted to long-term bonds if  rates do climb substantially.  </P> <P> * Hildegard Zagorski, a stock market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities,  says she is "not doing very much in the market." Zagorski says that aside from  buying an option on a gold stock a few weeks ago -- as a play on inflation --  she's kept her money invested cautiously.  </P> <P> "I'm extremely conservative," says Zagorski, who added that this is just her  nature and not a reflection on the current market. "I don't fool around with  stocks."  </P> <P> Money that Zagorski has invested in a 401(k) retirement plan and an individual  retirement account is being put to work in a money market fund and a Treasury  bond fund. The 401(k) and the IRA are tax-sheltered savings plans.  </P> <P> "I'm nibbling (on stocks), but not going wild," says Hugh Johnson, chief market  strategist for First Albany Corp. "I think the market is going to go down. But  I'm starting to see some values."  </P> <P> Johnson says he's buying mainly blue chip stocks like AT&amp;T and Philip  Morris. But primarily, he says, he's investing in his own company, First  Albany.  </P> <P> By nibbling on blue chips and investing in First Albany, Johnson has tied up  about 75% of the money he has available. The remaining 25% is being invested in  Treasury, zero or municipal bonds.  </P> <P> "I haven't really done anything differently" since the financial markets  started to decline, Johnson says.  </P> <P> * Oppenheimer &amp; Co.'s market watcher, Michael Metz, is using a different  approach than Johnson. "Right now I'm looking for bargains in the  small-capitalization area," says Metz. Small stocks, he says, have been  under-performing the rest of the stock market. And some are selling at  "going-out-of-business prices" -- even though they aren't.  </P> <P> But Metz says he is putting only 30% of his money in stocks right now. The rest  is invested in Treasury securities with maturities of four to seven years.  </P> <P> Metz believes that the stock market as a whole will be stuck in a trading  range, with the Dow Jones industrial average going no higher than 2,900 and no  lower than 2,400. Small stocks will stage a better recovery than big ones, he  contends, when oil prices and inflation come down next year.  </P> <P> The small stocks that Metz likes include Tech-Sym Corp. of Houston, Storage  Equities Inc. of Glendale and Vitalink Communications of Fremont, Calif.  </P> <P> * Liam Dalton, who runs the money management firm of Axiom Partners in New  York, is the boldest of the group sampled. And he has only 55% of his total  assets (not just his "investable assets") in the stock market.  </P> <P> Over the short term, Dalton says there is a better chance that stocks will rise  than fall. Any good news out of the Middle East would be like tossing a match  on a pile of dry wood, igniting a rally, he says.  </P> <P> Still, Dalton admits, in the current environment "you wake up every day, and  you take a look at where everything is." He thinks that if war starts in the  Middle East, it would knock the stock market down for a time, then permit it to  rally.  </P> <P> But even Dalton is investing selectively. "I'm looking to pick off some of the  less vulnerable stocks," he says. Cooper Tire, for instance, should have good  earnings. More importantly, says Dalton, the stock is depressed. He also likes  Kuhlman Corp., a Birmingham, Mich., maker of plastic products.  </P> <P> Dalton says 35% of his assets are in bonds and the rest in cash.  </P> <P> Now for my secretive trader friend who didn't want his identity revealed.  </P> <P> He's keeping 60% of his investments in money market funds and 40% in stocks.  "I've always liked cash on hand. You never know when you'll need it," he says.  </P> <P> "In stocks, I try to pick out large stocks with recognizable brands" -- like  AT&amp;T, Mobil and Hershey. "The only way you make money is over the long  term."  </P> <P> He does have some mad money. He sets $10,000 to $15,000 aside to speculate on  the short-term ups and downs of certain stocks, "just to play, just to keep  involved."  </P> <P> And probably so his clients won't think he's a coward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 104 Hours' Work Goes to Pay the Mortgage  </P> <P> If you can't figure out yet why the housing market is in such tough shape,  here's as good an explanation as any.  </P> <P> Comstock Partners, an investment advisory firm, says the average factory worker  has to use up 104.15 hours of wages a month to pay the mortgage on an  average-priced house.  </P> <P> Mortgage payments were sopping up 101.17 hours of monthly pay in 1989 and 99.54  hours in 1988. Since the normal person probably works less than 160 hours a  month, this doesn't leave much left for extravagances -- like food.  </P> <P> Back in 1963, Comstock says, people had to fork over only 36.46 hours of  monthly wages to make a mortgage payment.  </P> <P> But today's situation isn't the worst ever. In 1981, when interest rates went  into the stratosphere, it took 113.88 hours of work to service a monthly  mortgage.  </P> <P> Years ago, Comstock was one of the first groups to predict that housing prices  would tumble. It doesn't hold out a lot of hope for the housing market.  </P> <P> To afford a house, "most people had to put two people to work -- at least -- in  the 1980s," according to Rita Hamilton, an investment analyst with Comstock.  "That's still the case with the '90s."  </P> <P> Housing prices in many regions of the country have fallen the past few years,  which has helped the situation somewhat. But the improvement in affordability  on the price side has been partly wiped out by an increase in interest rates.  </P> <P> Could anything revive the housing market? Hamilton says a large jump in wages  would help. But that's unlikely to occur, especially if the nation enters a  recession.  </P> <P> A big drop in interest rates would make houses more affordable. But Hamilton  believes that there won't be a major pickup in demand unless mortgage rates  fall to between 6% and 7%. And Comstock thinks that, over the near term, rates  will be rising.  </P> <P> The last alternative is not a pretty one. Prices will have to fall more before  sales pick up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time May Be Right for Collection Firms' Stock  </P> <P> Union Corp. and Payco America are in the perfect business for today's economic  environment. Both firms make a living collecting bad debts for other people.  </P> <P> Charles Carabell, an analyst with Kemper's Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi brokerage,  says when the economy starts to sour, delinquent borrowers often can't pay off  all their loans, so "it becomes a question of who gets there first." Union  Corp. and Payco are hired by creditors who want to be first in line.  </P> <P> There are said to be 6,000 companies and people throughout America who get paid  for collecting bad debts. And while most of the knee-breakers are out of this  business, the majority of these 6,000 are small, mom-and-pop operations. The  exceptions are Union Corp., Payco and a Canadian company called FCA Corp.  </P> <P> The collectors generally send letters to debtors and pepper them with telephone  calls. They can also garnish debtors' wages or haul them into court. For their  effort, collection firms generally get to keep between 25% and 35% of what they  collect. They have a success rate of about 30%.  </P> <P> Melvin Cooper, head of Union Corp., doesn't see the economic downturn as a boon  to his business. He says there is already $90 billion in bad debts out there,  so there is plenty of "inventory" for businesses like his.  </P> <P> But others like Carabell think that the economic slump -- let's go ahead and  call it a recession -- will make the earnings of publicly held debt collection  firms go up. In fact, he believes, Union Corp.'s $20 stock could be selling for  $35 a share before it gets sidetracked by an economic upturn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congress May Be Able to Skirt Spending Law  </P> <P> If Congress can delay for another month, it might not have to worry about Gramm  Rudman after all.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department last week gave Congress the perfect escape route from  making Gramm Rudman spending cuts when it reported that the nation's gross  national product had risen only 0.4% in the second quarter. Previously it had  reported growth of 1.2% for that quarter.  </P> <P> Under a little-understood provision of Gramm Rudman, Congress can vote to  suspend the deficit reduction law under a handful of circumstances. One is  economic growth of less than 1% in two consecutive quarters.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department makes its first report on the third-quarter gross  national product on Oct. 31. Most experts agree that third-quarter business  growth should be considerably below 1%.  </P> <P> So if Congress hasn't come to a deficit reduction by Oct. 31, it can simply  vote to suspend Gramm Rudman -- for the good of the economy, of course.  </P> <P> One other way to suspend Gramm Rudman would be to declare war on somebody.  </P></p>

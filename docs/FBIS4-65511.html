			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- Germany's citizens are  obviously no longer willing to continue to incur debts for  consumption to the current extent. As the German Bundesbank  writes in its latest monthly report, the decline of the savings  quota went hand in hand with a decline in the readiness to incur  debts for consumption purposes. With 15 billion German marks  [DM] the additional loans taken out in 1993 were one-third less  than the previous year. The Bundesbank attributes this to the  decline in income and the "more somber economic prospects in  western Germany."    Concerning the short-term overdraft of current accounts, it  noticed that new debts "were only one-quarter of the sums of the  previous year." At the end of 1993 private debts for  consumption amounted to DM354 billion, which was about 17  percent of the available budget income. Given savings of DM222  billion, the savings quota, which is the share of savings in  available income, went down by about one percentage point to  approximately 13 percent.    As the Bundesbank continues, net capital expenditures in  fixed assets as well as the savings of the overall economy went  down considerably in 1993 due to the economic crisis. After the  deduction of write-offs, capital expenditures in fixed assets  amounted to DM255 billion and thus were "almost one-fifth lower  than the previous year," the Bundesbank writes.    The financing gap in the economy was again closed by foreign  investors. "The fact that this was possible despite generally  declining interest rates is to be seen as an expression of trust  of foreign creditors in the stability of the German mark," it is  said.    The main reason for the gap between supply and demand on the  financial markets was "the borrowing of public budgets, which  was high before and continued to increase in 1993." With DM155  billion it exceeded -- due to unification -- the sum of 1992 by  almost half and thus amounted to about two-thirds of the overall  private formation of monetary capital in Germany.    While capital expenditures in fixed assets in western  Germany  declined by 30 percent to DM161 billion as a result of the  recession, the development was reversed in the new laender: The  formation of fixed assets rose to an almost equal extent to DM94  billion. Thus, the east German economy "made good progress in  all fields" in reconstruction and restructuring, in the view of  the Bundesbank.    The profit situation of west German companies continued to  deteriorate; in eastern Germany manufacturing companies were  generally not able to return to profitability in 1993, the  Bundesbank continues.</p>

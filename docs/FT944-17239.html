			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / US push for Israeli deal with Syrians US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will today launch an intensive effort to bridge the differences preventing an Israel-Syria peace agreement. He is hoping to build on the improved atmosphere created by an unprecedented interview granted by the Syrian foreign minister to Israel's state television at the weekend. Mr Christopher arrived in Jerusalem yesterday at the start of a week that will see him shuttling between Jerusalem and Damascus, visiting Jordan and Egypt and making a trip to Kuwait. He played down hopes yesterday for a breakthrough on the Israel-Syria track but there are now clear signs of progress. Mr Christopher has already tentatively scheduled a return to the region at the end of this month or early in November. The most obvious sign yet of Syria's determination to sign a peace treaty came on Friday when Mr Farouq a-Shara, foreign minister, gave a first full-length interview to the Israeli media, telling state television of his country's desire for 'peace, tranquility, stability and prosperity' in the Middle East. 'We have to change the face of the region,' he said, urging Israel to agree quickly to a peace deal involving the return of the Golan Heights. The interview, conducted in Washington reportedly in the presence of Mr Dennis Ross, US peace talks co-ordinator, was notable for Mr A-Shara's pledge that Syria would 'pave the way' for an Israel-Lebanon accord once peace with Damascus was achieved, and for his assurance that the Israelis 'will be absolutely satisfied' with the consequences of a peace deal. This was an apparent reference to the fully normalised, diplomatic, trade, tourism and cultural relations Israel has been demanding as part of an agreement. While taking issue with Mr A-Shara's claim that Syria had never shelled Israeli civilian targets, prime minister Yitzhak Rabin cautiously welcomed the interview.</p>

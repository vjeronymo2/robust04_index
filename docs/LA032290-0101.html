			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMORED CAR BANDIT GIVEN 14-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> A 28-year-old man was sentenced to 14 years in prison Tuesday after a jury  convicted him of gunning down an armored car guard during a foiled robbery  attempt in Glendale.  </P> <P> After three days of deliberation in the second trial of Alfred Giordano, a  Pasadena Superior Court jury found him guilty of attempted robbery and  attempted murder in the Dec. 31, 1987, shooting that left security guard Howard  White paralyzed. But the jury rejected an allegation that the shooting was  premeditated, thereby reducing the maximum penalty from life in prison to 14  years.  </P> <P> Several hours later, Judge Terry Smerling issued a $100 fine and sentenced  Giordano to the maximum 14 years, citing "the carefully planned nature of the  robbery . . . the viciousness of the shooting . . . the racial overtones."  </P> <P> White, a 34-year-old father of two who is black, was not present for the  verdict or the sentencing.  </P> <P> "Certainly the robbery was premeditated," Smerling said as Giordano's mother  and father looked on. "And incredibly serious injuries were suffered by Mr.  White. It could very well have been a murder case."  </P> <P> It was a quick and clear-cut ending to an unusual and sometimes bizarre court  saga.  </P> <P> Both Alfred and his brother, Peter Giordano, 33, were charged in 1988 with  attempted murder and attempted robbery after White was shot outside a  check-cashing service on San Fernando Road. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann Glidden  contended that Alfred, using a Uzi semiautomatic rifle, gunned down White and  unsuccessfully searched his canvas bag for money while Peter, 33, drove the  getaway car.  </P> <P> In a trial last May, no one could identify Peter Giordano as the getaway driver  and he was acquitted. But three witnesses said they saw Alfred Giordano shoot  White. Kimberly Giordano, Alfred's wife, testified that he told her how he had  committed the crime and that he laughed about White's injuries and his race.  </P> <P> But Kimberly Giordano also told jurors that Officer Joseph Jimenez, the  Glendale police investigator in the case, had sex with her and coerced her to  testify against her husband. White, when asked to point out his assailant,  looked at the brothers, who were sitting together, and pointed at Peter  Giordano. When asked by the prosecutor if he was sure, White said that he had  meant to point at Alfred Giordano and had made a mistake.  </P> <P> Eventually, a mistrial was declared on the charges against Alfred Giordano  after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. The dissenting juror,  prosecutors have said, was swayed by the testimony of Jeanette Russell, a  witness who said Alfred was visiting her at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> Russell repeated the same testimony in the second trial, which began Feb. 15.  But jurors said Tuesday her testimony was discounted. It was mainly the  testimony by Kimberly Giordano that convinced them of Giordano's guilt, they  said.  </P> <P> During the second trial, Kimberly Giordano reluctantly corroborated much of her  earlier testimony about her husband's confession to her.  </P> <P> "We went with the three eyewitnesses, and by and large, everyone seemed to buy  Kimberly's story," said Richard McKinney, a dialogue writer for the TV show  "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> "No one for an instant believed Jeanette Russell" because she did not come  forward with the alibi until long after Alfred Giordano's arrest, McKinney  said.  </P> <P> Alfred's defense attorney, Robert Swanson, contended it was Peter Giordano, not  Alfred, who attempted the foiled heist and shot White. During the trial, he  called Peter Giordano into the courtroom several times, asking White and others  if they were certain it was Alfred and not Peter who assaulted him.  </P> <P> Jurors were not swayed.  </P> <P> "The defense brought in a lot of strategies to throw the jury off, but there  was never any doubt," said Pamela Welsh, a teacher from Montrose.  </P> <P> Several jurors, however, said they thought the police investigation in the case  had been "unprofessional" and "sloppy." They said they believed that Jimenez  had a sexual relationship with Kimberly Giordano and set up reward payments in  exchange for her testimony.  </P> <P> Swanson said Tuesday he requested the speedy sentencing so that he can begin  filing an appeal. He indicated he will challenge several of Smerling's rulings.  </P> <P> Despite Swanson's objections, the judge ruled in both trials that Kimberly  Giordano be allowed to testify against her husband. Although a 1983 divorce was  set aside last year by an Orange County court, Smerling ruled that marital  privilege -- allowing spouses to refuse to testify against each other -- did  not apply in the case.  </P></p>

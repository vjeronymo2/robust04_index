			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial  actions carried on Havana television in Spanish between 16 and  22 April.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 16  April  report that Alexis Duque Velazquez, the manager of a consignment  store in Havana, was arrested for embezzling the profits from  three months' work. The crime was detected when an unscheduled  audit was performed after employees of the store reported the  manager to the local council. Although previous audits had not  detected fraudulent activities, on this occasion auditors found  that Duque Velazquez had forged contracts to cover up for the  33,000 pesos that he had pocketed.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 22  April  report that three employees of a post office in San Miguel del  Padron Municipality, Havana City Province, stole over 126,000  pesos from the state by falsifying money orders, until caught by  the Ministry of Communications and the Police, working together.  In 1993, they cashed 364 false money orders, each for  approximately 300 pesos. They got away with this for a while  because of inefficiencies in the postal system. They were also  able to operate because other people failed to comply fully and  properly with the procedures for paying out and monitoring money  orders. "To reconcile 2.5 million in money orders in one year is  not an easy task, even if those which are false will be  discovered in the end. However, the delay in this reconciliation  was causing the state to lose money." "Communications now has a  modern system that allows them to detect false money orders  quickly."</p>

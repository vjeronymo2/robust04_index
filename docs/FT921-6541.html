			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Asahi Glass results hit by building downturn ASAHI Glass, the leading Japanese glass-maker, reported a 19 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit, to Y63.59bn (Dollars 496.79m), in the year to end-December. The results reflect the downturn in the country's construction and car industries. Sales rose 1.1 per cent to Y1,248bn, while parent company sales rose 0.4 per cent to Y1,022bn. Pre-tax profit fell by 5.3 per cent Y60.23bn. However, parent operating profit rose by 8.4 per cent to Y47.77bn. The company reported a significant fall in non-operating income from interest and dividends, and sales of shares in subsidiaries, which were affected by turbulence in Japanese financial markets. It said sales of flat glass and construction materials slowed in tandem with a fall in new housing starts, but there was an increase in sales of high-performance glass for the industry. Slower demand from car-makers led to sluggish sales of fabricated glass, while total glass sales fell 0.8 per cent to Y526bn. Asahi said 'a quick expansion of domestic demand' was unlikely this year, and forecast a 3.7 per cent increase in parent sales to Y1,060bn.</p>

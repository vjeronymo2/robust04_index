			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions seek advice on R-R jobs move UNION LEADERS were yest-erday seeking legal advice over a decision by Rolls-Royce to terminate the contracts of its 34,000 aerospace workers in order to implement a pay freeze. The move - claimed by some unions to be mass sackings, if only on a temporary basis - is one of the most significant attempts by a company to change its employees' contracts during the recession. Rolls-Royce said the move was nothing more than a legal technicality, and that employees would be offered contracts on broadly similar terms. It added that it had no wish to see people dismiss themselves as a result of its decision. Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the company had 'imposed a six-month wage freeze without consultation or warning'. Rolls-Royce announced the pay freeze last week at the same time as unveiling plans to double job losses in the aerospace division this year to 6,000. In a subsequent letter to employees, sent at the end of last week, the company gave notice that contracts would be terminated at various stages, depending on length of service, from last Saturday. New conditions would be exactly the same as existing ones except that pay would be frozen. Mr Webb said unions were worried the company was planning other changes to working practices, including the introduction of individual contracts. Few other companies among the increasing numbers of employers announcing pay freezes have terminated existing contracts. However, Mr D'Arcy Payne, personnel director in Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, said that the company had taken careful legal advice before making its decision. Under the pay freeze, increments to reward length of service will be suspended. In addition, there will be no general pay rises for at least six months. Leaders of the manual workers' union will meet on Thursday to discuss the job losses and the pay freeze, and union officials are also asking for a meeting with the Rolls-Royce board.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / British Gas rejects price claim BRITISH GAS has rejected allegations that the price increases for competitors using its pipeline, which it withdrew last week, would be reinstated after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry due in three weeks' time. But it has not ruled out putting prices back up after a review. British Gas said: 'Nothing is ready to go on the table; the price rises may be too high, too low or just right, but we will review that.' Some of British Gas's competitors regard the company's decision last week to withdraw price increases of up to 30 per cent as a cynical delaying tactic to remove an area of potential controversy before the MMC report. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a rival supplier, said: 'I don't think they have any intention of changing these price increases, they're just trying to impose them in a more palatable manner.' British Gas has said it will delay price rises of between 2 per cent and 30 per cent until October next year. In the meantime it will review the charges levied on users of its pipeline system. Another shipper said: 'I'm worried they will try again (with the price rises) and, of course, they are making business difficult for us because we need some stability to plan our own charges to customers.' Mr Harry Moulson, who takes over as managing director of British Gas's National Transmission business tomorrow, has said he will not impose the price increases until he has made a thorough examination of the company's cost base. He also wants British Gas's marketing operations to be charged the same for sending gas through the pipelines as is paid by rivals. Ofgas, the industry regulator, believes that when British Gas proposed putting up prices for gas transport, it was trying to shift its profit base from the household supply market into pipelines. Profits in domestic gas supply are being squeezed by a tough pricing formula. To compensate for this, the company was trying to make its pipelines more profitable. Ofgas says that for every Pounds 1 spent directly on the pipeline system, British Gas had allocated another Pounds 7 of costs to it. This is the area which Mr Moulson will examine when satisfying himself that the increases are justified. He also intends to hold more consultations with rivals.</p>

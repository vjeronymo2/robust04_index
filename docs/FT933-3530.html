			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / France calls up trouble-shooter Trichet: The new Bank of France governor is a man who appears to enjoy a challenge MR Jean-Claude Trichet, who was officially appointed yesterday as the new governor of the Bank of France, seems to be drawn to crises. His steady climb up the ladder of France's financial administration has placed him in the hot seat on several occasions. In 1981, as deputy director of international affairs in the Treasury, he faced the challenge of managing France's interests in the Latin American debt crisis. In August 1987, he was appointed director of the Treasury and was soon dealing with the implications of the international stock market crash. True to form, he takes over at the head of the French central bank at a difficult time. This summer's currency crisis, which widened the franc's fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent, broke the French currency's close link with the D-Mark - the centrepiece of France's monetary policy. It leaves Mr Trichet and the government of Mr Edouard Balladur with the task of deciding what is French policy in the new European monetary order. The task is complicated by pressures from French businessmen and politicians, even within Mr Balladur's Gaullist RPR party, for the reversal of the Bank of France's anti-inflationary stance and the implementation of more expansionist policies to revive the recession-hit economy. Proponents of an alternative policy to a strong franc and financial discipline are, however, unlikely to take any comfort from Mr Trichet's appointment. Like his predecessor, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Mr Trichet has been an unswerving advocate of financial rigour. An amateur poet, he is expected to stick to his lines. 'He has been one of the principal architects of current policy,' says Mr Jean-Luc Parodi, professor of politics at the Institut des Etudes Politiques de Paris. Mr Trichet's orthodox views partly reflect his background and his experience in the French administration. A graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for many of France's top officials, Mr Trichet has worked his way up France's financial hierarchy. In 1985 he was appointed director of international affairs at the Treasury and the following year he became chief adviser to Mr Balladur, then the French economics minister. But those who have worked with him say his stance is also based on conviction. 'Like Mr Balladur, he believes that France cannot return to the days when the financial authorities resorted to devaluations to ease the problems facing the economy,' says one French banker. In fighting his corner, the new governor will soon have a strengthened hand. A reform of the law to grant independence to the central bank is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. Under the new laws, the central bank will be granted autonomy in monetary policy. How autonomous Mr Trichet appears will be the yardstick for his success in his new job. 'The French government might have sent a stronger signal by naming a more independent-looking figure,' said one Paris-based diplomat, referring to Mr Trichet's background in the Treasury and his links with Mr Balladur. It is a sentiment echoed by some senior European officials who have negotiated with Mr Trichet. 'He is very charming and intelligent and has shown his mettle in his work for the Paris Club and Group of Seven,' one monetary official commented. 'But you have to realise that French officials, even at the very, very highest level operate under very, very firm instructions from whoever is in political control.' Nor has Mr Trichet always been a strong advocate of central bank independence. It is not so many years since visitors to his office in the Treasury would be treated to strong criticism of the idea. The real test of his independence, however, may come in his attitude towards the Bundesbank rather than the French government. Since the ERM reforms at the beginning of August, the Bank of France has continued to be guided by German monetary policy and the franc/D-Mark rate. It was only after last week's cut in German interest rates, for example, that France completed its return to pre-crisis levels of official interest rates by cutting the 5-to-10 day borrowing rate from 10 per cent to 7.75 per cent. The more important intervention rate was left unchanged at 6.75 per cent. For the short term at least, the Bank of France is likely to continue to edge interest rates downwards, following the lead of the Bundesbank and with a careful eye on the value of the franc, which now appears to have a target range of between FFr3.50 and FFr3.55 to the D-Mark.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] Mr. Samphan Thongsamak, the minister of  education, talked with reporters in Nakhon Sithammarat Province  about the spread of drugs among youths in the south. He said  that drug use is now spreading rapidly. The Ministry of  Education is trying get teachers to tell students about the  dangers of drugs. He said that in his view, there has been a  marked increase in drug use in the south. This is the  responsibility of narcotics units and the police. Administrative  officials must formulate a system in order to step up the  monitoring of drug activities.    ``It must be admitted that in the southern border provinces,  a large number of youths are addicted to drugs. But the  government is not ignoring this problem. Teachers will be asked  to monitor their students more closely in order to control drug  use. This is all that the Ministry of Education can do.''

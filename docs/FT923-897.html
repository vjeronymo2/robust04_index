			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hagen wins seat on Nedlloyd board MR TORSTEIN Hagen, the Norwegian investor, yesterday won his long battle to win a seat on the supervisory board of Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, after an Amsterdam court rejected objections to the appointment that were lodged by the company's works council. The court ruling caps a long and determined effort by Mr Hagen, who owns about 25 per cent of Nedlloyd's shares, to get a board seat and help oversee the company's return to sustained profitability. In 1988, and again in 1991, Mr Hagen attempted to gain influence at Nedlloyd but was rebuffed each time by the management board. The board argued that it was counter to Dutch corporate practice to nominate significant shareholders to the supervisory board, a body that is required by law to look after the interests of all 'stakeholders' and not just shareholders. The management board reversed its position in early 1992 and nominated Mr Hagen to the supervisory board. However, the move was opposed by the works council, which charged that management was hoping to buy off Mr Hagen and neutralise his criticism of company policy. Yesterday's court ruling breaks the deadlock and clears the way for Mr Hagen to join the board. 'We cannot do anything else but loyally accept this decision,' the works council said. Mr Hagen's clashes with Nedlloyd in the past were central to the continuing debate in the Netherlands about the subordinate role of shareholders in Dutch corporate governance.</p>

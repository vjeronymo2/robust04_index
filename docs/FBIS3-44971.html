			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320) and XINHUA </F> reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- A five-day national  conference of presidents of higher courts ended in Beijing  today. The conferees held: Strict administration of justice by  the people's courts has a direct bearing on the normal operation  of a socialist market economic system and the stability of  market economic order; as well as the dignity and integrity of  the socialist legal system and the image of the party and the  government. Therefore, it is a sacred duty of the people's  courts to strictly administer justice. Courts at various levels  must regard strict enforcement of law and improved quality of  justice as a task of primary importance, and make relentless  efforts to carry out this task.    Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at  the conference. He said: To ensure strict administration of  justice, courts at all levels must emancipate minds, seek truth  from facts, make active exploration, be bold in practice, and  further strengthen reform and construction of courts  ideologically, organizationally, institutionally, and in their  style of work so as to constantly perfect the socialist judicial  system with Chinese characteristics.    He demanded that courts persist in exercising their judicial  functions independently and under the party's leadership, do  things strictly according to the law, and resolutely correct  failure to abide by the law, lax law enforcement, and letting  law-breakers go free, so as to safeguard the unification of the  socialist legal system. Meanwhile, it is necessary to train a  contingent of court personnel who have a strong political  orientation, professional competence, and solid style of work,  and who are honest in performing official duties, and strict in  administering justice.    According to briefings, interference from local and  departmental protectionism have affected the strict enforcement  of law in the trial of a few cases by the people's courts in  some localities, thus preventing the courts from bringing into  full play their judicial functions, and undermining the dignity  and integrity of the legal system.    The conferees called for upholding the principle of open  trial to effectively guarantee the right of litigants to file  law suits. It is necessary to conduct open investigation,  cross-examination, debate, and trial to place the entire  judicial process under the supervision of the people.    The conferees held: The strengthening of judicial  supervision and enforcement of judicial discipline is an  important means to guarantee strict administration of justice.  Courts at all levels must further study and trial-implement a  system of investigating wronged cases. Personnel liable for  wrongdoings in handling cases must be affixed with  administrative and legal responsibilities. Courts at the upper  level must strengthen supervision over the judicial work of  courts at the lower level, and must resolutely correct errors  and unfair verdicts in law enforcement.</p>

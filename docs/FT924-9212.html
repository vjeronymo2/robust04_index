			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BP No one who owes Dollars 16bn can feel all that expansive, so Mr David Simon, BP's new chief executive, is right to be cautious about the company's revived performance. While the third-quarter figures show an improvement, that owes much to lower interest and tax charges. At the operating level conditions remain difficult, particularly in refining and chemicals. And while asset sales are going according to plan, debt will fall only slowly. With most of the debt denominated in dollars and the US interest rate cycle near its low, interest charges may also fall more slowly than loans outstanding. BP still faces a long haul. Meanwhile, the valuation of the shares depends on which set of investors is in the driving seat. To US fund managers BP looks a better bet than some domestic energy stocks. Their buying has supported the share price since the dividend cut. However, even their patience may be tested because much of their holding was bought before sterling began its slide against the dollar. UK fund managers still have little reason to favour the stock while it yields less than Shell.</p>

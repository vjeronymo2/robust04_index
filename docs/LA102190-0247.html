			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH;  </P> <P> CAROL BURNETT, U.S.M.C.  </P> <P> If the Marines sent Pvt. Gomer Pyle to Saudi Arabia, we wouldn't have to worry  about war in the Middle East. Gomer would either melt Saddam Hussein's hardened  heart or send him right into a straitjacket.  </P> <P> Gomer (Jim Nabors) tries his best, but go-o-olly, does he drive Sgt. Carter  crazy. This time, however, Gomer's the one who could be driven crazy-by Cpl.  Carol.  </P> <P> Carol Burnett, as a love-starved Marine on Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. (Friday at 2:30  a.m. on TBS), falls hard for Gomer, who keeps dating her because she never  gives him a chance to tell her he's already got a girlfriend-Lou-Ann Poovie  (Elizabeth MacRae). Burnett is at her infuriating and pathetic best.  </P> <P> "Corporal Carol" originally aired in September, 1967, a couple weeks after her  own series, "The Carol Burnett Show," made its debut. Nabors would sometimes  turn up on Burnett's comedy series, too.  </P> <P> Gomer, whose show was a spinoff of "The Andy Griffith Show," never forgot his  Mayberry roots and was occasionally visited by old pals Andy, Goober, Opie and,  this week, Aunt Bee (Thursday at 2:30 a.m. on TBS).  </P></p>

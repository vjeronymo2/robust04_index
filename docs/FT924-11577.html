			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / China warns of turmoil over Patten's HK plans CHINA yesterday vowed to reverse democratic reforms proposed for Hong Kong by its governor, Mr Chris Patten, if he introduces them without Beijing's consent. In an uncompromising one-hour statement which underlined the deep rift between Britain and China, Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, warned of confrontation and turmoil in the colony during the transition from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. He cast doubt over the future of Hong Kong's HKDollars 163.5bn (Pounds 13bn) airport project, saying China would not honour debt agreements or contracts if Mr Patten proceeded with construction without agreement on financing. It would deny flights originating from the airport the right to use Chinese air space, he said. China's hard-line response to Mr Patten's proposals, at the end of his three-day visit to Beijing, sets the stage for a struggle for hearts and minds in Hong Kong. The first test of local reaction to Lu's ultimatum will come today when Mr Patten makes a statement to the colony's Legislative Council. Lu accused Mr Patten of violating the 1984 Anglo-Chinese Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and of making proposals incompatible with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He alleged that Britain had repudiated agreements reached between Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, concerning the pace of democratisation. Lu said Mr Hurd had written to Qian agreeing in principle that the colony's 1995 elections should be carried out according to 'arrangements' put forward by China, including those for an election committee. In London, the Foreign Office said messages had passed between Britain and China in 1990 in an attempt to agree on proposals for the 1995 elections. It had not been possible, however, to agree on all aspects of the elections. Mr Patten's proposal - that the election committee, which under the Basic Law will elect 10 members of the Legislative Council, should itself be elected - thus fell outside the Basic Law and did not contravene it. Lu said if Mr Patten went ahead with his proposals, China would disown them in 1997 and construct an executive branch of government, a legislature and a judiciary that conformed to its understanding of the Basic Law. 'If convergence with the Basic Law is not taken into consideration then that will undermine (prospects for) a smooth transition. Such a position will only lead to turmoil in Hong Kong,' Lu said. The British government yesterday repeated its support for Mr Patten's plans, saying it wished to maintain co-operation with Beijing. Japanese emperor 'deplores' war atrocities, Page 3</p>

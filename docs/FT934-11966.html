			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (6): The carrot and the stick - Investment in Canada is patchy. Bernard Simon explains why CANADA'S investment climate these days has all the extremes - and the in-betweens - of its weather. At one end of the spectrum, a prolonged recession has meant that governments at all levels are willing to pull out the stops to attract businesses which hold out hope of creating jobs. The slack economy has also made Canada a more attractive location for long-term investors. Inflation and interest rates are at their lowest level in decades. Real estate prices in most parts of the country are still in the doldrums. The 1989 free trade agreement with the US has reinforced pressures on management and workers to become more competitive. Employees are willing to do more for less, and trade unions have become more flexible. However, these advantages do not mean that industrialists can look forward to a warm, hassle-free welcome. Taxes are high. Non-tariff trade barriers hamper trade between the 10 provinces, and red tape is pervasive in many sectors, especially for any business requiring environmental clearances. Mr Bob Brown, chairman of Price Waterhouse in Toronto, sums up the changes in government attitudes and policies over the past year or two this way: 'The drunkard is off strong drink, but he's still into a dozen beers a day'. The pros and cons of locating in Canada thus depend heavily on the needs and priorities of a particular business. Domestic and foreign investors have had little hesitation, about pouring money into the entertainment and hospitality sectors, where the lure of millions of well-heeled consumers is paramount. The US National Basketball League recently received three competing bids to set up a team in Toronto, as well as one from Vancouver. Mr David Peterson, a former premier of Ontario, is confident that the CDollars 250m which his group offered for the franchise will be more than recouped by sales of tickets and souvenirs. 'The SkyDome,' Mr Peterson says, referring to Toronto's bulbous sports stadium, 'is the one place where you find people smiling these days.' By contrast, the mining industry is gloomy. Tight environmental rules and high-cost labour are causing foreign mining companies to shun Canada. Many Canadian companies are paying more attention to exploration in Chile and Mexico than to their own country. Foreign investors in the politically-charged cultural industries, such as publishing and broadcasting, also encounter strong resistance from Canadian nationalists. On balance, however, the climate for investment has improved rather than deteriorated. Ms Maureen Farrow, chief economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Toronto, says that 'over the last couple of years, it's become a less risky place.' In particular, she notes, 'our cost structure is more in line with where it should be.' Even the social-democratic governments in Ontario and British Columbia, whose interventionist policies have demoralised the business community, have shown signs of changing direction. Ontario has ordered a three-year pay freeze for provincial civil servants. A bottom line-oriented management has been installed at Ontario Hydro, the provincial power utility. It has promised not to raise electricity rates next year, and to hold future rises within cost-of-living increases. Mr William Macdonald, a business consultant, says Canada is four to five years into a restructuring process that could take another seven to eight years. In a few years, he predicts, Canada could have the best possible combination of mutually reinforcing monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and trade policies. Much depends however, on the political climate. While the long-term economic outlook has improved, this week's general election has created a new set of uncertainties. The business community is taking comfort from the landslide victory of the Liberals, which ended nine years of Progressive Conservative rule. The Conservatives were devastated in the election, winning only two out of 295 seats in the House of Commons. Today's Liberals are a far different party from the interventionist one led by Mr Pierre Trudeau which governed in the 1970s and early 1980s. They are more pragmatic, and more aware of the needs of both domestic and foreign business. The Liberals raised some fears during the election campaign that their fiscal and monetary policies would be less disciplined than the Tories. They also pledged to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement, which is due to come into force on January 1 1994. In practice, however, the policies of a Liberal government are unlikely to be radically different from those of the Conservatives. The Liberals are unlikely to scupper Nafta. They have also promised to give high priority to deficit reduction. The 1993 election will be remembered for the strong performance of two fledgling regional parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the Reform Party, which is based in western Canada. Both parties are generally pro-business and favour free trade. But the BQ's aim to take Quebec out of Canada has increased the risk of political instability in the years ahead. The key event will be a provincial election in Quebec, which will probably be held in the second half of 1994. The BQ's provincial cousin, the Parti Quebecois, has promised to hold an independence referendum within a year if it wins that election. Ms Farrow says that the level of political risk in Canada is 'no different to any other country these days'. But she cautions that investors would do well to monitor developments in Quebec closely.</p>

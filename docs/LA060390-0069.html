			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLOON-BASED SCIENCE PROBE DAMAGED IN LANDING  </P> <P> A 2 1/2-ton experimental NASA probe crashed and sustained about $2 million in  damage when a wind gust foiled its landing.  </P> <P> Dozens of batteries and electronic devices were strewn on the ground at the  landing site, said Jack Tueller, a scientist with the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, who helped build the probe.  </P> <P> NASA engineer Al Huters said the probe cost between $2 million and $3 million  to build. He said the device rides on a steel gondola about 10 feet square and  is carried aloft by a helium-filled balloon.  </P> <P> The probe, used to measure radioactivity in the upper atmosphere, had made two  successful experimental flights over Australia in 1988, officials said. A wind  gust apparently caught it as it touched down Friday in eastern Arizona.  </P> <P> "It was supposed to land very softly," Tueller said. "In the two landings in  Australia, there was very little damage."  </P> <P> The probe can measure faint emissions from stars and "was putting us on the  cutting edge of astronomy," Tueller said.  </P> <P> The gamma-ray imaging spectrometer is one of two in the world, Tueller said.  The other belongs to UC San Diego.  </P> <P> It was launched Thursday from an airport at Ft. Sumner, N. M., and reached an  altitude of more than five miles.  </P></p>

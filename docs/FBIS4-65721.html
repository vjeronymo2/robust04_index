			<p>BFN     [Text] Ottobrunn near Munich -- The aviation and aerospace  company of Daimler-Benz and the French aviation concern  Aerospatiale have now specified their plans for a joint venture  in the production of satellites. As Aerospatiale boss Louis  Gallois reportedly announced in Cannes (southern France), a  holding society is to be founded in Munich before the end of the  year in which the two enterprises are to participate on a 50:50  percent basis. Negotiations on this cooperation have not yet  been concluded, a spokesman of the German Aerospace AG company  stressed. According to Gallois, the two firms hope to achieve  results by July. The partners believe that, in a self-confident  manner, they will jointly become the largest European producer  of satellites and a serious competitor for the English-French  Matra-Marconi group.</p>

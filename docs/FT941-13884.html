			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Small fish in a big pond - Off the Wall Lady Thatcher liked the idea of her statue mounted above the English entrance to the Channel tunnel - 'Britannia resisting the Continental Hordes', perhaps. But Eurotunnel, niggled by her failure to provide Government cash for the enterprise, ignored the suggestion. Now the greatest building project of the century seems doomed to be completed with only a minimal contribution from the artists of the age. But when passengers start to arrive at Waterloo later this summer to catch the direct train to Paris, they will be greeted in Nicholas Grimshaw's award winning new terminal with one lone, but striking, work of art - 'Channel Fish' by the French artist Jean-Luc Vilmouth. Vilmouth is the winner of a competition organised by Public Art, the group responsible for locating art in the environment, against competition from, among 80 others, Ron Haseldon, Simon Patterson, and Peter Greenaway. The French artist's concept is piscine - fish made of steel mesh coated with fibre glass and suspended from the ceiling. These are not static fish. They wriggle, and to spectators in the first floor waiting room they will resemble a shoal of fish weaving in formation down the curve of Grimshaw's opaque building. At the moment five fish, varying in length from three to five metres, are guaranteed, thanks to a Pounds 70,000 contribution from the BR subsidiary looking after the rail link, European Passenger Services, boosted with Pounds 24,000 under the government funded Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. But an extra Pounds 40,000 is needed to acquire another five fish to make up a decent shoal, and companies likely to profit from the Tunnel are being approached for support. The fish are sand eels, a delicacy in France but not familiar in the UK. Vilmouth is best known for an installation in Grenoble, 70 metres long and featuring hammers pattering on to clocks. Public works of art are compulsory in official buildings in France; this has led to much bad art but also a tradition of municipal and corporate patronage. In the UK, public art is still not widely accepted but this could be changing. The Pounds 1m invested by Stuart Lipton in sculptures for his Broadgate development in London has more than paid for themselves in prompt lettings and popular approval, while Birmingham's International Convention Centre is another successful project heavily endowed with art, selected by Public Art. It remains a reproach to all involved that the sole artistic haul from the Channel tunnel is half a dozen French fish. * It was always predicted that 1994 would be the year that the arts would suffer from lower government and local authority grants, reduced sponsorship, and falling box office revenue. The consequences have arrived early. As usual the smallest have come off worst. Ten arts organisations in London, including Double Edge theatre group, Greenwich Mural Workshop, and Islington Arts Factory, have lost their London Arts Board grants. The LAB, faced with a 2.25 per cent reduction from the Arts Council, has kept things ticking over with standstill grants for most of its 140 clients. A few special cases, such as the Drill Hall and Camden Arts Centre, get good uplifts, but it is curtains for the ten. Timothy Mason, LAB's chief executive, is trying to bolster regional arts groups in the capital at the expense of small neighbourhood activists. At the other extreme Jeremy Isaacs, general director at Covent Garden, must decide soon whether to drop one of the most awaited productions of the season, Puccini's La fanciulla del West, with Domingo scheduled to appear twice and Gwyneth Jones making what could be her last appearances at the Garden. With a frozen Arts Council grant, and box office below target, Isaacs is tempted to replace this expensive opera with another revival, Tosca. This is what cuts in arts funding mean - not wholesale closures but candle-end economies. It also means taking fewer risks. Another hard pressed opera company, Welsh National Opera, is also dropping a planned production, Smetana's The Two Widows, which opened recently to mixed reviews at the London Coliseum. It would look much better on the WNO's small Cardiff stage but it cannot afford to take chances at the box office. Finally the Barbican has rationalised away 15 jobs from the 172 employed in the City of London's arts centre. Here again falling revenues has been the driving force behind greater efficiency.</p>

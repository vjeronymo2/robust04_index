			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Xie Rong (6200 </F> 2837)]    [Text] Ashkhabat, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Persons in charge of  the relevant departments of China and Turkmenistan signed three  documents here in the morning of 22 April. Premier Li Peng, who  is currently on a visit here, and Turkmen President Niyazov  attended the document-signing ceremony.    The three documents are an agreement on a government loan to  be offered by China to Turkmenistan, a protocol on [regular]  consultations between the Chinese and Turkmen Foreign  Ministries, and a letter of intent on cooperation between the  China National Petroleum Corporation and Turkmenistan's Ministry  of Oil and Gas on a natural gas pipeline project.    An exchange of notes on China's granting goods and materials  to Turkmenistan free of charge was signed today, too.    Prior to the document-signing ceremony, Turkmen Oil and Gas  Minister Suyunov briefed Premier Li Peng and his party on a  tentative plan to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan  to Japan via China. He said: Turkmenistan's current proved  reserves of natural gas and petroleum reached 21,000 billion  cubic meters and 5 billion to 6 billion tonnes, respectively.  The exploitation of these resources will make Turkmenistan  become an energy-exporting country. The length of the natural  gas pipeline is 6,130 km on land and 880 km to 1,100 km by sea.  It will be a project whose implementation will span this  century and the next. Its inauguration will be beneficial to  Turkmenistan, China, and Japan. Premier Li Peng attentively  listened to the briefing and asked detailed questions about the  relevant situation.    Today, a ceremony conferring on Premier Li Peng the title of  academician emeritus of the Turkmenistan Academy of Sciences was  also held in the hall of the presidential office.    Today at noon, Ismail Amat, state councillor and  concurrently  minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, and who  accompanied Premier Li Peng on his visit, cut the ribbon for the  inauguration of the Asia Hotel, a Sino-Turkmen joint venture  located in a suburb of Ashkhabat. Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister  Saljayev [name as received] and Chinese Ambassador to  Turkmenistan Cheng Zhensheng attended the ribbon-cutting  ceremony.</p>

"The area of influence under the mark has grown in a short  time from sixty to one hundred million people, indirect  influence is being tripled, and that's not the end of it because  other countries in the area of the mark are knocking at the  Union's door," Costa said Thursday [3 March], commenting the  agreements reached Monday with the three northern states, which  may join the EU in January 1995.    The prospects for Italy at the turn of the century will not  be very bright, especially if Italy is unable "to gain  considerable political and economic room in Europe and in the  Mediterranean," Costa added.    "Europe itself, which inappropriately criticized us for our  state-run overspending, never misses a chance to fatten itself  with Franco-Prussian bureaucrats and to approve antifree market  measures such as those on milk quotas," Costa claimed, referring  to EU demands for reductions in milk production.    Italy, Costa asserted, must be able to negotiate and "fight"  in a Europe which he described as "sometimes contradictory --  but always serious and careful with detail -- and conditioned,  tomorrow more than today, by the Bundesbank."</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Man in the News: The UN's protector of a fragile peace - Marrack Goulding Early yesterday morning Mr Marrack Goulding was in a New York hospital. Not, happily, with gunshot wounds, although it well might have been: three days earlier he had been fired on by pro-Iranian militiamen in south Lebanon while inspecting the scene of an Israeli incursion into UN-policed territory. Mr Goulding's medical problem is more prosaic, though not unrelated to his job as UN under secretary-general in charge of peacekeeping. Two months ago he had what is normally a routine operation to correct Dupuytren's contraction, a claw-like stiffening of the hand, but he has been in pain ever since. 'I travelled too soon,' he explains. 'It got infected in the Western Sahara, and then I had to go straight from there to Yugoslavia and had some rather bizarre treatment in Zagreb.' Is it getting better? 'Not really. The medical advice is not to get stressed out . . .' He gives a hollow laugh. The chance of his being able to follow this advice is clearly zero. Peacekeeping is in far too much demand these days to allow any prospect of peace and quiet for the man in charge of it. Mr Goulding has 10 such operations under his command at present, including the unprecedentedly ambitious task of bringing peace and reconstruction to Cambodia, which involves supervising both the existing administration and the election of a new one. It is now six years since Mr Goulding ('Mig' to his friends) left the British Foreign Office in mid-career - he was 48 and had been ambassador in Angola - to join an organisation he then regarded as 'probably terminally ill'. He took over from Sir Brian Urquhart, a lifelong UN servant who had built up the peacekeeping function virtually from scratch, drawing on his experience in the British army where he served right through the second world war. Mr Goulding, by contrast, served only three months in the Royal Artillery before being medically discharged. He has a slightly 'hot-and-bothered' manner which contrasts with Sir Brian's legendary unflappability. But his nerve has held under fire, and he has grown into the responsibility. His talents were rewarded earlier this month when Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the new UN secretary-general (with whom Mr Goulding clearly has an easier relationship than he did with his predecessor, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar), kept him on, in charge of an enlarged department, as one of only eight under secretaries-general where there were 17 before. Three years ago, when Mr Perez de Cuellar separated peacekeeping from 'peacemaking' (ie: political diplomacy), Mr Goulding felt slighted and frustrated that his own role was confined to the former; but now he is quite happy with the division of labour. 'It would be boring,' he adds, 'if we were back in the bad old days when there were only five operations and nothing much was happening.' But now 'new peacekeeping operations are cropping up at the rate of five a year'. Even more encouraging is the fact that, unlike in the past, most of these operations can now be wound up after completing their mission according to a timetable, instead of getting bogged down and dragging on year after year. Thus all five of those set up in 1988-89 have now been completed: those that supervised the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq, the Cuban withdrawal from Angola and the independence of Namibia, plus the observer group in Central America. Mr Goulding admits, by contrast, to being 'very uneasy' about Yugoslavia, which he fears may become 'another Unifil' - the luckless UN force which has been in south Lebanon since 1978, and has become a target for both sides. These fears are shared by Mr Boutros-Ghali. But both came to the conclusion that the dangers if no UN force were sent to Yugoslavia would be even more grievous. There are, Mr Goulding explains, two kinds of peacekeeping operations. The classic type, of which Yugoslavia is an example, is put in 'to create the conditions in which negotiations can go on', usually by helping maintain the ceasefire at the end of a war. The newer type, seen in Namibia, Cambodia, Western Sahara and El Salvador, forms part of a political settlement which has already been negotiated but requires an impartial third party to oversee its implementation. In both types of operation, he stresses, it is crucial that the peacekeeping side be fully informed and consulted by those who negotiate the terms on which a peacekeeping force is to be sent in. In this respect he regards the process in El Salvador, where he worked very closely with his 'peacemaking' colleague Mr Alvaro de Sota, as a model; by contrast, he describes the arrangements in Western Sahara, negotiated in great secrecy by Mr Perez de Cuellar's special envoy Mr Issa Diallo (now head of the UN's Economic Commission for Africa) as 'a disaster'. Similarly, Mr Goulding feels hopeful that at least the worst pitfalls of Lebanon can be avoided in Yugoslavia because in the latter case he was able to work very closely with the special envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, who negotiated the terms of the UN force's deployment. Peacekeeping, as Mr Goulding himself puts it, has become 'the flavour of the decade'. Armenia is now calling for a UN force in Nagorno-Karabakh, and who know which other ex-Soviet republics will soon make similar demands. This is flattering, but Mr Goulding foresees problems. One is money: already there is a head-on clash over the cost of the Yugoslav operation between the Secretariat and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council which, Mr Goulding says, are 'very reluctant to make available the money we say it's going to cost'. In the case of Namibia the Council drastically reduced the size of the force Mr Goulding had asked for, and he blames this for the deaths of 333 people when Swapo guerrillas swarmed across the Angolan frontier in April 1989, straight into the guns of the South African army. The second problem he sees is the management capacity of the Secretariat itself, which is already 'stretched to breaking point'. 'Nobody round here ever gets such a thing as a weekend, or can count on getting home before 10 or 10.30 any evening' - a fact his wife Susan ruefully confirms. 'We need more people, better financial and administrative procedures. We must have the money available when we need it. At the moment we have no authority to spend anything. We need reserves.' But Mr Goulding stresses that he is not complaining about a job which has 'more than lived up to expectations'. His contract has been extended for a year, but he says he would gladly serve another six.</p>

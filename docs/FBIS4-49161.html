			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xin Wenchu (6580 2429 0443): "Guangdong Provincial </F> Party Secretary Xie Fei Delivers Important Speech at Provincial  Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting; Stresses Need To Use  Scientific Theories To Arm Cadres, Attach Importance To Grasp  Education of Teenagers, and Improve and Strengthen Propaganda  Mechanism"]    [Text] The Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee held the  Guangdong Provincial Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting in  Guangzhou yesterday. Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau member and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC  Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting.  Propaganda and ideological work, he pointed out with emphasis,  has always been an important aspect of the party's work and is  an important channel for implementing the party's policies and  principles, uniting the ideology of the whole party and the  people of the whole country, and realizing party leadership.  Propaganda and ideological work play an important role in  uniting, mobilizing, and encouraging the people of Guangdong to  strive to basically realize the magnificent goal of  modernization in Guangdong within 20 years. Party committees  and governments at all levels, various trades and professions,  and various units should attach great importance to doing a good  job in the propaganda and ideological work in the new period and  should make greater achievements in this respect.    The meeting was held in the provincial party committee  auditorium yesterday morning. Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting.  Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin, and Huang Hua, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee, also made important speeches.  Wang Zongchun, Yao Siren, Zhang Hanqing, Li Lanfang, and Huang  Hao also attended the meeting.    Xie Fei's speech was divided into four parts: 1) attach  importance to and strengthen propaganda and ideological work; 2)  educate the broad masses of cadres and party members with the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3) do  a good job in giving guidance to public opinion; and 4) properly  grasp the building of basic engineering in propaganda and  ideological work.    The great practice of establishing the socialist market  economy structure and developing the socialist productive forces  with great efforts, Xie Fei pointed out, have provided a new  impetus and favorable opportunity, putting forward even more  important tasks for, and higher demands on, propaganda and  ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work are faced with  even more arduous tasks. The establishment of the socialist  market economy structure urgently demands that propaganda and  ideological work create a public opinion environment of  enthusiastically forging ahead.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, Xie Fei stressed in his speech, is  contemporary Marxism in China. Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made  his important remarks during his inspection tour of the south in  1992, tremendous changes have taken place in the society,  economy, and the people's mental attitude in our province. This  is inseparable from the fact that various localities in our  province have seriously organized the study of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The  establishment of the socialist market economy structure, the  further liberation and development of the productive forces, and  the speeding up of socialist modernization have put forward new  and higher demands on our theoretical level, our level of  understanding of policies, and our work ability. To meet the  needs of such demands we must have a thorough understanding of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and be able to use it skillfully in practice. Leading cadres at  all levels should, despite their heavy workloads, consciously  find time for studying theories and should strive to improve  their own ideological and political quality and to raise their  theoretical level. They should be determined to get away from  and reduce unnecessary social intercourse and should, in light  of major issues of the reform and development of their  respective localities and departments, concentrate their minds  on the study of theories, read more books, ponder on problems,  skillfully use scientific theories as guidance to solve problems  in practice, and strive to raise their level in the art of  leadership and other kinds of work. In studying the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics at present, we  should mainly study the third volume of "The Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping." In our study, we should pay attention to  properly settling the following issues: 1) firmly grasp the  essence of the emancipation of the mind and seeking truth from  facts and establish the Marxist world outlook and methodology;  2) guide the broad masses of party members and cadres to  seriously sum up the experience in reform and opening up in the  past 15 years and strengthen the faith in taking the road of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the  party's leadership; 3) strive to improve the ability to lead and  control the socialist market economy; and 4. improve study  methods, widen channels of study, and uphold the style of study  of linking theory with practice.    Adhering to a correct public opinion guidance is to adhere  to the party's basic line, properly propagandize the party's  line, policies, and principles, and strive to arouse the  enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and to guide them toward  the realization of modernization, said Xie Fei. Our public  opinion should be conducive to: Furthering reform and opening  up, the establishment of the socialist market economy structure,  and the development of the social productive forces; encouraging  and urging the people to do arduous pioneering work and to blaze  new trails in making the country prosper, the people happy, and  the society progressive; helping the people distinguish right  from wrong, to uphold the true, the good, and the beautiful, and  to resist the false, the ugly, and the vicious; and conducive to  the unity of the country, the solidarity of the nation, the  easing of the minds of the people, and the social and political  stability.    To adhere to a correct public opinion guidance, Xie Fei  pointed out, it is necessary to correctly handle three kinds of  relationship: That between healthiness of contents and  liveliness in form--the two should be integrated; and that  between positive propaganda and negative exposure--uphold the  principle of unity, stability, arousing enthusiasm, and taking  positive propaganda as the dominant factor, while exposing and  criticizing things on the negative and dark side of the society  and giving play to the role of supervision with public opinion  but it is necessary to seek truth from facts, have a sense of  propriety, take social effects into consideration, and pay  attention to effects at home and abroad; and the relationship  between social effects and economic effects. We must properly  grasp a crucial point and that is, improvement of the quality of  the journalist contingent.    To properly grasp basic engineering in propaganda and  ideological work, emphasized Xie Fei, at present it is necessary  to concentrate our efforts on properly grasping four aspects of  work. The first is to grasp the foundation, that is, it is  necessary to properly grasp the foundation of education for  teenagers. Teenagers are the future and hope of the motherland  and efforts should be made to properly grasp education and  training for them and to develop them into a new generation of  people with ideals, ethics, culture, and a sense of discipline.  The second is to grasp the grass roots. Propaganda,  ideological, and cultural departments at all levels should place  the focal point of their work at the grass roots. It is  necessary to carry out propaganda and ideological work and the  building of spiritual civilization in the grass roots and to  give full play to various kinds of organizational role for  grass-roots party branches as a powerful fighting force. It is  necessary to carry out in the grass roots various kinds of  activities which are healthy and progressive in content, vivid  and lively in form, and attractive to the masses and the  contents of propaganda and education should be merged with such  activities to silently exert a subtle influence. The third is to  grasp the position. The construction of hardware for  propaganda, culture, and spiritual civilization is the material  basis for improving the quality of ideology and ethics and the  quality of science and culture of human beings. It is also one  of the marks indicating whether or not a locality is "grasping  with both hands" and "grasping hard with both hands" and  indicating the level of economic and social development of that  locality. Various localities should include the "hardware" of  propaganda and cultural undertakings into the overall plan for  economic and social development and into the government annual  financial spending budget and gradually increase the percentage  of investment. The fourth is to grasp the mechanism. It is  necessary to sum up the successful experience of various  localities in our province since reform and opening up began, to  meet the new demands of the development of the socialist market  economy, and to further form, improve, and consolidate the  following mechanisms: The switch-on and guarantee mechanism  enabling party committees to strengthen leadership, governments  to pay attention, and various quarters to participate; the  mechanism enabling the comprehensive use of administrative,  economic, and legal means to carry out management, regulation,  and control; and the mechanism enabling the masses to govern and  discipline themselves, to educate themselves, and to keep  themselves within bounds.    Party committees at all levels should really undertake their  responsibilities and earnestly strengthen leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, Xie Fei pointed out  emphatically. First, party committees at all levels should  strengthen guidance and coordination in propaganda and  ideological work, regularly study and analyze the ideological  trends of various social strata, determine the policy, major  tasks, and focal points of propaganda and ideological work in  different periods, and give guidance to propaganda departments  and help them discuss and grasp major matters and carry out  their work in a down-to-earth manner. Second, party committees  and governments at all levels should give support to the  development of propaganda and cultural undertakings in terms of  financial and material resources. They must implement the  instruction by the central authorities that "taxes and profits  handed over to the state by the propaganda and cultural system  should, in principle, be returned to the system and should be  used for the development of propaganda and cultural  undertakings." Third, it is necessary to strengthen the building  of the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers. It is  necessary to show concern for their politics, ideology, work,  and livelihood, give full play to their role, and constantly  improve their quality.    The tremendous achievements made in economic construction  and other aspects in our province since the beginning of reform  and opening up cannot be separated from the hard work of the  broad masses of propaganda and ideological workers, Zhu Senlin  pointed out in his speech. The new situation has put forward  new tasks for, and new demands on, propaganda and ideological  work and propaganda and ideological departments have undertaken  even more important historical missions. Under the condition of  the socialist market economy, these departments should  enthusiastically explore ways and means to do a better job in  propaganda and ideological work, carry out their work in a  creative manner, and better serve the reform, opening up, and  economic construction of the whole province. They should, in  accordance with the general goal and demand of basically  realizing modernization in Guangdong within 20 year, make great  efforts to developing flourishing propaganda and cultural  undertakings. Governments at all levels should attach  importance and give support to propaganda and ideological work,  let the propaganda and ideological department know about the  situation in good time, and try their best to provide better  conditions for propaganda and ideological work so that it can  produce greater benefits. They should include the building of  propaganda and cultural undertakings into the general plan for  the local economy and society, make overall arrangements, and  construct in a planned way a number of relatively modern  propaganda and cultural facilities which are in keeping with the  economic development. They should, with the economic  development, appropriately increase input into propaganda and  cultural undertakings and resolutely implement an economic  policy to support the propaganda and cultural undertakings. They  should continue to encourage various social quarters to run  propaganda and cultural undertakings and give them support in  this respect. They should grasp prosperity in one hand and  management with the other and make great efforts to straighten  out problems existing in the cultural market. They should  attach importance to improving the working and living conditions  of the broad masses of cadres and workers in the propaganda and  cultural systems.    Huang Hua relayed at the meeting the guidelines of the  national propaganda and ideological work meeting and put forward  views on the implementation of such guidelines. To implement  the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  meeting, he stressed, we must link them with the reality of  Guangdong, grasp the key points and, in particular, make great  efforts "to arm the people with scientific theories, to guide  the people with correct public opinion, to portray the people  with noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works."  We must formulate plans, grasp typical examples, improve work  methods, provide better services on our own initiative,  earnestly do a better job in all kinds of work, and strive to  attain good results. We must, Huang Hua added, earnestly  strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and  ideological workers, constantly improve their quality, and  further inspire their enthusiasm to make the country prosperous,  to forge ahead, and to make new contributions to opening up a  new situation in the propaganda and ideological work in our  province and to basically realize modernization in Guangdong  within 20 years.    Also attending the meeting were deputy secretaries in charge  of propaganda and ideological work from party committees in  cities at the prefectural level, heads of propaganda departments  of party committees of various cities and counties (districts),  chief editors of party committee official newspapers from  various cities, persons in charge of various departments and  bureaus of the propaganda system directly under the provincial  party committee, persons in charge of ideological work of units  concerned directly under the provincial party committee, heads  of propaganda departments central authority units concerned in  Guangzhou, and representatives attending the provincial external  propaganda work meeting, the provincial meeting of directors of  cultural bureaus of cities, the provincial meeting of directors  of radio and television bureaus of cities, and the Guangzhou  City propaganda and ideological work meeting, totaling nearly  1,000 people.</p>

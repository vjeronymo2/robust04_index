			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director finds that the proposed revision at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;14(6) is not consistent with section 526(e) of SMCRA and does not approve it. The Director requires Utah to amend its program to eliminate the discrepancy in the appellate procedures that govern Board decisions on permit applications in a manner no less stringent than the requirements of section 526(e) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a), Delegation of Authority for Assessing Civil Penalties in Certain Circumstances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a), Utah proposed to change the responsible party from the Board to the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) for assessing civil penalties when a violation of permit condition or other provision of Chapter 10, Title 40 occurs. Section 518(i) of SMCRA provides, in part, that States shall incorporate into their programs, civil and criminal penalty provisions that are no less stringent than section 518 of SMCRA and procedural requirements relating to these provisions that are the same or similar to those set forth in SMCRA. Utah's proposed transfer of authority for civil penalty assessments from the Board to the Division is not inconsistent with section 518(i) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed revision to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20 (1)(a) and (3)(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3), Contest of Violation or Amount of Penalty <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed to delete existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) in its entirety. Most of the requirements of existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) are recodified in this amendment as UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(2) (see finding No. 2). One requirement of existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) that is not retained and recodified elsewhere in the statute pertains to a waiver of rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty when the operator fails to forward to the Board within 30 days of receipt of the notice of violation the proposed civil penalty for placement in an escrow account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 518(c) of SMCRA provides, in part, that failure to forward the amount of a proposed civil penalty to the Secretary within the specified time ``shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.'' In order to be no less stringent than SMCRA, the Utah program must include a similar provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this amendment does not include the waiver requirement, OSM notes that Utah has in another amendment dated April 14, 1994, proposed a provision that is intended to resolve this deficiency (administrative record No. UT&hyph;917). In order to consider the additional proposal prior to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer decision on the deletion of the part of existing UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3) that provided that an operator's failure to forward the amount of a proposed civil penalty to Utah within 30 days results in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8), Civil Penalty for Failure to Correct Violation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed editorial revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8). However, aside from these revisions, OSM noted in its letter dated June 10, 1994, that, while section 518(h) of SMCRA specifically references section 525, regarding administrative reviews, and section 526, regarding judicial reviews, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8) did not contain any specific cross-references to counterpart provisions of the Utah program. Utah responded (administrative record No. UT&hyph;949) that the reviews provided in SMCRA by reference are found in the State program at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;22. The Director finds that the reference provided by Utah meets the requirements of section 518(h) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii), Recovery of Reclamation Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii), provides a formula for determining the sale price of reclaimed abandoned mine lands to be sold to a State or local government for public purposes, but the formula does not include the cost of purchase as required by section 407(e) of SMCRA. This apparent deficiency in the Utah plan would render Utah's plan less stringent than section 407(e) of SMCRA, but OSM notes that Utah has proposed to address this deficiency in a separate amendment dated April 14, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;914). In order to consider the additional proposal prior to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer decision on proposed UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(a)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(b)(i) and (2)(b), Delegation of Authority to Waive Fees and Liens Against Reclaimed Land <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed to revise its provisions at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(b)(i) and (2)(b) to provide that the Division rather than the Board may waive special charges for use of reclaimed land or liens against reclaimed land in certain circumstances. Title IV of SMCRA does not prohibit a State regulatory authority from delegating responsibility for administering and enforcing the Federal provisions. Section 413(a) of SMCRA provides, in part, that a State with an approved State program shall have the power and authority to engage in any work and to do all things necessary or expedient in order to implement and administer the provisions of Title IV. Utah's proposed transfer of authority to waive special charges for use of or liens against reclaimed land in certain circumstances from the Board to the Division is not inconsistent with section 413(a) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed revision to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28 (1)(b)(i) and (2)(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a), Liens Against Reclaimed Land <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposed editorial revisions to UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a), which requires that the Division shall place a lien against reclaimed abandoned mine land, the market value of which has increased as a result of the reclamation work, except where the surface owner neither consented to, participated in, nor exercised control over the mining operations which necessitated the reclamation work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 408(a) of SMCRA has the same provisions, but it additionally specifies, with respect to the surface owner, that the provisions apply to a person owning the surface prior to May 2, 1977. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

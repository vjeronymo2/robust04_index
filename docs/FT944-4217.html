			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Property: The square in a hole - Investors, not architects, will decide the future of London's Paternoster Square The future of Paternoster Square - the ugly concrete precinct next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London - will be decided in the next few months. But after almost a decade of public wrangling about what should occupy London's most sensitive development site, it will be investors rather than architects or planners which will determine the outcome. The planning process is finally chugging to a conclusion. Last week, Standard Life, the UK life insurance group, won detailed planning permission to redevelop Juxon House, in the south-west corner of Paternoster Square, directly opposite the cathedral. Paternoster Associates - a joint venture between UK developer Greycoat, Park Tower Realty of the US and Mitsubishi Estate of Japan which owns 4.2 acres of the seven-acre site - should clear the final planning hurdle in January. It was in 1987 that proposals for a modernist design for the site were scrapped when the Prince of Wales described the competition which produced it as 'demoralising'. The City of London planning authorities granted outline permission for Paternoster Associates' new neo-clasical design in October 1992. These envisage 750,000 sq ft of offices and more than 80 shops and restaurants to a plan which aims to recapture the pattern of streets and lanes which existed before the area was levelled in the second world war. Standard Life is now free to build 185,000 sq ft of offices to a design by Whitfield Partners, the architectural practice run by Sir William Whitfield, who is also a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission. Including Sudbury Tower, which is owned by Nuclear Electric, the UK utility, the entire Paternoster Square site could accommodate more than 1m sq ft of office space. But when will the developers have the confidence and financial resources to start work? Although Standard Life now has full consent, it is by no means clear that it will press ahead with redevelopment of Juxon House. The existing building is let to Barclays Bank on a lease with about 70 years left to run. The landlord would have to be sure of finding a new tenant at rents above current levels to make redevelopment worthwhile. Mr Alex Watt, property investment manager at Standard Life, said: 'The main question is financial: when is the right time for us to build. We also have to ask whether tenants will want to occupy offices next to a major building site. It could make sense for us to wait until the rest of the Paternoster development is finished.' The initiative, therefore, is with Paternoster Associates as owners of the majority of the site. The consortium paid Pounds 160m for its slice of Paternoster Square in 1989. However, after five years of delay and planning battles the total cost is thought to be about Pounds 260m. But the market value of the site is now much less - possibly as low as Pounds 30m, according to other developers. Each of the partners originally contributed Pounds 15m equity, with the rest of the acquisition funded with debt provided by Mitsubishi. Greycoat and Park Tower Realty have since written down the value of their stake to zero, so the site is, in effect, in the hands of Mitsubishi. The Japanese company, part of the powerful family of companies which includes Mitsubishi Bank, was once seen as the main supplier of long-term development finance to Paternoster Associates. However, the Japanese group has suffered from a domestic property recession as fierce as anything experienced in London. Under these circumstances, the estimated Pounds 375m development costs will have to be found elsewhere. Greycoat is trying to organise a group of financial institutions to fund the six new buildings planned. The snag is that work can not start in such a sensitive area until funding for all six phases has been committed. Paternoster Associates cannot run the risk that its grand design will end up half finished. Trying to find a funding formula which satisfies six or more financial institutions and all three partners in Paternoster Associates will not be easy. The biggest hurdle could be Mitsubishi's reluctance to recognise the true value of Paternoster Square. It made loans of about Pounds 200m to Paternoster Associates to fund the initial acquisition of the site and work carried out since. Conventional institutional funding would effectively involve selling the finished development forward, which could force the Japanese company to take an unwelcome write-down on the loans. There are doubtless ways in which these problems can be overcome - such as keeping the ground lease with Mitsubishi and granting long sub-leases to institutions. But time is running out if Paternoster Square is to capitalise on the shortage of City office space. On paper, Paternoster should provide attractive accommodation with floors of up to 30,000 sq ft - exactly the type of office space which is now in short supply. But Paternoster is not the only potential City development looking for institutional funding. The authorities have already granted planning permission for an extra 13.6m sq ft of office space within the City. Of this, more than 7m sq ft covers sites which are currently empty and waiting for work to start. The lead-times on property development are such that Paternoster Associates can be fairly confident that there will not be an oversupply of new offices much before 1999. To get the whole development finished by then, though, demands that cranes are erected by the middle of next year at the latest. Mr Peter Thornton, managing director of Greycoat, conceded that the timetable is tight. 'With a three and a half year development schedule ahead of us we really need to be ready to roll by the middle of next year,' he said. 'I would not like to be starting later than the summer. Trying to get the funding sorted out over the next three months will be critical.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    PATERNOSTER SQUARE: WASTED YEARS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 1985            Consortium led by Stockley and British Land                     buys Paternoster Square from Church Commissioners                     for Pounds 80m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 1987            Mountleigh buys Stockley  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 1988            Mountleigh takes full control for Paternoster site  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1988            Mountleigh sells to Organization Diego Cisneros                     of Venezuela for Pounds 230m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1989            Greycoat and Park Tower Realty form Paternoster                     Associates and buy site for Pounds 160m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 1990            Mitsubishi Estate takes 30 per cent stake in                     Paternoster Associates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991                Greycoat writes down Paternoster investment to zero  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Summer 1995         Development work to start?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

As early as  last year, the presence of a Namibian embassy in Israel would  have been unthinkable because of SWAPO's [South-West African  People's Organization] open criticism of the Jewish state.  Shortly after independence, the Namibian Government formally  established diplomatic ties with the Palestine Liberation  Organization [PLO] at the ambassadorial level and continued its  campaign of open support for the organization of Yasir 'Arafat.  A brief statement issued last week on decisions made at the  first cabinet meeting in Windhoek for 1994 notes that the  cabinet has decided to empower Minister of Foreign Affairs Theo  Ben Gurirab to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel.    The cabinet has also given its permission for a high-level  Israeli business delegation to visit Namibia within the next  three weeks and for ministries to hold talks with the delegation  on "areas of interest" for Namibia. The cabinet has taken note  of the policy objectives being pursued at this stage, concerning  the Middle East and especially the negotiations between the PLO  and the Israeli Government. In his New Year's message to the  diplomatic corps last week, the president, Mr. Sam Nujoma,  referred to the agreement between Israel and the PLO as one of  the top "achievements" of 1993. He said that the prospects of  self-government for Palestine is closer than ever before  following the signing of the peace agreement. Israel and the  PLO signed the historic agreement on Palestinian autonomy in  Gaza and Jericho in Washington on 13 September. In the  agreement, Israel and the PLO undertook to officially recognize  each other.</p>

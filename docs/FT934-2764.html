			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Escaping the annuity trap - As rates fall, William Burrows suggests ways to achieve better returns The Budget seems to have satisfied the markets that public spending and inflation are under control. As a result, the gilts market has rallied and, consequently, yields have dropped again. This has triggered more falls in annuity rates; five companies cut theirs last week. With these rates at their lowest for more than 20 years, some advisers are arguing that conventional annuities are providing bad value for money because those holding them are being locked into a low-yielding investment from which there is no escape. It is, however, now possible to escape from the annuity straitjacket by considering some other types of annuity. These include with-profits and unit-linked annuities, and self-invested annuities. The main advantage of these options is that those who have annuities are not locked into a low-yielding investment for life but can benefit from future investment returns. The chart shows how annuity rates have fallen by nearly 25 per cent since 1990. Rates move in parallel to medium-dated gilt yields and, if interest rates fall, so will annuity rates (but not by the same degree). The timing of an annuity purchase is probably the most important factor when trying to maximise pension income. But correct timing is affected by three variables: annuity rates increase with age; they rise and fall with investment yields; and the accumulated pension fund depends on prevailing unit prices. Many people are delaying buying an annuity because they expect rates to rise in the future. But they may be failing to take into account the real cost of the lost income. For example, a male of 65 with a pension fund of Pounds 100,000 can get Pounds 11,120 a year. If he decided to buy an annuity at 66, then, if the fund grew by 6 per cent and rates stayed the same, he would receive Pounds 12,050, an increase of Pounds 930. But he would have lost out on that year's income of Pounds 11,120. Clearly, there is an opportunity cost in delaying the purchase of an annuity, and this is difficult to calculate. With annuities which are linked to investment funds, it does not matter if annuity rates are low because the starting income need not be calculated with reference to present gilt yields. The annual pension with a with-profits annuity is calculated by referring to the performance of the underlying with-profits fund. As bonuses are awarded only once each year, an anticipated bonus level is selected at the start. If, for example, an 8 per cent bonus (at present, the highest allowed) was selected, the starting income would be about the same as a guaranteed annuity - but would increase by 2 per cent if a 10 per cent bonus was declared. If the bonus was only 6 per cent, then the income would fall by 2 per cent. There is a danger that with-profits annuities can fall if future bonuses are lower than expected. But as the starting annuity is calculated without reference to gilt yields, they appear good value when annuity rates are low and, consequently, are not so attractive when rates are high. Only Prudential (which has a minimum purchase price of Pounds 100,000) and Equitable Life offer with-profits annuity contracts. Unit-linked annuities work in a simpler way but units are cashed to provide the pension payments. These are a much riskier investment and not many policies are sold. Self-invested annuities are a revolutionary idea. Say Pounds 100,000 was invested and 25 per cent taken as tax-free cash. The balance would be invested in one or more unit-linked or with-profits pension funds. A level of income is selected which is somewhere between a minimum of 5 per cent and the maximum. If, say, 8 per cent is chosen, then the relevant number of units are cashed each time a payment is made. If the fund grows by 10 per cent a year, the pension fund will grow by 2 per cent (ignoring charges); but if the fund grew by only 6 per cent, then the fund would reduce in size. The level of income can be reviewed each year and the investments switched between funds. Part or all of the fund can be converted into a conventional annuity at any time. One very important aspect is that the managed annuity should continue to be paid to dependants after the holder dies. Unlike conventional annuities, spouse's pensions do not have to be bought at the outset. At present, this contract is offered only by Equitable Life, which calls it the managed annuity, but other companies are designing similar contracts. Managed annuities are available only for personal or self-employed pensions. It might be possible to transfer the pension from a company-sponsored scheme to a personal plan, but professional advice must be sought. In deciding which annuity is best for any given set of circumstances, there are three important considerations: Value for money. Many people feel that guaranteed annuities give poor value for money and the other options provide better returns. Peace of mind and security. This means different things to different people but some will prefer a guaranteed annuity, where the benefits are known in advance, to a pension that depends on the stock market. Investment-linked pensions are not suitable for people who require a guaranteed income or do not want to take risks. Flexibility. There is a tendency to view the need for retirement income as being static, but many people can look forward to receiving lump sums from insurance plans, inheritances or investments. With managed annuities, pension income can be tailored to meet specific requirements. Now that there is more choice, it is important to take professional advice about your retirement options. You do not need to be a victim of low rates, but better returns come only with greater risk.

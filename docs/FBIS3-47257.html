Lt. Gen. Chang Song, superintendent of the military academy,  was named to head the committee, a ministry official said.

The committee will be operated through the end of February  and its membership number 15 -- eight for the Yulgok project  subcommittee and seven for the supply procurement one.    Members have been picked up from among logistics experts at  the ministry, Joint Chiefs of Staff, tri-service headquarters  and defense institutes, the official added.</p>

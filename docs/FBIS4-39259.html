			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- "The leadership of  the Dniester Republic considers the crisis in Crimea an internal  affair of the Ukraine," declared to BASA Valeriy Litskay, state  secretary of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. He  mentioned that the Tiraspol officials are keeping in touch with  Crimean leaders, but, in his opinion, these contacts are a  matter of routine. According to the state secretary, the  Simferopol authorities, despite rumours, have not asked for  support from Tiraspol. Referring to the notion of creating a  union of unrecognized states, suggested by the leaders of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Valeriy Litskay stressed that the Tiraspol  officials had not been officially requested to enter this union.  "We had not been offered documents such as the statute or the  program of the union. Our position concerning the Union of  Unrecognized States will depend solely on the contents of such  documents," mentioned Litskay.</p>

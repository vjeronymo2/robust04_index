			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Northern Foods in big trade Leading food manufacturer Northern Foods saw exceptionally heavy trade late in the day which prompted well-founded speculation that one of its biggest stakeholders had sold out. Large blocks of shares adding up to a total of 21m were all sold at 195p to PDFM, the fund management group which already holds 10 per cent of the group. Northern said it was unperturbed by the change of ownership and unaware of the seller's identity. If all the trades represented one side of the exchange, they would amount to more than 3.5 per cent of the company's shares. Several analysts said the seller might have been Norwich Union, which in August was recorded as owning 3.52 per cent of the group. The East Anglian insurance group was unavailable for comment last night. Northern Foods is expected to suffer in the short term from the recent deregulation of the milk industry - milk deliveries account for a large part of the company's business. On the other hand, Northern's shares have fallen by a third over the past two years and PDFM has a reputation for buying shares on weakness. Northern's shares closed a penny softer at 199p.</p>

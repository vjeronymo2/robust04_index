			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Growth in average earnings falls to lowest for 25 years GROWTH IN average earnings fell to its lowest level for 25 years in April and is expected to fall further in the next few months. The fall, to an underlying rate of 7 per cent in the year to April, had been long awaited. In spite of falling inflation and rising unemployment, the underlying growth of average earnings - which measures levels of earnings rather than pay rises - has hovered stubbornly at roughly 7.5 per cent since the middle of last year. In December it fell to 7.25 per cent, where it stayed until April. The actual increase in average earnings in the year to April fell even more sharply, to 6 per cent compared with 8.8 per cent in March. The slowdown in the rate of earnings growth was spread across all sectors of the economy. Average earnings for manufacturing employees fell from 7.75 per cent in March to 7.25 per cent in April. The Department of Employment said higher overtime working compared with a year ago was holding the figure up by about 0.5 per cent. Earnings growth in the service industries fell from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent, the lowest rate for 25 years. According to the department, the overall fall in earnings growth in April was partly the result of lower pay settlements of a year ago feeding through to the index. The April figure was also affected by the early payment of bonuses in March rather than April to avoid higher taxes under a possible Labour government. Figures for manufacturing unit wage costs, which fell sharply between March and April, reflected higher productivity and the slowdown in earnings growth. In April they fell by 0.4 per cent compared with a year before, the first negative figure for just over four years. That compares with growth of 5.7 per cent in the year to March. In the three months to April, unit wage costs grew by 2.7 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent in the three months to March. Manufacturing productivity, or output per head, grew by 4.9 per cent in the year to April, the highest rate of growth since April 1989. In the three months to April, it grew by 4.7 per cent compared with 3.8 per cent in the three months to March.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARLTON GIVES UP COMEBACK EFFORT  </P> <P> Steve Carlton, a four-time Cy Young Award winner who is second on baseball's  all-time strikeout list, today announced he is finished as a player after  repeated comeback attempts.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old left-hander, who was released a year ago by Minnesota after  allowing 18 earned runs in 10 innings, had surgery for removal of eight chips  from his left shoulder last September.  </P> <P> "My arm hasn't rehabilitated the way I had hoped," Carlton said in a statement  issued by the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he recorded 241 of his 329  career wins. "I'm still experiencing some pain and I've decided I no longer  would be active as a player."  </P></p>

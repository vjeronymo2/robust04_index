			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Higher margins boost Persimmon Pre-tax profits of Persimmon, the UK's eighth largest housebuilder, jumped 34 per cent, from Pounds 8.44m to Pounds 11.3m, in the first six months of this year, helped by sharply higher sales and margins. The housing operation on its own increased profits by 85 per cent, with last year's figures boosted by sale of advance corporation tax benefits of Pounds 2.36m. Turnover advanced from Pounds 73.4m to Pounds 91.3m. The interim dividend is increased from 2.8p to 3p, and is more than twice covered by earnings per share which rose from 6.7p to 7p. The shares put on 10p to close at 262p yesterday. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said profit margins had risen substantially as the group had used up much of the expensive land it bought in the late 1980s. Sales incentives introduced during the recession had also been reduced, while new house prices had risen by a 'few per cent'. Selling costs, which had risen from Pounds 1,500 per home in 1989 to Pounds 5,500 in 1992, had fallen to Pounds 3,700 by the first half of this year and were expected to fall to Pounds 3,000 next year. The number of homes sold during the first half had increased by 14.5 per cent, from 1,260 to 1,443. Persimmon expected to push up sales for the year as a whole from 2,771 to at least 3,250, rising to 4,000 next year. Mr Davidson was confident that the slow recovery in the housing market would continue. The company, to satisfy its expansion plans, had increased its land holdings to 16,500 plots owned or controlled with planning permission. This compared with about 14,300 a year ago. Persimmon expected to increase the number of plots to about 20,000 during the next 18 months. Mr Davidson said net borrowings as a result could rise to about Pounds 40m by the end of this year, equivalent to gearing of 20 per cent. This compared with net cash of Pounds 6m at the end of June following the group's Pounds 50m rights issue in March. COMMENT Persimmon's share price, which had underperformed the sector by about 7 per cent since the March rights issue, deserved to bounce back yesterday, helped by better news of August house sales. The margin improvement is encouraging, although the company is unlikely to recover to previous levels. The market, rightly, was perturbed about a further increase in the number of shares in issue, which has risen by 49 per cent since 1990. But the relative decline in Persimmon's rating looks to have gone too far for a quality builder with a strong land bank. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m, including ACT proceeds, would put the shares on a prospective p/e of 14.5, which looks cheap against the sector.</p>

Senada Cemurovic reports.    [Cemurovic] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, addressed a large number of  domestic and foreign journalists. Several tens were killed and  an enormous number injured, although the final toll is not yet  known, by a Chetnik shell that landed at about 1230 on  Sarajevo's busiest market, Markale. The Presidency has already  held an extraordinary session. The Executive Committee of the  city of Sarajevo, which also met, decided to declare 6 February  as a day of mourning.    [Unidentified correspondent] Ladies and gentlemen, according  to the latest report of the Bosnia-Herzegovina press agency 49  people were killed and 140 wounded killed by a 120-mm mortar  shell fired from the direction of either Mrkovici or Poljine.  The mortar shell was recently made and had not been painted  yet. That is one report.    As you may already know President Izetbegovic has ordered  our  state delegation to withdraw from the negotiations at Sarajevo  airport in the light of what has happened. I would now like to  ask President Izetbegovic to comment on this crime.    [Izetbegovic] First of all, my deepest condolences to the  families of the victims. This is a black and horrible day for  the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have decided to withdraw  from the talks at the airport. We have decided to hold an  emergency session of the Presidency, a joint session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and government, to examine the  justification of our presence at further talks in Geneva. We  are preparing a very brief letter to 30 or 40 statesmen of these  countries to inform them of what [happened] in Sarajevo today.  It will be a brief letter in which we will say that we feel as  if we have been condemned to death. We will demand that the  right to defend ourselves -- that was taken away from us -- be  granted back. We will let them know that all those who are  depriving us of this natural right to self- defense -- contained  in Article 41 of the UN Charter -- will be considered as  accomplices in this crime. Prime Minister Silajdzic and I are  now at your disposal to answer your questions.    [Correspondent] I would like to ask Prime Minister Silajdzic  -- who was at the airport at the time with representatives of  the Serb aggressor side -- how that side reacted to the largest  massacre in Sarajevo so far.    [Silajdzic] As always, they have rejected any responsibility  for this attack in Sarajevo.    [Izetbegovic] I should add here that I saw an UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] document today that unambiguously confirms  that the shell that killed those people -- two children among  them, if you recall -- in Dobrinja yesterday, had been fired  from Serb positions. This was a classified report to their  superiors.    [Correspondent] What do you expect from UNPROFOR as a result  of this?    [Izetbegovic] We do not need confirmation as to where the  shell had come from but nevertheless, they will investigate into  this. We want them to tell the world about what happened today,  to present their view to the world.    It has become common practice for the Serbs to claim,  whenever a heinous crime like this is committed, that we are  killing ourselves -- [Nikola] Koljevic, [republic of Srpska vice  president] said this about Dobrinja. If I get killed some day  they will claim it was a suicide.    [Izetbegovic's spokeswoman] We are receiving information  from  moment to moment. The figure we gave you -- 49 dead -- is  unfortunately, not final. However, it was confirmed that the  mortar shell came from Mrkovici.    [Correspondent] Do you think there is any special  significance in the fact that these two incidents happened in  two successive days in the week before the beginning of the  Geneva talks?    [Izetbegovic] We are wondering whether they wish to goad us  into making the wrong move. The first emotional response would  be to refuse to take part in any negotiations. However, I  believe we will not make such a wrong move, we will most  probably go to the talks. Of course, the final decision will be  made at the joint government and Presidency session, but I  believe we should keep a cool head and think rationally about  what we should do next.    [Correspondent] When will this joint session take place?    [Izetbegovic] At 1800 today. Are there any more questions?  Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL'S TRANQUILITY IS ABOUT TO STRIKE OUT;  </P> <P> CONTRACT: THE QUAKE-DELAYED WORLD SERIES HAD A UNIFYING EFFECT. COMING TALKS  MAY HAVE A SHATTERING ONE.  </P> <P> The tranquility Fay Vincent detected between management and players during the  earthquake-interrupted World Series is not likely to continue for long, to the  commissioner's chagrin.  </P> <P> Bargaining toward a basic agreement to replace the one that expires Dec. 31  will begin here this week with preliminary meetings between the owners'  negotiating team, the Player Relations Committee and the players' union, the  Major League Players Assn.  </P> <P> Talks are not expected to intensify until the week of Dec. 10, after management  finishes conducting its business at the winter meetings Dec. 2 to 7 in  Nashville, Tenn., and the Players Assn. holds its convention at about the same  time in Arizona.  </P> <P> This week, however, Player Relations Committee director Barry Rona will  officially present to Players Assn. director Donald Fehr an outline of a  proposed revenue sharing plan, the major thrust in the owners' negotiating  stance. Already, there are rumblings of skepticism about the plan in the  union's hall. The sides that seldom agree on anything seem to have another item  upon which to disagree.  </P> <P> At the general managers meetings last week in Palm Springs, Rona outlined the  preliminary proposal, which calls for what he termed "a working partnership."  </P> <P> Rona's proposal was for management to divide players into two categories: those  with experience of six seasons or more and those with experience of fewer than  six seasons.  </P> <P> For players in the second group, a pay-for-performance scale would determine  salaries. Money for that would come from a revenue sharing fund of all 26  clubs. The percentage of the clubs' revenues to be shared would be negotiated.  Signing of free agents in the first group would be determined by some form of  salary cap, although Rona prefers not to use that phrase.  </P> <P> "There would be no cap on any player's salary, and there would be no cap on a  club's payroll," he said. "A club may drive the payroll up to any level, but  once it reaches a certain plateau it cannot sign other clubs' free agents.  Clubs must reach the minimum payroll either by doing it on their own or by  signing free agents, their own players or their own free agents. If not, the  money must be turned over to the players in a lump sum."  </P> <P> The pay-for-performance scale for players with between zero and six seasons'  experience would be based on a formula using statistics over two years, similar  to the Elias Sports Bureau's ranking system to determine compensation for clubs  losing players to free agency.  </P> <P> The union is critical of management's proposal because it is designed to  eliminate salary arbitration, a system the Players Assn. wants to continue; the  association intends to negotiate toward making the system applicable to more  players.  </P> <P> In 1985 labor talks, the union agreed to limit salary arbitration to players  with three or more but fewer than six seasons' experience (players with six or  more seasons can become free agents).  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 45 California pear handlers subject to regulation under the order, and about 300 producers of pears in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule indefinitely suspends all of the pear provisions in the order, along with the rules and regulations issued thereunder, including: (1) Provisions pertaining to the administration of the order, including committee nominations and selections; (2) the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container, and inspection requirements; (3) the issuance of administrative rules and regulations related to exemptions and special purpose shipments; and (4) information collection and reporting requirements. The pear provisions being suspended are in &sect;&sect;917.4, 917.15, 917.20, 917.21, 917.24, 917.25, 917.26, 917.28, 917.29, 917.34, and 917.35 of the order; and in &sect;&sect;917.100, 917.121, 917.143, 917.149, 917.176, 917.179, and 917.461 of the rules and regulations issued thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule also suspends certain provisions in &sect;917.18 pertaining to nomination of Control Committee members, to enable the Control Committee to continue to function with only peach members upon suspension of the order's pear provisions. Since the pear provisions are being suspended, there is no need for the pear industry members to serve on the Control Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pear Commodity Committee (committee) unanimously recommended suspension of most of the pear provisions under the order, because such provisions are no longer needed. The California Bartlett pear industry is now functioning under the California Pear Marketing Program (State pear program), and is no longer using the pear order provisions. The State pear program, developed by the California Bartlett pear industry and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, is similar to the Federal pear program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee recommended suspension, not termination, of the order's pear provisions to provide the California Bartlett pear industry with an opportunity to review operations under the State pear program for an indefinite period of time. The committee wants to maintain the option of reactivating the Federal pear program, if the State pear program does not operate satisfactorily. The California pear industry will have the opportunity to examine the effectiveness of the State pear program until the end of the 1994 marketing season. At that time, the Department will conduct a referendum of eligible pear producers to determine whether they favor continuance of the Federal pear program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) has the authority to conduct a continuance referendum to determine whether producers affected by a marketing order favor continuance of their order. The Secretary has determined that continuance referenda are an effective means for ascertaining whether producers favor continuance of marketing order programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary would consider termination of the order's pear provisions if less than two-thirds of the pear producers voting in the referendum and producers of less than two-thirds of the volume of pears represented in the referendum, favor continuance. In evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretary would consider the results of the continuance referendum, other relevant information concerning the operation of the order's pear provisions, and the relative benefits and disadvantages to producers, handlers, and consumers. Through such analysis, the Secretary would determine whether continued existence of the order's pear provisions would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any event section 8c(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate an order whenever the Secretary finds that a majority of all producers favor termination, and that majority produced for market more than 50 percent of the commodity covered by the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event the Secretary terminates the order's pear provisions, the Control Committee shall, for the purpose of liquidating the affairs of the committee, continue as trustees of any and all the funds and property in its possession, or under its control, including claims for any funds unpaid or property not delivered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

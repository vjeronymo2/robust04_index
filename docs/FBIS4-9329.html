			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 22 April carries in its  regular 41-minute newscast three reports on fighting in the  republic.    Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "after  attempting two unsuccessful infantry and tank breakthroughs in  the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste, the enemy intensified the  shelling of the Brcko defense line in the afternoon. Civilian  objectives were also targeted. During an hours-long, relentless  shelling of the defense lines on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca  route, chetniks from the direction of Cadjavac and Tadici used  tanks, recoilless guns, all caliber mortars to fire several  hundred shells. The chetnik artillery and tank attack did not  affect the stability of our positions. The same can be said for  sniper activity directed at Djukici, Vranovaca, and Boderiste."    The studio announcer introduces a report by an unidentified  correspondent on the situation in Breza and says that "on three  occasions today, the aggressor's artillery fired at Breza." The  correspondent says that "the first time occurred at around 1240  when the aggressor used howitzers from the region of Nabozici.  Several shells were launched at the outskirts of Breza. It is  redundant to mention that the positions from which the chetnik  artillery is firing are located well inside the Sarajevo  exclusion zone, that is, within the 20 km radius. Some time  later, several shells again landed on the outskirts of Breza,  after which a deceptive calm settled in. However, at around  1605, the chetniks again used artillery to shell the residential  area of Breza with seven 122-mm howitzer shells. The general  alarm signal was again sounded on the territory of our commune  and is still in effect at the time of filing this report at  1758."    Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps Information Service  and says that "two months have gone by since the cease-fire was  agreed upon in Sarajevo, yet during all this time the chetniks  have not even tried to observe it. The chetniks began the day  by throwing hand grenades in the district of (?Aerodrom). This  was followed by machine gun barrages from Velika Kula and  Baletici directed at the defense lines [words indistinct]. This  affects primarily Lemze, which was targeted by Tromblon shells  from the Rajlovac barracks and a portable rocket launcher from  Zecja Glava and [name indistinct]. The citizens must exercise  caution because the criminals may at any moment turn to shelling  the city. This is implied by the movements of their manpower  and hardware sighted today, and the dogged work of engineering  units on the reinforcement lines."</p>

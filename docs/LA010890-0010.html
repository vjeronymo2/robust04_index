			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRINKLERS IN THE HOT SEAT  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald Manning is justifiably disappointed because the  City Council is dragging its feet on mandatory sprinklers for high-rise  apartments and condominiums. After months of talk without action -- and in the  aftermath of the recent $25-million blaze in a high-rise condominium in  Westwood -- the chief is pressing for a strong residential sprinkler ordinance  now.  </P> <P> The issue is expected to come up today before the council's Public Safety  Committee. An ordinance, proposed by Councilman Richard Alatorre would require  sprinklers in the hallways of all residential buildings taller than six  stories. The new law would also require at least one sprinkler head in every  apartment in buildings taller than 13 stories. The requirement reflects a  stronger commitment to fire safety, but it is diluted by an exemption.  </P> <P> Although Alatorre deserves credit for keeping the issue alive despite  torrential protests from condominium associations and landlords, his proposal  would allow an exemption for significant asbestos removal, a common problem in  older buildings. Removing the carcinogenic substance can raise the cost of  installing sprinklers from $4 per square foot to more than $20 per square foot.  The removal process, opponents say, also displaces residents. The expense and  inconvenience are legitimate concerns, but the protection is indispensable when  a life-threatening fire breaks out.  </P> <P> After the deadly First Interstate building fire in May, 1988, the council  approved mandatory sprinklers for all tall commercial buildings, but rejected a  similar requirement for residential high-rises. Sprinklers could have kept the  Westwood fire from spreading and reduced damages by as much as 90% at the  14-story Wilshire Terrace, according to fire officials, a reminder that the  most advanced protections against fire are as important where people live as  they are where people work.  </P></p>

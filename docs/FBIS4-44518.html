			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Dong Jialin (5516 1367 2651), director of the </F> regional planning commission: "Implementation of 1993 Economic  and Social Development Plan and Draft Plan for 1994"]    [Excerpts] 1. Economic and Social Development in  1993: Basic Situation    Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the  party's 14th National Congress, people of all nationalities in  the province worked hard to deepen reform, broaden the open  policy, and accelerate development in 1993. There were  remarkable achievements in all areas of economic and social  development.    1) Economic Development Reaches New Level; Structural  Adjustment Scores New Progress    Gross output value stood at 9.65 billion yuan for the entire  year, up 10 percent, a gain of 2.5 percentage points over last  year and higher than the goal of 9 percent set at the beginning  of the year. Specifically, the primary industry grew 5.5  percent, the secondary industry 12.9 percent, and the tertiary  industry 9.5 percent. The rural economy developed across the  board. Grain output for all 1993 reached 2.03 billion kilograms,  104.3 percent of the target and a historic high. There was a  substantial increase in acreage planted with barley, assorted  legumes, soybean, vegetables, herbal medicines, and tobacco,  which are highly sought after on the market and fetch good  prices. Township and town enterprises continued their strong  momentum, their gross output value hitting 3.05 billion yuan for  the year as a whole, up 42.8 percent from the preceding year.  Industrial output rose steadily, expanding by 3.65 billion yuan,  a gain of 12.8 percent over a year ago. (Gross industrial output  value stood at 12.08 billion yuan, up 13.9 percent.) Heavy  industry, particularly metallurgy and the building materials  industry, grew substantially. Nonstate industry expanded more  rapidly than state industry. Enterprises enjoyed higher margins  of profit. Among industrial products, the production to sales  ratio climbed from 95.4 percent to 97.6 percent, the profit to  funds ratio from 5 to 6.5 percent, and the working capital  circulation rate from 1.3 to 1.4 times. The combined  profitability index of industrial enterprises that practiced  independent accounting hit 76.6 percent, 10 percentage points  higher than 1992. Enterprises in the building industry found  themselves in an improved position and completed an additional  850 million yuan worth of projects, or up 13.3 percent over last  year. Potential was tapped in the transportation and posts and  telecommunications industries. Railroads, highways, and  airplanes carried 5.8 percent more cargo than in the preceding  year, while the volume of business in the posts and  telecommunications industry rose 53.4 percent.    2) Key Areas Report New Achievements; New Projects Completed    Fixed assets investment in all society totaled 5.16 billion  yuan, up 35.5 percent, or 12.5 percent after adjusting for  inflation. This includes the 3.37 billion yuan in local fixed  assets investment, 131.2 percent of the target in the plan for  the year, up 27.1 percent from a year ago, or 4.1 percent after  adjusting for inflation. Of the total local fixed assets  investment, capital construction investment by state units  amounted to 2.59 billion yuan, and another 900 million yuan went  to modernization and transformation. The overwhelming majority  of key projects proceeded smoothly. Among national priority  projects, all work on bridges, culverts, and tunnels relating to  railroad construction has been completed. The double-tracking of  the 62-kilometer Zhongwei-Gantang railroad was completed and the  line has now been put into service. Among the region's own  priority projects, the construction of the mine and rotary kiln  in the second phase of the expansion of Ningxia cement plant was  completed; they went into trial production last October. Work  was essentially completed on the pumping station at the  Yanhuanding project, trial operation has begun for some parts of  the project, irrigating 21,400 mu for winter last year. These  are some of the major projects completed last year: the  transformation of the Yinchuan chemical fertilizer plant, the  expansion of Ningxia coking factory, the Ningxia ferro-alloy  plant, the resin plant at Qingtong gorge, steel cable workshop  at the Shizuishan steel plant, Xiji vermicelli plant, Zhongwei  modern building materials plant, Ningxia ferric oxide plant, the  coal mine in Pingluo county, Guyuan granary, and centralized  heating in county towns like Yanci and Pingluo, centralized  supply of heat to Yanci, Pingluo, and other county towns, No 2  waterworks in the old city of Yinchuan, the expansion of the  capacity of the telephone systems in Yinchuan, Taole, Pangyang,  and Xiji, distance-programmed telephone projects in Shizuishan,  Qingtong Gorge, Zhongwei, and Pingluo, and the highway from  Rujigou mine to the opening of the ravine for the transportation  of coal.    3) New Strides Made in Reform-Deepening; New Developments in  Broadening the Policy of Opening to Outside World    Rural reform continued to deepen. The transformation of the  operating mechanism of state enterprises became more  thoroughgoing. Rapid progress was made in the reform of the  property rights system. Multiple economies continued to take  shape. The number of private enterprises and individual  industrial and commercial households rose 50.4 percent and 19.8  percent, respectively, from a year ago. The entire economy  became more market-oriented. The market for every commodity  continued to expand. New progress was made in the development of  the markets for capital goods like finance, securities, and real  estate. The implementation of Document 6 of the CPC Central  Committee and the effort to tighten macroeconomic regulation and  control have been remarkably successful; the once disorderly  financial market has changed markedly for the better.  Region-wide 427 million yuan in loans that were illegally or  improperly made were recovered. The reserve fund rate of the  various specialized banks increased from 3.4 percent in July to  over 10 percent by year end.    The open policy continued to be broadened on all fronts  across the board. Exports last year totalled $111.24 million,  approaching last year's level, including $74.71 million worth of  goods exported by the localities themselves, up 11.6 percent  from the previous year. A total of $36.66 million in foreign  capital was utilized during the year, an increase of 260 percent  from 1992, and 181 enterprises funded by the three kinds of  foreign capital were approved in all of 1993.    4) New Achievements in All Social Undertakings; Improvements  in People's Living Standards    There was a total of 257 scientific and technological  [S&amp;T]  achievements above the provincial or ministerial level in all  1993 and 168 patents were granted. In rural areas,  yield-increasing technologies including ton-grain technology,  high-yield paddy farming technology, the transformation of  low-yield land, and dry crop agriculture were introduced over  large areas. Altogether 4.6 million mu were brought under  cultivation using the new technologies. Eighteen new crop  varieties were selected and submitted for approval. On the  industrial front, a host of new technologies, new products, and  new processes were developed. The vertical cement mechanical  kiln, electromagnetic bridge crane, and ATC cam knife-shifting  equipment, among others, were put into production with fairly  good economic results. ' Institutions of higher education in the  autonomous region admitted 3,378 students in 1993, up 24 percent  from a year ago, and secondary specialized schools admitted  4,397, up 16.6 percent. At the elementary school level, 95.2  percent of school-age children were in school, up from 94.6  percent in 1992. The "231" project was further implemented.  Region-wide, the number of illiterates dropped by 48,800  people, and the two counties of Pingluo and Zhongwei inspected  and accepted the anti-illiteracy campaign organized by the  autonomous region.    A variety of social undertakings continued to make progress.    Urban and rural household incomes continued to increase. The  per capita income in urban areas was 1,907 yuan, up 304 yuan  from a year ago or 3.3 percent after adjusting for inflation.  Per capita net income among peasants was 667 yuan, up 48 yuan  from last year, but actually unchanged from a year ago after  adjusting for inflation. The market was booming, with social  commodity retail sales for the year reaching 4.3 billion yuan,  up 15.4 percent from last year. According to sample surveys, the  natural population growth rate for the year was 14.07 per  thousand, down 0.068 per thousand from a year ago. The region's  total population stood at 4,953,000 at year end, 37,000 fewer  than projected.    Even as the region's economy chalked up new achievements  last  year, there were some outstanding problems and contradictions,  primarily overly rapid price increases. The overall price index  for the year was 12.8 percent, and the household living expenses  price index jumped 14. percent, significantly higher than the  target set at the beginning of the year. Funds and rail  transportation continued to have considerable "bottleneck"  effects on the economy. Times were tough for a number of state  enterprises. The amount of losses was significant and the number  of money-losing enterprises high.    2. 1994 Economic and Social Development Plan: Major Targets  and Tasks    Nineteen ninety-four is a critical year for the completion  of  the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It is also crucial for the push to  create a socialist market economy. Grasping the opportunity,  deepening reform, expediting development, and maintaining  stability...such is the keynote for region-wide work. The design  and implementation of the 1994 regional economic and social  development plan should adhere to this keynote and contribute to  it. It must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be  thoroughly true to the spirit of the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and the 2d meeting of the 8th National  People's Congress. The plan should further liberate our  thinking, promote reform all round, expand the open policy, and  strive to adjust the structure and raise profitability. It  should take bold solid steps toward creating the basic framework  for a socialist market economy, spur the steady, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy, and fuel social  progress all round.    Based on these demands, the principal targets of the 1994  regional economic and social development plan are:    -- Gross regional output should reach 11.4 billion yuan, up  9  percent over 1993 in constant prices. The primary industry is  projected to grow 4 percent, the secondary industry 9 percent,  and the tertiary industry 13 percent.    -- Fixed assets investment in all society should be 4.77  billion yuan, up 9.4 percent in constant prices, including 1.38  billion yuan in capital construction investment by local state  units, 750 million yuan in technological transformation, and 1.1  billion yuan in collective and individual investment.    -- Local revenue should reach 602.49 million yuan, up 9.8  percent in constant prices, after the tax separation system is  introduced.    -- Exports should reach $105 million, imports $70 million.  The amount of foreign capital utilized is estimated at $35.5  million.    -- Social commodity retail sales should grow 14 percent to  reach 4.9 billion yuan.    -- Overall retail prices should rise no more than 10 percent  or so.    -- Work hard to improve profitability. The energy  conservation rate, the rate of sales of finished products, and  the circulation of working capital must all go up. The ratio of  unprofitable enterprises must be brought down 5 percentage  points, while the amount of losses should be trimmed by 10  percent.    -- The natural population growth rate should be contained  below 14.4 per thousand. Total population at year end is  projected to reach 5.02 million.    These are the major tasks of economic and social development  for 1994:    1) Make Agriculture the Top Priority Steadfastly, Spur Rural  Economic Development Across the Board    Grain output is projected to total 1.9 billion kilograms in  1994; oil-bearing crops, 70 million kilograms; beet, 600,000  tons; fruit, 130 million kilograms; meat, 83 million kilograms;  and aquatic products, 150,000 tons. The gross output value of  township and town enterprises will reach 3,664,000,000 yuan, up  20.3 percent. Peasants' net incomes will be 720 yuan per capita,  53 yuan more than the year before. We should concentrate on  doing a good job in these areas: 1) Intensify the adjustment of  the rural industrial structure. As far as grain crops are  concerned, we should grow more beer-producing barley, legumes,  corn, and buckwheat As for cash crops, we should expand the  planting of beet, hops, asparagus, chili, and man-made licorice  root. In forestry, we should tackle the development of  second-generation high standard farmland and forest belt in the  Huangguan region and the comprehensive treatment of desertified  areas. Moreover, we should continue to develop commercial  orchards and commercial forests. Turning to the animal husbandry  industry, efforts should be made to raise beef cattle, sheep  that produce mutton and wool, and pigs that produce lean pork.  2) Build up a host of agricultural commodity production bases.  Develop an agriculture that is high-yield, high-efficiency, and  good-quality. In addition to creating various agricultural  byproducts commodity bases already planned, we should build 16  high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural  demonstration zones of all types across the entire region. 3)  Step up the development of the agricultural infrastructure to  enhance agriculture's lasting power. Continue to tackle the  Huang He treatment project. Complete Phase 1 of the irrigation  expansion project funded by the World Bank. Launch Project 4071  in the three counties including Guyuan which was funded by the  World Food Program and designed to fight poverty and  environment. The Huang He Daliushu key water control project,  long-hoped-for by the people in the region, has been included in  the "National Program for Agricultural Development in the  1990's" adopted by the State Council. It has also made its way  into the list of projects, the fourth batch so far, approved by  the State Council that may be considered for receiving loans  from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. This year  we should concentrate our energies on reviewing and approving  the necessary documents, drawing up the migration plan, and  repaving the roads on site. Also we need to continue to tackle  with diligence preliminary work for the Liupanshan water  diversification project, the Xingren water pumping project, the  Shabotou key water control project, and the remaking of another  irrigated area in the Hetao region. 4) Further accelerate the  development of township and town enterprises. Push for the  adoption of the shareholding cooperative system vigorously.  Increase inputs in township and town enterprise through various  channels and at all levels. Import technology and attract  qualified personnel to come to Ningxia. Expand lateral economic  and technical cooperation both within Ningxia and between the  region and other places. Improve the overall quality of township  and town enterprises. Step up planning and guide township and  town enterprises to achieve the right degree of concentration.  Fully utilize and transform existing small towns and build new  ones. Strive for breakthroughs on all these fronts this year. 5)  Do a good job in poverty relief and development. The autonomous  region should concentrate on putting to good use funds like the  "three xi" and "work in lieu of loans." Work hard to secure  other anti-poverty development funds from the central  government. Targeting the impoverished areas, we must win the  war on poverty. Beginning this year, the regional planning  commission will work together with a number of mountainous  counties to design an anti-poverty strategic plan.    2) Keep Output in Industry and Transportation Growing at a  Steady Pace While Raising Profitability.    These are the projected outputs for the major industrial  products in 1994, taking into account market demand and  production capacity: coal, 13 million tons; electricity  generation, 9.1 billion kilowatt-hours; aluminum, 85,000 tons;  ferro-alloy, 125,000 tons; cement, 1.4 million tons; chemical  fertilizers (net amount), 330,000 tons; tires, 1.3 million sets,  bearings, 1.9 million sets; machine tools, 2,280; machine-made  paper and cardboard, 120,000 tons; sugar, 40,000 tons; and  cigarettes, 53,000 crates. The profit to investment ratio of  industrial enterprises is projected to rise to 7 percent, up  from 6.5 percent a year ago. The turnover rate of working  capital was 1.45 times, up from 1.4 times in the previous year.  Overall labor productivity and the profit to costs ratio are  also projected to continue to go up.    Stopping enterprises from losing money and increasing their  profits must be tackled as a major task this year. Intensify the  responsibility system to stem losses and increase profits.  Turning-losses-into-profits targets should be handed down from  level to level all the way to the grass roots and enterprises.  There should be evaluation at fixed intervals. Rewards and  penalties should be meted out at year end. Ningxia should  concentrate on stemming the losses of enterprises run by the  region whose losses exceed 2 million yuan each and making major  enterprises whose profits top 5 million yuan each even more  profitable. At the same time, give priority to energy  conservation work in high-energy-consumption enterprises.    Further overhaul our thinking and liberalize our policies.  Be  supportive of nonstate enterprises when it comes to credit and  transportation, etc.    To spur the adjustment of the industrial structure and boost  the staying power of development, we must continue to tackle  industrial capital construction projects and technological  transformation projects now under way aggressively so that they  pay economic dividends as soon as possible. In the energy  industry, the focus is on building the Lingwu mine and  completing the No 1 well at Yangchang Wan. No time should be  wasted in completing track-laying on the Dagu feeder railway.  Begin construction on the power plant in the second phase of  Daba power plant project. Continue construction on the Hexi  headwork power station at Qingtong Gorge. Build the  Sanying-Haiyuan and Yinchuan-Helan 110 kilovolt power  transformation and transmission works. In raw materials  industry, complete the expansion of the second phase of Ningxia  cement works, the transformation of Qingtong Gorge cement plant,  the heavy oil catalytic cracking transformation of Ningxia oil  refinery, and the energy consumption project at the Shizuishan  steel works. Tackle preliminary work on these projects: phase  three of Qingtong Gorge aluminum plant, the natural gas  pipeline, the transformation of Ningxia chemical industrial  plant, and the transmission of electricity from Ningxia to other  provinces. Turning to the processing industry, complete a host  of technological transformation projects, including those at  Xibei bearing plant, the Yinchuan electric wire plant, the  Yinchuan dacron plant, and the Dahe machine tool plant. Complete  the expansion of Zhongwei paper-making plant and 5233 plant.  Begin construction on the deadweight meridian tire project at  the Yinchuan rubber plant, the 500,000-set spherical roller  bearing project at the Xibei bearing plant, the Ningxia  fermentation plant, the Shizuishan sanitary porcelain works, the  Yinchuan metallic magnesium plant, and the Ningxia  pharmaceutical plant.    Turning to transportation and posts and telecommunications,  continue to coordinate with the central government's plan to  accelerate the transformation of Baozhong Railway and Baolan  Railway and the construction of Jinghu Yinlan, Xilanwu Class 1  guanglan main lines. Complete the construction of the Yingu  Highway and Yinchuan Huang He Bridge. Start construction on  Yinchuan Hedong Airport. Begin the expansion of the handling  capacity of the municipal telephone system of Yinchuan to 30,000  lines. Begin phases two and three of the mobile communications  project. Proceed with the program-controlled telephone projects  in such cities and counties as Yongning and Helan.    3) Maintain Investment on a Sensible Scale; Further  Accelerate Key Projects    Social fixed assets investment for the entire region is  projected to reach 4.77 billion yuan (excluding Baozhong Railway  and Changqing oil-field), up 9.4 percent from the preceding  year. Specifically, investment by state units will total 3.67  billion yuan, up 10 percent, and investment by collectives and  individuals, 1.1 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent. Of all investment  by state units, 2.27 billion yuan (1.38 billion yuan from local  governments and 890 million yuan from the central government)  will go to capital construction; 1 billion yuan (750 million  yuan from local governments and 250 million yuan from the  center) will go to technological transformation, 285 million  yuan will go to real estate development, and 150 million yuan  will be invested in other projects.    Of all capital construction investment by local state units,  local governments have tentatively allocated 60 million yuan in  their budgets, lending by the various banks in the region will  amount to 250 million yuan, the head office of the Construction  Bank will make available 136 million yuan in special loans, and  various central ministries and commissions will chip in with 87  million yuan. In addition, 180 million yuan will come from  special funds like those of electricity, transportation, and  posts and telecommunications; 5.4 million yuan from the energy  and transportation fund; 29 million yuan from the special  agricultural fund under the region's finance department; 14  million yuan from the "three xi" fund; 175 million yuan in funds  raised by the sectors, municipalities, and counties themselves;  104 million yuan in foreign capital, 108 million yuan in funds  raised through the issue of bonds, etc., and 40 million yuan in  other funds.    Continue to make a success of the technological  transformation of existing enterprises, particularly large and  mid-sized state enterprises. Continue to implement the  "doubling" plan in key enterprises. In technological  transformation projects, limit the share of investment in local  products and import more technology. Modernize equipment and  develop new products.    Eleven projects have been designated as key national and  autonomous regional construction projects for 1994. Among key  national construction projects are the Lingwu mine and Baozhong  Railway. Among key regional construction projects are the  following: Yinchuan Hedong airport, Yanhuanding water-pumping  project, phase two of Daba power plant, Yinchuan dairy products  factory, Yingu Highway (including Yinchuan Huang He Bridge),  Ningxia tourist hotel, the expansion of the handling capacity of  the Yinchuan municipal telephone system, the transformation of  Yinchuan rubber plant, and the expansion of Xibei bearing plant.  Eight projects have been designated as key preliminary work in  the region: Daliushu key water conservancy project, Liupanshan  river diversion project, Xingren water-pumping, phase three  expansion of Qingtong gorge aluminum plant, expansion of Ningxia  chemical industrial plant, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas  pipeline, Guyuan cement plant, and the Aerda imitation silk  project, a Sino-Indonesian joint venture.    4) Grasp Opportunity To Further Open Up to Outside World    Fully capitalize on the existing favorable opportunity to  increase exports and foreign exchange earnings. Even as Ningxia  continues to do well with traditional staple exports, it must  strive to develop new flagship exports. The export sector should  be given preferential treatment when it comes to obtaining bank  credits and securing rail transportation. Promptly give  qualified enterprises the authority to handle foreign trade on  their own. Make use of the region's coastal areas as window to  the outside world. Go all out to open up and develop an  international market. After a unitary system is introduced in  foreign exchange, the autonomous region will no longer control  or issue to lower levels a foreign exchange distribution plan.  The state imposes quota management on 26 commodities and applies  an automatic registration system to some commodities which are  sensitive on the domestic market. As for other commodities, it  will be up to the enterprises themselves to organize their  importation.    Continue to utilize foreign loans extensively and  effectively, using most of them to finance the transformation of  large- and medium-sized state enterprises and the autonomous  region's key construction projects. Our plan calls for the  utilization of $18.48 million in foreign loans in all 1994,  including $8.48 million in foreign loans taken out by the state  and $10 million international commercial loans. Tighten foreign  debt management. Adhere to the rule that the borrower must also  be the repayer and put an end to the present situation in which  borrowing is often dissociated from repaying. Further improve  the investment climate. Continue to attract direct foreign  investment in a variety of ways. Direct foreign investment is  estimated at $17 million for 1994. In accordance with the  industrial policies of the state and the region, we should steer  even more foreign capital to foreign-exchange-earning  industries, infrastructural projects, basic industries, other  projects using advanced technology, and the technological  transformation of existing enterprises. Actively spur the  development of the "three kinds of enterprises either wholly or  partially funded by foreign capital," making them more upscale  and enabling them to operate at a higher level and on a larger  scale. Increase the percentage of foreign capital that actually  materializes.    5) Steer Economic Construction Onto the Path of Relying on  S&amp;T Progress In Earnest; Further Develop Education    The autonomous region is set to tackle 37 key S&amp;T  projects  and 17 S&amp;T dissemination projects in 1994. In agricultural  S&amp;T,  the main focus should shift from exclusively pursuing quantity  to pursuing both an increase in quantity and an improvement in  product quality and to increasing the value of commodities.  Accelerate the introduction of better varieties of cash crops  and step up research on their farming technology. Intensify  research into the processing technology of famous, high-quality,  and unique agricultural byproducts. Put together a host of  S&amp;T  demonstration projects. In the short haul, we should concentrate  on research in mulberry cultivation and silkworm raising,  man-made licorice, and tobacco cultivation. Actively promote  technological advances in industrial enterprises. Strongly  encourage them to set up research and development offices.  Import and absorb applicable technology extensively. Accelerate  the transformation of traditional industries using new  technology. Continue to develop new integrated electronic  products and research new materials technology. It is proposed  that enterprises join forces with institutions of higher  education and scientific research units to set up a variety of  organizations of technology development.    Institutions of higher education and secondary specialized  schools will admit 2,500 and 4,400 students, respectively,  throughout the autonomous region in 1994. Increase the  proportion of self-financed students as appropriate in  accordance with a plan. Continue to diversify and increase the  channels of educational funding. Compulsory education should  primarily be funded by local governments. Encourage society to  raise and pool funds for education in a variety of ways.  Encourage private education. Make a success of "Project Hope,"  which aims to solicit educational donations for the mountainous  areas in the south. Make vocational education and adult  education more attuned to the demands of the market. Capitalize  on the enthusiasm of all quarters in society for education.  Continue with "Project 231."    6) Continue To Improve People's Lives and Develop  Miscellaneous Social Undertakings    With the economy developing and social productivity rising,  we should continue to improve the people's living standard. By  developing the rural economy across the board and raising the  prices of grain and beet by an appropriate margin, we must work  hard to boost peasants' incomes substantially. As output expands  and profitability rises, state enterprises should raise their  workers' wages correspondingly. Take pains to implement wage  reform in units and institutions carefully and meticulously. Be  solicitous about the livelihood of retired personnel, workers in  troubled enterprises, and peasants in impoverished areas.  Vigorously push ahead with the commercialization of urban  housing and expedite housing construction. Accelerate the reform  of the social security system. Continue to improve facilities  that play an intimate part in the daily lives of the people:  urban water supply system, roads, liquefied gas supply, etc.  Actively develop cultural undertakings, publishing, radio and  television broadcasting, public health, and sports. Increase  investment in a variety of ways and through diversified channels  to improve the infrastructure of social development. Continue to  tackle family planning work successfully, focusing on rural  areas and the floating population and going all out to keep the  natural population increase rate below the target in the plan.</p>

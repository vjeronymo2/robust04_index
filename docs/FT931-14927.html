			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Keep competing THE ARRIVAL of Mr Karel van Miert as EC competition commissioner seems already to have raised hopes and fears in roughly equal measure. To those who regarded Sir Leon Brittan as an unreconstructed Thatcherite, Mr Van Miert's credentials may seem agreeably middle-of-the-road. For those who adhere to the idea that interventionism is the primrose path to economic inefficiency, their champion seems to be defecting to the enemy. Mr Van Miert's actual views, as reported on the opposite page, scarcely bear out either view. Indeed, he has limited scope for change, since most of his new job consists of applying existing rules. But in merger policy especially, hard cases will inevitably come his way; and it is here that there is room for unease. In anti-trust issues, Mr Van Miert says, competition should not be the only criterion: industrial, social and other factors also apply. Indeed they do, but they are not the business of the competition commissioner. There are powerful lobbies against competition, at the corporate and national level. The beneficiaries of competition are the general public, who do not have a corresponding voice. Although industrial and competition policy ought to be two sides of the same coin, in practice they are often at variance. If the result is to be a productive compromise, it is above all necessary that the competition commissioner should fight his corner. This is not to say that the job is a purely negative or static one. In particular, the single market will bring pressure for merger in some industries, as a direct result of the increase in competition and the enlargement of the market itself. If the result is improved economic efficiency, there would need to be powerful arguments for blocking it on competition grounds. One of the important aims of the single market, after all, is to produce companies which are capable of competing on a world stage. That is an industrial policy objective. But competition policy need not be at odds, provided trade policy allows relatively free competitive entry for imports into the EC; and that is now a matter for Sir Leon. There is also room for initiative on the vexed question of national monopoly in utilities such as telecommunications. This is a politically sensitive area. But introducing genuine pan-European competition into these markets is not only desirable in itself. It is also an essential step in establishing a single market in utilities, which is much to be desired in terms of economic efficiency. There is another reform to which Mr Van Miert could usefully address himself. An obvious flaw of the EC system of regulation is its lack of transparency at any level. Neither the competition directorate nor the Commission are obliged to explain and defend their decisions, as the competition authorities do in the UK. The idea is occasionally mooted of a separate EC cartel office on the German model. That may be a step too far. But anything Mr Van Miert can do to explain what he is up to would save industry a good deal of second-guessing. Indeed, transparency and accountability are the best guarantee of a fair competition policy, and therefore the strongest underpinning of Mr Van Miert's moral authority.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television A populist night on the box tonight. Rowan Atkinson's character Mr Bean, a cross between Chaplin and Mr Magoo, has proved tremendously successful and there will be a vast audience for his latest misadventure, Mr Bean in Room 426, on ITV at 8pm tonight. That is followed by The Brit Awards, the record industry's annual prize giving. Much has been made of the fact that many of the nominees, especially Elton, Eric and Phil, are pushing 50, and hardly represent the future, while others, like Kate Bush, have not made a new record in years. However, the ceremony serves to draw attention to British pop music, which is currently going through a bad patch and needs all the publicity it can get. A much more competitive musical event goes out at 7.20pm on BBC 2, the final of The Choir of the Year competition. The keen rivalry of the participants is only matched by the sporting behaviour of the six choirs singing it out for the two titles. Perhaps the fact that there is no money involved ensures the wonderful atmosphere.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: The Poisoned Chalice - Music Theatre The one virtue of The Poisoned Chalice, an opera scripted and composed by Tony Britten, being premiered by Music Theatre London at the Drill Hall, is brevity. Its two acts are not much more than half an hour apiece. The interval is on you just as you feel the need to run out screaming into Chenies Street; and those who steel themselves to go back in will be pleased to find that this is unusual among bad operas in lacking the defect of long-windedness. Indeed, its concision is like a slap in the face. The four characters in brilliant white process at the start on to Simon Higlett's tilted silver disc, deliver some solemn choral thoughts, and embark on what will be very many individual circlings of the platform, singing as they walk, taking care to avoid the little tree, and all involved in a drama that has evidently been going on for some time before we arrived. Gradually we settle into the idea that this is a story and not just a bawling contest, and recognise old friends in Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Morgan Le Fay. For it is the 'Matter of Britain' that Tony Britten says has always, since childhood, drawn him on and driven him to pen the doggerel libretto and doggerel-like score of this Chalice. His feeling for prosody is remarkable - extra syllables just crammed in where necessary and the music stretched to fit. What he says is even worse than how he says it: utterances of pure unmisgiving bathos which contaminate you with the deadly, confident clasp of bad art. Britten - an artistic director of Music Theatre London, along with the evening's stage-director Nicholas Broadhurst - has composed much for television and films, but the Chalice's music has scarcely the inventiveness of a soap-powder jingle. It was performed by a quartet consisting of conductor/keyboardist Jonathan Rutherford with flute, cello and percussion players at least two of whom were not the musicians named in the programme. Perhaps they had bolted in horror at an insipid tonal idiom - tonal, that is, with a few obligatory raucous gesturings - which seemed to my unlucky companion like the Hecklers' answer to the Birtwistle opera Gawain they so deplored. It must have been a hard job finding the singers, too. Swedish soprano Sara Jungberg's Morgan at least had some sort of voice. Mary Lincoln's Guinevere tried hard to make us believe she had one. Both parts, alas, required considerable vocal prowess. Billy Hartman's Lancelot was too stiff, Andrew C. Wadsworth's Arthur not stiff enough. He just slouched there in his burlap with the cool self-possession of someone about to order a drink. At the opera's end each character is resolved into an allegorical single word - 'Stability' (Arthur), 'Honour' (Lancelot), 'Power' (Morgan), 'Love' (Guinevere) - which they keep repeating. 'Love' has the last word. But I should add 'Vanity'. This is a show that should never have reached the boards.</p>

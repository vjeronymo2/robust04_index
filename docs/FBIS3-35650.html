New Date for it  Not Defined Yet"]    [Text] The meeting scheduled for 25 January in Moscow  between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan and mediated by  the Russian president did not take place. According to V.  Kazimirov, special representative of the Russian Federation  president and head of the Russian peacemaking mission for the  settlement of the Karabakh conflict, new dates for the meeting  have not been defined yet. The Russian diplomat thinks that  "meetings at such a level should be prepared in the most  thorough way" and "unless preparations that would ensure a  certain success of the summit are complete, it is premature to  speak about concrete dates."    Until then, the mediators continue their efforts, the sides  voice new proposals on resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan  conflict. Rakhman Mustafazade, an official in the Azerbaijan  president's staff, has named the main principles of Baku's  approach to this problem. First, the withdrawal of Armenian  troops from the occupied territories and the creation of  guarantees for the safe living of the Armenian and Azeri  population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Second, the repealing by  Yerevan of all illegal constitutional acts and documents that  describe Nagorno-Karabakh as belonging to Armenia. Third, the  preservation of the cultural appearance of the occupied  territories of Azerbaijan, i.e., the renouncing by Yerevan of  the policy of destruction of monuments of history and culture of  the Azerbaijan people in Karabakh. In Mustafazade's view, the  Yerevan officials' dragging out of the peace process within the  CSCE framework promotes the actual legalization of Armenia's  territorial claims.    To all appearances, Azerbaijan will hardly talk at all,  having bet on a military solution to the question. The Azeri  Army is strong enough today. Besides, Baku feels a weakening of  the Armenian Army that began after a series of major defeats.    Armenian generals, too, admit this weakening. On the radio  24 January, Major General Arkadiy Ter-Tadevosyan, a directorate  chief of Armenia's Defense Ministry, stated that "Today the  country is in no position to deliver an appreciable retaliatory  strike at Azerbaijan, which has been in recent days increasingly  encroaching on Armenia's borders."</p>

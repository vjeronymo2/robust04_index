The earlier-set  discussion date was Friday, February 4.    The amnesty declaration was prompted by the adoption of  Russia's Constitution on December 12, 1993. According to the  basic law, the right to declare amnesty rests with the Duma, the  Lower House of the Federal Assembly, parliament in Russia.    Drafted by the Russian President's State Management  Department, the decree provides for pardoning certain categories  of prisoners, World War Two veterans and women included.    No faction has unequivocally supported the decree. Yegor  Gaydar, the leader of "Russia's Choice," has suggested in an  interview with Interfax that amnesty should be carried out in  line with specific penal code clauses rather than categories of  prisoners.    At a news-conference a week ago, the LDP faction's leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy reiterated his faction's call for freeing  all political convicts and those jailed for economic  mismanagement as of March 1985. "What Russia's president wants  to do at this time is to pardon criminals," he stressed.    The faction of communists and agrarians intend to press for  the release of all those charged for complicity in the events of  August 1991 and October 1993.</p>

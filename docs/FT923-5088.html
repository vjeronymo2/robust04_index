			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Hidden tax on power likely to survive: The Treasury will be reluctant to transfer the cost of the nuclear levy to the PSBR THE DEBATE about UK electricity prices homed in on a new target this week: the fossil fuel levy. The suggestion yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator, that the levy could be phased out more quickly than originally planned will be strong ammunition for industrialists who have been complaining that electricity prices are too high. His remarks followed suggestions by the two big power generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, that the levy should be reduced. Any decision about the future of the levy will have to be made by the government, which is maintaining a cautious silence. The levy is in effect a tax on electricity generated by oil, gas and coal, and its proceeds go to subsidise power projects using non-fossil fuels such as nuclear power, wind and tides. This year the levy will amount to Pounds 1.2bn - equivalent to 11 per cent on the electricity bills of every household and company in England and Wales. It is supposed to shrink by stages to Pounds 800m in 1997. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which owns and operates the 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales, receives more than 95 per cent of the levy, and uses it to create provisions to cover the future cost of decommissioning and rendering these power stations safe when they end their useful lives. This financial support is vital to Nuclear Electric's existence. In the financial year to March 1992, the company made a loss of Pounds 783m, which the levy transformed into a profit of Pounds 482m. The company's ability to get its nose above water has prompted the levy's critics - headed by large groups such as ICI - to argue that the levy should be reduced. Prof Littlechild also believes that a faster phasing out of the levy would increase pressure on Nuclear Electric to cut its costs and make itself fully commercial. Nuclear Electric does not deny that the levy makes all the difference. But Dr Bob Hawley, its new and combative chief executive, stressed yesterday that he had already set the company the goal of achieving a profit without levy by 1995. So Prof Littlechild's remarks were superfluous, he said, even assuming he had the right to tell the company how to run its affairs. The main question is whether Nuclear Electric should continue to receive the levy once it was making a profit on its own. Dr Hawley says the company needs the levy to make provisions for the reactors it inherited when it was formed in 1990. The profits, when they come, will be needed to make provisions for reactors still to be completed, such as Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast. If the levy is abolished the provisions will still have to come from somewhere, most probably from public borrowing. The Treasury may prefer to keep the levy - in effect a hidden tax of which few people are aware - rather than have Nuclear Electric's costs heaped on to the public sector borrowing requirement. This suggests that the government may resist calls to get rid of the levy, particularly given its opposition in principle to subsidies. Any decision would also have to take account of other coming events, notably the planned privatisation of British Coal this year, and a full review of the nuclear power industry in 1994. Removal of the levy could be good news for coal because it would lower electricity prices and boost demand. But it might also put paid to the nuclear industry's chances of surviving the review. Even so, electricity industry sources were saying yesterday that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - who now handles energy policy - may be more sympathetic than his predecessors. Prof Littlechild, it was suggested, may even have made his remarks at Whitehall's behest to provide Mr Heseltine with a cue - though as an independent figure, Prof Littlechild is free to say whatever he chooses.</p>

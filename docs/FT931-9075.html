			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Biotechnology sector welcomes SE rule changes THE UK biotechnology industry has welcomed proposed changes in Stock Exchange rules which would make it easier for young pharmaceutical companies to obtain a full listing. The BioIndustry Association, a trade body with 180 members ranging from small biotech start-ups to large companies, said the proposed relaxation in rules 'may encourage Britain's biotechnology industry to raise funds here rather than having to go to the US.' The period of consultation on the new rules for 'companies without an adequate record' ended yesterday and the Stock Exchange is expected to introduce them later this year. They would allow a pharmaceutical company that had been in existence for three years to seek a listing even if it had no products on sale, so long as it had at least two new drugs in clinical trials. However, Mr Louis Da Gama, executive director of the BioIndustry Association, said non-pharmaceutical biotechnology companies - such as those aiming at agricultural markets - were not happy with the proposed changes, which would continue to exclude them from a listing. 'Already some of our members have gone to the US to meet their current needs and more may follow their lead,' he said. So far only one UK biotech company - Oxford-based British Biotechnology - has obtained a full London listing. Others have taken advantage of the less restrictive Nasdaq listing rules in the US.</p>

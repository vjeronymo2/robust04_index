			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Kline Apologizes to Stutterers: Kevin Kline apologized to the National  Stuttering Project this week for offending stutterers with his Oscar-winning  role in "A Fish Called Wanda" about a year after he was asked to make a  statement.  </P> <P> "I apologize for the pain I might have inadvertently caused persons who  stutter. The character I portrayed in 'A Fish Called Wanda' should not be  considered a role model for any civilized person when talking to a stutterer,"  Kline wrote in a letter to the group. Kline has resisted an apology because he  said the organization missed the humor in his role. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

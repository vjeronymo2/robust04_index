			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Key meetings may determine S Africa power-sharing deal TWO key meetings this week could determine the fate of the recent power-sharing deal between the South African government and the African National Congress. The ANC's policy-making national executive committee is meeting to decide whether to ratify the deal, and government is due to open talks with the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party today to try to sell power-sharing to the country's third largest political group. Both meetings could delay installation of a multiracial interim government, or prevent it altogether. ANC negotiators were confident that they could persuade the organisation's national executive to formalise an outline agreement reached with the ruling National party last week, calling for power-sharing until the end of the century. The national executive, which began its meeting yesterday, is due to take its decision by tomorrow night. The executive is also expected to consider calling for the lifting of sanctions against South Africa. Several of the ANC's regional leaders, including the firebrand Natal leader, Mr Harry Gwala, are known to oppose power-sharing, and many other executive committee members are believed to feel that a five year 'sunset clause' before majority rule is too long. Last year the national executive broadly endorsed the principle of power-sharing - though not for the long period now envisaged - but only after a bitter fight between ANC radicals and moderates. Later today the same power-sharing deal will be debated at a meeting between government and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who has already sharply condemned the agreement. Government negotiators will try to persuade Inkatha that the power-sharing deal would meet its demand for devolution of power to regions. Economic reforms, Page 16</p>

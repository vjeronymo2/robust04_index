			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Study shows effects of inward investment THE KNOCK-ON effects of foreign direct investment to the UK are numerous, widespread and not always transparent, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry. The study, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte in collaboration with Benchmark Research, was prompted by the growing significance of inward investment to the economy. It says inward investment might account for as much as 25 per cent of all new capital formation in 1991-92, against 15 per cent in 1989. There have been numerous studies into the direct impact of inward investment, but the latest report aims to analyse less tangible effects on local economies and communities within the English regions. The study says the primary beneficiaries of inward investment are groups that have established a direct relationship with the inward investor - employees, local component suppliers, local service companies and local customers. The less tangible effects, such as involvement with local charities or links with educational establishments, indicate the degree of integration into the local economy. While only a sixth of the companies examined were actively collaborating or planning to collaborate in research and development with another company, almost half were working on R&amp;D with one or more academic institution, nearly all of which were local. Japanese companies led the field in collaborating with academic institutions, and the high incidence of collaboration by mechanical engineering companies had brough significant local benefits through technology transfer. In general inward investment is considered to be 'a good thing', not only by the investors but by most other companies and organisations within each region.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUND BARRIER TO BLOCK LAX NOISE TO BE  STUDIED  </P> <P> El Segundo will study the feasibility of installing a sound barrier along  Imperial Highway to reduce the noise from Los Angeles International Airport,  which has plagued the city for 30 years.  </P> <P> The Board of Airport Commissioners last week allocated $50,000, but no date for  the start of the study has been set, said Don Harrison, assistant to the city  manager.  </P> <P> The terrain along Imperial is hilly, and Harrison said the city believes that  an earthen berm or a wall could effectively shield homes in lower-lying  neighborhoods from the engine noise of aircraft on the ground.  </P> <P> Robert Beard, LAX airport noise abatement officer, said a 20-foot-high berm and  wall combination built several years ago north of the airport has cut noise  from planes operating on the ground by up to 50% for the first two rows of  homes near the wall.  </P></p>

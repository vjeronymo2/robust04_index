In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we allocated three megahertz of spectrum at 900 MHz for the narrowband PCS service and adopted rules to govern narrowband PCS operation. As part of this action, we allotted eight 12.5 kHz wide response channels exclusively for use by existing common carrier and private paging licensees. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we designated four of the eight response channels for licensing at the Major Trading Area (MTA) level and four for licensing at the BTA level. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  We also defined an existing paging licensee as a paging licensee authorized under Part 22 or Part 90, as of June 24, 1993, the adoption date of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First Report and Order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additionally, we stated that to be eligible for a response channel license, an existing paging licensee must operate at least one base station in the MTA or BTA for which it requests a license. Finally, we limited each licensee to two paging response channels per geographic area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Rand McNally,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1992 Commercial Atlas &amp; Marketing Guide, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at pages 38&hyph;39. Rand McNally organizes the 50 States and the District of Columbia into 47 MTAs and 487 BTAs. For PCS licensing purposes, we adopted service areas based on the Rand McNally MTA and BTA definitions with certain exceptions. In particular, we separated Alaska from the Seattle MTA and added five insular areas: Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. In our rules, the insular areas are treated as five BTA service areas and three MTA service areas,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 24.102 of the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. On April 25, 1994, NABER submitted a Petition for Reconsideration of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requesting reconsideration and clarification of certain aspects of the eligibility and multiple ownership rules that apply to the response channels. Comments were filed by Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet); <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  no reply comments were filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PageNet's comments were filed 33 days late. In a petition for acceptance of late-filed comments, PageNet states that it did not focus on NABER's petition until it was reviewing the proposed auction rules for the response channels. In the interest of considering a full record in this matter, we are accepting PageNet's comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility for Response Channel Licenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. As indicated above, we limited eligibility for acquiring narrowband PCS response channels to existing paging licensees and defined an existing paging licensee to be a paging licensee authorized under Part 22 or Part 90 of our rules as of June 24, 1993. We also required that the existing paging licensee operate at least one base station in any MTA or BTA for which it requests a response channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In its petition, NABER requests that the eligibility requirement to operate a base station in the service or trading area for which a response channel is sought be changed to a requirement that the applicant merely provide coverage within the trading area. NABER argues that basing eligibility on the location of a transmitter instead of coverage area could prevent operators from obtaining response channels. It states that the coverage provided by a single base station may include more than one BTA and that thus, under the adopted rules, the operator would not be eligible for response channels in all of the BTAs in which it provides conventional one-way paging services. NABER recommends that we allow paging licensees to apply for response channels in trading areas that are within 25 miles of the geographic coordinates of any base station licensed as of May 10, 1994, the release date of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This recommendation was submitted by NABER in an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  presentation to the Commission's staff on June 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. NABER also requests that we clarify whether the June 24, 1993, date for determining whether an entity is an existing paging licensee is applicable in determining the area of operation for license eligibility purposes. It notes that an existing carrier, initially licensed as of June 24, 1993, may have expanded or constructed its system into adjacent areas after June 24, 1993. NABER contends that such a carrier should be able to include its current coverage area for purposes of obtaining response channels so as to make its entire system compatible and competitive even though parts of it were constructed or put into operation after June 24, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. PageNet, in its comments, generally supports the rule modifications suggested by NABER. In addition, PageNet requests that the rule limiting applicants to only Part 22 and Part 90 licensees as of June 24, 1993, be eliminated or modified. It argues that this restriction is not needed to prevent speculative or frivolous applications under an auction regime and that the ability to improve service should not be arbitrarily restricted to those that were licensees on a certain date. PageNet requests that the rules be modified to permit applications for response channels by any licensee operating a system serving at least some portion of the market on the date the application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Our decision to license the response channels on an MTA and BTA basis and to require operation of a base station transmitter in the service area was intended to facilitate our licensing process and provide a simple method for determining mutually exclusive applications. Existing paging stations are currently licensed on a mileage separation basis rather than an MTA and BTA basis. We concur with the parties that there are advantages to basing eligibility on the coverage area of existing base stations. As noted by NABER, a single base station may often cover more than one BTA. We therefore find that a coverage area standard for response channel eligibility would better conform with the service needs of existing paging operations. Accordingly, we are amending our rules to permit licensees to obtain response channels sufficient to upgrade existing paging systems over their entire coverage area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Goode intentions Of all the Goode committee's weighty proposals, the minimum solvency standard for pension funds could be the most momentous. As in banking or insurance, a solvency requirement was always a prerequisite for a worthwhile system of prudential regulation. The question is whether its introduction will make the pension industry as risk averse as banks became when capital adequacy ratios were imposed. Since UK funds control Pounds 400bn in assets, even a subtle shift in investment will have far-reaching implications for financial markets. The solvency standard proposed yesterday does not look excessively harsh. But pension fund solvency is a slippery concept which turns on actuarial assumptions on investment return and mortality rates. The committee is right to recommend that actuaries should be appointed by trustees rather than companies. That should help prevent them inclining towards generous valuations to please their paymasters. But Goode has stopped short of prescribing standard assumptions which actuaries should use; this hot potato is instead passed back to the profession. How they respond will determine whether pension funds feel obliged to shift assets out of equities and into gilts. The assumptions would not have to be particularly tough to leave many pension funds in danger of falling close to the new solvency limit if equities suffer a bad spell. Heavier investment in gilts would surely result. Prudential regulation carries risks of its own in terms of lower investment returns, and ultimately poorer pensions.</p>

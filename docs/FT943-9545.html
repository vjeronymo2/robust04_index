			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold consumption weakens Demand for gold bullion is being depressed by a big drop in consumption in two important areas - Saudi Arabia and Turkey - according to the World Gold Council, a promotional organisation financed by some producers. At 18 tonnes, demand in the second quarter in Turkey was 50 per cent below the same months of 1993. The council suggests in its latest Gold Demand Trends publication that Turkey's austerity package, launched in April to combat its economic and financial crisis, encouraged huge sales of jewellery and exports of scrap gold bars. In the quarter scrap gold exports of 5.9 tonnes far outweighed gold imports of only 0.1 tonnes. Saudi Arabian gold demand, meanwhile, dropped by 53 per cent because, the council says, consumers were worried about economic conditions and this caused a reduction in trade stocks. Demand was also hit by a lacklustre Hajj season, a 20 per cent cut in government spending, and by the impact of the civil war in Yemen. All this contributed to a 4.3 per cent fall in gold demand - from 562.8 tonnes to 538.5 tonnes - in the second quarter in those countries monitored by the council. These account for about 75 per cent of total world demand. A council official claimed that in the largest of the price-sensitive markets in the developing world, such as India and China, buyers seem to have adjusted to higher gold prices.</p>

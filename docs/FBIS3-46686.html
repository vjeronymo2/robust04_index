			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ise, Mie Pref., Jan. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa pledged Tuesday [4 January] to enact political  reform bills by the end of the current Diet session ending  January 29, denying dissolution of the House of Representatives.  "I do not have a thought at all of (Diet) dissolution or of  resignation of the cabinet en masse," Hosokawa said at a news  conference after a visit to Ise Shrine, an annual ritual for an  incumbent premier.    Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa may dissolve the Diet  or  resign with other cabinet members if the political reform  package fails to pass the House of Councillors during the  session. Hosokawa has staked his political future on getting  the political reform package into law, at first by the end of  last year, and now by the end of the session which has been  extended by 45 days.    The four government-proposed bills, which passed the lower  house on November 18, are now pending in the upper house.    The prime minister also told reporters that he is willing to  have further negotiations about the bills with Yohei Kono,  president of the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), if they will bear fruit, he said.    Hosokawa met Kono before the package passed the lower house,  seeking concessions about the package, but they failed to reach  an agreement.    Hosokawa also said the government will not give up the plan  to complete the construction of a dam on the Nagara River in  spite of objections from environmentalists. He said he hopes  the dam will be completed during the next fiscal year beginning  in April.    He said the nearly-completed dam will be built "cautiously,"  based on the outcome of a new environmental assessment promised  in December by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi. The dam  project had caused an international uproar when an appeal made  by Japanese environmentalists demanding a halt drew attention  from foreign ecology groups.    Hosokawa said an advisory panel will be set up to discuss  the overhauling of the nation's defense program, adopted in  1976. Based on its advice, the government will decide on  measures by the summer, before the ministries submit their  preliminary requests for fiscal 1995 budget draft.    The measures to be taken will affect the budget, he said.    Defense Agency officials have envisioned a smaller Ground  Self-Defense Force with enhanced mobility and information  gathering capabilities in line with the post-Cold War situation.    Hosokawa said the government will submit a product liability  bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning January  31. He also pledged efforts for the early enactment of a Public  Information Act.</p>

With  the move, Korean residents of China or Chinese residents of  Korea, exchange students, businessmen and travelers will be able  to send and receive money more easily as bilateral cooperation  in the postal, communications and financial areas deepens. The  communications ministers of both countries earlier agreed to  adopt the system at two meetings last year.    Seoul and Beijing decided to launch the system ahead of  President Kim Yong-sam's official visit to China in late March.  International postal money orders are issued by agreement of  the Universal Postal Union (UPU). China will become the 23rd  country to cooperate on the system with South Korea.    At present, 380 post offices nationwide issue international  postal money orders and payment can be made at 2,700 post  offices.</p>

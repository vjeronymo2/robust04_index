			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Zabriskie's point of departure The question of who is going to emerge at the head of Merck when the charismatic Roy Vagelos leaves the world's largest drugs group a year from now gets ever more intriguing, writes Richard Waters. Two potential front-runners have now left to run other US drug companies: president Richard Markham to Marion Merrell Dow and, last week, head of manufacturing John Zabriskie to Upjohn. The shake-up following Zabriskie's departure provides few clues. True, head of research Edward Scolnick has also been given ultimate responsibility for manufacturing, apparently putting him in the strongest position. But two others have also seen their roles enhanced in an apparent attempt to keep the field wide open. Judy Lewent, the widely-respected chief financial officer, has also been given responsibility for public affairs, while head of strategic planning Francis Spiegel will oversee Merck's Kelco division. All part of a plan to give managers a more diversified background, says Vagelos. And then there is Martin Wygod, head of Merck subsidiary Medco, whose marketing skills and proven ability to anticipate big changes in the drugs market have drawn praise from Vagelos. Asked recently what skills his successor would need, Vagelos replied: 'Vision'. On that test, Wygod wins hands down.</p>

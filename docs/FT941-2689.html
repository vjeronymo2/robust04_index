			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Up to eight BZW directors break Pounds 1m earnings barrier Up to eight directors of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, received remuneration of at least Pounds 1m last year, it emerged yesterday. The highest paid was Mr David Band, chief executive, who received about Pounds 1.4m, including pension contribution, salary and substantial bonuses. Bonus payments to directors and staff were partly routed through techniques designed to reduce and delay tax charges, which triggered discussions last year between the company and inspectors from the Inland Revenue. About Pounds 500,000 of Mr Band's own payments are believed to have been deferred over the next three to five years. The revelations come in the wake of substantial bonuses paid to a number of City executives including the partners of Goldman Sachs, the private US investment bank, which is believed to have generated pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.84bn) last year. BZW's substantial payments reflect the company's success in generating profits of Pounds 501m last year, which has led to more than 6,000 employees in the company sharing bonuses totalling Pounds 100m. Some of the details of the remuneration are revealed in the 20-F form which has just been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, BZW refused to comment on the figures or methods of payment. Leading tax experts said yesterday that a number of merchant banks and other companies have used tax avoidance and deferral techniques in spite of efforts by the Revenue to clamp down since the last Budget. Ms Moira Elms, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that employers are still able to pay bonuses in ways which avoid National Insurance Contributions, while income tax owed by their staff must always be paid but can be substantially delayed. One approach is to pay the bonuses to an insurance company, which issues life insurance policies with very short-term maturities. She said she had heard of other techniques including the use of schemes operated by specialist consultancies which provided bonuses through fine wines, diamonds and 'bonus bonds', or vouchers redeemable at retail outlets. These come outside the definition of earnings as defined for the purpose of National Insurance Contributions. She said that the way in which bonuses are received by staff can defer their income tax liability for up to 18 months. 'There are still some loopholes which we will tell our clients about,' she said. 'But we warn that they will be closely scrutinised by the Revenue and are only worth doing if they are very carefully structured and there are significant numbers of employees or sizes of bonuses at stake.'</p>

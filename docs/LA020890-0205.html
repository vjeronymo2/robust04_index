			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1986 MURDER IN DARK LOT SPURS CAMPUS LIGHTING BILL  </P> <P> On a cold January night in 1986, student disc jockey Robbin Brandley was  walking to her car in an unlit parking lot on the Saddleback College campus in  Mission Viejo when she was attacked.  </P> <P> The body of the 23-year-old Laguna Beach woman, a communications major who had  looked forward to a career in broadcasting, was found several hours later next  to her car. She had been stabbed repeatedly. There was no evidence of sexual  assault or robbery and the case was never solved.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, after recently being contacted by the young woman's parents,  state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) introduced legislation to require  lighting on all public campuses in California.  </P> <P> Citing a rise in crime on the nation's college campuses, Bergeson said the  increased lighting would act as a deterrent. Brandley's mother, Genelle Reilley  , said lights in the Saddleback parking lot four years ago might have saved her  daughter's life.  </P> <P> "It's too late for our daughter, but we don't want this to happen to anyone  else's child or grandchild," Reilley, 51, said at her Laguna Beach home  Wednesday. "We want to do everything we can to protect our children on these  campuses."  </P> <P> Reilley and her husband, John, also 51, a Ralston-Purina executive, approached  Bergeson last December about the possibility of enhancing campus security with  more lighting. Upon looking into the issue, Bergeson said in a statement  Wednesday, she found that no lighting standards existed on California campuses.  Schools, she said, look to the state architect's office for lighting  recommendations.  </P> <P> "This bill will give the state architect an adequate standard which will  guarantee a minimum average of two foot-candles (a unit of measuring  illumination) at the pavement throughout the parking or walkway surface,"  Bergeson said. "(The bill) will effectively double the amount of light  available to most school lots."  </P> <P> Bergeson noted that, in recent years, campus crime in California and across the  nation has been on the rise. Reilley said Saddleback College has been at  particularly high risk because of its location amid hills where shrubbery can  conceal an attacker.  </P> <P> The year before Brandley's death, another Saddleback student was attacked on  campus. In April, 1985, a 25-year-old student was abducted from a different  parking lot by two men who beat her over the head, stripped her, then dumped  her naked, but alive, about six hours later on a freeway off-ramp. Since  Brandley's death, at least three other women have reported being sexually  assaulted there.  </P> <P> On the night she was attacked, Brandley -- a student disc jockey for KSBR-FM --  served as a volunteer usher for a piano concert and reception at the school's  Doyle G. McKinney Theatre. She was returning to her car, about 100 yards from  the theatre, when the attack occurred.  </P> <P> Ever since, John and Genelle Reilley have sought to assuage their pain over  their daughter's murder by pushing for campus security reforms.  </P> <P> Last year, Genelle Reilley testified in support of a state Senate bill that  would have required colleges to submit a list of all recent crimes to enrolling  students. The bill passed the Senate and Assembly but was vetoed by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> In October, Reilley said, she and her husband organized a Violence in America  seminar at Cal State Fullerton. The seminar, she said, focused on causes of  violent crime and ways to prevent it.  </P> <P> The Reilleys said they have been less successful in their dealings with  Saddleback College.  </P> <P> She and her husband pushed unsuccessfully for the school to establish a  violence-prevention program. School officials, however, have said they were  never contacted by the Reilleys and that the college already offers a program  that examines how to deal with victims of violence.  </P> <P> In October, 1986, the Reilleys filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court  claiming that county, state and community college officials were partly  responsible for the death of their daughter by not providing adequate security.  The suit is pending.  </P> <P> Though she sees Bergeson's bill as a victory in her campus security campaign,  Reilley added that the pain of her daughter's loss persists.  </P> <P> "I still wake up at 3 a.m., which is the time I was notified by police,"  Reilley said, wringing her hands while perched on the edge of a sofa. "You get  used to the pain, but it is still intense and sometimes it just really hits  you."  </P></p>

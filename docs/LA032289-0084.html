			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Tim Littles, a light-middleweight amateur boxer from Flint, Mich., has learned  that he was not a winner in amateur boxing's World Championships Challenge in  Casablanca, Morocco, last month.  </P> <P> Littles, 24, defeated East German Torsten Schmitz in the bout -- or thought he  had. Littles' hand was raised by the referee when he was announced as the 3-2  winner and he was also awarded a gold medal.  </P> <P> But the USA Amateur Boxing Federation received official results this week from  the International Amateur Boxing Assn., and Littles is listed as the loser.  </P> <P> "Our people left Casablanca under the impression that Tim had won, but the  official AIBA results show a jury overturned the Littles decision due to an  'addition error' on the part of a Moroccan judge," said Leslie King of the  USA/ABF.  </P></p>

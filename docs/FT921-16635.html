			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Indian premier charges Pakistan with 'state terrorism' MR P V Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, has accused Pakistan of using 'state terrorism' in the northern Indian states of Punjab and Kashmir. Speaking at a meeting of the National Integration Council attended by all the main political parties, Mr Rao said 'sponsored terrorism (was) being carried on from across the border'. The 'whole government, the whole state' was taking part in the terrorism, he said. Officials have long blamed Pakistan for insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab, but this is first time the prime minister has pointed a finger at India's neighbour, accusing it of 'waging a proxy war' in the two states. Relations between India and Pakistan, never good at the best of times, are bound to deteriorate following Mr Rao's charge but it is thought unlikely that military action will follow. Both countries are preoccupied with economic problems and would not willingly bear the cost of another conflict. The meeting of the National Integration Council was held at the demand of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). The president of the BJP is now on a nationwide 'unity tour' whipping up emotions on the Kashmir and Punjab issues. He plans to end it on January 26 - Republic Day - by unfurling the national flag in Srinagar, capital of Kashmir. All parties, including the ruling Congress, have condemned the BJP tour on the ground that it would stir up communal tensions. Mr MM Joshi, the BJP president, has drawn large crowds during his tour, which is expected to gain momentum when he reaches the northern states next week. The council welcomed the government's plans to hold general elections in Punjab next month but could not adopt a common resolution on Kashmir because of the BJP's demand that the state should not be given preferential treatment under the Indian constitution. Pakistan said it had swapped lists of nuclear installations with India yesterday under an agreement aimed at easing suspicion about each other's nuclear capabilities, Reuter writes from Islamabad. The Foreign Ministry said that the lists had been handed over by the two countries' missions in New Delhi and Islamabad under an accord ratified in January 1991 and aimed at banning attacks on each other's nuclear plants. India and Pakistan, who have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, both say their nuclear programmes are for peaceful purposes. But they accuse each other of having at least the potential to make nuclear arms. Neither has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, each citing the other's failure to do so.</p>

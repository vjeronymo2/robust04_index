			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella: "We Do Not Want </F> To Be Outcasts"]    [Text] Our active commitment to the nonproliferation policy  in the field of missiles, chemical weapons, and nuclear energy  represents one of the key points of the so-called Argentine  foreign policy's "Copernican revolution."    We espoused this commitment by principle, and in pursuit of  our interests.    By principle, because one of the priorities of the  international community in which Argentina, within its reach and  possibilities, now plays a leading role undoubtedly consists in  preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.    In pursuit of our interests, and thanks to this policy (and  within the framework of the transformations our country is  carrying out), Argentina is regaining trust and credibility.  And this is translated into a reduction of the so- called  Argentine risk, a decline in the cost of loans, an increase in  investments, and access to sensitive technology that had been  banned for us. Without the nonproliferation policy, Argentina  would be described today as an outcast country, estranged from  the Western world from a political, technological, and economic  viewpoint.    Changes in the international political system and in the  progress made by great powers to achieve disarmament have  modified public and political stances on the acquisition of  nuclear weapons, and have contributed to creating a closely-knit  atmosphere in the sphere of nonproliferation.    The international community has become fully aware that the  acquisition of nuclear weapons jeopardizes international peace  and security and mankind's survival.    Proof of this is that at the beginning of 1992 the UN  Security Council declared for the first time that the  proliferation of weapons of massive destruction constitutes a  "threat to international peace and security."    Within this framework the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT) signed in London, Moscow, and Washington on 1 July 1968,  and effective since 5 March 1970, is considered to be the  bulwark of nonproliferation.    This international legal instrument enables nonnuclear  states  to freely confirm that they renounce nuclear weapons in a formal  and internationally binding way. Moreover, by observing the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, they can  prove that such a commitment is faithfully honored.    This has been the path so far taken by some 160 countries --  South Africa, which has an important nuclear program, followed  this example. Only 30 states, including Argentina, have not  adhered to the NPT.    Not long ago President Menem officially expressed his  decision to join this important international instrument in the  future. This bears direct relation to and is the culmination of  the path taken by our government, which enabled the issuance of  Decree 603/92 on the control of the exportation of sensitive  material, signing the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement between  Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC [Brazilian-Argentine Agency for  Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials] and the IAEA,  establishing the ABACC, joining the Tlatelolco Treaty, and  participating as an observer to the group of nuclear supplying  countries, of which it will soon become a member.    It should be pointed out that by virtue of the Quadripartite  Agreement and the Tlatelolco Treaty, our country meets all the  requirements established by the NPT.    The signing of the NPT will earn our country international  confidence and openness in our nuclear activities, and will  contribute to consolidating the international high standing we  have built up for ourselves concerning nonproliferation.  Besides, it will facilitate and boost the exchange of new  technologies with countries that are more developed in this  area. It will also enable us to have greater clout when the  renewal of the NPT is discussed next year, so as to be able to  include more stringent provisions for the disarmament of nuclear  countries.    And above all one must not lose sight of the fact that the  current nonproliferation system is based on an international  treaty (NPT) signed by the majority of states. This means that  nonproliferation cannot be effectively imposed only by powerful  states or suppliers of nuclear technology and materials, but  rather by the experience and action of the international  community in its entirety.</p>

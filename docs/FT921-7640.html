			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ward Pounds 14m in red following exceptionals Ward Holdings, the Kent-based housebuilder and property group, yesterday said the poor state of the housebuilding market had contributed to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14m for the year to October 31. The deficit, which compared with profits of Pounds 3.93m last time, included Pounds 12.2m of exceptional charges, relating to a write-down in the value of the land bank. Losses per share were 19.1p (earnings 4.7p); the final dividend is passed leaving a total of 0.5p (2.6p). Turnover fell from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 22.9m. Expectations of a housing recovery which never materialised adversely affected the group. The house construction division was worst hit, incurring a loss before exceptionals of Pounds 3.39m (profit Pounds 1m). The exceptional number of house repossessions in the south-east, together with rising white collar unemployment, continued to overshadow the market. Better news came from the property investment and commercial development business which remained in the black, reporting a decline in operating profits to Pounds 2m (Pounds 3.52m).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 27 April TASS -- Tajikistan leadership is  deeply concerned over the escalation of terroristic actions  along the Tajik-Afghan border, the Tajik Foreign Ministry said  in a statement circulated on Wednesday.    Tajik Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zafar Saidov told ITAR-TASS  that according to "irrefutable evidence" a thousand and a half  Tajik rebels are massing in the Afghan border village of  Bakhorak. The group is headed by Abdul Rashid Badakhshi,  commander of the so-called Badakhshan Resistance Front. The  rebels plan to intrude into Tajikistan's inner mountainous  regions and launch military actions against the government  troops, he said.    Abdul Basir Khalid, commander of Afghanistan 29th Army  controlling the region where the rebels are based, is not only  tolerant to all their actions but assists rebels, Saidov said.    Tajikistan leadership considers such actions as open  hostility against the government and as an attempt to provoke a  new armed confrontation in the Republic, and warns that the  government will make appropriate moves to prevent provocative  actions.    The Tajik Government appeals to all Afghanistan-based rebels  to give up irresponsible actions and turn to search for  political decisions whithin the framework of the inter-Tajik  negotiating process.</p>

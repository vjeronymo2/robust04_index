			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Leyland site to be business park Part of the former Leyland Daf site at Leyland, Lancashire, is to be redeveloped at a cost of Pounds 70m, with the aim of attracting up to 4,000 new jobs during the next 10 years. Launching the scheme to develop more than 1.3m sq ft of new industrial and commercial accommodation, Lancashire Enterprises said yesterday that the centrepiece of the development would be a rail-freight terminal linking the site with the international European rail network. The new private terminal will compete with Railtrack's terminals in Liverpool and Manchester.</p>

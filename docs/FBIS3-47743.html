Larson, commander-in-chief of US Pacific Command, paid a  courtesy visit to President Le Duc Anh at the Presidential  Palace today. The US admiral informed the Vietnamese leader of  the results of his exchanges of views and working sessions with  the Vietnamese side on the solving of the MIA issue. He  expressed his sincere thanks to the government and people of  Vietnam for their effective cooperation with the US armymen and  officials who were engaged in searching for US servicemen  missing in action during the Vietnam War. He also expressed his  wish that in the coming time, with the efforts and cooperation  of both sides, further progress would be made in that field, so  that the two countries could soon open a new chapter in their  relations.    Speaking to his guest, President Le Duc Anh appreciated  Admiral Larson's goodwill, and he said he believed that being  responsible for the MIA issue to the president and the defence  minister of the US, Mr Larson would have first hand information  on the solving of the MIA issue in Vietnam and country's efforts  in this field while it still met with many difficulties due to  the heavy aftermaths of the war. President Le Duc Anh affirmed  that starting from the humanitarian tradition, the state and  people of Vietnam were cooperating with the US side in the  settlement of the MIA issue, and were ready to close the past  and look to the future in their relations with the US for the  benefits of the two countries and for peace, stability, and  development in the region and on the world over as a whole.    Earlier, Admiral Larson was received by Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam and Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Thoi Bung.  He had talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai on matters of  common concern.    The US admiral left Hanoi this afternoon to visit an  excavation site in central Vietnam before concluding his Vietnam  visit.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Public Housing Authority in Butte, Mont., failed to maintain proper  accounting records and implement budgetary controls on a building improvement  project, according to an audit report compiled by a regional inspector general  in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD's report said that  because of the shortcomings, the department "cannot be sure" money awarded for  the projects was being spent "in the most efficient and economical way." The  housing authority operates 356 low-income housing units, and the assistance  program provides money to improve the units' physical condition and upgrade  their management. As of March, 1989, $4.8 million had been approved for the  projects.  </P></p>

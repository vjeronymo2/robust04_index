			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Ex-BCCI officers face court AFTER a two-year investigation by the Abu Dhabi government, 11 former officers of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International are to appear in court at a preliminary hearing in the emirate tomorrow to face charges that include forgery, mismanagement and fraud. Of the 11, six are British passport holders, four are Pakistani and one is reported to be Canadian. They include former executives of Bank of Credit and Commerce (Emirates), a local bank in which BCCI had a 40 per cent shareholding and the management contract. BCCE has long since been renamed, restructured, and put under new management. Two key figures from BCCI who are among the 13 facing charges will be conspicuously absent. Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, the founder and former president of BCCI, is an invalid in Pakistan, with which the UAE has no extradition treaty, while Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar has started serving a six-year sentence following his conviction in London on September 28. The hearing, and full trial later, could be open to the public though this will depend on a decision of the trial judge. At Saturday's hearing the charges will be read out and counsel for the defence appointed from among several local lawyers. The case would then normally be adjourned for two weeks while defence lawyers study the charges. But given its complexity, they could ask for more time, especially if they should seek access to more documents.</p>

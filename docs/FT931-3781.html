			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Money Markets: French futures drift ATTENTION in the money markets shifted to France yesterday, as the weaking franc caused the short end of the French futures markets to drift downwards. The June contract Pibor futures moved by over 30 basis points during the day, although it later rallied to a closing level of 91.23. Dealers said that the movement reflected the increasing tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism, highlighted by the fall in the escudo against the D-Mark and other currencies. The Portuguese central bank intervened early in the day in support of the currency, raising the rate at which liquidity is absorbed by 0.5 percentage points to 13.5 per cent. Dealers pointed out that speculation that Portugal might be forced to devalue in the coming weeks was continuing to weaken the French franc and force up money market interest rates in some countries. However, he added that the run-up to the French elections later this month was a second factor for the slide. 'The Pibor will remain very volatile into the election and probably after it,' he said, predicting that 'there could be some nasty days next week' in the French money markets, with short-term interest rates likely to be heavily squeezed in the days before the first phase of the election next weekend. At the longer end of the French market futures were considerably firmer, closing slightly up at the end of the day. Dealers suggested that this was due to speculation that the French franc could gain from any fall in the value of the D-Mark sparked by a new crisis in Russia. 'It's Russia that is affecting the longer end of the market, but the ERM for the shorter periods,' said another dealer. Elsewhere in Europe, trading in German and British money markets was generally quiet, although the longer end of the German futures market firmed. With the focus in Britain now firmly fixed on Tuesday's budget, UK interbank rates remained virtually unchanged. Although the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn, this was successfully taken out late in the day. Meanwhile the downwards trend in European interest rates received another small boost when the Irish Central Bank cut the rate at which it lends to commercial banks by 0.5 of a percentage point to 11.5 per cent.</p>

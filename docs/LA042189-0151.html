			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET WAGES FAR OUTSTRIP PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> Soviet wages grew more than twice as fast as productivity in the first quarter  of 1989, further aggravating unsatisfied domestic demand for consumer goods,  official data released today showed.  </P> <P> Nikolai Belov, first deputy chairman of the state statistics committee  Goskomstat, speaking at a news conference, also reported statistics showing a  slowdown in industrial production, a decline in exports and an increase in  imports.  </P> <P> The figures appeared to confirm that the Kremlin's liberalizing economic  reforms, criticized by some Soviet economists as half-hearted, have been unable  to bring a quick solution to the country's mounting economic problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Economic Imbalance  </P> <P> In the short term, at least, the greater freedom the reforms have given state  enterprises to set wage levels for their workers has apparently exacerbated the  economic imbalance, which Belov described as "a very alarming phenomenon."  </P> <P> Belov said average wages grew at an annualized rate of 9.4% in the first three  months of 1989, while productivity grew by 4.5%.  </P> <P> "The Soviet economy is going through a complicated, sometimes contradictory  process," Belov said, although he maintained that the main tendency was  positive.  </P> <P> "It is necessary to control the growth of money incomes so it is in line with  the growth of productivity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modify Taxation  </P> <P> In particular, Belov said, plans were being made to introduce a coefficient  tying wage increases to productivity increases at state enterprises, where the  majority of citizens work.  </P> <P> He said there were also plans to modify taxation, which would also help curb  disposable income of the 1.7 million people -- out of a total work force of 120  million -- who are employed in the booming cooperative sector.  </P> <P> The jump in wages -- which at an average $377 per month are still extremely low  by the standards of other industrialized countries -- has further exacerbated  the imbalance between supply and demand in the economy.  </P></p>

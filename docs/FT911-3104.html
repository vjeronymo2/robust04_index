			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: ECGD and political risk re-insurance Sir, Your report (April 19) of the speech Mr Malcolm Stephens, chief executive of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, gave last week to the Confederation of British Industry pointed out, rightly, the concerns UK exporters have over the government's preparedness to provide political risk re-insurance for the soon-to-be-privatised insurance services wing of the ECGD. You also drew attention to Mr Stephens' argument that the government was justified in blocking a parliamentary amendment to ensure that such re-insurance be available for three years after the privatisation because, if the amendment was passed, new legislation would be required to extend the three year period. This, as the Labour party supporters of the amendment know, is nonsense; the amendment would, in fact, have compelled the government to provide this essential re-insurance for a minimum of, and not up to, three years after the privatisation. Exporters now have every reason to fear that a Conservative government will scrap this support when its commercial risk re-insurance facility does expire after three years, and therefore that the level and cost of short-term credit insurance available for exports to the less-developed countries after that time will depend entirely on what the privatised company is prepared to offer. The decision to oppose a move intended to commit the government to providing support to Britain's hard-pressed exporters certainly casts doubts on ECGD's motives in participating in a conference, next month, which has been endorsed by the Institute of Export and the British Exporters Association, to allow exporters to discuss whether 'the planned changes at ECGD are the best long-term solution for all concerned' at a time when the Export Investment Guarantees Bill, which will pave the way for the privatisation, may have already been passed by parliament, thus letting the government off the hook.

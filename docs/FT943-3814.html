			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (4): Poised for a shake-up - Stock exchange reforms mark end of the 'hoekman' The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is poised to embark on the most radical shake-up in its near 400-year history. On September 30, the bourse will be split into retail and wholesale segments. For the first time, screen trading will be introduced into the professional sector of the market, in an attempt to compete with London's screen-based SEAQ International, which has captured large swathes of trading in Dutch equities At a later stage, probably around January 1, foreign banks and stockbrokers will be allowed to trade on the Amsterdam exchange from their bases overseas. This, too, is a direct challenge to London's success in attracting Dutch business across the English Channel. The reforms, the culmination of years of piecemeal changes, will mean the demise of the traditional 'hoekman', or stock jobber, who acts as an intermediary in Dutch share trading. The bourse's chairman, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, is in no doubt about the far-reaching nature of the impending changes. 'There has never been as big a change to our trading system as the ones we are about to make. Until now, the principles of the 'hoekman' system have not, as far as I'm aware, undergone any fundamental changes since the 17th century,' he said. However, the writing has been on the wall for the hoekman since at least the mid-1980s, when larger participants, Dutch banks and Dutch pension funds, began to complain that the jobbers' small size and limited capitalisation was impeding trading and reducing liquidity. In 1986, a first step was taken to end the hoekman firms' monopoly by allowing market players to do large group trades without the help of a hoekman. Starting later this month, the bourse's two dozen hoekman firms will be whittled down to no more than five to 10 companies. In their new guise, they will act as market specialists, roughly along the lines of their counterparts in New York. The new-style hoekman will operate exclusively in the retail market, but will also serve as a point of contact between the retail and wholesale ends of the bourse. Although Amsterdam is injecting screen trading into its overall trading system, it has consciously stopped short of abolishing the trading floor altogether, as London did in its Big Bang in the late 1980s. 'The decision to retain the philosophy of the central market is a good one,' Mr van Ittersum said, citing debate in London about the wisdom of the UK capital's alternative - adhere to a quote-driven, market-making system. London is starting to look at continental practice at a time when many continental bourses are making some of the concessions to professional investors and trades that lay at the heart of Big Bang. But he stressed that Amsterdam's continued attachment to the floor will have to be borne out by future events and by continued advantages in terms of cost, of swift and transparent price formation, and of a 'feeling for the market' fostered by direct, daily, physical contact. 'The floor itself is not a dogma, it must be a question of efficiency,' he said. Not surprisingly, some hoekman companies opposed the changes that heralded their transformation into specialists, and they called for a longer transition period. The reforms, first scheduled to take place in the 1994 first half, will now go ahead on September 30, Mr van Ittersum said. Foreign-based traders will probably not be admitted until three months later. This is partly because the Amsterdam bourse's members have not yet decided whether foreigners will be required to take out ordinary membership or a cheaper form of extraordinary membership. 'We also want to give our members three months of trading under the new system before opening it up to foreigner traders,' Mr van Ittersum said. A similar three-month gap was observed in the launch last year of the Amsterdam Treasury Market (ATM), the Dutch capital's screen-based trading system for Dutch government bonds which has attracted 15 foreign participants, mostly based in London. 'I expect many of these 15 to be interested in the new equity market, too,' Mr van Ittersum said. 'In the end I think we'll have the 10 to 20 leading foreign houses as participants.' One prospective foreign participant is CS First Boston, which recently announced it was closing its trading and backroom operations in Amsterdam and transferring staff to London. The stock exchange is hoping to keep CS First Boston involved in Dutch bourse trading, despite its virtual departure from Amsterdam. Amsterdam believes that foreign involvement could take off quickly after January. 'If the three biggest players in London say ''Yes, you're better off in Amsterdam', then I think interest could develop very swiftly." Mr van Ittersum said the best test of Amsterdam's success in competing with London will be the spreads between bid and offer prices on the bourse's Asset (Amsterdam Stock Exchange Trading System) screens. If these are as narrow or narrower than those on SEAQ's screen, Amsterdam will have reached its stated goal of being the international price leader for Dutch equities. Another test, though perhaps more difficult to judge because of the lack of transparency in international turnover figures, will be the amount of equity turnover that flows back to Amsterdam from London. At its lowest point in 1992, some 60 per cent of Dutch equity trading took place in Amsterdam, according to a milestone report by McKinsey, the consultants, which galvanised the Dutch financial community into action and helped clear the way for October's reforms. 'McKinsey said that at this rate we might fall below 50 per cent in three years' time. Your goal must be to serve as the price leader for your own equities, and to be leader you must have at least a majority of the volume,' he said. 'I want us to try to get back in any case to a ratio of 75:25, preferably 80:20. That is our goal.'</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Golden legend in Bond St - Patricia Morison joins the 175th birthday celebrations of Agnew's AGNEW'S celebration of its 175th birthday has been so successful that it is extending the exhibition which marks the event until August 28. Important chunks of the birthday cake were snapped up very early by the likes of the Getty Museum, which bought Sebastiano del Piombo's saturnine portrait of Pope Clement VII. But you may still be tempted by two panels by Fra Angelico. The exhibition has been beefed up to significant effect, so that even if you have already visited, it is worth making a second call on Agnew's darkly soothing rooms. Now to be enjoyed are: a lady's portrait by that always intriguing court-portraitist for Queen Elizabeth I and James I, Robert Peake the Elder; a Gericault oil of an animated scene at a farrier's yard; two drawings by Tiepolo; and nine additional and stupendous watercolour landscapes of England and the Continent by Turner. One of the Turners, Gosport: the Entrance to Portsmouth harbour, was bought by Ruskin in 1839 when he was an undergraduate. It is not so hard to believe the old windbag's claim that during the vacation his 'chief recreation, after Greek and Trigonometry in the nursery-study was 'to go down and feast on my Gosport.' Gainsborough's Cattle on a River Bank with Sailing Boats is one of the new recruits. Admired by William Hazlitt, it is silvery-toned, almost bleached-looking, and there is something ever so faintly surreal about it. The cows on the steeply rising river-bank loom portentously over the rowing boats, so much so that it seems they might be thinking about a mass embarkation. Not that you will necessarily see all these works. Nibbling by buyers continues. Zoffany's often-exhibited portrait of the Willoughby de Broke family harmoniously taking tea at Compton Verney was out on approval when I called last week. It is sad indeed to think that after more than two centuries with the original family, this charming example of the English conversation piece must now find a new home. Given unlimited funds, it would be an odd buyer who did not prefer Fra Angelico's beautiful pair of panels of four saints to three hitherto unknown gold-ground panels by Mariotto di Nardo, one of his Florentine predecessors, who died in 1424. All the same, I was much taken by the scenes from the life  -and after-life - of St Stephen the Protomartyr. The panels were part of the predella section beneath an altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin, painted for the church of Santo Stefano in Pane. The altarpiece was dismantled in the 1840s and the main panels were bought by an English collector. Until the First World War or thereabouts, they were together in a church in London's Hatton Garden. Mariotto's altarpiece is now widely scattered, the two other panels dealing with St Stephen now residing in collections in New York and Munich. The Agnew's panels are confident exercises in story-telling. They show the young deacon preaching before the Sanhedrin, his lapidation (a pleasant word for a stony death) by the Jews, and burial. Mariotto then took the story further, using for his source that medieval best-seller, the Golden Legend by Bishop Jacopo da Varazze. It would be a service if a publisher would bring out an English-language selection from the bishop's highly entertaining and indispensable source-book to countless images of saints. I cannot believe there is no market for such a book - just think of all the students taking art-history courses, let alone the more mature church-cum-gallery crawler. Saint-spotting is a delightful pastime and one which I am sure would spread, if only there was an English equivalent of the long-standing Livres de Poche edition. No one-volume dictionary of saints can ever go far enough into the fantastic undergrowth which, by Bishop Jacopo's day, had sprung up around saints' legends, teeming with details which may be charming, bizarre, or even sadistic. In Mariotto's case, the Golden Legend version led to a sharply different, and specifically Italian, version of St Stephen's posthumous career. The version of events documented by contemporaries in the early 4th Century, is that a priest acting on angelic instructions dug up the Protomartyr's body in a field outside Jerusalem. The bishop of Jerusalem was ecstatic and bits of the holy body were then sent to favoured bishops all round the Christian world. The arrival of one piece in Majorca incited a pogrom. The piece which arrived at Hippo in what is today Algeria, aroused immense excitement and furnished St Augustine with a splendid conclusion to his City of God. Yet Mariotto's version shows us the whole body of St Stephen being transported to Rome in a delightful sailing-boat. On the right side, we see that the thrifty Roman clergy decided to put St Stephen into the same sarcophagus as St Lawrence (roasted on the grid-iron, you will recall). St Lawrence's corpse obligingly moved over to make room. Agnews, 43 Old Bond Street, London W1X 4BA, (071) 629 6176, until August 28</p>

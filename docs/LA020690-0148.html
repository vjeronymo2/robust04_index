			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ROCK THROWERS' ROOMS SEALED  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers sealed rooms in two Palestinian homes today in a new army  policy that lets authorities close all or part of houses where residents are  suspected of hurling rocks at troops.  </P> <P> Another Palestinian was reported killed today when a civilian opened fire on  rock throwers who attacked his truck in the West Bank.  </P> <P> The new policy on sealing homes, which could affect hundreds of families in the  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, drew immediate criticism from civil rights groups  and liberal politicians, who said the measure amounted to collective  punishment.  </P> <P> In the nearly 26-month-old uprising, the army has razed or sealed hundreds of  homes to punish Arabs suspected of fire bombings or serious attacks. But the  penalty was not used for stone throwing, the most common tactic of teen-agers  at the forefront of the uprising against Israeli occupation.  </P></p>

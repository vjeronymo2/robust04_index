			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL LOSES, MUST PAY $5.5 MILLION TO USFL;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SUPREME COURT LETS STAND A RULING THAT THE LEAGUE MUST PAY LEGAL FEES  IN ANTITRUST SUIT.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today refused to free the National Football League from  having to pay more than $5.5 million in legal fees to the defunct U.S. Football  League.  </P> <P> The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the NFL must reimburse the  USFL for attorney fees the failed league incurred in winning only $3 in a  much-publicized antitrust suit.  </P> <P> The USFL was formed in 1982 with 12 teams playing a spring-summer schedule. It  collapsed in 1984 after the owners decided to switch to a fall schedule, a move  that never materialized.  </P> <P> The USFL filed a $1.7-billion suit in 1984, accusing the NFL of federal  antitrust violations in its treatment of player contracts, television coverage,  stadium availability and other matters.  </P> <P> A jury found that the NFL deliberately acquired or maintained monopoly power  over major league professional football but ruled against the USFL on other  claims.  </P> <P> The jury awarded the USFL $1, and the presiding judge tripled that figure to $3  in accord with antitrust law.  </P> <P> The NFL claimed the lawsuit was an unsuccessful and unjust ploy to force a  merger with the established league.  </P> <P> The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals last October upheld the award of $5.53  million in lawyer fees to the USFL, which had sought more than $7.6 million to  pay its attorneys.  </P> <P> The appeals court said, "The jury found that the NFL's monopolization of the  United States major league professional football market injured the USFL. An  injury having been found, the awarding of attorney's fees to the USFL was  compulsory.  </P> <P> "The award of only nominal damages to the USFL does not affect its right to  attorney's fees."  </P> <P> Allowing recovery of the fees encourages "the detection and cessation of  anti-competitive behavior" by assuring that when lawyers prevail they will be  paid by the losing side, the appeals court said.  </P> <P> In another ruling today, the high court refused to kill a $100-million lawsuit  against Dade County, Fla., and developers of Joe Robbie Stadium, home of the  Miami Dolphins.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, let stand an appeals court ruling that three  black residents of the stadium neighborhood can pursue in federal court their  constitutional attack against the county and developers.  </P> <P> That portion of the suit revived by the appeals court alleges that the zoning  changes made to accommodate construction of the stadium complex violated  constitutional rights.  </P> <P> The suit says the zoning changes represented both a "taking" of private  property without just compensation and "a stark pattern of discriminatory  practices affecting the property and housing rights of black citizens."  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Proposed BCCI deal wins High Court approval THE High Court yesterday agreed to sanction a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 921m) compensation settlement negotiated with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The judgment means Touche Ross, the provisional liquidator, has overcome the first hurdle in its attempt to win court approval for the deal that will give creditors between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of their original investments. The English Creditors Committee of BCCI, which had asked for the deal to be rejected, was given until next Wednesday to lodge an appeal. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, giving judgment after a four-day hearing, said the proposals represented the best option for the bank's 140,000 creditors in 70 countries around the world. The judge accepted the liquidator's argument that rejection of the deal would have been a 'huge gamble', leading to protracted litigation against Abu Dhabi with no certainty about the outcome. Sir Donald said that while he accepted that depositors felt the offer was nowhere near enough, he thought that in the 'cold light of day' many would realise that the prudent and sensible decision would be to accept what was on offer now. Many depositors, he said, had placed their confidence in him to 'wave a wand and all will be well' but he said: 'I cannot conjure money out of the air, however deserving the case. Nor can the liquidators. All I can do is choose between the available options. I don't believe that if I rejected these proposals I would be doing the depositors a service.' One point clarified during the hearings is that the liquidators now have to seek the approval of creditors representing 51 per cent of the identified liabilities rather than 70 per cent as they suggested earlier. The original agreement allowed Abu Dhabi to waive the condition. Even if no appeal is lodged, two further court hearings are necessary before the liquidators have final approval. If judgments in the Caymans next week or in Luxembourg the following week go against the package the deal could still fall. Mr Tony Scott, secretary of the BCCI Depositors' Protection Association, said he was confident there would be an appeal. He said: 'I believe that the liquidators are using creditors' money to conclude a settlement that creditors themselves do not want. I believe that is unfair and unjust.' Lord Justice Bingham's report into the role of BCCI's supervisors in the UK is expected to be published towards the end of next month.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Reuters rises 15% as Instinet shows strong growth Shares in Reuters Holdings rose 13p to 518p yesterday after the financial information and news group said its revenues had increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 513m in the first quarter of 1994, against the same period last year. The trading information was the first of the statements which Reuters intends to make in April and October, to indicate how the group fared between its annual and interim announcements. About 35 per cent of Reuters shares are held by US investors, who are accustomed to quarterly reporting. Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'When we announced our 1993 results, we felt we could achieve double-digit revenue growth in 1994. We still feel that, and we have no reason to change our expectations of relatively stable margins this year compared to last year.' The main contribution to buoyant transactions revenue in the first quarter was Instinet, the US-based equity brokerage service for institutional investors, which saw growth of 89 per cent. About half of that came from Thamesway, the international institutional broker which Reuters bought in November. Reuters said the growth in revenue in the first quarter was accompanied by increasing capital expenditure. Employee numbers rose due to higher levels of business activity. The group said revenue included Pounds 13m from acquisitions, but did not include any contribution from two purchases completed in March - Teknekron which supplies digital trading systems to banks, and Quotron, the US-based equity trading service. Mr Job was speaking at the Reuters conference in Geneva which saw a preview of the new financial TV service for foreign exchange traders Reuters will launch in June. Reuters will this week fly in 2,500 executives from financial institutions across Europe to its exhibition of financial products. Reuters now services 15 cities in the former Soviet Union and all the east European capitals. Mr Job said he was still confident that Quotron, the loss-making business bought from the US bank Citicorp could be returned to profitability. He was also confident Globex, the group's automated futures trading system, could 'continue much as before' in spite of the recent departure of the Chicago Board of Trade.

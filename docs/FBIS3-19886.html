			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis] </F>   [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's decision  to suggest to the Security Council the dispatch of Turkish blue  helmets to Bosnia has caused an immediate and strong reaction  from Athens. Categorical opposition was expressed in a letter  that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed urgently a  short time ago to Security Council President French delegate  Jean-Bernard Merimee.    The letter points out the need for the United Nations to  observe the principle that rules out the participation in peace  forces of bordering states or countries that have historic links  to any of the parties involved in a conflict.    Mr. Papoulias is now chairing a conference being attended by  top officials of the Foreign Ministry.    Earlier, UN spokesman Joe Sills said that Butrus-Ghali had  decided to suggest to the Security Council that Turkey be added  to the list of states that are authorized to contribute men to  the UN peace force in the former Yugoslavia. The spokesman also  noted that Butrus-Ghali decided to suggest the relaxation of the  criteria prohibiting certain states from participating in the  peace forces by invoking the recent developments in Bosnia and  the need not to lose the current international momentum because  the UN cannot muster enough forces. Mr. Sills avoided giving a  direct answer on why Butrus-Ghali suggested the dispatch of blue  helmets only from Turkey and not from other countries that have  also offered, such as Italy and Greece. However, he did not  rule out the possibility that there might be a similar  suggestion in the immediate future.    Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator on the former  Yugoslavia, confirmed that Mr. Merimee and representatives of  other Security Council permanent members are maintaining a  positive stance on the possibility of dispatching Turkish blue  helmets. According to ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports, UN circles  believe that it is possible that approval will come in the next  few days for the dispatch of 1,000 Turkish troops who, it is  assumed, will be deployed primarily in the Croatian areas of  Bosnia and certainly away from areas controlled by the Serbs.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Italy to reorganise public sector: Radical changes by government to speed up privatisation ITALY'S overblown public sector holdings are to be radically reorganised to accelerate privatisation. IRI, the main public sector holding, ENI, the state oil concern, ENEL, the national electricity company, and INA, the national insurance institution, will today become joint stock companies under the guidance of the Treasury. Their total assets have been put provisionally at L60,000bn (Pounds 28bn) and the new Italian government of Professor Giuliano Amato intends to sell off an initial 45 per cent to the public. This promises to be the most far-reaching change in the nature of state ownership since Mussolini created IRI in 1933 to act as the motor of public sector driven development. IRI companies alone account for more than 4.5 per cent of GDP and they cover activities from agriculture, banking and construction to defence, information technology, the media and shipbuilding. The announcement at the weekend came in the wake of Friday's emergency budget for the remainder of 1992 which is aimed at finding an extra L30,000bn through spending cuts and increased revenues. The move should add greater credibility to the budgetary measures which were criticised for failing to make more significant spending cuts. 'We are on the edge of a precipice,' said Prof Amato commenting on the measures in the budget. His sense of urgency was underlined by the speed his government intends to tackle privatisation. The four state entities will have only 10 days to approve their new statutes. The previous Andreotti administration spent more than a year arguing over how and what to privatise, while optimistically writing in a total of L21,000bn from privatisation income for 1991-92. Until now the main block on privatisation has come from politicians who have encouraged state ownership as a means of continuing political patronage. The management of all state groups is politically appointed. Prof Amato has also decided to wind up Efim, the industrial state holding whose debts of L8,000bn are nearly double its annual turnover. Its situation has long been one of the most blatant examples of political patronage determining industrial strategy. Foreign creditors account for L3,500bn of the debt and talks with them could determine how many of its activities such as the heavy loss-making aluminium sector will be closed down, or merely transferred to IRI. By placing the four public entities under the tutelage of the Treasury, the government intends to signal to the markets that it is seeking serious financial solutions to the complex issues that privatisation has raised. The Treasury has the best technical team and has been working exhaustively on privatisation schemes over the past year. It is expected to create two further holding companies at least temporarily: one will hold the shares of IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA; the other will handle its existing financial holdings in BNL, the state commercial bank, and in IMI, the financial group. One of the main issues will be the capitalisation of the new companies and how their existing debts are treated. IRI has no formal capital, merely a small trust fund, while its state-backed debts amount to more than L55,000bn. Before this government move, ENI had been planning to sell shares this autumn in Agip, the oil exploration subsidiary, and Snam, its gas company. Editorial Comment, Page 10</p>

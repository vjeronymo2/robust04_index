			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN has already  reported that on 18 May Oleksandr Moroz was elected chairman of  the Supreme Council of Ukraine by a majority vote. [passage  omitted]    A UNIAN correspondent asked people's deputies to comment on  the result of the ballot:    Volodymyr Lanovyy of the "Reforms" group: "This is just the  first stage. Let us wait for the election of 112 people's  deputies. It is also possible that parliamentary activity will  be paralyzed by the formation of a government from the body of  people's deputies. Apart from that, Oleksandr Moroz only won by  a few votes. I hope the final stage of the parliamentary  election will change the situation, because everything will be  decided today by the communist majority rather than by Oleksandr  Moroz."    Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy from the "Statehood" group, who once put  himself forward for the post of Supreme Council chairman but  withdrew his candidacy: "I am an optimist. That is why I think  one should search for the way out of any situation. There is no  tragedy, although the result is not what we had hoped. One  should work constructively."    Vyacheslav Chornovil of the People's Movement of Ukraine  group: "Had I known earlier than today about behind-the-scenes  games by [President] Leonid Kravchuk, who could get rid of his  competitor in the presidential election, the forecasts made  could have been different. I consider the result of the  election to be a national tragicomedy.    Yuriy Buzduhan, a leader of the Social Democratic Party of  Ukraine, who on principle did not join any of the groups:  "Compared with the former Supreme Council, this is a step  forward. Why? Because the majority in parliament came to power  legitimately and, naturally, will take responsibility for its  actions. The future will show to what extent the people of  Ukraine were sensible in electing this deputy and this Supreme  Council chairman. I believe Oleksandr Moroz will be a  consolidating force, and this will be his most difficult task.  I do not rule out the possibility of him asking Vyacheslav  Chornovil to be his deputy."    Stepan Khmara, chairman of the Ukrainian Conservative  [Republican] Party, who is not a member of any group: "One has  once again to admit that the national democrats made a mistake,  were defeated, pushed aside, lost their moral prestige, and let  the old cadre stay in power."</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Russians ready to play the capitalist game: Privatisation is steadily shifting economic control away from Moscow RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin's referendum victory appears not to have resolved the power struggle between supporters and opponents of economic reform which rages at the political centre - but in the regions, away from Moscow, reforms are steadily being entrenched by the government's mass privatisation programme. Ministers and advisers at the headquarters of GKI (GosKomImushchestvo), the state property committee which is managing the privatisation programme under the direction of Mr Anatoli Chubais, the deputy prime minister, can barely contain their excitement. In December, when voucher auctions for medium- and large-scale companies began, 18 companies were sold. In April, 558 enterprises in 54 regions were up for tender, making the reformers' target of 5,000 sales by the end of the year more realistic. In total, 1,547 of the 26,000 companies which employ more than 200 workers or have assets valued over Rbs1m, will have been sold this month. Of these, 372 enterprises employ more than 1,000 employees and account for 86 per cent of total employment in privatised enterprises. Add to this the 33,400 small enterprises that were privatised last year and the reason for the reformers' satisfaction becomes apparent. 'Medium-scale privatisation is going like a train,' says Mr Maxim Boiko, a senior adviser to Mr Chubais. It is not surprising that parliamentary opposition to Mr Chubais has grown in recent months, accompanied by repeated calls for his resignation. 'The Chubais programme is really undermining the power of the state authorities,' says Mr Sergei Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre for Economic Reform. 'They thrived on ill defined property rights. That is why they oppose him.' Yet in the regions, governments - and, to a less extent local parliaments - are increasingly supporting the Chubais programme, with 71 regions, out of about 90, organising auctions this month. In Volgograd, 600 miles south of Moscow, Mr Konstantin Ogloblin, director of the state property fund which sells property on behalf of GKI, is unequivocal: 'I support the policy of Mr Chubais and his programme of voucher privatisation,' he says. The Volgograd state property fund has privatised 37 companies since January, ranging in size from about 100 employees to 26,000 at a giant tractor plant, and is privatising at the rate of 13 companies a week. Most privatised enterprises are now largely owned by the workers and managers, who generally choose to exercise their right to purchase 51 per cent of the available shares in the enterprises. Critics doubt that privatisation will produce either new investment or restructuring, especially if worker-shareholders prevent managers from laying off surplus workers. 'I like Chubais,' says Grigory Yavlinsky, an economist and critic of the government. 'But what he is doing is not clear. You have to cut the roots from the bottom up - to separate housing from the enterprise and then de-monopolise. Only after that can you privatise.' But in Volgograd the process of restructuring is slowly beginning. At Red Dawn, a washing machine factory producing 190,000 washing machines a year, the managing director plans to lay off 150 of his 700 workers after privatisation. Shop-floor workers at Red Dawn appear to accept the management's right to manage. 'People are expecting lay-offs,' says Uri, a 30-year-old engineer. 'The staff used to be against privatisation but now they are in favour. The first people to be fired will be the drunks, the ill-disciplined and the lazy-bones.' As an exercise in popular education, the Volgograd privatisation effort is impressive. With western help from the International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, and Soviet-style hype in form of dozens of smart, new posters that bravely declare: 'Privatisation] Hundreds of businesses await your choice]', the citizens of the city are being encouraged to use their vouchers to invest. In spite of the sheer complexity of the privatisation system, the signs are that much of the population of the Volgograd region is prepared to give this new capitalist 'game' a go. Under the rules, each Russian has been issued with a rouble privatisation 'voucher' which has a nominal face value of Rbs10,000 - a sum they can top up with money of their own. The vouchers can be sold on for cash, used to purchase shares in their place of work, 'invest' in one of the five new investment trusts, or purchase a limited quantity of shares in the companies up for auction at Volgograd's new share auction house, a former trade union building. There, business is brisk as a stream of local Russians arrive to invest their vouchers in shares for local enterprises. Mr Georgy Tseplalov, a 58-year-old farmer and shop owner, had travelled 200 miles to invest his vouchers in Konfil, a sweet factory. With a flash of entrepreneurial pleasure he admits that he has collected 10 vouchers by purchasing them at reduced rates from his fellow villagers. 'I know the factory and I think it has a good future,' he says. Lena Tereshinko, 35, arrived with a neighbour to buy shares in four local chemical factories: 'We want to invest our vouchers to get the best returns for them,' she says, adding with a laugh: 'There's not much else we can do with them - Rbs10,000 these days won't even buy a proper pair of boots.'</p>

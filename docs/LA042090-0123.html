			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKERS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE  </P> <P> Bright orange signs, traffic cones and flashing yellow lights -- all signs of  freeway repairs or construction under way -- are frustrating signals for most  drivers.  </P> <P> But to Albert Miranda, they are markers of danger, and occasionally, as on the  San Diego Freeway on Thursday morning, the construction signs are markers of  death.  </P> <P> Miranda worked for eight years as one of Orange County's 140 California  Department of Transportation workers, repairing guardrails, replacing signs and  placing his life on the line.  </P> <P> "You constantly are looking over your shoulder," said Miranda, who now works as  a spokesman for Caltrans' Orange County office. "You can't step in the wrong  direction. It's very dangerous. There's nothing out there to protect you but  the plastic cones and the signs."  </P> <P> Thursday's accident, in which a highway maintenance worker was crushed to death  when a van traveling more than 80 m.p.h. slammed into a parked maintenance  truck, is an example of the hazardous conditions workers face, Caltrans  officials note.  </P> <P> The worker's death was the fifth in Orange County since 1980 and the first this  year, according to Caltrans.  </P> <P> The agency reported that no worker deaths occurred in 1989, but there were  seven fatalities statewide between 1984 and 1988. That is a decrease over the  previous reporting period between 1979 and 1983, when 17 workers died around  the state. Between 1974 and 1978, there were 14 fatalities statewide.  </P> <P> Caltrans does not keep statistics on the number of injuries suffered, but  Miranda estimated that hundreds of workers have been hurt over the last 15  years.  </P> <P> The decrease in the number of deaths during the late 1980s is attributed in  part to the "Give 'em a Brake" television ad campaign that attempted to raise  awareness about the dangers faced by the highway workers.  </P> <P> Another factor in the decreasing rate of fatalities is the introduction of  safety devices, such as concrete barriers and light boards that inform drivers  of highway conditions, officials said.  </P> <P> Despite the improvements, some workers say the freeways are more dangerous  today than they were 10 years ago.  </P> <P> "We used to go into the middle of traffic to collect objects," said George  Hays, who worked on Southern California freeways for 21 years and is now  regional manager of the Orange County Caltrans office. "We wouldn't even think  of doing that today. . . . Things are a lot more dangerous."  </P> <P> Miranda said he knew four of the Orange County workers who were killed.  </P> <P> Two of them died when a truck with bad brakes slammed into them on the Santa  Ana Freeway near Lincoln Avenue.  </P> <P> Another was killed on the Riverside Freeway near Weir Canyon Road when a driver  lost control of his car after reaching for something on the floorboard, Miranda  said.  </P> <P> A fourth was killed on Laguna Canyon Road when a milk truck hit him on Big Bend  Curve as the worker attempted to cross the road.  </P> <P> "A lot of drivers just aren't alert," Hays said. "They're looking for something  (in the car), thinking about their children, or something like that."  </P> <P> Officials ranked freeway off-ramps and interchanges as the most dangerous areas  for repair work.  </P> <P> "Any time you have a situation where people are making up their minds about  where to go at the last minute, you have a hazard," Miranda said.  </P></p>

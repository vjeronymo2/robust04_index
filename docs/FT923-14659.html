			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Platignum back in the black Platignum, a maker of writing instruments, stationery and furniture, returned profits of Pounds 405,000 pre-tax for the year to end-March on turnover of Pounds 17.13m. That compared with previous losses of Pounds 1.34m, which included exceptional provisions of Pounds 578,000, on turnover of Pounds 20.78m. The directors said demand was weak in all businesses but that action on improving margins and reducing overheads achieved a better underlying performance. Extraordinary costs of Pounds 739,000 (Pounds 150,000) left the year-end loss at Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 1.42m). Earnings worked through at 0.2p (losses 0.63p).</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Best laid plans of men and mice: The significance of Disneyland for the British election IN AN election campaign dominated by photo opportunities, sound bites, and staged and scripted interviews, it is refreshing to see a politician look shocked. It happened last week to Tony Blair, Labour's shiny-faced employment spokesman. While in full spate advocating higher pensions for all, he was cut off at the knees by a softly-spoken working-class Welsh housewife: 'I don't know why you want to give us all this extra money,' she said. 'We'll just go and spend it on a trip to Euro-Disneyland.' Mr Blair, whose features anyway have the rubbery consistency of a cartoon character, looked like Mickey Mouse would if Mini Mouse told him she was going off with Donald Duck. While the Labour party is quite prepared to argue that tax cuts lead to undesirable expenditure on pleasurable foreign imports, it had clearly never occurred to them that good working-class Welsh pensioners might perpetrate similar treachery. But I have no doubt that the lady was right. Euro-Disney will syphon off more discretionary pounds, once it opens next month, than any competing English, or even Welsh, attraction. In 1988 I was invited by the Disney company to tour Disneyland in California, and Disneyworld in Florida. I think the occasion was Mickey's 60th birthday. To celebrate Disney executives had covered 320 acres of an Iowa cornfield with the image of Mickey Mouse's head. They called it the 'Little Mouse on the Prairie.' Meanwhile in California and Florida the executives who all wore Mickey Mouse watches showed me maps of Europe covered with concentric circles showing population densities, and average speeds of public and private travel. They somehow seemed to converge on a blob about 20 miles east of Paris. '1992' they said. 'How convenient,' I trilled. 'The year the Channel Tunnel opens.' 'Oh really,' they replied in a tone nicely mixing boredom and disbelief. Well Mickey is on time, at least. It is hard to over-emphasise the military precision with which the Disney company orders its affairs. And like the military, the greatest precision attaches to the tiniest details. Four years ago, at the Disney University in California - yes, there is such a place - I stumbled across a document which governed the exact physical appearance to be adopted by employees. Under the section Women (Hair) it said: 'Hair below shoulder-length should be worn combed away from the face so that it will not fall forward or over the face while performing normal job duties. Side tendrils, if worn, should not extend below the bottom of the ear lobe. If a yarn or hair ribbon is worn it should be no wider than one-half inch or longer than four inches when tied. Stick-pin barrettes (both leather and plastic) and knitted chignon (bun) holders are not acceptable.' For EuroDisney everything has been thought of. The Disney employees dressed up as Mickey Mouse will not be allowed to ruffle the hair of little European children who come running up for affection. This is because Disney is concerned that one such child might be undergoing chemotherapy, and be wearing a wig. Mickey will not have a tail. This stems from an incident eight years ago when a visitor to Disneyworld in Florida pulled too insistently at Mickey's tail; Mickey picked the boy up and hurled him through the air. The parents took Mickey to court. No such incident will ever be allowed to break the monotony of perfection at Euro-Disney. This perfect monotony is in fact the great US invention. In any other business it is simply called mass production. It is why the Heinz baked bean, the Kellogg cornflake, and, many years ago, the Ford motor car, conquered the world. The Disney company, with complete success, has applied the US principles of mass production to the appearance of human beings. In this election campaign the party media managers are attempting to achieve the same standards of flawless, rehearsed consistency with their charges, the politicians. But unfortunately for them, the public want men, not mice. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

Historian N. Vasetsky  wrote in the weekly Literary Gazette that Trotsky, who with Lenin forged the  1917 Bolshevik Revolution, was assassinated in 1940 in an operation ordered  from Moscow and run by a secret police agent. "Stalin could not forget old  insults . . . either he himself took the decision or he let his entourage know  that it was time to put an end to Trotsky," Vasetsky wrote, acknowledging what  has long been believed in the West.  </P></p>

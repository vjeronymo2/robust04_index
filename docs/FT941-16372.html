			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Shippers draw up battle lines - Container war leaves agreement at sea Winter conditions on the north Atlantic are rarely smooth but a dispute between exporters and the shipping lines which link North America and Europe has whipped up a storm. Conferences - agreements between shipping lines to set prices on a particular route - are a well-established means of introducing certainty into a seasonal business requiring large capital investments. But one newly-established conference, the Trans Atlantic Agreement, has set shippers against the shipping lines and led to a dispute over the powers of the European Council and the European Commission. The TAA is an agreement between 15 large shipping lines, accounting for about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to regulate both rates and capacity. Its members include many large container shipping lines such as P&amp;O, Nedlloyd and Maersk. The TAA came into effect in September 1992 and pushed up freight rates by as much as 100 per cent, the shippers claim. The shipowners see in it a chance to reduce their ruinous losses on the north Atlantic. 'When the cost of shipping a container across the Atlantic fell from Dollars 1,600 (Pounds 1,080) to Dollars 800 no-one jumped up and down to say that the shipowners were losing a fortune,' comments Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O and president of the European Shipowners' Association. 'All the ship-owning companies are trying to do is to claw back their losses and make sure they don't go bust.' The shipping lines estimate their losses on the north Atlantic at Dollars 650m over the past four years. The shippers, for their part, see the TAA as an attempt to extend the normally accepted rules of conference agreements laid down by the United National Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). They regard it as a dangerous precedent which, if the shipping lines can get away with it, could be applied to other routes around the world. Shippers' organisations have responded angrily to the creation of the TAA and have lobbied hard for the European Commission to view it as an illegal cartel. The British and French Shippers' Councils have condemned the TAA as damaging European exports at a time of recession. Guinness, the drinks group which ships large volumes of beer and whisky to the US, estimates that the TAA has added up to Pounds 1.5m to its annual shipping costs of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. 'We face a monopoly agreement which has already cost us a significant sum and which threatens to cost us more in 1994,' said Mr Chris Scott-Wilson, head of European affairs. 'We are very concerned that the TAA can control freight rates and limit capacity almost at will.' The dispute centres on conflicting interpretations of regulation 4056 which exempts liner conferences from European competition rules. Unusually, this regulation, which took effect in 1987, was the work of the European council of ministers and not the European Commission. This led to claims that when the council considered the TAA at the end of last month it was usurping the commission's powers. In the event Mr Karel van Miert, commissioner in charge of European competition policy, intervened. Last month he issued a statement of objections to the TAA but invited the shipowners to consider a compromise. The dispute between the shippers and the shipowners focuses on three aspects of the TAA: Its inclusion of the inland transport of cargoes to and from the ports. The shippers argue that many shipping lines do not own road haulage companies and do not make capital investments in this area. The TAA argues that what are known as intermodal agreements are a well-established and essential part of contracts. The fact that it seeks to control capacity on the routes as well as rates. The shipowners counter that they have taken surplus vessels out of commission and have reduced capacity by 10 per cent over the past year. But there is still excess capacity of 15 per cent. Permission for shipping lines to charge differential rates. The shippers say this breaks the normal conference rules which require shipowners to charge uniform rates. The shipowners argue that it is natural for TAA shipping lines to charge varying prices because they offer different levels of service. Brussels has indicated that if the TAA makes permanent capacity reductions it would look more favourably on the agreement. But it has recently taken a tough line against other conferences which it felt breached the rules, fining two cartels operating between Europe and Africa.</p>

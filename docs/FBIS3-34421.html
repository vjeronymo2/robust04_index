One of the reactionary Majles deputies, Khamushi, said that  the 50.9 percent increase in current prices was shattering and  stated: Unfortunately this budget will raise inflation to 50-60  percent.    It is worth mentioning that in the course of the discussions  on the regime's budget bill, 120 of the reactionary Majles  deputies, who were terrified of the explosion of popular  discontent against high prices, presented a triple urgency bill  to the Majles that stipulated that the government should be  stripped of all authority to raise prices and grant only the  Majles this right.</p>

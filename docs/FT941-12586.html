			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Ulster MP claims shift by Catholics A growing number of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland see their long-term future within the UK, Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said last night. He said Catholics in Ulster feared that their quality of life would suffer in a united Ireland, while in the Irish Republic people had turned their backs on old-style republicanism and re-unification was no longer a priority. Mr Taylor said the economics of a united Ireland would be disastrous and he predicted mass emigration for hundreds of thousands. He told his party's Mid-Ulster constituency association: 'Thinking Catholics and Protestants do not want to suffer such an experience and that is why the greater number of people in Northern Ireland, including an increasing number of Catholics, want to remain in the UK and have improved relations between north and south.' If Northern Ireland left the UK, Mr Taylor said it would cost the republic Pounds 3.5bn a year - about Pounds 10,000 for every man, woman and child - to maintain the same level of public services and quality of life.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Property: Name on the wall - Cadogan's Place Our competition (Weekend FT, July 9/10) for the best suggestion for a new blue plaque to commemorate a famous person who had lived or stayed in London produced intriguing suggestions. We had to exclude 6 Roland Gardens, SW7, where Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, opened her first school in 1926 since Dame Ninette is still alive. But it is one to pass on to English Heritage. James C Currey of Dallas, Texas, had an unusual proposal: the legation of the Republic of Texas, 1838-1846, in St James's Street, SW1. Two years after the state won independence from Mexico it sent a minister to London. The British government proposed dominion status, as Canada obtained in 1867, but in 1846 Texas joined the Union. Antoin Daltun, of Dublin, suggested two sites connected to the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations of 1921, which led to the Irish Free State: 22 Hans Place, SW1, the Irish delegation's headquarters, and 15 Cadogan Gardens, SW3, where Michael Collins stayed. Both good ideas, and unusual locations. Thomas Hackett, in Luxembourg, wants to celebrate 90 years of the entente cordiale with France by honouring the philosopher-poet Paul Valery, who worked at 15 St Swithin's Lane, EC4 in 1896. Among other suggestions was the former home of Wallis Simpson (later Duchess of Windsor). But the winner of the bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne must be the writer Peter Hopkirk, who points out that John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir and Governor- General of Canada) is a surprising omission. He lived at 76 Portland Place, W1, from 1912 to 1919 where he wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps and Greenmantle. Across the road is the Turkish ambassador's handsome residence - 'fittingly, perhaps, as much of the action of Greenmantle is set in Turkey'.</p>

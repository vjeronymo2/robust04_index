			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Paper demand forecast to rise DEMAND for paper and packaging products is expected to increase in 1992, according to International Paper, AP-DJ reports from New York. At its annual conference, the company said that it expects demand for bleached packaging board to grow by 2 per cent per year until 1995. By the end of 1995, about 670,000 tons will have been added to the 1991 capacity base; about 70 per cent of which will come from the US. Worldwide demand for chemical market pulp is expected to increase this year by between 4 and 5 per cent. Although new capacity will be available, International Paper looks for gradual improvement in operating rates during 1992 to 1995.</p>

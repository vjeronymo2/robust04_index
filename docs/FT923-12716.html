			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Anglo American profits decline 18% in quarter PROFITS from the gold operations of Anglo American, the world's largest producer, dropped by 18 per cent during the June quarter following lower contributions from Freegold and Western Deep Levels. Although gold production rose fractionally to 63,799kg from 63,490kg the previous quarter, total working costs were 2.6 per cent higher at R1.72bn (Dollars 628m) compared with R1.67bn last year. The average rand gold price received was 2.2 per cent lower at R32,749 per kg compared with R33,483 per kg. Profit after capital expenditure fell 17.7 per cent to R137.4m from R167m last year. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, said the main issue facing the group was to deal with problems at Western Deep Levels where a string of mine accidents claimed 46 lives this year, disrupting production and sapping the morale of the workforce. Available profits at the mine dropped by 35 per cent to R10.9m from R16.8m last quarter and R30.1m in the June quarter last year. Although monthly gold production improved steadily - quarterly production was 1.1 per cent up at 9,096kg over the March figure - the catalogue of accidents meant the mine was still some way off good health. Gold production in the June quarter last year was 10,430kg. Western Deep Levels is the deepest gold mine in the world, with mining down to depths of 3,800m below the surface. Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director, said a number of steps were being taken to improve safety He said the mine, where two thirds of the deaths have occurred, had a safety record last year above the industry average. The other mine to suffer a significant fall in profits was Freegold where available profits dropped to R61.8m from R81.7m. Mr Hewitt said this was a result of gold production dropping slightly to 28,059kg from 28,337kg, a lower gold price of R32,863 per kg and working costs rising by 4 per cent to R819m from R789m. Available profits at Vaal Reefs were unchanged at R48.6m. Elandsrand had a very good production quarter, lifting production by 11.6 per cent to 4,852kg from 4,104kg while profits at Ergo dropped to R5.1m from R7.5m.</p>

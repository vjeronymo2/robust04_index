			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Goodrich to sell rest of offshoot BF Goodrich, the speciality chemicals and aerospace group, launched a public offering to sell its remaining 49.5 per cent interest in the Geon subsidiary which it floated earlier this year. The proceeds from the sale, put at Dollars 248m before tax, will be used to fund part of the Dollars 300m acquisition of Emerson Electric's Rosemount aerospace division, announced two weeks ago. The two transactions mark the culmination of Goodrich's plan to narrow the scope of its operations to speciality businesses which it believes have good profit growth potential, and move away from cyclical businesses. The company has said it expected earnings next year to be significantly ahead of the 60 - 70 cents a share projected for this year. The 12.9m shares in Geon, a maker of polyvinyl chloride, have been offered at Dollars 20 each. This is below the current market price, which edged down to Dollars 20 5/8 on the news, but still ahead of the Dollars 18 at which Goodrich floated its first 13.1m shares in the company in April. The company reported a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 91.9m after the flotation, suggesting that the fourth-quarter gain from the latest sale will top Dollars 100m.</p>

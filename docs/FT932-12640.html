			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Choice of new premier pleases Milan CONTINENTAL bourses were mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN found the prospect of having an economist, rather than a politician, as the next prime minister to its liking and shares rose in heavy trading. The Comit index added 9.63 or 1.8 per cent to 541.26. Two names were at the forefront of speculation throughout much of the day, Mr Romano Prodi, the former chairman of IRI, the main state holding company, and Mr Carlo Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy. In the event, it was Mr Ciampi who was summoned to see President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro late in the day. 'The appointment of somebody who is not a politician will be good news for the market,' said Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan. 'It indicates that the old political class has reached the end.' Domestic and foreign funds were active buyers, concentrating both on blue chips and second liners. Privatisation stocks mostly posted strong gains, with Credito Italiano rising L78 or 2.6 per cent to L2,989 and Sme up L171 or 2.7 per cent to L6,417. Fiat turned in another strong performance fixing L129 higher at L6,989 and breaking through the L7,000 level on the kerb to L7,070. ZURICH was seen entering a spell of consolidation and the SMI index fell 23.7 or 1.1 per cent to 2,139.0. The mood was depressed by the weaker dollar and scant prospects for any further easing in interest rates in the short term. UBS bearers, down SFr18 at SFr947, led the market lower. Bearers in CS Holding, which holds its annual news conference in London today, shed SFr60 to SFr2,380. Export shares were led lower by Roche certificates which fell SFr50 to SFr4,230. PARIS saw one of its weakest days this year in terms of market turnover, down to FFr1.7bn, as the CAC-40 index lost 4.96 to 1,911.62. Among issues acting against the trend Peugeot built on Friday's gain with a further rise of FFr10 to FFr574 and Elf improved FFr2.90 to FFr359.90 with Petrofina confirming that the French group holds a stake of 4.98 per cent. Schneider slipped FFr16 to FFr644 after reporting a slight increase in profits and forecasting difficult trading conditions in 1993. LVMH lost FFr5 to FFr3,641 as it announced plans for a 5-for-1 share split. FRANKFURT edged down on futures-led technical trading, while exporters weakened on concerns of further falls in the dollar against the D-Mark. The DAX index fell 7.29 to 1,649.81 in turnover of DM6bn. Siemens fell DM1.4 to DM627 ahead of half year results. BRUSSELS posted its seventh consecutive fall led by a decline in financial issues. The Bel-20 index fell 13.44, or 1.1 per cent to 1,210.50 in thin trading. Generale Banque fell BFr150 or 1.9 per cent to BFr7,780 on reports that a leading shareholder was releasing its stake below the market price. OSLO was lifted by a largest-ever ship building order for Kvaerner's Finnish subsidiary and favourable corporate earnings news. The All share index gained 2.93 to 455.05 in turnover of NKr569.4m. Kvaerner's B shares rose NKr4 to NKr197. Norsk Hydro put on NKr3.50 to NKr168 on good first quarter results. HELSINKI continued higher on satisfaction with the outcome of the Russian referendum. The HEX index rose 33.5 or 3 per cent to 1,152.1. Turnover in shares and bonds so far this year also surpassed yesterday the entire FM25.81bn turnover for 1992, the bourse said. Trading volumes have shot up as prices soared since September 8 when the markka was floated.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 26                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1153.76    1154.82     1155.16    1155.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1219.12    1223.48     1220.39    1220.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1155.89    1155.47     1154.12    1152.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1221.21    1218.39     1219.36    1218.66  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 23    Apr 22    Apr 21    Apr 20    Apr 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.50   1164.35   1157.71   1158.12   1164.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1223.66   1234.50   1224.52   1220.73   1221.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1156.59; 200 - 1224.39 Low/day: 100 - 1152.75  200 - 1217.92.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

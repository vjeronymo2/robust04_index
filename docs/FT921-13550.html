			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Production cuts steady oil prices OIL PRICES edged up slightly yesterday as two more producers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced symbolic cuts in output. North Sea Brent crude for March delivery was 10 cents higher at Dollars 18.10 a barrel as Algeria and Iran said they would cut production. Algeria will trim 20,000 barrels a day (b/d) from its output of 800,000 b/d and Iran will cut 50,000 b/d from its production of 3.5m b/d in a bid to bolster prices. The moves follow cutbacks announced last week by Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria, which between them cut 130,000 b/d. But the organisation's largest producer, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its own production in advance of Opec's next meeting on February 12. The small production cuts are unlikely to have a major effect on oil prices, but have so far managed to stop them sliding. Dubai prices for March delivery are still Dollars 6 a barrel below the Opec target price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Nevertheless, the voluntary production cuts signal to the market that Opec producers are ready to co-operate over more substantial cutbacks in February rather than become embroiled in a row. Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained that it will bear its part of output cuts as long as other countries share the burden.</p>

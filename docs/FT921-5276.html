			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Corporation tax cut and loopholes closed A RISE in the corporate tax rate and the closing of some tax loopholes were the key features of the Hong Kong government's budget presented yesterday by the colony's new financial secretary, Mr Hamish MacLeod. The colony's corporate tax rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 17.5 per cent - a measure that had been well leaked and discounted by the stock market. The budget was billed by the government as one for the man-in-the-street, a departure for an administration seen as avowedly pro-business and a sign that Hong Kong's experiment with limited elective democracy is having an effect on at least the government's presentation of policy. Mr MacLeod said his budget measures were framed against an economic background which would see the economy expand by 5 per cent in real terms this year after 4 per cent growth last year. Trade, the backbone of the colony's economy, was expected to be buoyant with exports growing by 14 per cent. Although he was accused of not doing enough for the less well off while penalising business, his measures are likely to pass through the Legislative Council without serious amendment. Mr MacLeod said stamp duty on share transactions would be lowered to 0.4 per cent from 0.5 per cent although duty would be extended to covered warrants. He also promised legislation to close tax loopholes which have allowed companies to avoid taxes, especially car dealerships which fudge the true cost of imported vehicles to pay less tax. A combination of higher land sales, faster growth, and less capital spending due to delays with the new airport project boosted the government's surplus to HKDollars 14.1bn (Pounds 1.03bn) from a forecast HKDollars 1.3bn in last year's budget. The surplus is forecast to fall to HKDollars 5.1bn this financial year.</p>

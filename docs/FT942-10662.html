			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Health reform hits Congress troubles President Bill Clinton's proposal to require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, one of the central elements of his healthcare reform plan, is running into difficulties in Congress. Congressional committees working on healthcare legislation are baulking at the employer mandate, which is opposed by Republicans and centre-right Democrats who fear the financial burden it would place on smaller businesses. Congressman John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, remains a few votes short of persuading a majority of his committee to accept the employer mandate. Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee, also appears not to have a majority for the employer mandate, though he has warned his members that the alternative, if a comprehensive reform is to be financed, would be a broadly-based tax increase. In the Senate, meanwhile, Democratic Senator David Boren has signed up with the rival plan produced by Republican Senator John Chafee, which would put the obligation on the individual to secure health. That could mean that the Senate finance committee, of which Mr Boren is a member, ends up using the Chafee plan as the basis for its legislative drafting, rather than Mr Clinton's proposal. But Senator Ted Kennedy, who heads the other main Senate committee dealing with healthcare, preserves the employer mandate in his version of the bill, which he released yesterday. He does, however, exempt businesses with five or fewer employees from paying for their workers' insurance. The Chafee plan would impose a fine on anyone who did not have health coverage by 2005, just as motorists are required to obtain car insurance. It would also, like the Clinton plan, prohibit insurance companies from refusing to cover someone because of their health, or from charging them more, and would offer vouchers to help those on low incomes pay for insurance. It would thus in theory meet the goal of guaranteed, universal coverage Mr Clinton has said is his only unnegotiable demand. In practice, however, it would leave the government with a large bill if adequate subsidies are to be given to those who cannot afford health insurance premiums.</p>

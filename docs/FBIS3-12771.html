Speaking at a banquet hosted in honor of the  visiting Polish president, Mr. Lech Walesa, in New Delhi last  night, President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, said a sense of  identity and affinity marks the multi-dimensional growth of ties  between the two countries. Describing Mr. Walesa's personal  contribution to Polish revolution as significant, Dr. Sharma  said the dramatic changes in Poland over the last decade acted  as an important catalyst in ending the Cold War and  fundamentally transforming international relations.    Reciprocating the sentiments, Mr. Walesa lauded India's  efforts toward ending the arms race and eliminating the threat  of nuclear warfare. Turning to the economic front, Mr Walesa  said there is great scope for increasing trade between the two  countries and the potential in both the countries should be  fully exploited.    The Polish president also met the vice president, Mr. K.R.  Narayanan, and stressed the need to project Mahatma Gandhi's  ideas and values for shaping the new world order.</p>

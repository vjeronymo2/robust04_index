			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (5): Europeans seem happier - Dissatisfaction has driven some companies south of the Canadian border, but others are doing fine THE MOANS and groans about doing business in Ontario have not discouraged some foreign companies from investing in the province - and expressing satisfaction with the results. Chrysler's mini-van plant in Windsor and its car assembly line in Bramalea, north-west of Toronto, contribute about a third of the company's total North American output, a much higher proportion than General Motors' or Ford's Canadian operations. Chrysler chose the Bramalea factory to build its new LH mid-sized car. In contrast to the cuts being made by other motor manufacturers, Mr Yves Landry, president of Chrysler Canada, said recently that the future of 3,000 workers at the Bramalea plant 'looks bright indeed.' The factory, which turned out 260,000 vehicles in 1992, added a second shift last December. Toronto is home to the only restaurants in North America owned by Movenpick, the German-Swiss chain. Movenpick's newest outlet, in the atrium of one of the city's office towers, has been a spectacular success since it opened last year. The self-service restaurant, which has the feel of a bustling marketplace, serves 3,500 to 4,000 people a day, each of whom spends an average of CDollars 10. Mr Johannes Karbach, Movenpick's operations director, says Toronto's big advantage is its cosmopolitan population. 'We're not only fighting for people who have roast beef and mashed potato,' he says. But the return on Movenpick's CDollars 7m investment is still razor-thin. According to Mr Karbach, food and other basic supplies are competitively priced, but Movenpick has difficulty passing on steep increases in electricity rates and municipal services. Lear Seating, a US-owned car seat manufacturer, is currently building its fourth factory in Oakville, on the outskirts of Toronto. The site was chosen mainly because of its proximity to a Ford assembly line, which will be its main customer. But Lear did look just across the border, around Buffalo, New York, before settling on Oakville. Besides the location, a company official says, Lear was attracted by an abundance of semi-skilled labour. He adds that government agencies were 'very receptive' and worked closely with Lear to smooth the way for construction of the 90,000 sq ft factory. The Ontario government is becoming much more aggressive in fighting for new investment, according to Mr Peter Barnes, deputy minister for trade and industry. 'The Japanese have learnt the value of stamina, we have to learn it too,' says Mr Barnes, as he reels off details of his ministry's new 'customer-oriented' approach to investors. Mr Barnes also says that Ontario's drawcards include political and economic stability, the quality of life and a productive workforce. European firms, in particular, appreciate that Toronto has a more cosmopolitan ambience than most parts of the US.</p>

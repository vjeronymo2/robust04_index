			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Fiat to build car plant in Algeria FIAT, the Turin-based automotive group, yesterday agreed to go ahead with a joint venture in Algeria to build a Dollars 350m (Pounds 192.3m) car plant with Saada, the Algerian state vehicle concern. The agreement, signed in Algiers, envisages a plant with a 30,000-unit annual capacity at Tiaret in west Algeria. The project has been under discussion since 1989 but has been dogged by arguments over size, credits and most recently political uncertainties. The decision marks a significant overseas commitment by Fiat and reinforces the Italian government's aim of replacing France as Algeria's main trading partner. It is also a significant gesture of foreign investor confidence in Algeria's military-backed government. Yesterday's agreement envisages the creation of a joint company with L82bn (Pounds 37.2m) of capital, 36 per cent held by Fiat and 64 per cent by Saada. Fiat has the option to raise its stake to an eventual 49 per cent. The plant is planned to be operational within three years and in the meantime Fiat has the right to import into Algeria up to 12,000 cars a year. Part of the production - of a model based on the Fiat U - will be exported to North African and African markets. Fiat said yesterday the project was intended to be integrated into its overall car production plans. However, it has prospered thanks to some L170bn of soft credits made available to Algeria to finance the plant. The Italian government has also agreed to extend Dollars 7.2bn worth of export credit guarantees to Algeria, largely linked to the development of gas supplies. The Algerian government has undertaken to provide the infrastructure. Tiaret, on a plateau some 300km from the coast, has been regarded by some auto industry experts as a highly unsuitable greenfield site. Corruption clean-up, page 4</p>

President Itamar Franco has forbidden Radiobras [Brazilian Radio  Broadcasting Company] from retransmitting the interview. The  retransmission request was made by the justice minister himself  because, according to him, in his remarks he categorically  defended the president, even though he may have talked about the  coup.    In a brief statement, President Franco said the minister  himself is responsible for the remarks he made. Through acting  presidential press adviser Fernando Costa, the president  explained that he was informed about the interview by the  justice minister himself, and declined to comment on the  statement's content. Correa said Franco had "incentives" to  impose a coup, as done by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.    The Army's spokesman, General Gilberto Serra, said the  military is not aware of the matter and Army Minister Zenildo de  Lucena was surprised by those remarks.    Gen. Serra said: "We, the military, are democrats. We fight  for democracy, regardless of the inconveniences it might cause."    Correa had difficulties explaining his remarks. He tried to  minimize the interview's impact, saying that he only felt a  climate in society favorable to a "Fujimorization of the  country."    He added: "No one had made a proposal in this regard, but we  knew it existed. People in society felt the desire to see a  strong hand."    Correa's interview on television was clear, however. In  response to a question on the possibility of a coup if Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva was elected, he said:    "I want to say something extremely serious. President  Franco,  who has democratic training and a lofty public spirit, has gone  through one of the times of greatest turbulence in the country.  Last year, with the establishment of the CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee], low salaries, and the difficulties in  administration, there were certain incentives toward this  Fujimorization. I am certain that had the previous government  that was ousted been in power instead of President Franco, what  happened in Peru would have taken place in the country: The  president would have become a Fujimori, a dictator."    Correa immediately answered the following question: "Would  President Franco have the support of the people had he closed  Congress?"    "I think so because the people's indignation is great and  the  people want to see immediate results and corruption eliminated."</p>

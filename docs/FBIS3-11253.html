Jose Angel Talavera (El Chacal), the rebels' leader, said in  Managua next week his men, estimated at more than 200, will  continue to turn in their weapons in the Quilali region,  approximately 320 km north of Managua.    The armed group suspended the disarmament process last week,  fearing the government would not meet its commitments. Talavera  said he hopes this time the government will meet its commitment  with the demobilized, adding on previous occasions it had not.    The government offered a series of social benefits for the  contras' disarmament; nevertheless, there are constant protests  against the government's lack of fulfillment.</p>

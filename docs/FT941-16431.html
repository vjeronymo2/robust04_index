			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / FT Guide to the Week MONDAY 10 Nato tries to redefine itself Leaders of the 16 Nato countries meet for a two-day summit in Brussels. US President Bill Clinton, on his first trip to Europe since taking office in January 1993, will be attending. The US called the meeting - Nato's first summit since 1991 - to try to inject new life into the alliance. Proceedings will be dominated by a dilemma over how to handle the aspirations of central and east European countries that want to join. Keeping both them and the Russians happy looks impossible. Middle East peace talks Middle East peace talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are due to resume. Negotiations have been stalled over arrangements for the Israeli handover of Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank, which should have begun on December 13. Beirut reconstruction The share offer to capitalise Solidere, the company being created to rebuild Beirut city centre, closes today.

Wibble presents her budget Anne Wibble, (left) Sweden's finance minister, presents her budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year. After three years of deep recession, the economy is set to show modest growth. But sharply rising debt and a budget deficit of about 15 per cent of GNP have cramped policy options in the battle to reduce unemployment from 14 per cent. Burmese opposition The Karen National Union, the largest group of insurgents still fighting Burma's military government, is to tell its colleagues in the Democratic Alliance of Burma that it has decided to pursue separate peace talks. The move comes in response to mounting pressure from its traditional backer, Thailand. Britain's Milk Marketing Board Britain's Milk Marketing Board meets the government in an effort to win support for its plans to reshape itself as Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative. The Pounds 3bn milk market in England and Wales is opened to competition in April. If the government rejects the board's plans, an investigation of the milk market is likely to begin on Wednesday. TUESDAY 11 Russia's parliament meets The newly-elected Russian parliament convenes - in two places. Because the government has taken over the old parliament building for itself, the State Duma (lower chamber) will squeeze into a former Comecon skyscraper, and the Federation Council (upper chamber) will sit in the former Soviet construction ministry a few miles away. President Boris Yeltsin is expected to address both chambers separately on their first day. Election of a parliamentary speaker is an early task, which, reflecting the fractious nature of parliament, is unlikely to be easy. The parliament looks set to be dominated by anti-reform forces. EMI meeting The European Monetary Institute, the European Union's embryo central bank, holds its inaugural session in Frankfurt town hall. The Institute was set up on January 1, when stage two of the EU's progression to a single currency formally began. South African reform The Transitional Executive Council starts meeting in Pretoria for what are expected to be weekly sessions. Tunnel ticket prices Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel Tunnel, announces fares for Le Shuttle, the car passenger service which will run through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais. Tickets go on sale on Wednesday ahead of the tunnel opening on May 6. UK politics The House of Commons returns after its Christmas recess.  The Finance Bill will be published, with no substantial changes expected from the November Budget, the first to unify spending and revenue measures. Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, will be the minister mainly responsible for piloting the Bill through the Commons. Phones of the future Al Gore (left), the US vice-president, addresses communications and entertainment industry executives at a conference on information superhighways sponsored by University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He will outline the administration's telecommunications policy into the next millennium. FT Survey West Bengal. After a quarter of a century of decline, the state's industrial revival seems imminent. In Calcutta, the eastern seaport which is the natural gateway to emerging Asian nations, there is a strong campaign to revive some of the region's lost glory as India's prime industrial heartland. WEDNESDAY 12 Proposal for allaying angst The Czech capital Prague is the venue for a meeting between President Clinton and the leaders of the Visegrad group of four central European countries, Czech president Vaclav Havel (above), Polish president Lech Walesa, Hungarian president Arpad Goncz and Slovakian president Vladimir Meciar. President Clinton will be explaining Nato's plans for closer military collaboration through so-called 'partnerships for peace' that stop short of full membership. He will be trying to reassure them that the scheme will address their security fears. Clinton then flies on to Russia, where among other things the will try to assure his hosts that the planned arrangements pose no threat to them. Italian confidence vote The Italian parliament is due to debate a motion of no-confidence in the government of prime minister Carlo Ciampi (left).

Metallgesellschaft Deadline for banks to approve a DM3.2bn (Dollars 1.9bn) bail-out for the German mining, metals and engineering group.

Shevardnadze is to sign a series of agreements on industry and trade, tourism, security, customs, prevention of smuggling, drugs smuggling, culture and sports. UK economic policy Chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke and governor of the Bank of England Eddie George have first substantial discussion of monetary policy since last November's Budget. Inevitably, interest rates will feature on the agenda. The policy dilemma is whether to cut rates in anticipation of the effect of April's tax rises on consumer demand, or to wait to see how consumers react. Recent positive economic indicators has dampened speculation of a cut in the short term. UK unemployment Labour market statistics for December 1993 are expected to show the number of jobless still falling, but more slowly.  Estimates of the month's decline vary from 5,000 to 40,000, with the trend fuelled by more hiring rather than just a slowdown in firing.  Unemployment in November was 2,816,000. THURSDAY 13 Clinton confers with Yeltsin President Clinton holds talks in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. Signs are that economic reform is taking a back seat. Russia is being much more assertive abroad, especially in the former Soviet states. And Mr Clinton will need a lot of balm to soothe Russian suspicions that Nato is creeping up to its borders. A bridge too far? A bridge too far? Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt's four-party coalition will meet in an attempt to make a long-delayed decision on building a road-and-rail link to Denmark, the first fixed link between Sweden and the European mainland. Stockholm and Copenhagen signed a treaty to build the combined 18km bridge-tunnel across the Oresund strait in 1990. However, the Dollars 2.8bn project has been held up by opposition from Sweden's Centre Party. Its environmental objections are shared by many voters, according to opinion polls. Mr Bildt, anxious to avoid a coalition upset, is striving to find a compromise that will allow the project to go ahead, while keeping the Centre Party in the government. A frustrated Denmark, meanwhile, is threatening to sue if Sweden backs out. Professor Stephen Littlechild due to speak UK electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, is due to speak on power generation and electricity supply at a conference in London's Langham Hotel.

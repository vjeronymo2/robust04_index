			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: In need of perspective Sir, Dr Denis Alexander (Letters, June 25/26) lacks historical perspective. The church's persecution and censorship of Copernicus, Galileo, Servetus and Descartes, hardly adds up to a 'powerful impetus . . . to the emergence of modern science'. Just to add balance to a one-sided account, Calvin burnt Servetus when he was on the point of discovering the circulation of blood and kept him roasting alive for two hours. Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Inquisition. The Inquisition sentenced Galileo to house arrest for life and commanded him publicly to renounce Copernicanism. The 17th century is better described as the time that science liberated itself from theology. The church fought a rear-guard action right into the 19th century. Darwin delayed publication of the Origin of Species for 20 years, castigating himself as 'The Devil's Chaplain'. The humiliation of Bishop Wilberforce and the triumph of Huxley's Royal Society marked the ascendancy of a scientific world view in the eyes of British society. Over the past half a millennium, religion has retreated from the centre of an explanation of all that exists to the periphery - it is to science that one looks first.

MPs cannot not assume the enormous responsibility for the  future and the health of people in Latvia if the problem is as  important as the Skrunda issue is, Ulmanis said Jan. 26.    Latvia has evidence of new-type radiation across its  territory what could be aimed at determining movements of space  objects, Ulmanis said. In his opinion, Russia is looking for  new ways to control the airspace above Europe and Latvia.    If the guesses prove right, Latvia could possibly attain  reduction of the term for the preservation of the radar station,  the president said.    As reported, Russia wants to keep the radar for five more  years. If Latvia agrees to this condition, Russia will complete  the withdrawal of its troops by September, said Russian  delegation head Sergei Zotov.</p>

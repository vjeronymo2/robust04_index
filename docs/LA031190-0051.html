			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE  </P> <P> It was refreshing to read Mr. Crotty's commentary on environmentalism ("More  Doesn't Necessarily Mean Better," Feb. 25) because it was the first time that I  have found someone in the matrix of local politics that recognizes some of the  social complexity in this issue.  </P> <P> At the base of the problems created by environmentalism in government, in the  media and in movement and establishment environmental politics is that most  spokesmen for all of these institutions are far from knowledgeable about  ecology as a science, or in knowing what constitutes scientific facts and how  those arguments are made. That is, there are few real scientists in any of  these institutional configurations, and because of that there is no way that  there can be a real evaluation of technical or scientific information by any of  these groups of people. Mr. Crotty well knows, having worked for the EPA, that  there are very few scientists actually working for that agency, most are  bureaucrats or engineers with MBAs or law degrees and rarely do they seek out  real information. They don't have to, they are regulators, policemen enforcing  environmental laws.  </P> <P> Instead governments contract out their scientific decision making to  entrepreneurial environmental consultants. The environmental impact statements  that were demanded in the legislation of the 1970s have been a lucrative market  for pseudoscientific entrepreneurs. And nowhere in the implementation of the  legislation has there been any process to insure scientific accountability  either in the way these EIS documents are prepared or in the evaluation of the  information after government gets it.  </P> <P> William K. Reilly, director of the Environmental Protection Agency, himself is  a lawyer, not an ecologist. If you look at the boards of directors in national  environmental movements, they are top heavy with lawyers and "conservationists"  but not scientists. Added to that is the appalling state of scientific literacy  in the general public; there is no mechanism anywhere to insure that the  information being debated to set environmental priorities has been selected  with any intelligence. And clearly a lot of it has not, and I'm afraid that we  are going to see more and more of this.  </P> <P> I applaud Mr. Crotty for his contribution to the debate. I hope we can continue  to have it.  </P> <P> ELAINE R. BROOKS  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

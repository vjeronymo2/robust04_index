			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent Vyacheslav Osipov has just  reported that returning after the break to the law on financing  expenditure from the federal budget in the second quarter, the  Federation Council approved it by 103 votes. I will recall that  in the morning the upper chamber of the Russian parliament  rejected this law which had already been adopted by the State  Duma.</p>

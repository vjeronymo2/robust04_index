			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Strong-Arm Measures Will Not </F> Work"]    [Text] The U.S. imperialists have been bringing the  situation on the Korean peninsula to a more and more dangerous  phase of war under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue.  According to reports, on 17 June the U.S. Senate babbled about  someone else's southward invasion and adopted a resolution  urging President Clinton to beef up immediately the U.S. Forces  occupying South Korea. This resolution, which passed a full  session of the U.S. Senate, calls for, among other things,  sending additional U.S. troops and fighter planes to South Korea  and deploying an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in this  region. This is an attempt to deploy massive aggression forces  on the Korean peninsula and clearly discloses the U.S.  imperialists' brigandish [kangdojok], aggressive nature.    They cited someone else's southward invasion and nuclear  issue as a pretext for beefing up the forces. However, this is  sophism which cannot convince anyone.    It is a well-known fact that the North's nuclear issue, a  byproduct of the imperialists' antisocialist, anti-Republic  maneuvers, is a falsehood that was fabricated to crush [apsal]  our Republic. The same is true with threats of southward  invasion.    Southward invasion, the nuclear issue, and other things that  the U.S. imperialists are talking about are mere excuses to  justify their military buildup and aggression maneuvers.    Under such excuses, the U.S. imperialists have already  brought numerous aggression troops into South Korea and plan to  move aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation, which had  been mobilized in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, to the  waters close to the Korean peninsula to stand by right after the  exercise is over. They also plan to deploy aircraft carrier  Kitty Hawk to the waters close to our country. A foreign news  agency has disclosed that the scheduled concentration of several  aircraft carriers in one region was part of the U.S. plan to  beef up naval forces in Northeast Asia. Nevertheless, without  being satisfied with this, they plan to deploy more troops and  fighter planes and an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in  South Korea and in its neighborhood. This proves that they plan  to deliberately further aggravate the situation on the Korean  peninsula to provoke a second Korea war against us at all costs.    If this had not been true, why should the United States have  continuously deployed aggression forces in South Korea and in  its neighborhood and inspected bases of the Japanese maritime  and air Self-Defense Forces under the pretext of our so-called  nuclear issue, which could not be used as an excuse?    Even though the cold war is said to be over internationally,  the cold war has continued on the Korean peninsula because of  the U.S. imperialists.    The U.S. imperialists try to launch a surprise preemptive  strike at our Republic after deploying massive aggression forces  under the pretext of our nuclear issue. However, military  adventures, threats, and blackmailing can in no way frighten  anyone else or resolve the issue.    The United States gave rise to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, which originated from the U.S. imperialists'  hostile policy toward Korea. Therefore, the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula must be resolved through dialogue and  negotiations; it can never be resolved through forcible  pressures, threats, or blackmailing against the other side.    This is why people from all walks of life in the world  denounce the U.S. imperialists for pursuing military strong-arm  measures and strongly ask the United States to resolve the  nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations.    Just like a thief turning on the victim with a club, the  United States, which gave rise to the nuclear issue, finds fault  with us, who are under nuclear threat, and tries to beef up  aggression forces. This clearly shows it has no interest in  peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  but tries to crush [apsal] our Republic by military force.    No strong-arm measures will work on us, who consider  independence to be their life.    We have already made it clear that if the United States  chooses to take strong-arm measures, we will take a different  road.    If the United States tries to get something through military  adventures, this will be a miscalculation.    The U.S. imperialists must clearly know we are ready for  both  dialogue and war and act with discretion.</p>

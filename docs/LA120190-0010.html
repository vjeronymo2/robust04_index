			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS  </P> <P> When our troops write home from the gulf, I wonder how many letters are  addressed to Beverly Hills or Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> When we get past the cliches of gunboat diplomacy and the hypocritical bloody  shirt-waving, what we find is the old story of the sons of the poor being  ordered to put their lives on the line for the portfolios and privileges of the  sons of the rich. If ours were a draftee army, would it be there? A great  democracy can do better.  </P> <P> MARTIN CONROY  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

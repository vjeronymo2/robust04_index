			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, June 30 (AFP) -- The European Court of  Justice held that the EU [European Union] Commission had  "serious" arguments in seeking action against Greece for  blockading Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM], the Commission said on Thursday [30 June]. [passage  omitted]    Sources close to the Commission of the European Union (EU)  on  Wednesday had reported the Court as saying that it needed one to  two years to see if the Greek embargo violated EU regulations.  [passage omitted]    The Court decided that it was unable to decide whether or  not  the embargo by Greece contravened treaties of the European Union  (EU), which do not allow EU members to take such unilateral  action on trade, until it had studied the matter in detail.    But the Court held that the arguments advanced by the  Commission appeared to be "pertinent and serious," a spokesman  for the Commission said on Thursday.    "The Court believes that the unilateral measures taken by  Greece are in contradiction with community regulations  concerning the free circulation of goods and the common trade  policy," the spokesman said.    But the Court had said on Wednesday that it was rejecting  the  request that temporary measures be taken because the Commission  had not shown that serious and irreperable prejudice had been  caused, the Commission spokesman said.    However the Court had found that the Commission's legal  arguments about the fundamental issues had appeared at first  sight to be pertinent and serious.    This ruling, which had been given behind closed doors to  Greece and the Commission, did not prejudice the final decision  of the Court. [passage omitted]</p>

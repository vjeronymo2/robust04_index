			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Wharf turns in nine-month profit of HKDollars 1.21bn WHARF (Holdings), the main listed company in the empire founded by the late Hong Kong shipping tycoon, Sir Yue-kong Pao, announced profit before extraordinary items of HKDollars 1.21bn (USDollars 157m) for the nine months to December 1991. The results, which were in line with market expectations, compared with a HKDollars 1.44bn profit in the year to March 1991. The company has just altered its year-end from March to December; it said this meant the results represented an annualised increase of around 12 per cent. This would represent the 24th consecutive year of profits growth, at an average of over 27 per cent per annum. Wharf is in a transitional stage, as it builds up its property portfolio. The portfolio is expected to expand from 5.2m sq ft in 1991 to more than 13m sq ft in 1998. However, the bulk of this will not come on stream until 1993, with little profits growth anticipated in the coming year. The company announced an asset revaluation which increased its net asset value per share by 16 per cent to HKDollars 16.19. Further increases in asset value will follow the completion of its four big developments: Times Square; New Tech Centre and Gateway Towers in Hong Kong; and Lane Crawford Place, in Singapore. Times Square represents the key to increased profits in the short term, bringing 2m sq ft of property to the market in early 1993. Wharf has also expanded its hotels division through the acquisition of four hotel properties in the US. It meanwhile continues to seek opportunities in infrastructure and telecommunications. It is to submit a tender for the Western Harbour tunnel contract in the second half of 1992, while it still plans to set up a cable television network in Hong Kong. The directors recommended a final dividend of 42 cents, making a full-year payout of 56.5 cents a share, compared with 49 cents in the year to March 1991.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] On Sunday, 2 January, Hong Kong Bureau  monitored the "Today's Hotline" program, a listener call-in show  carried daily on Guangzhou Guangdong People's Radio Network in  Mandarin from 1035-1200 GMT. Reception ranged from fair to  poor. The following is a summary of the program.    1. The program opens with a brief introduction by the  program host, Wen Tao. He invites listeners to call in to  recommend topics for discussion. As a New Year token, the host  says he will dedicate a song to the first caller of the day.    2. While waiting for the first call, a song in Mandarin,  "Goodbye My Love," sung by Hong Kong-Taiwan singer Teresa Teng,  is played.    3. A Miss Pan, a hairdresser from another province who works  with a hairdresser parlor in Guangzhou, calls in to complain  about the practice by local parlor owners to retain workers by  delaying payment of salaries. She says one of her friends, also  a hairdresser, has not received her salary for the last six  months, and when she asked her employer to pay off the salary in  arrears as she was going to pay a home visit during the coming  Chinese New Year season, her employer refused to pay but tried  to persuade her to stay with the parlor during the current high  season. Miss Pan says she herself is also facing a similar case  at the moment.    4. A Mr. Zhang, a migrant laborer working in Guangzhou and  planning to pay a home visit during the Spring Festival season,  calls in to urge the traffic control authorities to pay more  attention to keeping good traffic order during the present  passenger high season. He complains that many drivers who are  eager to make more money always try to take as many passengers  as possible and drive as fast as possible, without paying the  least attention to traffic regulations.    5. A Hong Kong-style Cantonese pop song is broadcast during  a break.    6. A young man called Little Ma calls in to complain that  construction work going on in Huadu city near Guangzhou is  causing very serious air pollution. He calls for more attention  to the air pollution problem and urges construction companies  concerned to carry out their duty to minimize pollution.    7. A Miss Liu says she often comes across motorcades on  highways around Baiyun Airport and, whenever such motorcades  pass by, the police never fail to drive other road users out of  their way. She says most motorcades are convoys for  high-ranking government officials who claim to be servants of  the people. She compares these motorcades to emperors' and  senior mandarins' convoys in imperial China of the past. As  civil servants, officials should try to minimize the  inconvenience caused to the public while they are travelling,  she says.    8. A French song is broadcast before the brief newscast.    9. Newscast at 1100 GMT.    10. Commercial break.    11. The "Today's Hotline" program resumes at 1109 GMT. A  Mr. Jiao calls in to complain that the bus fare varies  tremendously, from 8 to 15 yuan, for a trip between Guangzhou  and Heshan. He wonders why the public bus company does not set  a uniform bus fare for the route.    12. A Miss Sun, who recently experienced a road accident,  calls on the police to intervene promptly in settling disputes  arising from traffic accidents.    13. Commercial break.    14. A Mr. Zhang calls in to review the results of the  Dongfeng Road traffic control program that has been implemented  for three months.    15. The program host dedicates a song sung by Hong Kong  songstar Jacky Cheung to this Mr. Zhang, who is said to be a  long supporter of the program.    16. A Mr. Duan, who is also an old friend of the program,  complains about the poor management of the town gas supply to  the civil servant residential quarters at Guangzhou Avenue. He  criticizes the town gas corporation for poor service. The host  asks him to write the radio station a letter giving details of  his complaint so that the station can refer the case to the  authorities concerned for a settlement.    17. Brief newscast at 1130 GMT.    18. Commercial break.    19. The program resumes at 1140 GMT. A Mr. Chen calls in to  inquire about the law and regulations defining the ownership of  rural land. He wonders whether the government of his home  village, Douwen village in Puning county, is authorized to  dispose of plots of land at its discretion, and he charges the  village government with abusing power.    20. A Miss Zhang complains that the Shuqian Road branch of  the Industrial and Commercial Bank often refuses to render a  money exchange service, which she said is a legitimate function  of the bank.    21. A love song sung in Mandarin.    22. A Miss Chen who is a philatelist complains about the  Guangzhou Philately Company. She says she has a philately  stored value card which entitles her to the privilege of buying  newly released stamps. However, when she and many other  philatelists went to Guangzhou Philately Company to buy the Art  of Zheng Banqiao memorial stamp series that was released in  October, the company refused to sell the stamps to them.  Meanwhile, she found out that these stamps are available at  philately stalls in town, for quadruple the original price.  Miss Chen asks the philately company to respond to her  complaint.    23. A Miss Lu who works for a Taiwan company's Guangzhou  office says she went to the Liuhua district post office on 12  November to remit a sum of 5,000 yuan to Hubei. The remittee  had not received the money by 26 November, so she asked the post  office to refund her money. She had still not received a refund  two weeks later, so she visited the post office again on 13  December. Again she found her case was not properly attended  to. She is getting impatient and she asks for a prompt reply  from the post office.    24. Lobo's "How Can I Tell Her I Love You" is heard before  the end of the program.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Trial row may cost Pounds 500,000 A POTENTIAL saving to the taxpayer of up to Pounds 500,000 in the costs of the West Wiltshire Information Systems fraud trial could be lost because of a dispute between the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Legal Aid Board. The dispute is over who should pay for the hire of a computerised note-taking system which Judge Peter Fallon, the trial judge, believes could reduce the trial by up to five weeks. The trial, which is due to start in Bristol next month, is expected to last between four and six months. Mr Gerald Garland, former chief executive of West Wiltshire District Council, and six other former council officials are charged with conspiracy to defraud after West Wiltshire Information Systems, the company they set up in 1989 to run the council's privatised computer systems division, went into liquidation in July 1990. The council received no cash for the business, which was independently valued at between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m. The cost of hiring the Livenote computerised note-taking system, which allows a transcript of evidence to be relayed almost immediately to the judge and lawyers via laptop computers, is estimated at Pounds 5,000 a week. Judge Fallon, who has been experimenting with the use of Livenote for two years, believes that in long trials it can save up to a day per week. This is achieved by cutting the time it takes to find and use documents in court and by avoiding the need for multiple copying of documents. The average cost of the trial is estimated at between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 100,000 a week. Ms Judith Brown, a defence lawyer of Bristol solicitors Lawrence Tucketts, believes that as all seven men are legally aided the Legal Aid Board should pay at least part of the cost of the system. The board says the use of such a system would not be of specific benefit to the defendants, only to the administration of justice generally, and therefore the Lord Chancellor's Department should pay. Neither the department nor the board disputes that savings could be made but the department says the cost should be shared by those who would benefit from any savings. The board would benefit from a reduction in fees paid to barristers and solicitors, and it should therefore be prepared to pay part of the cost. The department said it was prepared to look at any application for it to pay its share. Ms Brown said defence lawyers were dismayed by the apparent reluctance to make a saving of up to Pounds 500,000.</p>

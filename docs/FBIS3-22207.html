			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vasyutin, deputy head of the Tula </F> Oblast administration, conducted by Igor Filimonov: ``Experiment  on the Scale of the Country'']    [Text] An interdepartmental organizational and  coordinating council on the environment has been established.  Behind the unwieldy name lies an environmental experiment that  has been conducted in Tula Oblast. It was approved by the  Russian government, which decided to back it up with the  participation of various ministries and committees. The council  is supposed to unite their efforts. Rarely has such a  broad-scale program of change come from a region, rather than  from the central government. That is why Sergey Vasyutin, deputy  head of the Tula Oblast administration, has been made head of  the interdepartmental council. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent  got in touch with him by phone.    Filimonov: Why was it in your oblast that it was  decided to conduct the experiment?    Vasyutin: Tula Oblast has the most highly stressed  environmental situation in Russia. The level of pollution by  industrial waste is high. Seventeen percent of the drinking  water does not meet health standards. The consequences of the  Chernobyl accident are having a strong impact. Just 14 percent  of the children lack health abnormalities. But there is a  powerful research base in the oblast for studying the impact of  environmental pollution on human health. A unique set of methods  for monitoring the human environment and a system for the early  diagnosis of diseases have been developed by Oleg Martynov, a  professor at Tula University. Moreover, our administration was  stubbornly persistent and got approval at the highest level for  a program for improvement of condition of the environment. More  than 3,000 proposals have already been received from scientists  and entire research institutes. The interdepartmental council  (and it includes the Russian Academy of Sciences Vice-President  Frolov; Academy of Medical Sciences President Pokrovskiy;  Danilov-Danilyan, the minister of the environment; and Sokolov,  chief physician of the Sanitation and Epidemiological  Inspectorate) will develop a normative and legal basis for  carrying out environmental reforms in Russia.    Filimonov: I know that not everything went  smoothly with the program, especially with its financing. Do you  think that such powerful support will help break down any  fortresses?    Vasyutin: We spent 18 months trying to get  approval for the program in the ministries. But even when there  are directives by Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin ordering the money to  be appropriated, lower-level bureaucrats easily rescind them. At  the last moment, thanks to Danilov-Danilyan, I managed to return  the program to the list of federal financing. The Ministry of  Finance had written it off as lacking promise. References to the  country's leaders have not helped. The clerks simply brush them  aside: ``We have a lot of such instructions. We've gotten used  to them.''    Filimonov: Environmental protection is often  associated with emergencies, but for some reason there is no  representative on the council of the Ministry for Emergency  Situations. Why is this?    Vasyutin: We have relations that have already been  set up. The methods proposed by Martynov not only presuppose an  automatic tracking of any increase in the level of pollution,  but make it possible to predict emergency situations. An  automated monitoring system has already been put into operation  at Yasnaya Polyana. The only instructional-methods center in the  country for training environmental-protection specialists has  been established on the basis of the civil defense system. We  are planning to create a special curriculum for schoolchildren  called ``Island of Survival'' in which we will prepare students  for action under emergency conditions.    Filimonov: The council, by bringing together the  representatives of several ministries and committees, is  seemingly going planning to break down departmental barriers and  attract scientist-practitioners from all branches of science.    Vasyutin: That is our dream, We will enlist  scientists only on a contractual basis and will reject the use  of huge institutes that require immense amounts of money to  support their administrators. A doctor of sciences working for  us will receive not 50,000 rubles, as one does at the present  time, but several times that amount. Money from the sale to the  West of our technological developments for the processing of  waste will also belong to the developers.    Filimonov: Sale to the West? But we have already  gotten used to the idea that our technologies are the most  unadvanced.    Vasyutin: It is simply that no one has heard about  a lot of them. In Germany our specialists demonstrated  calculations pertaining to the development of a unit for  extracting gasoline and diesel fuel from waste rubber. Western  scientists were convinced that such a thing was not even  theoretically possible. But the Platonov pilot unit is operating  in Tula. If we are able to implement the environmental program,  Russia will be able to get the opportunity to assume an equal  footing with the other countries of Europe and America.</p>

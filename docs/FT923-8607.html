			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Russian capitalists inherit social mantle cast off by the state: Signs of a growing private sector culture NOTHING could have been more bourgeois. A rugby match on a fine evening, with a little clump of spectators in a rather dilapidated ground. Bourgeois is what it was meant to be. The match's main spectator was Mr Vadim Polovnikov, president of the local team - Rostov-on-Don 'Enpils'  - and managing director of the Enpils chemical company. Round him was much of the private sector of Rostov-on-Don: representatives of the new class which is now reaching for some status and security in a society still dominated by the state. Rugby, the middle-class ball game of the west, is being used to help in that quest. Mr Polovnikov's company, an amalgamation of factories making paints, chemicals, medicines and building materials, went private last year by making over the shares to the managers and the workers. By becoming the first major private company in this southern Russian river port, Enpils and Mr Polovnikov are at the centre of a slowly growing web of private sector alliances. He is also president of the Union of Businessmen and Leaseholders. The vice-president, Mr Vladimir Nikolsky, has founded some half dozen private companies with help from Enpils. Many of the businessmen at the rugby match have founded businesses which supply services to Enpils. These men are together a great deal: their circle has the air of a slightly embattled yet modernising group establishing new customs. Some have recently been to the US, all for the first time. Their conversation already bears traces of a new in-group with their own concerns. They are discriminated against in prices - the state companies pricing down in supplies to each other, pricing up to the private sector. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank chairman, last week proposed that credit be advanced to the bankrupt state sector at 10 per cent, 'and we would still pay 80 per cent or more,' snorts Mr Polovnikov. They have protectors: the Rostov regional soviet is pro-business. Mr Vladimir Emilianov, the first deputy head of the administration, says that 'we want to develop private companies: as the state structure fails, we want the private sector to grow and take its place'. But money is lacking; the state sector is huge; there are few competent managers or bureaucrats; the fear of social unrest is deep. It is precisely the unease over the social position of the new businesses which impel them in a direction quite different from the 'classic' western model. Though Enpils has decentralised its various plants into separate profit centres, it is taking on a range of social responsibilities. It is building flats for its workers, is managing kindergartens, has a school, is building a swimming pool, has donated substantial sums to the impoverished local hospital. The Soviet-era big companies traditionally did much of this  -a fact which makes it even harder to declare them bankrupt. But Mr Polovnikov is doing more than his state colleagues, not less. He is the town's major sponsor. He funds the rugby club; the youth theatre and the International Children's Theatre Festival. He funds a new choir and is putting money into the reconstruction of the cathedral's bell tower. He wants people to see that private enterprise can sustain them and their culture as well as the state, with the result that he now has a whole range of dependents, all of whom laud him loudly. His circle is a little like a court - quite usual in Russian business. The growth of 'business' - the English word is used as asynonym for capitalism - coincides with the progressive collapse of the state, both as a controlling medium and as a social protector. To give themselves legitimacy, the new businessmen are taking upon themselves a mantle which the state is shedding. They are also reaching back into history for legitimation and in Rostov, that means back to the Cossacks, the descendants of originally outlawed frontiersmen who, on the Don and the Volga, established settled communities of farmers who continued a military tradition. Mr Nikolsky, a vigorous man in his early sixties, was last year received into the Rostov Cossack district. The Cossacks are also an object of Mr Polovnikov's charity: their weekly paper carries on its masthead the name of the company or companies sponsoring that edition. Since they were private farmers, they now push for the privatisation of land; and since the new capitalists must find a tradition before the Soviet one in which to wrap themselves, they take them up. Mr Vladimir Popov, the elected attaman of the Rostov Cossacks, is at the rugby match, too: when he mentions that he cannot attend a grand meeting of attamans in Moscow because of the expense, Mr Nikolsky assures him the expenses will be taken care of, and he should go. Mr Polovnikov's team, perhaps drawing on a Cossack tradition of anti-Muscovite revolt, has beaten the visiting Moscow Spartak by 79-3. As they move towards their cars, the Rostov capitalists could almost be the executive committee of a Rotary Club after an outing. So they would like to become. 'Normal businessmen,' as they say of themselves. But not yet, for all the show they are still precarious, still at the frontier.</p>

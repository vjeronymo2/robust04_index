			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilt deals in danger - A privatised postal service could end them Cheap dealing in gilts for personal investors could be under threat in the privatisation of the postal brokerage service now run by National Savings. Thirty companies had applied by the August 5 deadline to take part in the tender, including Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster and Sharelink. Seven will be asked to bid in October in competition with National Savings' in-house team. As the table shows, the National Savings postal dealing service now has both the lowest minimum charge and the lowest commission on deals worth up to about Pounds 12,000. In the year to April, National Savings handled 80,366 postal gilts transactions, worth Pounds 378m, with purchases averaging Pounds 4,751 in value and sales Pounds 4,627. During the bout of enthusiasm for gilts brought on by falling interest rates in 1992/1993, it did 133,800 postal deals worth Pounds 534m. The cost to investors does not appear, however, to have been a prime consideration for officials at the Department for National Savings who are in charge of the tender, at least in the initial stages. Nigel Bartram, Sharelink's marketing director, said National Savings had approached his company some months before the tender was advertised, asking if it would be interested in bidding. 'We had a request for a certain amount of information, none of which bears on cost,' he said. The focus had been on quality of service, performance measurement, and volumes and types of business. Bartram said it was too early for Sharelink to judge if the gilts business would be worth a bid if the company got on to the final list but the charging structure looked unattractive. 'The charges levied by the National Savings stock register are very significantly below those that obtain anywhere else,' he said. 'If anybody is investing from time to time in gilts, that is the most cost-effective way. But if you want real-time prices and instant dealing, you go to a broker.' Bartram added that the pricing of the National Savings gilts service was based on promoting the sale of government debt rather than ensuring the service provider could cover costs and make a margin. Sharelink, mainly a telephone-based share-dealing service, handles about Pounds 1.4bn worth of equities a year but only between Pounds 700,000 and Pounds 1m a year in gilts deals. The firm says this reflects the low level of private investor activity in the sector. Although other potential bidders declined to comment in detail, they may well share Bartram's sentiment: 'We would not be interested in running a service at a loss on behalf of the government.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What it costs to buy or sell gilts  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Value of sale or purchase (Pounds) Institution                    Min com      2,500     5,000     10,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Natnl Savings Stock Reg*       1 (buy)        10        20         40 Barclays (branch**)              25           25     37.50         75 Lloyds Bank                   18.50        18.50        25         50 NatWest Bank                     25           25     37.50         50 Sharelink                        20        37.50     56.25      61.25 Fidelity                         25           25        50         50 Midland                          20           25        50      62.50  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Value of sale or purchase (Pounds)                                 20,000      50,000      100,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Natnl Savings Stock Reg*           80        200          400 Barclays (branch**)            112.50     157.50       232.50 Lloyds Bank                       100        150          200 NatWest Bank                       75     112.50          175 Sharelink                       71.25     101.25       251.25 Fidelity                           50        100          100 Midland                         78.75     116.25          150  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows commission (including minimum commission) on the sale or purchase of gilts. *National Savings has a daily limit on dealings of Pounds 25,000 per stock; minimum sale commission is 10p. **Commission by telephone to Barclays is Pounds 15 (min) and Pounds 18.75 on Pounds 2,500.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

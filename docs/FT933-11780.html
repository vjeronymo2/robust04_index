			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / SIB probes Goldman Sachs deal: Maxwell shares transaction may be subject to British regulation THE SECURITIES and Investments Board has launched an inquiry into a transaction between Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, and one of the pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body which oversees Goldman Sachs' UK operations, has already examined the transaction and did not consider disciplinary action because the transaction had been booked through Goldman Sachs in New York, and was therefore outside the jurisdiction of UK regulators. Instead, the authority passed information to the US Securities Exchange Commission. But in a letter to the Commons social security committee, released yesterday, SIB said it had 'come across a point which it does believe merits further UK inquiry'. It is believed that SIB has learned that the transaction was cleared and settled in London, which could make it subject to UK regulatory rules. If SIB decides UK regulators do have jurisdiction over the transaction and Goldman Sachs is found to have breached UK securities rules, SIB could order it to pay Pounds 56m to two pension schemes. It could also levy a fine. In June Goldman Sachs was fined Pounds 160,000 for three breaches of rules in connection with transactions between it and the Maxwell interests. The inquiry relates to a transfer in April 1991 of 12.5m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation from the MCC Works Pension Scheme to two Swiss trusts established by Robert Maxwell. Goldman Sachs acted as agent in the transfer on the orders of Mr Kevin Maxwell. He ordered payment for the shares to go not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a company which acted for the Maxwell family private interests. Responding to SIB's letter, Goldman Sachs said: 'As we understand it, the SIB is examining a specific jurisdictional point. We have fully responded to their inquiry of today. As has been true in the case of other regulatory authorities which have examined these trades, we would expect to respond appropriately to any further inquiries the SIB may make.' While SIB's letter refers to the MCC works scheme, the transaction was part of a larger deal in which shares were purchased from the Mirror Group Newspaper pension scheme and the proceeds were also directed to Bishopsgate.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO BECOME A SELLER AT ORANGE COUNTY FARMERS' MARKETS  </P> <P> When Eileen and Mark LaMorte began raising house plants and nursery stock in  Anaheim 15 years ago, their greenhouses were surrounded by small, family-owned  farms and chicken ranches. They sold their plants once a week at an open-air  market conducted by local growers who harvested their produce at sunrise and  sold it directly to consumers from the back of their truck.  </P> <P> Now the LaMortes' greenhouses are surrounded by industrial buildings, and they  are among the last Orange County-based sellers at the local farmers' markets.  Those selling next to them are mostly from Riverside and San Diego counties or  the San Joaquin Valley, where there is still land available on which to grow  crops.  </P> <P> But Mona Amoon, a co-manager of the state-sponsored Farmer's Market in  Fullerton, knows that plenty of people in Orange County are back-yard farmers  who set aside a portion of their precious land for an herb garden, vegetable  patch or a couple of fruit trees. She hopes the "back-yard people," as she  calls them, will join the ranks of sellers at the market and help it retain its  neighborhood bazaar atmosphere.  </P> <P> Each week, several hundred buyers line up to choose from the market's selection  of home-grown fruits, vegetables, honey, eggs, nuts, flowers, herbs, house  plants and even fresh fish. So if you have just a single fruit tree or a row of  tomato vines, you can call yourself a farmer, sell your goods at the market,  make some extra money and meet your neighbors too. But first, you must become  certified.  </P> <P> Here's how it's done:  </P> <P> * Get an application form from the Orange County Agricultural Commission. The  completed form will list your name, address, type of commodity grown and the  amount of space devoted to production.  </P> <P> * Make an appointment with an Agricultural Commission inspector, who will visit  your home to verify the crop is grown at the site listed on the form. A  certificate will be issued, and you can then sell your goods at any of the  farmers' markets that the California Department of Food and Agriculture has  established throughout the state. But there's one potential problem: If you  live in an area that has been quarantined to control the Mediterranean fruit  fly, you may not be able to sell your produce until the ban has been lifted.  </P> <P> There are two farmers' markets in Orange County: one in Fullerton and the other  in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Sellers do not rent space at the markets, but are charged a percentage of their  daily gross sales. The amount charged varies at each of the markets. Contact  the individual market managers listed below for further information or call the  CDFA Direct Marketing Program at 1-800-952-5272.  </P> <P> * Orange County Agricultural Commission: 1010 S. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim (714)  447-7100.  </P> <P> * Fullerton Farmer's Market: Woodcrest Park, 450 W.

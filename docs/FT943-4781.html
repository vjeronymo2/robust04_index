			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Quality is the key to a more upbeat tempo: German piano makers In the heart of east Berlin the sounds of students practising their scales in the Hans Eisler music school are relished by Mr Karl Schulze, manager of Bechstein, one of Germany's oldest piano manufacturers based in nearby Moritzplatz. 'The number of students now learning the piano at the music schools in Germany has increased from 100,000 in 1991 to over 140,000. People are rediscovering the piano again. This is good news for Bechstein,' he said. A year ago Bechstein was holding talks with lquidators. Its losses had exceeded DM1.5m (Pounds 622,000) and the banks were unwilling to extend fresh credit. There were even fears that Zimmermann, the east German piano maker which Bechstein had purchased, wuld to the wall as well. 'I wanted to save Bechstein, revive its reputation and make the marriage with Zimmermann work. So I decided one of the ways to raise cash and get out of debt was to sell 6,500 sq m of our land here near Checkpoint Charlie to the Berlin Senate for DM30m,' said Mr Schulze. His restructuring also cut the workforce and he went to the Czech Republic to obtain parts for his pianos. 'By working with the Czechs, I reckon my labour costs have been reduced by 20 per cent. Our order books are full until the middle of 1995,' said Mr Schulze. If all goes well combined turnover this year will total DM28m and Mr Schulze expects a profit of about DM1.5m. Bechstein's turnround from virtual collapse has been keenly watched by Germany's other long-established piano makers. All of them - Bluthner in Leipzig, Schimmel in Braunschweig and Steinway in Hamburg - were hit by the downturn, yet most agree that they are emerging from the recession much quicker than they had expected. This is despite a fall in total, worldwide piano sales from a peak of 1.1m in the mid-1980s to about 600,000 in the early 1990s as well as competition from Japan and cheaper models, particularly from China and eastern Europe. 'We went through a bad patch during the recession,' said Mr Wilhelm Nikolaus Schimmel, whose family company was founded in 1885 and today has a 11 per cent share of the German market. 'In the mid-1980s, we had an annual turnover of DM65m, two-thirds earned from exports. But sales fell to about DM47m in the early 1990s, and we were making heavy losses. We had to restructure. 'Three years ago, we employed about 520 people. Today, we have 260 people on our books. But we made one major decision. We were not going to compromise our quality. I think this has paid off.' Germany's piano manufacturers unanimously agree that their industry would not have recovered had it gone downmarket. 'The competition from south-east Asia has been really tough,' said Mr Schimmel. 'Japan is our major competitor. But we had to respond by continuing to provide high quality and design. This is what we trade on. This has what has underpinned Germany's piano tradition. If you change that you undermine your own reputation.' Mr Ingbert Bluthner-Haessler, manager of Bluthner, who was catapulted into the market economy after being subsidised by the east German state for more than four decades, said the recession made the industry more aware of marketing. 'We had to hit home the message that we are producing quality,' he said. This year, Bluthner, which exports 50 per cent of its 400 uprights and grands, expects to lift its turnover 10 per cent to DM5m which will allow it to enter the black. Despite the revival in piano-playing, not everyone can afford a Bluthner upright, which costs between DM16,000 and DM23,000, or a Steinway, whose grand pianos start at DM61,900. Mr Roger Willson, managing director of the UK-based Whelpdale, Maxwell and Codd, the piano manufacturers and the sole importer of Bluthner, said: 'The recession had the effect of changing the habits of our customers. Parents either bought a cheap Chinese piano - if you call Pounds 1,200 cheap - or opted for the second-hand market for quality pianos in which demand has increased sharply.' Over the past year, Mr Willson has noticed that people are returning to the quality piano market again. 'I reckon worldwide sales will increase by about 4 per cent this year.' Steinway, which occupies the top end of the market, is surprised at the pace of recovery. 'The recession forced us to cut back. And music schools had their budgets reduced - so they were not buying pianos. But we did not expect to come out of the recession so fast,' said Ms Barbara Ascherfeld, Steinway's spokeswoman. About half of Steinway's production turnover of 1,200 units (1,000 grands and 200 uprights) is earmarked for music conservatories and the rest for individuals. About 30 per cent of its grand pianos are exported to Japan. Steinway recently made a special contract with its trade union so that its employees can work longer hours to meet demand. Mr Schimmel and his colleagues believe the German piano industry and the west European market is finally stabilising. 'But,' warned Mr Schimmel, 'the lesson we learned from the recession is that you cannot make short-cuts with quality.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------- German piano market  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Number of pianos                       1992             1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Production                        Upright       20,054           22,532                        Grand          3,410            4,732  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Total         23,464           27,264  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Exports  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Upright       11,133           16,629                        Grand          2,253            3,129  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Total         13,386           19,258  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Domestic sales  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Upright        8,921            5,903                        Grand          1,157            1,603  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Total         10,078            7,506  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Imports  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Upright       15,950           17,023                        Grand          2,182            1,785  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Total         18,132           18,808  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Total domestic sales  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Upright       24,871           22,926                        Grand          3,339            3,388  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Total         28,210           26,314  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Statistisches Bundesamt  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

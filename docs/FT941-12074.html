			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sinclair buys Zeneca peat bog business William Sinclair Holdings, a supplier of a range of products to the gardening and horticulture markets, has acquired Zeneca's compost business for Pounds 2.76m. Net assets involved are Pounds 2.4m. Turnover for the business for the year ended December 31 1993 is estimated at Pounds 3.7m with profits before tax and interest of Pounds 436,000. The purchase will add about 1,850 acres of peat bogs to Sinclair's peat reserves. Included in the deal is a modern compost production plant near Carlise. This should enable Sinclair to process certain products in their range near to the raw material production source. Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of William Sinclair, said the acquisition was strategically important for the company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--The Higher Military Court this  morning held a hearing on the case of the attempt to assassinate  the interior minister. Seventeen defendants, including two  still at large, face charges in the case. The presiding judge  read out the list of charges in the case. All the defendants  pleaded not guilty.    Muhammad Rashad 'Abd-al-Hamid Hijazi, the first defendant  named, told the court that the confessions he made in connection  with the case were extracted from him under torture. Hisham  Na'im al-Husayni, the sixth defendant, admitted to the court  that he possessed a pistol, as stated in the prosecution's  indictment. His lawyer said that the pistol belongs to  al-Husayni's cousin, who left it in the defendant's care when he  went abroad.    The court examined 17 exhibits provided by the prosecution,  including forged ID's and birth certificates, cassette tapes,  and weapons.    Six of these exhibits presented to the court pertained to  'Adil Siyam, a terrorist killed in a police ambush in al-Munib.  These included personal and family ID's and passports, some of  which are Yemeni; they carry Siyam's photo but are in a variety  of names.</p>

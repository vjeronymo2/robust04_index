			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed and selective view of Northern Ireland (2) Sir, Enoch Powell is certainly not naive. Therefore in writing that 'the beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind of everything conjured up by the term sectarian', he is being more than selective with the truth. The mind would have to be cleared of memories of 15 years of his presence in South Down Orange Halls, and of the fact that the Orange Order, vehicle of a sectarian ideology. was specifically represented on the Ulster Unionist Council, the governing body of Mr Powell's party. That Order publicly defines its loyalty to the Crown in terms of a 'Protestant Succession'. Much of the pain of the last century is a direct consequence of another English politician 'playing the Orange card'. Now if the mind-clearing exercise is to promote a non-sectarian solution in Ireland, it would be more than welcome; but to suggest it in order to consolidate the status quo is less than candid.

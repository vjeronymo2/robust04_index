			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Museum honours a jazz genius - Christina Lamb visits a new exhibition celebrating the life and work of Duke Ellington The dragon-like piano teacher, whose insistence on endless scales kills off any early attraction to music, is a familiar image to many people. It is easy to visualise the young Duke Ellington as a small, baseball-besotted, Afro-American boy writhing on the piano stool as he was forced to practise by the wonderfully named Mrs Marietta Clinkscales. Fortunately, Ellington's interest was revived in pool bars around his home town of Washington, DC; and during a summer job at the Poodle Dog Cafe he was soon filling in when the pianist arrived too inebriated to play. Ellington's 'Soda Fountain Rag', composed in 1913 at the age of 14 from bits of songs he knew and set to the rhythms of the soda pullers, was the start of a long and prolific career. Known as Duke for his aristocratic bearing, Edward Kennedy Ellington turned out more than 1,500 compositions including popular songs, instrumentals, theatrical works, film scores and sacred pieces, most written while criss-crossing the US on tours. His standards include such much-recorded numbers as 'Sophisticated Lady', 'Satin Doll' and 'It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)', although perhaps his most enduringly famous single recording was 'Creole Love Call', made in 1927 with singer Adelaide Hall who died in London only last year aged 92. Ellington began his career at a time when sound recordings were in their infancy and jazz was denounced in the press as 'ruining young girls'. But he broke new ground constantly and his work has become the first of any jazz artist to inspire the kind of serious study usually reserved for classical composers. He is the subject of a new course at Harvard University, two new books* and a major exhibition, Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington, in the Museum of the City of New York**, on the fringe of Harlem, which will tour US cities until 1996. The exhibition is based on 200,000 pages of documents and scores as well as photos, concert programmes and other memorabilia saved by Ellington's son, Mercer, and acquired by the Smithsonian Institute in 1988. There are interactive video monitors where, by touching players on screen, you can call up individual band members like Johnny Hodges, 'Tricky' Sam Nanton or Cootie Williams, follow their careers, listen to their solos, and see how each contributed to the Ellington sound. Accompanied by Ellington's music, you can see the small Wurlitzer organ on which he composed while on the road; the Medal of Freedom awarded by President Nixon; the cross he always wore; programmes from the Cotton Club and Carnegie Hall; and his first record sleeves. Murals and life-size cut-out figures evoke scenes from his life - from his youth in Washington, DC, as the pampered only son of a butler, to leading The Serenaders in dance halls while painting signs by day. Just as with the 'Soda Fountain Rag', Ellington always fashioned music out of what he heard and saw, whether it was dancing at the Cotton Club or simply people walking in the street. But the characteristic Ellington sound really began to take shape in New York in 1923 with the arrival of trumpeter Bubber Miley, whose use of mutes created a growling effect, which transformed the band's sweet, melodic dance music style to one that the critics dubbed 'jungle jazz'. In spite of his natty dress and natural charm, Ellington found it difficult to break into the hotly competitive Manhattan club scene. His big break came in 1927 when he was hired at Harlem's Cotton Club. Through its nightly radio broadcasts, the Ellington orchestra soon became famous nationwide. Although a talented pianist, the band was his real instrument and he attracted many great musicians. Many of his compositions were written specifically to highlight the strengths of his players. The band was noted for its fresh, improvised sound, yet this was the result of constant work. Typically, Ellington would have an idea that the musicians would try out and suggest changes. Then, he would go away and re-work it. By the 1940s, Ellington's influence was everywhere. Yet, while his music was loved by white society, colour prejudice meant that he and his players could not eat in many US restaurants or get rooms in hotels  - a problem they solved by renting a railway carriage for their constant tours. The late 1940s and 1950s were difficult times but Ellington kept going despite the decline of big bands, the closure of dance halls and the advent of television. By 1955, though, the orchestra was reduced to accompanying ice-skaters at Flushing Meadow. Just as the music world was writing him off, he made a stunning comeback at the Newport jazz festival in 1956, where his 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue', written 20 years earlier, had the audience stomping in the aisles. Duke at Newport became his best-selling album, he made the cover of Time magazine and clinched a new contract with Columbia Records. The 1960s were glorious years, culminating in 1969 with a celebration of his 70th birthday at the Nixon White House. In 1974, Ellington succumbed to lung cancer - but he composed until the end from his hospital bed. Once asked where his ideas came from, he said: 'Oh man. I got a million dreams. That's all I do is dream all the time.' He could, however, never have dreamt that he would, one day, be rated worthy of academic study at a top university and a national exhibition. *Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington, by John Hasse (Simon &amp; Schuster); The Duke Ellington Reader, by Mark Tucker (Oxford). **The Museum of the City of New York is on Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street.</p>

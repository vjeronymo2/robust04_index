			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper highly volatile - Market Report COPPER fluctuated wildly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, reaching Dollars 2,520 a tonne at one stage before closing Dollars 5 down from Friday at Dollars 2,476.50. There was a Dollars 5 a tonne premium for metal for immediate delivery compared with three-month aluminium at the close and that backwardation (premium) reached a notional Dollars 50 at one point. Traders said the bulk of the activity reflected 'third Wednesday' pricing and trading, and covering against nearby option commitments. Big cash purchases defended the Dollars 2,500 level in the morning before heavy Far Eastern selling and fund liquidation established the lower trend, they said. ALUMINIUM prices reached a new four-year high of Dollars 1,720 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,715.50, up Dollars 7.75. Compiled from Reuters</p>

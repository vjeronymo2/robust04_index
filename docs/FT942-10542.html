			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Confident of adding some pep - The rationale for Pepkor's interest in Brown &amp; Jackson Pepkor believes the strategy which has built it into South Africa's largest retailer will help it turn round Brown &amp; Jackson, the troubled British retailer which it is seeking to control. 'We've felt for a long time that our 'Pep retail formula' would be applicable anywhere in the world with a large, low-income mass market,' says Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman. 'We have a lot of experience in running a large number of relatively small retail outlets over a wide geographical area with a highly simplified and effective distribution system that we think will be applicable to the UK market,' notes Mr Wiese. Building off its domestic base, Pepkor has been focusing on overseas expansion for several years, and by the end of last year its Scottish chain, Your More Store, had grown to 45 outlets. Operations have been relatively successful to date, with 13 new stores opening in the first half of financial 1994 and another three in the second. Despite the costs of the expansion programme, the group has managed to break even and states that most of its stores are profitable. However, Pepkor's management has long had its eye on expanding into England, especially the north, with a declared long-term target for a 200-store chain. The acquisition of Brown &amp; Jackson, with its 230-store Poundstretcher chain, would more than satisfy that goal and turn Pepkor into the biggest player in this sector of the British retail market. Turning Poundstretcher around will be a tall order, but Mr Wiese and his team are confident they can do the job. And although there is some concern over whether the company has sufficient management breadth to digest these acquisitions without diluting management for its domestic questions, the company is sure this will not happen. 'We have sufficient management depth to help Poundstretcher return to profitability without any problems for our southern African operations,' says Mr Wiese. Pepkor, which is Africa's largest retailer with annual sales for R8.24bn, (Pounds 1.13bn) has been a star stock over the past five years, posting annual earnings per share gains averaging nearly 20 per cent despite a four-year recession in its home market. It owns 1,700 stores and has 40,000 employees throughout southern Africa. It focuses on mass-market retailing in food, clothing and business materials industries, and has some manufacturing of semi-durable goods related to its own activities. The group's main division is Pep stores, with more than 1,100 outlets. It is a mass market retail group that primarily targets the country's black consumer base. In this area of down-market retailing the company's long-term performance has been spectacular, and no other South African company has been able to match it. And although its most recent year was a difficult one, as operating profit declined 8 per cent due to a combination of low consumer activity and destabilisation in the black townships in the run-up to the elections, this is expected to improve significantly over the next year. Through much of the 1970s and 1980s Pepkor was regarded as something of a backwoods group, reflecting its origins as an Afrikaaner dominated company concentrating on small towns. But over the past few years it has catapulted over some of its blue-chip competitors with a string of acquisitions. In addition to taking over Cashbuild, the building materials company, and Smart Centre, the clothing group, it has also bought Shoprite/Checkers, the supermarket chain, and managed largely to turn around the ailing company. Its manufacturing operations have long worked at full capacity, and profit growth has been dependent largely on productivity increases, which the company has consistently achieved. It is this kind of management attention and marketing skill that will be transferred to Poundstretcher if the deal goes ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said Friday the country should complete National  Assembly deliberation of the Uruguay Round agreement this year  since the United States and other major nations are taking  domestic steps to effectuate the accord next Jan. 1.    While briefing Democratic Liberal Party Chairman Kim  Chong-pil on the government's position on ratification at Kim's  office, Han said the accord's passage this year at the National  Assembly was needed to help the government stand firm in the  trade diplomacy arena and improve the export environment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rolf Schwarze and Heike Wiegand, professional </F> journalists, Eschwege, under the rubric "Research and  Technology": "Medicine/Ambitious Esprit Project: Nerves Made of  Silicon. Artificial Limbs Will Be Controlled by Nerve Impulses";  first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] Wednesday, 10 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Scientists at  Centro Nacional de Microelectronica (CNM) in Barcelona are  working on the development of a new chip that, implanted in the  human body, can receive nerve impulses and forward them to  various parts of the body. Nerves destroyed (in an accident)  could be replaced by them in the future. Artificial arms and  legs could be controlled by nerve impulses for the first time by  means of this chip.    The idea for this originated already around two and a half  years ago. But the man-machine communication had to be feasible,  they realized at the CNM laboratory. An ambitious research  project that the European Community is generously subsidizing  within the Esprit program has sprung from the idea in the  meantime. Together with five other laboratories in Germany,  Italy and Switzerland, CNM's scientists are working on the  development of a new microchip that could open up new pathways  for medicine.    However, Centro Nacional de Microelectronica is taking the  main share of the "Intelligent Neuronal Interface" project. "We  are still at the very beginning," Rosa Villa, who as a physician  is watching over the CNM project, says, curbing overhasty  expectations. The goal is the development of a chip that,  implanted between the split nerve ends, is to act as a  communication bridge between the nervous system and outside  information processing system.    A prototype has already been designed in the meantime: a  silicon chip one square millimeter small that is like a  miniature sieve. The microperforation was achieved by neutron  bombardment, explains Jordi Aguil&oacute;, head of CNM's design  department. "The only effective method by which the chip's  circuits are not damaged."    The development of a biocompatible material for the chip  case  has been likewise difficult. But this problem has also been  solved by now. The chip's biocompatibility has by now been  tested with success in experiments on animals, Rosa Villa  attests. The chip was implanted in rats. The next phase of the  research can begin. The nerve chip is to act as the receiver of  rat-nerve signals that are interpreted by a computer. Additional  findings for further development of the chip are hoped from this.    Similarly to TV relay stations that amplify the signals for  reception at more distant points, the chip already permits  signal transmission from the brain to nerve intersection points.  Rosa Villa explains the future capabilities that follow from  this: "The chip could replace destroyed nerves and be used in  order to control artificial limbs."    If the latter sounds improbable, it is not in the opinion of  the CNM researchers. After all, it is theoretically possible to  decode signals from the brain at severed nerves, Jordi  Aguil&oacute; explains. "Thus it must also be possible to forward  these brain signals through the chip to an artificial arm or  leg."    Rosa Villa: Unlike conventional pacemakers that can only  transmit commands, the chip will be interactive. "A miniature  electronic brain that is compatible with the human nervous  system can receive neural signals, process them and transmit  them to various parts of the body or to artificial limbs."    There is still a way to go before this point. "This is a  long-range research project whose end cannot be foreseen yet  today." Rosa Villa also knows that it will be a few years before  this chip can be implanted in the first patient. "It will not be  feasible before the year 2000."</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> New York's Times Square is coming alive with new hotels, but few as inexpensive  as Ian Schrager's refurbished Paramount on West 46th Street. This is the  theater district, and who can argue with the prices: 40% of the Paramount's 610  rooms cost $100 or less. (Doubles up to $170.)  </P> <P> Schrager spent a bundle spiffing up this old (circa 1927) hotel. Writer William  Norwich called the Paramount a "high-tech inn for the hip un-rich." No  argument. It's chic. Guest rooms are described as whimsical, but you'd best  like white and checker-board-patterned carpets. Even the beds are white. French  designer Philippe Starck used blowups of Vermeer's 17th-Century "Lacemaker" for  headboards. Starck did French President Mitterrand's bedroom at the Elysee  Palace, so who's to argue?  </P> <P> Baths feature conical-shaped wash basins with live red roses. Other flowers are  strewn throughout the hotel. Schrager weeps. Says his floral bill figures to  run $250,000 a year. Still, business is rosy. Open only a few weeks, the  Paramount is boasting 90% occupancy.  </P> <P> Staffers in the lobby dress tuxedo-casual with T-shirts, substituting for  formal shirts. Schrager describes the lobby as resembling "a big living room --  a stage" where guests seated on the mezzanine study other guests in the lobby.  </P> <P> In breaking with tradition, Schrager installed a playroom for youngsters. This  along with a $1 movie theater with popcorn and penny candy. Coming up next: a  supper club in Billy Rose's old Diamond Horseshoe nightclub. Says Schrager: "We  give our guests dreams. We give them magic." His hero? Walt Disney.  </P> <P> The Paramount, 235 West 46th St., New York 10036.

Four hundred rooms  ($145/$205, single/double). The Empire is frequented by artists performing at  Lincoln Center. CDs/VCRs in all rooms. Theater packages offered seasonally  featuring the Metropolitan Opera, the Philharmonic, the New York City Ballet,  etc. Free privileges for guests at a nearby health club.

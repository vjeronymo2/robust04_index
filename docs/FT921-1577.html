			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lead for Labour in marginals LABOUR appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats in Wales and pulling in front of the Conservatives in several marginal seats, Anthony Moreton writes. According to an NOP poll conducted for the television company HTV at the weekend, Labour may take Delyn from the Conservatives and consolidate its tenuous hold on Clwyd South West. In the south it was doing well in Cardiff Central and Pembroke and looked likely to hold its by-election gains in Monmouth and the Vale of Glamorgan. The survey offers some comfort to the Conservatives because it indicates that the party is increasing its support in seats where there is a three-way split with Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists.</p>

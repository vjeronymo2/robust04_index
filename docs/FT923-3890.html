			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Private investors wary of former Soviet republics PRIVATE investment in the republics of the former Soviet Union is likely to remain slow for some time, according to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank arm that specialises in private sector financing. Sir William Ryrie, IFC executive vice-president, said yesterday that private sector money had begun to flow into countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary in eastern Europe, but that investment in the former Soviet Union was likely to take longer to pick up. 'It's going to take a little while before private investors are going to commit serious money,' he warned. The IFC last year won agreement from its members for a Dollars 1bn capital increase over the next five years to help it expand its activities in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. The latter, however, have not yet completed the membership process, and the IFC's role has so far been limited mostly to advice and technical assistance. 'What we are looking for is opportunities to do something which will really be catalytic,' Sir William said, citing the successful privatisation of more than 2,000 shops and small businesses in Nizhny-Novgorod as a good example. Building on this experience, the IFC is now undertaking the privatisation of the entire trucking business in the Nizhny-Novgorod province, and has written a manual on small-scale privatisation to be used elsewhere in Russia. Overall, the IFC boosted its financing of private sector projects in the developing world by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.77bn (Pounds 880m) and Sir William said he expected to maintain this rate of growth - somewhat faster than projected at the time the Dollars 1bn capital increase was agreed - over the next few years. By attracting co-financing from other investors and lenders, the IFC was able to help raise nearly Dollars 6 for every Dollars 1 it invested in the 167 projects it took part in during the financial year ending June 30. Sir William said his group had managed to maintain profitability, despite problems with its Dollars 408m of investment in the former Yugoslavia and some deterioration in its African portfolio. Net profits climbed by 9 per cent to Dollars 180.2m, but the IFC had to boost its reserves against loss substantially, making a new provision of Dollars 101m and writing off Dollars 26.8m of investments.</p>

			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TSB fails to agree terms over estate agency chain AN ATTEMPT by TSB Group to establish a company with National &amp; Provincial Building Society to buy and manage its chain of 133 estate agencies has fallen through after the two organisations failed to agree a price for the network. TSB Group and National &amp; Provincial announced yesterday that 'differences of opinion on the value of the businesses' had led to the heads of agreement signed in April being terminated after negotiations revealed differences. TSB is thought to have asked for about Pounds 10m for the estate agency chain, which it hoped would eventually be sold to local managers as groups of businesses. It said it did not think the price offered would have given value to shareholders. Mr Alastair Lyons, National &amp; Provincial's finance director, said the two sides had been 'unable to come to a meeting of minds' as to the value of the estate agents after the society had approach the bank with the proposal. TSB said it intended to continue to manage the chain, which made a Pounds 6m loss last year. The bank hopes that it would return to operating break-even this year as the number of transactions in the housing market rises. Mr Lyons said the society would press on with its strategy of trying to acquire minority stakes in local chains of estate agents in order to be able to sell products through them. It had hoped the TSB purchase would follow this pattern. TSB has been trying to sell businesses that it does not think contribute to its core retail banking franchise.</p>

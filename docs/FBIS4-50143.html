			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Taipei] </F>   [Text] Lien Chan, president of Taiwan's Executive Yuan,  revealed on 13 May that Taiwan does not discard the possibility  of improving relations with North Korea.    While making a speech at the National Assembly on 13 May,  Lien Chan said: "Taiwan is gradually developing practical  relations with the ROK, but this does not mean that it will  discard the possibility of development of diplomatic relations  with North Korea." He added: "There is no reason for Taiwan to  avoid the establishment of official channels for dialogue with  North Korea."    Currently, Taiwan has established diplomatic relations with  29 countries. If it improves relations with North Korea, it  would be a breakthrough in settling the North Korean economic  crisis. It seems that it will also bring about a setback in  restoring economic relations between ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan  severed diplomatic relations with the ROK in August 1992 when  the ROK established diplomatic relations with China. In  November 1993, the ROK and Taiwan established missions in each  other's countries. Nevertheless, Taiwan is continuing to  maintain tense practices with the ROK, such as continuing import  restrictions on ROK products, including automobiles.    Right after severing diplomatic relations with the ROK,  Taiwan sought to improve relations with North Korea as part of a  retaliation against the ROK, but has retained its `North Korean  card' because it had decided at that time that it does not have  great practical benefits.</p>

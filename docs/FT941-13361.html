			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Rail link groups face pressure to act quickly Private-sector companies interested in financing and building the Pounds 2.6bn Channel tunnel rail link will be expected to declare their interest in the next few weeks in spite of many question marks over the project. Although it is expected to take the government at least two years to get legislation authorising the line through parliament, negotiations will start at an early stage on the form that private-sector involvement will take. Several construction companies have declared an interest and at least two consortia involved in earlier stages of the 68-mile rail link remain in existence. Further groups are expected to emerge in the next few months. Mr Peter Brittell of Sir Alexander Gibb, consultants to the project, said the government would try to avoid the lengthy delays and cost overruns which marked the construction of the Channel tunnel by seeking a consortium with a balance of construction, banking and other interests. Several construction companies, including Tarmac and John Laing, are assessing the possibility of bidding. Laing said it was still keen to carry out the work as part of a consortium. In the early stages of the rail-link project it joined the Rail-Europe consortium with a group of banks, engineering consultants and construction companies, though it is not clear whether the same consortium would bid this time. Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar House, BICC and GEC, has also expressed an interest. 'But there is a lot of detail which we still have to look at to see precisely what they mean,' a spokesman said. Ove Arup, an engineering consultancy involved in drawing up plans for the route, said it intended to join one of the consortia being established. Hochtief, a German contractor, is thought to be leading one consortium, while UK consultants expect that Japanese and other continental European groups may also be interested. As well as work on the line there are sizeable contracts to be won to build the stations. The St Pancras terminus is expected to cost about Pounds 500m and will form part of the main contract. Blue Circle Industries, working with several local authorities, has put forward plans for commercial development at Ebbsfleet, near Gravesend, while a consortium including P&amp;O, Tarmac, Land Securities, John Mowlem and Newham council has made proposals for a station at Stratford. The government has decided to bring the private sector into the project before putting legislation through parliament - against the advice of Union Railway, which carried out preparatory work on the rail link - to allow the private sector to influence the shape of the project at an early stage. This does not, however, mean that it will have to spend money before it is sure that parliament - in particular Tory MPs with irate constituents affected by blight along the route - will approve the project. Mr Brittell said bidders would expect the government to indemnify them against the political risk of parliament not approving the project. To increase the attractiveness of the project to the private sector, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has decided to give the winning bidder the revenues from the train services. European Passenger Services, which will run the trains on behalf of three national railways, expects to start a limited service in May, increasing capacity through the summer as more trains and carriages are delivered.</p>

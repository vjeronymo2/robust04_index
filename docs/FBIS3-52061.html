The office, led  by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, indicates that the various  resolutions issued by this parallel office cannot in any way  contribute to the solution to the crisis. The office advises the  concerned parties that any act emerging from those sessions,  which are considered illegal, can compromise the parliamentary  institution.    The Senate office invites the 18 January elected to regain  their self-control, to respect their identities, and to let the  senators' assembly work on the burning issues of the moment.</p>

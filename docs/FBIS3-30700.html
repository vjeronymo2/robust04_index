The guests spoke about the  stage of the negotiations conducted in search of a solution to  the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adrian Nastase reiterated  Romania's viewpoints on this issue. The speaker of the Chamber  of Deputies underlined that Romania had scrupulously observed  the UN embargo on Yugoslavia, and mentioned the direct and  indirect losses the embargo had caused to the Romanian economy,  totalling seven million U.S. dollars. The very huge negative  effects of such a situation may make Romania and other countries  find it impossible to observe such international measures in the  future, added he. In reply, Lord Owen said that he was sure  that a mechanism had to be put in place by which losses caused  by the enforcement of international sanctions automatically  trigger compensations. The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies  said that Romania was appreciative of the efforts made by the  negotiators in search of a viable, peaceful solution to the  crisis in former Yugoslavia. He added that Romania was ready to  be host to a number of activities related to the negotiations.    The meeting at the Chamber of Deputies had the aspect of  consultations on Romania's stance regarding the solutions  proposed for the crisis in its proximity.</p>

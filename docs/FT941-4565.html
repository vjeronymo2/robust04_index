			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Boom times for Canada brokers The Canadian brokerage industry earned record operating profits of CDollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.2bn) in 1993 on revenues of CDollars 5.5bn. The final profit after bonuses was CDollars 726m for a 37 per cent return on equity, or twice the level of 1992. The eight biggest firms, mostly owned by the big banks, took 65 per cent of total revenues, down from 69 per cent in 1992, said the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. Booming stock markets were the driving force in 1993. Trading commissions nearly doubled to CDollars 2.36bn and underwriting revenues also nearly doubled to CDollars 1.29bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANGRY STEFFI MAY LEAVE GERMANY  </P> <P> Reigning Wimbledon tennis champion Steffi Graf says she is considering moving  to the United States and boycotting events in West Germany because of lurid  newspaper headlines linking her father to a topless model.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry to have to say this, but I hate these people," the No. 1-ranked  women's tennis player was quoted as saying in the latest edition of the West  German news magazine Stern.  </P> <P> "I will never stop hating these people who want to destroy my family just to  boost the circulation of their newspapers," Graf added.  </P> <P> West German tabloid newspapers have splashed stories of her father Peter, 52,  and nude model Nicole Meissner, 22, over their front pages, complete with  eye-catching photographs of the unclad woman.  </P> <P> In the Stern interview, Graf attributed her losses in the French and German  Open tournaments to anxiety over the stories.  </P> <P> "I don't want to give up tennis . . . but I might go to America and temporarily  not play in Germany if the newspapers hurt me and my family again in the future  with their headlines," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the </F> Labor party caucus by Yo'el Nir in Jerusalem on 2 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Nir] Before his session with the Labor caucus,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told reporters that he does not  give a damn about the opposition. They do not have to come up  with answers, therefore they engage in demagoguery, Rabin said.    In the meeting, however, Rabin indirectly addressed himself  to the charges against his policy made also by members of his  own party. He used very stern language against them and was  very determined when he spoke about what can be called the  ideology behind his policy, even if some charge that his policy  does not have an ideology. We do not want to rule another  nation, he said. I want a Palestinian entity which is less than  a state, but separate from us. We pay with blood for our ruling  over another nation which does not want our rule.    [Rabin] I want a separate Palestinian entity to be set up.  I do not want them inside the State of Israel. Our rule over  another nation has corrupted us. Look at our economy and its  dependence on them. We must for once take a risk for a change  in order to free ourselves from this.    [Nir] Our great victory in the War of Independence was the  establishment of a single-nation state. Annexing the  territories would mean a binational state. The problem,  however, is not the territories. Had the territories been empty  of people, I would have no argument with anyone regarding  greater Israel, Rabin said. Answering a question by Avigdor  Qahalani regarding the Jewish settlement in the territories,  mainly in the Jordan Rift Valley and on the Golan, Rabin said:    [Rabin] The settlements are today of marginal security  value. The problem is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The only  one which provides Israel with security is the IDF. I am  furious today because I have to employ a standing paratroop  regiment in the heart of Hebron, to protect 415 Jews, instead of  using it in the war against terrorism. I have troops pinned  down in the protection of settlements today instead of having  them fighting terror.    [Nir] Regarding Syria, Rabin said that today it is the only  strategic threat against Israel, though a moderate one. Peace  with Syria is essential, Rabin said, but not at any price.    [Rabin] Let me ask you: I know that some day I will not be  prime minister; I know what political stalemate can breed. I  would not like to see in the future a strategic axis of  Damascus, Baghdad, and Tehran -- not in two years, but perhaps  in five or seven years. I am not saying that stalemate  immediately means war, but I know what stalemate does breed.    [Nir] The prime minister reiterated the motto of this  evening's address: The price of ruling over a foreign nation.    [Rabin] What can we do? Peace cannot be forced on anyone.  One can decide: I want to stay here as an occupying ruler. I  am telling you, the price we pay with blood is the result of our  control over a foreign nation. The time has come for this to be  said. If the public wants to control another nation, it must be  told that we will pay with blood for this. It is not a matter  of this or another government; it is a question of policy. I am  telling you: The IDF is being stretched to its limits, mainly  the regular army, and is making efforts to protect both the  population in the territories and the Green Line. This is the  Army's responsibility. I gave the order to fortify the Green  Line at the expense of other missions in order to prevent the  recurrence of incidents in 'Afula and Hadera. Elon More [West  Bank settlement] does not protect 'Afula; the IDF, the Shin Bet,  the police do. This must be stated once and for all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Assembly  President Momcilo Krajisnik said on Wednesday that Bosnian Serbs  would leave the doors open to talks, but not with U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, and others who have  abused their position.    "We are particulary angry at Mr. Rose because we believe  that  he played an emperor and called the NATO pact without any cause.  Why didn't he call NATO when Moslem shelled Serb positions on  Tuesday," Krajisnik told Belgrade's television network Politika.    "In any case, Mr. Rose has ended his role in our battlefield  and he must be removed from these regions," Krajisnik said.    NATO-assigned U.S. warplanes on Sunday and Monday bombed  Serb  positions around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde after Serbs  crushed a Moslem offensive begun from this U.N.-protected area  in late March.    Gen. Rose requested the NATO air strikes allegedly to  protect  the U.N. peace troops in Gorazde, although there were only five  U.N. observers and seven British special SAS troops there, who  guided the NATO planes to Serb positions.    The Bosnian Serb authorities suspended relations with the  UNPROFOR, including the civilian sector, after the first NATO  air strike on Sunday, assessing that the U.N. peace troops had  openly sided with Bosnian Moslems.    Krajisnik also said that the Serb side was doing its best to  answer the NATO attacks.    "When the NATO pact bombs us that is one evil, but it is a  double evil if we attack NATO and if we answer (its attacks),"  Krajisnik said, assessing that the bombing had brought harm to  the Serb people, but that its effects had remained inside the  borders within which it pays to be patient in the interest of  peace.    "If we openly started resisting the NATO pact, downing their  planes, and this will probably follow if they try to continue  attacks on Serb positions, then there will be neither peace nor  delimitation and many plans would fail that way," Krajisnik  said.</p>

The Palestine Liberation Organization representative to  Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, earlier disclosed that 'Arafat had turned  down a chance to see Peres here on Monday on the grounds that  Israel was delaying agreement on a final autonomy deal.    He said the PLO leader would hold talks with Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak on Tuesday.    In Tunis a PLO source told AFP that 'Arafat would travel to  Cairo on Tuesday and would meet Peres "in the event that there  is progress in the Israeli position."    He said the PLO was sending a delegation here on Monday  headed by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, a member of the organization's  executive committee, to meet Peres in another bid to overcome  obstacles blocking application of a September agreement between  the PLO and Israel.    The accord offered limited self-rule to Palestinians on the  Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.  But its implementation, scheduled to start with the withdrawal  of Israeli troops on December 13, has been repeatedly delayed by  disagreements over security issues.    In the latest attempt to iron out differences, 'Abd-Rabbuh  will be accompanied by Faysal al-Husayni, a prominent  Palestinian figure from the territories, Ahmad Quray', head of  the PLO economic wing, and Nabil Sha'th, leader of the PLO  negotiating team on security questions.    In another development, Ahmad al-Tibi, a senior aide to  'Arafat, predicted Sunday in Jerusalem after discussions with  Peres that a comprehensive autonomy accord would be signed in  Cairo this week.    "I can say an overall agreement will be signed this week in  Cairo ... [ellipsis as received] Mr. Peres is committed to  meeting with Mr. 'Arafat," al-Tibi declared, describing Peres as  "sincere and serious in trying to accomplish an agreement very  soon."    A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  meanwhile refused to confirm that Peres would be in Cairo on  Monday, saying: "We will issue a statement in due time."    But Gad Ben Ari also said Rabin had told the Israeli cabinet  he was still "interested" in having the Peres-'Arafat meeting  "take place as planned."    The goal of the meeting would be to "agree on how to pursue  the negotiations with the PLO in order to end them as soon as  possible," Ben Ari said without promising that a final accord  would be reached in Cairo.    The Cairo negotiations between Peres and the PLO team will  focus on a list of points drawn up in the Swiss resort of Davos  where Peres and 'Arafat met on January 29-30, Kamal told  reporters after talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa.    Both sides emerged optimistic from the Davos encounter.    But while 'Arafat said he would be ready to sign a final  deal  in Cairo this week, Rabin said it needed three or four more  weeks and the Israeli army raised its own reservations.    "The security issues are the most important, but they are  not  the only ones," Rabin warned on Wednesday. "We will also have to  agree on civilian and economic issues."    The key stumbling-blocks remain the control of border  crossings with Egypt and Jordan into the new autonomous areas  and measures for protecting Jewish settlements in Gaza.    But according to Israeli press reports, the two sides agreed  in Davos on the amount of land around Jericho to be granted  self-rule.    A PLO statement on Sunday appealed to the United States and  Russia, co-sponsors of a Middle East peace initiative launched  in 1991, to "pressure" Israel into "rapidly" withdrawing its  troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    The communique, drafted by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO  political department, charged that the behavior of Israeli  authorities "clearly shows that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is  trying to avoid a withdrawal of Israeli forces under the  inadmissible pretext of security, which bears no relation to  reality."</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> PARK PROJECTS APPROVED  </P> <P> City officials are helping residents in an effort to reclaim Philadelphia Park.  </P> <P> On Monday night, the City Council approved the installation of new playground  equipment and construction of a concrete sidewalk and curbing. The action is  expected to discourage gang activity and drug dealing at the park, adjacent to  Philadelphia Elementary School on Philadelphia Street near Towne Avenue.  </P> <P> The council's decision to spend about $53,000 to fix up the park followed  meetings with a neighborhood organization, the Philadelphia Community Outreach  Group, which was concerned about loud noises, broken beer bottles and recurring  graffiti, said Doug Bridges, Pomona's director of parks and recreation. In the  past, residents who attempted to remove graffiti have been threatened by gang  members, Bridges said.  </P> <P> Beautifying the park "is a concerted effort of citizens saying, 'we've had  enough,' and the city seeing what it can do," Bridges said. "Hopefully, with  the new facilities we can turn the situation around."  </P> <P> The city also will sponsor recreational activities, including soccer games and  arts and crafts sales, in the hopes of discouraging trouble makers at the park,  he said. Similar programs are being considered at Kellogg Park and Lincoln  Park. Bridges said new play equipment installed last year has brought more  families to Kennedy Park near Ganesha High School.  </P></p>

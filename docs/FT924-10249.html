			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A lack of leadership THESE ARE worrying times. The German economy is sliding into what one of the members of the Bundesbank council has said could be 'a very long-lasting and very deep' recession. Japan's economic recovery is more a hope than a fact, while that of the UK is more of a prayer than a hope. The US recovery, feeble though it is by postwar standards, seems to offer what chance of early recovery exists. Avoiding recessions altogether is impossible. Avoiding recessions that last for years is both possible and necessary. Years of disappointment have already been experienced in the US and the UK. Now the rest of Europe and even, it appears, Japan are threatened by a similar fate. The European economy would decline with Germany's, while Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has warned of the prolonged adjustment needed to remedy the balance sheet deterioration that occurred during the 1980s in the US, Japan, the UK and several other industrial countries. Unfortunately, there are both political and intellectual obstacles to effective action, the central fact being the extraordinary weakness of the governments of every leading industrial countries. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party is paralysed by factional infighting. Implementation of the government's Y10,300bn (Pounds 53bn) fiscal package could be adversely affected, while any Gatt package that includes liberalisation of the rice market would be no less imperilled. Meanwhile, Germany's government has demonstrated yet again its disagreement over how to pay for unification. Arguing that 'the hour of truth is here', Mr Helmut Kohl admitted at the annual congress of his Christian Democratic Union that tax increases might be needed after 1995, only to be contradicted by his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel. Longest recession The French government is so fearful of the outcome of next spring's parliamentary elections that it is prepared to render the future of France, the European Community and the world economy hostage to the fate of its grain barons. In Italy, Mr Giuliano Amato's fragile government has made fiscal progress. But it still seems likely to do no more than halt the deterioration in Italy's fiscal position. By Italy's standards, the UK's problems look small. They are not. It is not merely that the UK is suffering the longest recession since the Great Depression, nor that the exit from recession seems to be as far away as ever. It is that the whole system of British government is under a cloud. North America is not immune. Canada has failed once more to resolve its constitutional problems. There is even talk of dissolution, while in the US talk is rather of the deep economic and social problems that the two leading candidates, Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, have done little to address. It is, in short, only by the standards of the losers in the cold war that the western world looks healthy. Much depends on the US. But it is difficult to feel much optimism, whatever the outcome of the election. Profoundly destabilising It would be wrong to exaggerate the need for global leadership. What is needed, first and foremost, is enlightened domestic policy in the major countries. Attempts to drive global monetary policy by the aim of exchange rate stabilisation, at least without equivalent co-ordination of fiscal policy, have been profoundly destabilising. What has made the life of the monetary authorities so difficult is persistent errors in fiscal policy. Within a globally integrated capital market, large fiscal deficits tend to seem costless, at least until governments find themselves looking into the abyss of uncreditworthiness. The International Monetary Fund is right, therefore, to warn of the consequences of failure to achieve reductions in fiscal deficits in the medium term. It is right, but doomed to be ineffective. Deficit cutting seems politically suicidal during recessions and unnecessary during periods of expansion. During a recession, it is not merely politically convenient to run larger fiscal deficits; it is intellectually respectable. Many advisers are driven to recommend the politically implausible combination of a fiscal boost in the short run with fiscal consolidation in the medium term. Partly because of the weakness of governments, partly because of genuine intellectual disagreements over the role of fiscal policy, no major co-ordinated effort to reignite global growth can be expected. Nor is much to be expected even within Europe, given the stalemate into which German politics has fallen over fiscal policy. What politicians must avoid above all is committing major new errors. The most important danger now is a tit-for-tat trade conflict between the US and the EC over oilseeds, which may start as soon as November 4, the day after the US elections. It takes strength to avoid succumbing to temptations. At the moment, western governments do not seem purposive enough even for that.</p>

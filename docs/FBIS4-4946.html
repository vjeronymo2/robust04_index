			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean  ambassador here, asserting "threat of nuclear arms development  by South Korea and Japan is becoming a reality," said Wednesday  his country will determine whether to develop nuclear weapons  depending on the extent of the effect such a threat would have  on their sovereignty.    Ambassador Cha Pong-chu said in an exclusive interview with  the YONHAP News Agency that at the moment North Korea has no  plan to develop nuclear arms.    "We hope to resolve the nuclear question through dialogue,"  Cha said. "To this end, a third-round North Korea-U.S. meeting  should be held at an early date to discuss the issue."    He claimed that Japan's intent of getting nuclearly armed is  an openly-known thing. "Japan will rise up (militarily) again  under all circumstances," he said.    Cha said even if North Korea develops nuclear arms, they  would not be directed against other part of the Korean peninsula  where he said the same brethren live or against the United  States across the Pacific.    "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed  to contain Japan," he said.    The ambassador said North Korea's official position toward  the issue of nuclear development is that "we have neither the  intent nor the ability of developing nculear weapons."    In particualr, he said, North Korea has no expertise to  develop nuclear weapons.    Cha said North Korea will not attack South Korea first.  "But, if we were attacked, we will not sit idly by," he said,  adding that if a war recurs, there will be no winner or loser.  "We all will have no choice but to die," he said.    He further said North Korea has already gone through all  IAEA  inspections, the outcome of which he said showed there is no  nuclear suspicion.    "IAEA's demand for additional inspection notwithstanding is  an undue pressure stemming from a scheme of the United States to  eliminate us," the North Korean ambassador said.</p>

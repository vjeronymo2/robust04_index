			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Housing Scheme Becomes `Political Football' -- Johannesburg  THE CITIZEN in English on 2 March in its page-6 editorial  comments on Housing Minister Louis Shill's announcement of a 90  billion rand housing plan, saying "it is a shame that a vast  housing scheme for the low-income group should be turned into a  political football, to be kicked around by the ANC [African  National Congress] and its associates." It is also "a disgrace"  that the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) should not only  call for the schemes's suspension but summon a minister before  it to explain his actions. "But then the TEC has gone far beyond  the State President's original intention that it should have  advisory and not executive powers. It intends to run the  country ahead of the election and it refuses to allow the  government to take decisions without its consent, even on such  matters as a housing scheme which brings great benefits to  poorer people. It is not that Mr Shill has jumped the gun, but  that the ANC and its allies are pointing the gun at Mr Shill and  the government."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting Breaks Talks Deadlock -- Referring  to the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting, Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 3 March in a page-14 editorial states that "whether  it had been broken, breached or merely dented, something had  happened to the deadlock." "Emotionally, we have a new lease on  the hope of peace. The outlines of a compromise are discernible.  The ANC and the Government should now, while feelings are warm  and spirits high, drop their insistence on so much overriding  central power. The Freedom Alliance should forgo its insistence  on the restoration of the pre-colonial Zulu monarchy and the  establishment of an ethnically exclusive Afrikaner volkstaat  [homeland]."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Buthelezi Changes Negotiating Style -- It is "premature and  wishful thinking" to believe that the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting  represents a breaking of the talks deadlock, says a page-8  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 March.  Buthelezi changed his "negotiating style" and "instead of  responding to Mandela's approach with the usual, gruff `this  proposal is fatally flawed', was `all smiles'." An explanation  for Buthelezi's new approach is that faced with pressures,  Buthelezi and Inkatha decided on the new approach "because they  needed extra breathing space to avoid a poll they are likely to  lose. The process of international mediation could also help  them regain some moral high ground."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Intimidation Campaign Against De Klerk -- An editorial on  page 10 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 25 February says:  "Intimidation is an evil which cannot be easily erased during  the current election campaign. It is clear that no political  party can be declared entirely innocent, but nevertheless a  certain pattern is beginning to take form." "What emerges is  that President F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the National Party,  has all too often been on the receiving end from ANC supporters.  In contrast, ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela is able to address  his followers relatively unhindered. Mr. Tony Leon of the  Democratic Party was this week able to move through Alexander  township peacefully, as was Minister Roelf Meyer through Soweto.  Examples of the campaign against President de Klerk were  evident during his visits to the various regions...reaching a  low point...when he was struck by an object thrown at him, and  at Kimberley...where a meeting had to be cancelled for his  safety. It is clearly no coincidence that these attacks follow  bitter personal criticsm of President de Klerk by Mr. Mandela."    Homeland Sets Time Bomb Ticking -- In his "Political Beeld"  column on the same page Willie Kuhn warns: "Even among those who  ought to know better, a dangerous oh-well-why-not approach has  emerged -- give the right wing their homeland, so there can be  peace in the land." "Therein lies the danger -- that half-baked  plans will be accepted in order to achieve temporary peace; but  this will set a time bomb ticking." He adds: "What happened at  Newcastle this week is an indication of the explosive force  which can be triggered by homeland claims. The right wing says  Newcastle belongs to it, the Zulus consider it as part of the  Zulu kingdom, the ANC supporters believe it is part of South  Africa -- and the Indians are probably wondering how they are  going to be Pakistanized. Even in Standerton the right wing and  the ANC are fighting for possession." "A homeland cannot be  established through emotional force," as this "would simply  repeat and multiply the mistakes of the past. Sober reasoning  is needed, rather than irresponsible surrender." "There must be  thousands of right wingers who realize that a homeland cannot be  simply wished into being. The blacks in the so-called homeland  towns will not simply evaporate; nor will they accept sudden  alien status in their own country." "These right wingers cannot  close their eyes to the creation of a tragedy in South Africa."    ID Document Fraud Causes Concern -- An editorial on page 8  of  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 February says: "The  alleged fraud involving the issuing of identity documents to  young Zimbabweans entering northern Transvaal legally or  illegally is reason for great concern. Should the allegations  prove to be true, it could mean that thousands of Zimbabweans  will be able to vote in the April election. Apart from the fact  that this would be illegal, the implications of such voting are  enormous. Such foreigners could even play a decisive role in  the election in the north of the country. Part of the problem  appears to be that Shangaan-and Venda- speaking blacks live on  both sides of the South African-Zimbabwean border. As a result  of a lack of jobs, and sometimes food, in Zimbabwe, many of  these people enter the northern Transvaal and they can be  mistaken for, and registered as, South African citizens." "We  hope that the Department of Home Affairs and the electoral  commission will investigate these allegations urgently and get  hold of the offenders."</p>

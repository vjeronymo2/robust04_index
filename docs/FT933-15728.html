			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Precious metals were sharply higher on the London bullion market as aggressive US fund activity followed Middle East speculative buying in the morning to push GOLD, SILVER and PLATINUM to fresh highs. Gold was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 391.65 a troy ounce, a fresh high since the outbreak of the Gulf War, against a morning setting of Dollars 388. Silver built on overnight and early gains to reach Dollars 5.07 a troy ounce at its fix, a 35-month high. Platinum jumped over Dollars 10 from morning levels to fix in the afternoon at a 27-month high of Dollars 404.25 a troy ounce after Dollars 393.50 earlier. The speculative buying began with silver during the overnight Far East session and then spilled over into gold and platinum. 'There were some extremely large orders being put around,' one dealer said. Despite bouts of profit-taking in New York, aggressive fund buying of gold, silver and platinum maintained early highs. London dealers said the gold market would now be looking for a strong close in New York as a sign that Dollars 400 is on the cards. 'We'll see it some time this week, but we'll probably get a minor pull-back first,' said a New York dealer. Compiled from Reuters</p>

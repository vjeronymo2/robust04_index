			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / California retreats on taxation THE CALIFORNIAN senate has agreed on changes to the state's controversial system of corporate taxation and so may have helped to head off a transatlantic tax war. The state senate's committee on revenue and taxation has approved a bill that would deal with three of the main complaints by foreign companies against the way Californian corporate taxes are assessed. The bill does not go as far as the British government has demanded. The UK wants the state to eliminate the worldwide unitary assessment, by which companies may be taxed on a proportion of the income they earn throughout the world, rather than only on income earned in California. State officials hope, even so, that the present legislation will be enough to head off retaliation which the British government has threatened to impose against Californian companies operating in the UK from January 1 next. The UK has been embroiled with California over unitary taxation for years, because of a decade-old lawsuit about the issue between Barclays Bank, the British clearing bank, and the California Franchise Tax Board, which collects the tax. The US Supreme Court is expected to decide this year whether to hear the suit. The Clinton administration has been unwilling to provoke a tax war with the UK and perhaps the European Community, but also unwilling to abandon the almost bankrupt state of California, which stands to lose as much as Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) on the Barclays case and associated suits. Californian politicians warned that the new bill - now generally expected to win approval by the full state legislature and be ready for signature by Governor Pete Wilson by mid-September - goes as far can realistically be expected. 'The 1993 tax law of California will not contain a single thing that the British government could object to, except for the very existence of worldwide unitary taxation as an option for those companies that want it,' said Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the tax board, who has been prominent in seeking a way out of the California-UK impasse. But British opponents of unitary taxation said the measure still did not satisfy their concerns. 'It's fine as far as it goes but it doesn't go far enough,' said Mr Peter Welch, chairman of the Unitary Tax Campaign, a consortium of British companies opposing the Californian system. California had already gone some way, in the 1980s, to meet objections to the unitary system. Companies may now choose, instead of a unitary assessment, to be taxed on a 'water's edge' basis, including only their activities in the US. The bill agreed by the revenue committee would remove three irritants which remained: a fee charged to those who choose the water's edge system, which brings the state about Dollars 45m a year; some complicated paperwork imposed only on companies choosing water's edge; and the tax board's right to override the choice of water's edge (a right it has never used). The UK, however, had sought to have the unitary system eliminated and the water's edge system made mandatory.</p>

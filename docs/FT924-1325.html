			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring lifts Devenish A RESTRUCTURING and expansion of its pub estate helped JA Devenish, the West Country-based pub operator, overcome a disappointing holiday season in Cornwall to increase its operating profits from pubs to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 16.5m). Devenish withdrew from wholesaling and brands at the time of the failed bid from Boddington last year and used the Pounds 25m proceeds to buy an extra 45 pubs. After leasing 115 pubs from Whitbread for eight years it increased its estate from 376 to 532 houses. Earlier in the year it bought 28 Roast Inns and Henry's Cafe Bars from Whitbread for Pounds 16.9m. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 33m. Devenish believes its operating profits from pubs would have been Pounds 700,000 greater if had not been for the disappointing summer in Cornwall, where a third of its estate is based. Profits from property disposals fell from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 763,000. Devenish's 30 per cent stake in the wholesaling businesses sold to Freetraders was responsible for increasing its share of profits from associated undertakings to Pounds 478,000 (Pounds 208,000). Extra provisions of Pounds 1.4m put aside at the time of the sale were not needed and therefore gave rise, after defence and aborted disposal costs, to an extraordinary credit of Pounds 446,000 compared to a Pounds 5.14m charge. Borrowings increased from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 34.5m, giving gearing of 24.6 per cent. COMMENT Devenish's decision to refocus its business and concentrate on pubs produced a satisfactory result in a difficult year. It would be hard, even for its potential adversary Boddington, to fault the strategy - not least because it argued for it last year when it made its failed bid. Investors will have to decide whether to take the more charitable view, that the present management can build on its performance, or the more cynical, which suggests that it has produced a one-off improvement in the face of another possible bid. Whichever view they take the shares look good value. Either the concentration on pubs will continue to boost profits or Boddington will make another bid. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.5m, excluding property disposals, the shares - which rose 5p to 259p - are on a prospective multiple of 13.5, a slight premium to the sector average.</p>

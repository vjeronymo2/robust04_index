			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Turkey has expressed deep concern about the  resumption of the intensified armed clashes in Afghanistan which  claim many lives and cause great destruction. Turkey says that  it is a great misfortune for the friendly and brotherly Afghan  people that clashes continue when domestic peace should be  established and when all efforts should focus on rebuilding the  country.    A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue says Turkey  insistently defends the need to establish a national [word  indistinct] that will comprise all the groups in Afghanistan.  It says: We urge all Afghan groups to stop this fighting among  brothers and to make the necessary efforts to sign a lasting  cease-fire as soon as possible.</p>

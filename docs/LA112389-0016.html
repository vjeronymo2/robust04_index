			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREATH TESTS  </P> <P> By authorizing "preliminary" breath tests of California motorists after  "administrative detentions," the attorney general's office has placed one more  arrow in the quiver of law enforcement. Simultaneously, and without a moment's  blink, our right against unreasonable searches and seizures has once again been  eroded on semantic subtleties and transparent nuances.  </P> <P> While drinking drivers undoubtably exact a toll in human lives and property  damage on our state's highways, compromising everyone's freedom to traverse  without arbitrary suspicion seems much too high a price to pay. Even though  sobriety checkpoint stops are "brief" and preliminary breath tests do not  require the driver to do anything, police scrutiny without justifiable cause  leaves our constitutionally declared rights in shambles.  </P> <P> ALVIN M. HALL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Trump Card" Host Selected: Real estate developer and casino tycoon Donald  Trump has reached into sports television for the host of his new game show,  "Trump Card," to be produced by Lorimar Television. NBC football analyst Jimmy  Cefalo has been named to host the show, scheduled to debut next fall. Cefalo  joined NBC in 1985 after playing for the Miami Dolphins from 1978-84. The daily  syndicated show, based on the British game show "Full House," will combine  elements of bingo with viewers' playing on cards at home. Although Trump might  make an appearance on the program, he has said he does not expect to play a  major creative role in it. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 31 Mar (EFE) -- The Mapuche Indian  "All-Lands Council" organization announced today that it will  resume its policy of taking over land in southern Chile on the  basis that the land was taken away illegally from the Indians.    The announcement was made at the closing of the Fourth  Mapuche Tribunal held by this organization, which also was  attended by especially invited Mapuche Indians from Argentina.    The Mapuche organization also decided to ask for the  immediate revision of the land treaties signed by various  Chilean governments and it also questioned the government policy  regarding the Indian population.    Council President Aucan Huilcaman announced that the process  "for recovering the land" will be resumed in the next few weeks.    Huilcaman added: "Before occupying the land we will show the  documents proving that the recovered land really belongs to the  Mapuche."    In 1992, Mapuche Indians belonging to the All-Lands Council  peacefully occupied some land in the Ninth Region, from which  they were evicted by police.    On orders from then-Interior Minister Enrique Krauss, more  than 100 Indians were tried for "illegal association" and  "illegal takeover of land" and some were imprisoned.    There are about 1 million Indians in Chile, of which about  two-thirds are Mapuche.    During the government of President Patricio Aylwin  (1990-1994), Congress approved an Indian law culturally  recognizing the ethnic groups that live in Chile and  establishing a series of mechanisms for their social and  economic development.    The law also created the National Land Fund to help  contribute to the recovery of some of the land taken away from  the Indian population or to purchase new land.</p>

Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was scheduled to  sign the "Partnership for Peace" document during a visit next  Thursday to the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    At a recent summit, President Clinton and other alliance  leaders invited their Warsaw Pact foes to accept the plan, which  would draw the nations closer but without granting them  membership.    NATO officials said the East Europeans can begin signing the  partnership document on Monday.    After they do, they will work out individual programs for  taking part in military exercises, peacekeeping and other NATO  activities. In turn, the nations will have to share information  about defense budgets, promise civilian control over the  military and standardize weapons systems.    Lithuania earlier this month became the first former Soviet  republic to ask for membership in the alliance and the security  guarantees that would go with it. Poland, Hungary and others  also want to join.    But the allies have refused to admit the East Europeans,  fearing to do so would create a new divide in Europe and isolate  and upset Russia, a formidable military power.</p>

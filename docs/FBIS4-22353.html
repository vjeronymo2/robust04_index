			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA special correspondent Oleg </F> Karmaza: "The Funeral March Was Accompanied by the Whine of  Jets"]    [Text] Novokuznetsk-Mezhdurechensk--The story of the  air disaster in Russia's sky is still incomplete: the "black  boxes" found in the taiga were sent to France for  analysis...    Aircraft have been falling out of the sky and are sure to  continue doing so. This is taken for granted. What is most  important is that crashes do not become a habit, a terrible  tragedy or a natural everyday occurrence.    But this is precisely what is happening now to our civil  aviation, which has been intimidated by everyone. Russia has  become one of the world leaders in the number of air disasters  taking place in the shortest period of time: 78 days--this is  the number of days from the Tu-154 disaster over Irkutsk to the  latest catastrophe involving the A-310 Airbus over Novokuznetsk.  At first glance this period of time is unreal, absurd. But a  fact remains a fact: 78 days and another 75 bodies. The figures  are almost the same--like ordinary accounting...    In many respects this is a strange catastrophe. It is  unusual, if such an expression is applicable in a tragic  context. Everything was the wrong way around in it: 99 percent  of all air crashes take place either during an aircraft's  takeoff or landing. Something happened here when the aircraft  was flying at its assigned altitude on autopilot. It had already  flown over 3,000 kilometers and all systems were operating  normally, without any deviations, which is confirmed by the  recorded transmissions between the crew and the ground.    The airplane fell very rapidly. At the steepest possible  angle, which seldom or almost never happens during an air  accident. It crashed into the side of a mountain, but it  completely cleared the tops of the trees for some reason.  According to the first rescuers to arrive at the crash site, it  appeared as if the Airbus had simply "flopped down" on the  mountain.    All the plane's fragments were found in a relatively small  area. They were not strewn over a radius of several hundred  meters as they were in the Irkutsk tragedy in January, for  example, but gathered together in a very small space.    The fact that the pilots did not have time to transmit  anything to the ground is also strange. Absolutely nothing! The  crash took place in complete radio silence. We cannot even make  a rough guess now about what happened on board the Airbus. A  sudden explosion? A fire? According to the driver of a log truck  not far away, an engine was on fire and a dense black plume of  smoke trailed after it. However, specialists investigating the  crash were skeptical about the driver's story: the witness was  slightly inebriated at that time.    Residents of the settlement of Mayzas, 8 kilometers from the  crash site, heard a powerful explosion. But to all appearances,  this was the explosion when the aircraft hit the ground. There  was a large amount of fuel in the plane's tanks: I would remind  you that the aircraft was flying to Hong Kong, and there was  sufficient fuel on board.    It has now been established that there were 75 persons--63  passengers and 12 crew members (three pilots, 8 female flight  attendants, and one male flight attendant) on the aircraft.  There were many foreigners--Chinese, Indian, British and French  passengers--on board. Judging by the effects found by the  rescuers at the crash site, the passengers were very well-to-do.  It is sufficient to say that more than $1 million and a large  number of precious stones and gold ornaments were found on the  first day of work.    To prevent looting, the crash site was immediately cordoned  off by the OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] and  soldiers (though for some reason, the soldiers were withdrawn  but the OMON remained, with full gear and weapons, and were put  on watches of 12 hours per day). There is a rather impressive  group of people working at the site now: over 100 members of the  rescue party, from Mezhdurechensk, Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, and  Moscow, and roughly the same number of inducted soldiers. The  militia and those under their jurisdiction--zeki [prisoners]  from the local colony--were put to work clearing away the crash  remains. Representatives of security organs are also working  there (judging from a conversation with them, a terakt  [terrorist act] has not been ruled out, but in any case, certain  details of the accident point to such a turn of events).    The crew of an MI-8 helicopter urgently dispatched from  Novokuznetsk were the first to discover the burning airplane. A  rescue party from Mezhdurechensk set out for the crash site in  vehicles equipped for snow travel. According to their accounts,  it was immediately clear how sad it was that there was no one to  rescue. The crash site was shrouded in acrid smoke from burning  plastic, seat materials, and cable. In the specialists' opinion,  all the passengers died instantaneously. There simply could not  have been any who survived for a short time after impact in this  situation.    Because of the turn of events, I came to the crash site as  an  undertaker. With S. Tarasov, director of the Mezhdurechensk  "Ritual," we transported all the coffins in the town at that  time (at first, journalists were very strictly prohibited from  being at the crash site, though members of the state commission  took pity on us and authorized us to perform our professional  duties for a brief period). Incidentally, with regard to respect  for the remains of the casualties, the catastrophe showed that  we are still civilized people. We carefully and neatly packed  the body parts in polyethylene bags, then placed them in the  coffins to take to the mortuaries in Novokuznetsk. "You do not  give bodies to the relatives in the bags--there should be at  least some respect," one of the commission members explained.    There was none of the unpleasant haste, even cynicism, which  existed at the Irkutsk disaster site, when the arms and legs of  the dead were thrown into polyethylene packages in an effort to  get the remains to the city a little faster (although there were  some excesses now, too. It was decided at first to send the  human remains to a mortuary in nearby Mezhdurechensk and  mortuary employees were ordered categorically to remove all the  "extra" bodies from the institution. It reached the point of  absurdity. As an example, the driver of our hearse-truck was  compelled to take his dead friend out of the mortuary, wrapped  in a blanket. There was nothing he could do but lay the body in  the "KamAZ" [truck] and drive around every bump and rut when  taking it to his relatives).    The first days after the crash the soldiers and rescue crews  prepared a route to take out the remains of the dead and parts  of the aircraft, as well as a pad for the helicopters. The  aircraft had crashed 1.5 kilometers from a road which is  traveled day and night by lumber trucks. Otherwise it would have  been much harder to get to the crash site. The sparsely  populated area is surrounded by volcanic peaks and taiga.    As terrible as it sounds, little was left of those killed in  the Novokuznetsk disaster. The bodies were burned and charred to  the point that they were unrecognizable. Many of the passengers  were still strapped in their seats. The rescue party found two  girls--the only children on this flight. Their father, one of  the crew members, had decided to take them with him on vacation,  to show them Hong Kong.    The rescue crews had to extract--and still have to  extract--most of the bodies from a deep layer of snow--winter  has brought a lot of snow here this year. About 60 bodies were  found in the first 2 days. Some of them were taken in two  "KamAZ" trucks to the Novokuznetsk mortuaries (the Airbus pilots  were taken separately, in a special helicopter). Identification  of the dead was begun yesterday. Although this will be a very,  very difficult job.    By the end of the second day, two of the three "black boxes"  on board the aircraft were found and sent right away to Moscow  for analysis. A special representative of the American General  Electric firm, which provided the engines for the A-310 Airbus,  has arrived in Novokuznetsk. However, he responded to all my  journalist colleagues in the same way: "No comment." And in  his own way, he was probably right.</p>

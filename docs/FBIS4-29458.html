			<p>BFN     [Text] On 16 June, the ruling coalition worked out a draft  plan on dealing with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear  arms development, which will be a focal point in discussion with  both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on a possible future coalition  framework. Among topics of the draft plan, which was formulated  from the viewpoint of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and  Japan's security system, are: 1) Necessary domestic conditions  will be created to enable Japan to respond to the United  Nations' and the international community's decisions, including  sanctions against North Korea; 2) Japan will closely cooperate  with the United States and South Korea; and 3) the domestic  crisis-control system, including legal measures, will be  promptly established, and if necessary, the legislation of a  "basic security law" will be considered. The coalition intends  to submit the plan to both the LDP and the SDPJ early next week.    A policy study group, the "Committee To Discuss Japan's  Security and Future," worked out the draft plan for the purpose  of discussing it at policy consultations with the LDP and the  SDPJ and preparing for future legislation by House of  Representatives members. The committee (chaired by Yukihisa  Yoshida, Democratic Socialist Party vice chairman) is comprised  mainly of ruling coalition members.    With regard to concrete measures such as economic sanctions,  the draft plan says Japan should cooperate not only in UN  sanctions but also in "multilateral" actions such as those taken  during the Gulf War.    As for cooperation with the United States and South Korea,  it  stipulates: "Japan will manage the Japan-U.S. security system  flexibly depending on changes in the situation, and will provide  support and cooperation to the United States within the  framework of the system. On the other hand, Japan will  positively promote cooperation with South Korea. To that end,  legal and other arrangement will be made."    Regarding the establishment of the domestic crisis-control  system, the draft plan points out: "An emphasis will be  attached to national security; protection of Japanese people's  lives, assets, and welfare; and maintenance of order in the  Japanese society." It also notes the need to improve laws and  regulations in anticipation of rescuing Japanese people living  abroad and accepting refugees.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Herculean tasks for new Tory hero Mr Kenneth Clarke regards the role of chancellor as above all political. He is right. Power is generated by skil-ful politicking; without it, the part played is that of a mere office-holder. We should not, therefore, be surprised that Britain's new finance minister spent the first three weeks in his new job setting a tone, establishing a mood, ensuring that the signals he sends out are correct and in tune with the electorate's aspirations. Only now, in his fourth week, does he feel that his base is prepared. That achieved, he is ready for the detailed in-house planning sessions that occupy a chancellor's diary. When he arrived at No 11 Downing Street on May 28 he noted with relief that there was no urgent economic crisis to be faced. His experience on Black Wednesday, when for a few hours the technicians ran the country and elected ministers were impotent, was one he regards as the worst of his political life. On the morning after Mr Norman Lamont's downfall, in contrast, the foreign exchange and stock markets were calm. The political marketplace was, however, turbulent. He could not afford to take a month or so off from the airwaves in order to read himself in, as he had done in several new ministries before. The equilibrium of the government had to be re-established. The new chancellor decided that his first priority was political. He spent much of his time thinking about three set-piece speeches: one to the parliamentary press gallery, one to wind up the economic debate in the Commons and, finally, his Mansion House address. All were well received. He accepted, and kept, many media engagements. He spread himself, and his message, as widely as he could. What he put across was that he was a believer in low inflation but, concurrently, a proponent of growth. This seems impossible, at least to me. No other chancellor has achieved both objectives simultaneously. Going for growth and damn the inflation would win Mr Clarke the Tony Barber award for fiscal irresponsibility. He believes that he understands this, and can avoid it. He will be put to the test next spring. It is then, in April 1994, that the changes in value-added and fuel tax provided for in Mr Norman Lamont's last budget will hit the retail price index. For a few months it may be impossible to keep inflation below 4 per cent. What then? To judge by the demeanour he has adopted so far, Mr Clarke might well ask whether the rise in prices was merely a one-off blip caused by the government's own taxation policy. If so, he would probably resist an increase in the rate of interest, however persuasively the new governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, put his familiar counter-inflationary arguments. If, however, more insidious inflationary pressures were identified at the same time - if, say, sterling was falling sharply - interest rates might well be increased. Mr Clarke remains, for all his experience of the day Britain was ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism, a believer in managed rates. He has said loudly enough that he knows there can be no rejoining of the ERM in this parliament. He would want a Soros-proof system in place first, but he has never said never. A steep devaluation would be inflationary. No one can predict monetary policy. But what I have outlined is the kind of approach ordinary people expect of a chancellor who has advertised himself as confident, relaxed, a repository of common sense. In consequence he has become, perhaps for a fleeting moment, the most powerful man in Mr John Major's government, the prime minister included. He is certainly the most self-confident. Where Mr Lamont was subject to the prime minister's authority, his successor may, without saying so, assume that he is virtually unsackable: that in any stand-off, it is not necessarily the first lord of the treasury's view that will prevail. Today, Mr Clarke has the bulk of the party (its Thatcherite wing excluded), the media, and presumably much of the country rooting for him. He would take pains to aver that Mr Major can nevertheless sleep safely in his bed at night. Let us be charitable. Let us believe this. For the media, and the public, will turn against him whatever he says. Anyway, in policy terms Mr Clarke sees himself as a carbon copy of the prime minister, with the latter only marginally less pro-European than he is. He would argue that if Mr Major were to go down, his chancellor would perforce go down with him. The new Tory hero's second immediate task was to steer the public spending targets announced last Thursday through the cabinet. He regards the commitment to a real growth in expenditure no larger than the growth in the economy as the toughest that political realism will allow; anything more severe might not get through a Commons in which the government's majority is dwindling and the Conservatives are divided. To those who complain that the ceilings on the next three years' outgoings are not low enough, he might reasonably respond that what was agreed last week was one contribution to reducing the anticipated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. It is open to him to tighten fiscal policy further in November, when the first unified budget is presented. No one has been able to pin him down on whether that means further tax increases or further spending cuts; his instinct is that if the public finances look as dire then as they do now he may have to do both. Mr Clarke draws strength from the fact that most people know in their hearts that this is probable. Those little matters out of the way, the new chancellor is embarking on a series of internal meetings on selected topics. This week he will review options for increasing the flow of private capital into public projects; next week's subject is small business and what can be done for it. After that they will debate tax policy. No decisions will necessarily be made at any of these educative sessions, unless Mr Clarke is suddenly struck by a blinding truth at any one of them. The chancellor starts with a prejudice in favour of fewer allowances and low rates; perhaps the lightning will strike there. He is not one for economists brought in from outside. His predecessor's advisers have gone. Mr Lamont's council of wise men was invented to protect shell-shocked Treasury officials from the full blast of public opprobrium. It will not be disbanded, but I would not place much money on it exerting a great deal of influence under the new Treasury regime. Mr Clarke is proposing to consult a few people he regards as leading industrialists who understand the economy, Sir Graham Day and Lord (Jeffrey) Sterling among them, but, in the main, he is heaping praise on his demoralised officials and listening to what they have to say. Before we all groan that this means more of the mistakes that have dogged us for so long, we should clutch at the one straw available. It is that huge self-confidence, the feeling inside the new chancellor's soul that he has the ability to pick the best advice, and distinguish the officials who give it from the ones who do not. He will be doing that, probably working harder than perhaps ever in his life before, when he returns from the August holidays to prepare the unified budget. I recall discussing the use of economists in the Treasury with Mr John Smith when he was shadow chancellor. Mr Smith, like Mr Clarke a lawyer, intimated that economists are two a penny, buyable with pre-knowledge of their opinions. What was needed at the Treasury was political nous, an ability to pick out what would work from what would not. It is that quality that we must tell ourselves is now being deployed on our behalf by Mr Clarke. He is one of the most experienced members of the government, and he is not a fool. He has made a good start. Only a sour old cynic like myself would cast the slightest smidgen of doubt on the finish.</p>

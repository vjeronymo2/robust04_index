			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray falls 17% TWO RECENT acquisitions took a sizeable bite out of profits at Sanderson Murray &amp; Elder. The motor dealer reported a 17 per cent pre-tax fall from Pounds 765,000 to Pounds 633,000 for the first half of 1992. Mr Tony Bramall, chairman, said neither of the two recent acquisitions - dealerships in Gateshead and Manchester - had performed well. The group handled 3,300 new vehicle sales in the half year - nearly 4 per cent down on last year, while almost 2,000 used vehicles were retailed - a 3.5 per cent fall. Margins on used cars were in line with 1991, but new car margins were under extreme competitive pressure. The service, parts and body repair activities contributed more than 60 per cent of total profits. Turnover jumped from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 51.1m. Earnings per share dropped to 2.87p (4.8p), while the interim dividend is in effect maintained at 0.6p after adjusting for the share sub-division.</p>

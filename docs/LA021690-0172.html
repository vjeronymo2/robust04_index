			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'RHYTHM NATION: 1814' EXPLAINED  </P> <P> It was no mystery when "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation: 1814" went platinum. But  that number in the title is a mystery to many fans.  </P> <P> It's true that 'R' is the 18th letter in the alphabet and 'N' is the 14th, but  that's just coincidence, Jackson said in the March 5 issue of US magazine.  </P> <P> "What actually happened," Jackson said, "was that while writing 'Rhythm Nation'  I was kidding around, saying, 'God, you guys, I feel like this could be the  national anthem for the '90s.'  </P> <P> "Just by a crazy chance we decided to look up when Francis Scott Key wrote the  national anthem, and it was September 14, 1814."  </P> <P> Jackson said that when she told A&amp;M Records executives what it meant, "They  didn't want me to say. So I didn't. They still don't want me to say, but  everyone keeps asking me."  </P></p>

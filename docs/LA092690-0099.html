			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHIELDS OUTLASTS BAYNES TO WIN COMEBACK FIGHT  </P> <P> When a boxer has not fought in nearly eight years and insists upon making a  comeback, he looks for an opponent that closely resembles a punching bag.  </P> <P> Randy Shields, once one of the premier welterweights in the world, thought he  had found such a man in Stewart Baynes of Los Angeles. Baynes had all the  credentials, most notably a 9-11 record.  </P> <P> But Shields, whose last previous fight was in 1983, had forgotten what such a  long retirement does to a boxer.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night at the Country Club in Reseda in his first comeback bout,  Shields, of North Hollywood, won a unanimous 10-round decision over Baynes. But  he was stretched to the limit in doing so.  </P> <P> After nearly knocking Baynes out in the second round with blistering, jarring  combinations, Shields took a beating in the fourth round of the junior  middleweight bout as Baynes hammered him for three minutes. Shields sagged  against the ropes.  </P> <P> But Shields, who fought the best welterweights in the world on fairly even  terms during the 1970s and early 1980s, showed his toughness by regaining  control of the bout in the fifth round.  </P> <P> The judges had Shields winning by scores of 97-93, 98-92 and 99-90.  </P> <P> Shields is 42-9-1.  </P> <P> In the co-main event, former North American Boxing Federation heavyweight  champion Orlin Norris was knocked down in the fifth round by journeyman Greg  Gorrell before he stopped Gorrell in the eighth round of the scheduled 10-round  bout.  </P> <P> Gorrell, who has fought mostly as a light heavyweight and a cruiserweight,  weighed a flabby 197 pounds. Norris, ranked 13th by the World Boxing Council,  weighed 221.  </P> <P> After being pounded for four rounds, Gorrell shocked Norris with a heavy right  hand late in the fifth round and Norris crumpled to the mat. He was up quickly,  however, and in the eighth he battered Gorrell from the opening bell. Referee  Lou Fillipo stopped the fight just 36 seconds into the round.  </P> <P> Norris, of Campo, Calif., is 24-2 with 11 knockouts. Gorrell, of Wichita, Kan.,  is 23-10.  </P> <P> In an earlier bout, Joey DeGrandis, a two-time Golden Gloves champion from  Boston who fights out of the Ten Goose Gym in Van Nuys, pounded out an easy,  unanimous decision over Fred Thomas of Los Angeles in a four-round bout.  </P> <P> DeGrandis, 166, unleashed a relentless body attack to pile up points and hurt  Thomas, 165, inthe third and fourth rounds. DeGrandis is 3-1. Thomas fell to  3-3.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin/Karlsruhe -- The Berlin police searched the  office of a journalist of the paper JUNGE WELT today. The  Federal Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed the operation,  which is linked with the alleged letter by the Red Army Faction  [RAF] published by the daily yesterday. [see item AU1603152294  previous Terrorism Report] The spokesman of the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office, Public Prosecutor Hans Juergen Firster,  stated that the search and the confiscation of the 18-page  letter was ordered because the original of the letter may be  used as evidence. With the help of technical examinations,  "evidence may be obtained and evaluated" that might allow  conclusions regarding the writer or the writers.    The operation is justified despite the journalists' right to  refuse to give evidence because the drafting of the letter and  its dispatch to the newspaper "suggest membership in the  terrorist association RAF." Thus, just like other pieces of  evidence, it is subject to confiscation, the spokesman stressed.    The editors of JUNGE WELT protested "most strongly against  the measure of the federal authorities."</p>

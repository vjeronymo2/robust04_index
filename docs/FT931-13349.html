			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Sport: Test of mettle for crew of Steel - Yachting / Keith Wheatley sees a dismasted yacht berth safely in Tasmania CHAY Blyth was in ebullient form. It takes an experienced observer to distinguish between this mode and the normally effervescent Blyth, but it was thus. 'Wow, isn't that fantastic,' he shouted as a crudely ugly racing yacht docked beneath the green hills of Hobart, Tasmania. British Steel II had her boom jury-rigged as a mast, and a second spar (borrowed from a much smaller yacht) in place as a mizzen. Aboard, her 14 crew looked much thinner than when they had left Rio on November 15. British Steel had been dismasted halfway between Cape Horn and New Zealand, 2,500 miles from land in the iceberg-strewn wastes of the Southern Ocean. It is as far from land and outside assistance as it is possible to be. Her voyage to rejoin the other nine yachts racing around the world in the British Steel Challenge, created by Blyth to give fare-paying amateurs a taste of world-class ocean sailing, has become a classic of ingenuity and guts. Skipper Richard Tudor, 32, had already become renowned as probably the hardest-driving of the 10 professionals helming the 67ft steel yachts. After winning the training race around the Fastnet and the first Solent-Rio leg, Tudor's boat was favourite to take overall victory in the 28,000-mile epic which will call at Cape Town before finishing back in the Solent during late May. 'It's been such an unbelievable experience. The shock and fear and then teamwork to survive. I'm not sure that dismasting isn't more of an achievement than winning the race,' said crew member Louise Broadbent of Leeds, as the battered yacht moored up. Once safely alongside Constitution Wharf, where Tasmania's unfortunate convicts once landed, the stories began to emerge of the rough, freezing night when the 90ft mast fractured just above deck level and toppled overboard - a month from the nearest land. A stainless steel bottlescrew, a disintegrated and left the spar without its main supporting wire. 'I thought we'd hit an iceberg,' recalled Marcus Gladwell, who was in his bunk directly below the broken fitting when disaster struck. 'The first noise of metal exploding woke me up, then came the banging of the mast against the hull. 'If the yacht had been made of anything except steel I'm sure the rig would have bashed through the side and sunk us.' In the dark and confusion it took nearly an hour, using massive bolt-cutters, to cut the wires holding the damaged mast to the yacht and let in sink 7,000ft to the ocean floor. After that came the realisation that from being leaders of the 28,000-mile race and favourites to win, British Steel II was effectively out of the hunt. 'Some people were fairly depressed in the aftermath,' said Tudor, going on to explain the irony of the incident. 'At the time we weren't pushing the boat hard. We were nicely placed just behind the leader Nuclear Electric and there was no need. Had we been pushing I could have forgiven myself for the damage,' said Tudor, a former professional sailmaker from Pwllheli. His only similar accident was losing the mast of his Mirror dinghy when he was eight. Although he is shrewd enough to conceal it, Tudor is bitterly disappointed that a design or manufacturing failure has dashed his hopes of glory. In a shed adjoining Constitution Wharf lie the masts from three other yachts, all seriously damaged from the same flaw in the overall rig. Andrew Roberts, technical director for the race and virtual designer of everything aboard except the hulls themselves, is certain that metal fatigue caused the same component to fail on eight of the 10 yachts. Certainly there are some expensive bills waiting to be apportioned and insurance assessors, spar-makers and metallurgists can be found holding animated conversations in odd corners of Hobart. Without the full mast and sails to balance the yacht, British Steel II began a wicked corkscrewing motion through the 40ft waves. 'From that point we just thought about survival, not racing,' said crew member Yvonne Flatman, a trading standards officer in 'civilian' life. The ultra-competitive Tudor rejected the easier notion of running with the prevailing winds to Chile. He was determined to reach Hobart in time to participate in the final two legs of the race. British Steel II used its motor to reach Hobart, disqualifying itself from that leg and the race overall. 'We knew we were deep in iceberg country and we didn't have enough food or fuel to do anything except sail out of it. It was my decision to stay in the race and head for Tasmania,' said Tudor. A spare mast has been flown out for British Steel II. The others are being repaired with new aluminium sections, some over half the length of the original spar. 'Of course I'm surprised at the damage we've suffered. I honestly thought the boats were built more substantially than that - if only because I'm responsible for the repair bills,' said Blyth, who created and owns the race concept. 'But we've got them all here safely and that's a huge relief.' Not least because next month Blyth is expected to announce plans for a successor race in even bigger yachts with more competitors. Against considerable scepticism he has proved that a taste for adventure and danger lurks within even the most deskbound of us.</p>

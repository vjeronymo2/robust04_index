			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 27 (AFP) -- Arab states are still  suffering from high unemployment and illiteracy rates despite  economic reforms and educational campaigns, and the problem is  threatening stability in the region, an official Arab report  said on Wednesday [27 April].    While illiteracy is expected to decline in the near future,  unemployment is likely to get worse in some Arab countries due  to economic slowdown and a rapid population growth, said the  report by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and  the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund.    "The high unemployment rate in several Arab countries is one  of the most serious problems which affect not only economic  development but social and political stability," the 1993 annual  report said.    "What increases the dangers of this phenomenon is that  unemployment rates are steadily rising and the problem could  become more complicated in future."    The report said unemployment in some Arab countries far  exceeded that in industrial countries where such rates do not  exceed 10 percent.    In Jordan, it rose from six percent in 1985 to 19 percent in  1991 while it increased from 13 percent to 16 percent in  Tunisia, it said. In Morocco it stood at 16 percent and Algeria  at 19 percent.    It said unemployment was widespread among educated people in  Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. "This makes the problem more  worrying," it added.    The report put the workforce in the Arab League's 22 members  at 66 million, which it said would increase to 81 million by the  year 2000.    It said the expected growth in labour was because more women  were taking up jobs and a large number of people are within  working age groups.    But the report cited what it called negative aspects in the  labour structure in the Arab world, including the low  productivity of workers, small contribution by women to economic  activity and employment of children.    "Productivity of a worker in Europe is more than six times  the productivity in the Arab world," it said. "The problem is  underscored in the farming sector, which accounts for 36 percent  of the Arab labour force but its share in the Gross Domestic  Product did not exceed 13 percent in 1992."    Surveys conducted recently in some Arab nations showed  around  1.3 million children aged between 6-14 were working in Egypt  while children accounted for 13.3 percent of the total workforce  in Morocco's countryside, it said.    "The surveys showed that this phenomenon is prevalent in the  countryside of other Arab countries," it said. "What adds to  those problems is the large number of non-Arab expatriate  workers in the Gulf oil producing states."    The report showed the services sector attracted the largest  number of workers, acounting for 46 percent.    It was followed by the farming sector, which has 36 percent,  and the industrial sector, with 18 percent.    Women accounted for only 6.7 percent of the total Arab  workforce but the level was expected to jump to 20 percent in  the year 2000.    "Illiteracy is another serious problem facing Arab states.  Despite educational campaigns, illiteracy stood at 49 percent in  1991 compared with 66 percent in 1970. The level is expected to  decline further to reach 38 percent in the year 2000," the  report said.    Women are suffering most, with their illiteracy accounting  for nearly 62 percent of the total. The level is expected to  reach 50 percent by the year 2000, it added.    A breakdown for 1992 showed Somalia had the highest rate,  standing at 75.9 percent, followed by Sudan at 72.9 percent,  Yemen at 61.5 percent, Egypt at 51.6 percent and Morocco at 50.5  percent.    The report showed Lebanon and Jordan had the lowest rates,  at  19.9 percent each but it did not provide figures for the United  Arab Emirates, Djibouti, Oman, Mauritania and Palestinians.</p>

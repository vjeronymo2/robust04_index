			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gift to a daughter I am a retired widower and in June 1990 was left a property valued around Pounds 85,000 at probate. When I die, I know my estate will be liable for death duties of perhaps Pounds 40,000. I have two daughters and I am considering transferring the above property to one or both. Is conveyancing necessary in this case and if so, can I attempt it myself? We assume that the property is not your private residence and can, accordingly, be gifted to your daughter without the gifts-with-reservation rules applying. If you occupy that property in the future, you will need to pay market rent to your daughter to avoid these rules applying. The gift of the property would be a potentially exempt transfer. Inheritance tax might be an issue if you were to die within seven years of making the gift. If you transfer the property to your daughters now, you could create a capital gains tax charge. The gain which you would realise would be the excess of the market value at the time of the gift over the probate value, reduced by indexation allowance (for inflation) since June 1990. In the present property climate, the market value at the time of the gift might not be greatly different from the probate value. Hence, your gain could be small and covered by annual exemption of Pounds 5,800. Alternatively, you might realise a loss. I suggest you get the property valued to see if CGT would be payable. Conveyancing is necessary in the case of a gift. This can be done by you but it is normally better to ask a professional adviser to help. No stamp duty is payable in the case of a gift of land.

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hartstone Dollars 50m debt replacement Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods group, yesterday announced a Dollars 50m debt replacement which will eliminate virtually all of its sterling borrowings and hedge against currency moves on its US assets. Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the decision to place Dollars 50m in debt with three US institutions would benefit interest charges in the current year. The debt was placed at an effective rate of 8.4 per cent for almost seven years. This compares with previous shorter-term sterling borrowings at an average of about 11 to 11.5 per cent. The effect of transferring the debt would also offset higher tax charges on profits made in the US. Hartstone bought leather goods manufacturers, Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, for Dollars 120m in March last year and has US assets of about Dollars 40m, roughly 37 per cent of the group total. Hartstone, which is expected next month to report profits of some Pounds 22.5m for the year to March 31, will have debt representing about 45 per cent of shareholders' funds after the proceeds are used to reduce UK borrowings. Interest cover would be about eight times, said Mr Barker. The three institutions are believed to be leading insurance companies active in the private placement market. Mr Barker said the institutions had indicated they were prepared to increase the levels of debt 'as and when we make any further moves'.</p>

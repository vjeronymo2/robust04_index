			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): New universities educate their public - The former polytechnics' efforts to establish a suitable and memorable image Britain's old polytechnics have spent the past year grappling with an awkward task - establishing their new university brand image. Marketeers have two problems. One is to imprint their new names, some of which have changed radically, on public consciousness. The other is to reverse the widespread perception that has existed for decades, that the old polytechnics were second-class institutions compared with universities. Any such distinction is now officially at an end. Last year, the government removed the 'binary divide' between universities and polytechnics, because it had been seen as redundant and a barrier to the expansion of higher education. The former polytechnics are now funded by and answerable to the government, rather than local authorities. The evidence is that marketeers have done a good job: applications to new universities through the Polytechnics Central Admissions System rose by 5 per cent this year, in spite of a fall in the number of 18-year-olds. But the methods used have varied widely. De Montfort University - formerly Leicester Polytechnic - has been the most ambitious. It launched a Pounds 500,000 multi-media campaign earlier this month aimed at 18-year-olds, whose A-level results do not reach expectations and who will be looking for a place via the clearing system. All the stops have been pulled out. Central to the campaign is a 30-second cinema and television commercial featuring a voice-over from Angus Deayton. It uses footage from Sir David Attenborough's BBC documentary 'Trials of Life', which shows a nimble sealion shrugging off a killer whale attack. Computer graphics at the end of the commercial are provided by De Montfort's school of design and manufacture, and reinforce the message that to be nimble and ahead of the competition, like the sealion, you need a university degree. The commercial is appearing on Channel 4 in two, four-week bursts, which started on August 9 and will run until mid-October. It is also appearing on 349 London area cinema screens and 209 Midlands screens. And a similarly aggressive newspaper campaign is in progress, targeted at broadsheets, with the slogan: 'The Real World. Entry visas now available at De Montfort University.' The old polytechnics have traditionally taken most of their students from their locality, so De Montfort's national campaigns could be seen as first steps to cutting links with the local area. Michael Brown, De Montfort's executive pro-vice-chancellor, said: 'In market research we've found that the choice of university is very whimsical. The problem is that customers' perceptions lag behind. We are trying to find a professional way to challenge people's perceptions about what's on offer.' Marketing departments of other new universities are watching De Montfort's experiment with keen interest. While some say that this level of expenditure for marketing is beyond them, others are trying similar, less ambitious campaigns. Teesside University's new image is centred around an ambitious logo, designed using the tangram pieces, which spell out the university's initials. The logo has been designed by Bush Hollyhead, a freelance graphic designer. Ms Helen Pickering, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, said the design is intended to reflect the university's identity, 'offering flexibility and modularity as well as quality'. Teesside has ensured that its new corporate identity is impressed hard on the educational community by running a series of advertisements featuring the logo on the front page of the Guardian. In London, most of the new universities are content to reinforce their standing with traditional target groups. South Bank University - formerly South Bank Polytechnic - has opted to spend heavily on poster advertising in the London Underground. In common with De Montfort's campaign, the message is aimed at name recognition, and propagating the benefits of a university education. There is little attempt to sell any benefits specific to South Bank. South Bank's marketing department says: 'We have to be imaginative because we can't take for granted the fact that people will know about us.' This led to a cheeky poster campaign, where underground travellers see a big (though technically incorrect) slogan 'We Can't Advertise', followed by more sober advertising copy in smaller letters apologising for not being able to explain that a South Bank degree would improve a candidate's chance in the job market. The University of North London - formerly the Polytechnic of North London - has cut spending on advertising this year. Instead, it has chosen to enforce its new brand image on its local community. UNL has several imposing modern buildings throughout the London boroughs of Camden and Islington. All now are 'badged' with large versions of the university's new logo - a design of a welcoming figure with outstretched arms - and its new name.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL BOARD PULLS LICENSE OF LAGUNA DOCTOR  </P> <P> The state medical board has suspended a Laguna Beach doctor's medical license  for three months for prescribing drugs excessively.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert A. Leslie could not be reached for comment Thursday. But according  to records from the Medical Board of California, once his suspension is lifted  in mid-June, the general practitioner will be monitored closely for the next  five years.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the medical board accused Huntington Beach physician  Jasmine Moini of gross negligence, unwarranted treatment and fraudulently  altering medical records. The board recommended that her license be revoked or  suspended if the charges are upheld at an administrative hearing.  </P> <P> Asked for comment, Moini said: "There's nothing to say really. These are  accusations. Anybody can accuse anybody."  </P> <P> In Leslie's case, the medical board opened a disciplinary proceeding after he  was found guilty in Los Angeles County Municipal Court on Oct. 9, 1986, of  excessive prescribing. He was also convicted of prescribing Valium to a person  not under his treatment and "prescribing Tylenol with codeine for addicts."  </P> <P> At that time, medical board documents said, Leslie was fined, placed on two  years' probation and ordered to spend 90 days in jail.  </P> <P> At a medical board hearing last summer, administrative law judge Rosalyn  Chapman reviewed the misdemeanor convictions and concluded that Leslie "is not  rehabilitated" but rather "obsessed with overturning his convictions" and so  "unable to objectively evaluate his conduct which led to the convictions."  </P> <P> She ordered that Leslie could resume practicing medicine after the suspension  if he abstained from all personal use or possession of controlled substances.  In addition, Leslie was ordered to provide free medical services to a community  agency for 18 months and to take a course in drug abuse.  </P> <P> The charges against Moini stem from half a dozen patient visits in 1986.  </P> <P> For instance, when treating a patient identified only as "L.H." for a sore  throat, Moini allegedly failed to perform a proper physical exam before  ordering a series of "clearly excessive lab tests" and diagnosing the patient  as having "among other things, chest pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease . . . and a urinary tract infection."  </P> <P> The medical board also asserted that Moini "committed a dishonest act  substantially related to the functions and duties of a physician."  </P> <P> It claimed that in January, 1987, Moini sent L.H.'s medical records to another  physician. But when the medical board asked for the same records, the file it  received in December, 1987, contained "supplemental information" that indicated  the file had been "fraudulently" altered.  </P></p>

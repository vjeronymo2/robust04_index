			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIND TAKING A MAJOR TOLL ON YACHT RACE  </P> <P> Boris, a tropical depression off Baja California, dumped remnants of rain and  erratic winds on Southern California and threw the second day of Ullman  Sails-Washington Insurance Race Week competition into chaos.  </P> <P> "We had wind from every direction, and it was totally unpredictable," said  Robbie Haines, the '84 Olympic gold medalist and recent Congressional Cup  runner-up who sailed Irv Loube's Farr 40 Bravura to its third consecutive win  in the IOR-B class.  </P> <P> The event will conclude with two shorter windward-leeward races today.

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: NEWS FOR AFICIONADOS: HEART OF ARTICHOKE SEASON IS LONGER THIS  YEAR  </P> <P> According to "Fresh Facts," the weekly newsletter published by the Fresh  Produce Council, a locally based trade group, "The 1989-90 artichoke season may  go down in history as one of the longest on record. Mild temperatures in the  Castroville area have given artichoke growers an unusually long stretch of  frost-free weather.  </P> <P> It looks like artichokes will be available right through the spring, without  the usual break in supply."  </P> <P> To cook artichokes whole, wash each under cold running water, spreading the  leaves slightly to give a thorough cleaning. Drain and place the artichoke on  its side on a cutting board.  </P> <P> Cut the stem off near the base (Step 1) so the artichoke stands upright evenly.  Next, turn the artichoke around and cut off one-fourth to one-third of the top  (Step 2).  </P> <P> Snap or cut off any small coarse leaves close to the stem, then snip the thorny  tips of the remaining leaves (Step 3) with kitchen shears. To prevent  discoloration, rub all the exposed surfaces with a cut lemon (Step 4) or place  the artichoke in a bowl of cold water that has a few tablespoons of lemon juice  added.  </P> <P> The center of the artichoke may be removed either before or after cooking by  spreading the leaves apart (Step 5) until you reach the center cone. Carefully  pull out the purple-tipped, prickly leaves, exposing the fuzzy choke.  </P> <P> Scrape out the choke with a serrated spoon (Step 6), then squeeze a little  lemon juice over the surface or dip again in the acidified water. Drain, then  press the remaining leaves back into shape and cook.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

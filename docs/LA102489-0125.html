			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 400 COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS EMPLOYEES STAGE  SICKOUT  </P> <P> About 400 Los Angeles County building inspectors, engineers and flood control  workers called in sick Monday to protest stalled contract talks, but county  officials said the job action -- involving about 10% of the public works  employees -- caused little disruption.  </P> <P> Workers represented by the California Assn. of Professional Employees have been  on the job without a contract since Sept. 30. The employees handle such jobs as  inspecting private construction and overseeing public works projects.  </P> <P> The job action caused county officials to send supervisory personnel to a  building and safety office in East Los Angeles where only one worker out of a  office staff of 12 showed up.  </P> <P> The union did not call the sickout, a spokesman said, but "encouraged workers  to express their displeasure" with stalled labor negotiations. The union is  seeking an 8.5% pay raise for each year of a two-year contract. The county has  offered 1.75% a year, but employee relations director Elliot Marcus said,  "That, of course, is not the final offer."  </P> <P> County officials told employees calling in sick that they would not be paid  unless they present "proof satisfactory to the department" that the absence is  linked to illness.  </P></p>

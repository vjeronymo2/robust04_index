			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by Nevena </F> Petrova; place and date not given: "No Deputy Will Be Held  Responsible for Corruption as Long as He Is Protected by  Immunity"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Petrova] What prevents us  from being more successful?    [Zhelev] The reforms are not being implemented. Until now  the land could have been returned five times.    [Petrova] Who is responsible for this, Mr. President?    [Zhelev] The executive power is responsible. Three  governments wasted their time and did not accomplish anything.  According to my assessment, the land that Berov's government  really returned amounts to only 10 percent. What DURZHAVEN  VESTNIK published about the land that has really been returned  does not correspond to the truth. (Editorial note: According  to the most recent data published by the National Statistics  Institute, previous owners have claimed 52,520,000 decares of  agrarian land. Some 28,877,000 decares have been returned to  private owners, and this represents 47.4 percent of the total  land that has been claimed.) What the newspaper refers to is  rather acknowledging ownership without issuing an appropriate  document or determining the borders of the plots.    [Petrova] Will returning the land, a reform to which you  attribute great importance, really stimulate the development of  our economy?    [Zhelev] Naturally, there will be only a few people who will  be able to establish solid agrarian companies. In the next 5-10  years in Bulgaria the cooperative form will be the dominating  one.    [Petrova] Mr. President, after this somber assessment of  what has been achieved in the last four years, what is your  forecast regarding the cabinet's fate after the Easter recess?    [Zhelev] I refrain from any forecast. This is a complex  issue.    [Petrova] What makes you uneasy and prevents you from  answering?    [Zhelev] This is the business of the parliament. We are a  constitutional state, despite the fact that our constitution is  not perfect.    [Petrova] Does Bulgaria need a new or a reshuffled  government?    [Zhelev] I refrain from answering, but I think that  reshuffling the government is not the correct road. We must  have early elections.    [Petrova] When do you think the Bulgarians will be ready to  head for the polling stations?    [Zhelev] (laughing) If you want to wait for the Bulgarians  to be ready for new elections.... Even when the mandate of this  cabinet expires the Bulgarians will not be ready for new  elections.    [Petrova] Then?    [Zhelev] The parliament members will not want to lose their  privileges -- salaries, Mercedes cars, immunity, and influence  over the mass media. The trade unions, the extraparliamentary  forces, and public opinion must be activated. They must prepare  the ground for early elections. Otherwise the current  parliament will do everything possible to reproduce itself.    This also is the reason why the parliament refuses to  dissolve during the two months that precede the elections. No  deputy will be held responsible for corruption as long as he is  protected by immunity.    [Petrova] Is it true that you will personally support the  candidacy of Dimitur Ludzhev as prime minister of a caretaker or  normal cabinet?    [Zhelev] Ludzhev is not interested in being the prime  minister in a caretaker cabinet. This will be the most stupid  thing he could do, namely, to waste his possibility to enter the  parliament because of serving 2-3 months as the head of a  caretaker cabinet. I think that Dimitur Ludzhev is a capable  politician. He could achieve a lot if he has a stable team.  [passage omitted]    [Petrova] Mr. President, who is the greatest criminal in  Bulgaria?    [Zhelev] (laughing) Not I.</p>

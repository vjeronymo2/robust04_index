			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) BCCI official convicted of aiding profits fraud Correction (published 3rd August 1994) appended to this article. A former senior official with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International was convicted yesterday at the Old Bailey of helping dishonestly to boost the bank's profits by Pounds 250m. Mr Imran Imam, a former accounts officer based at BCCI's London headquarters, was convicted of one charge of conspiring to conceal documents, two of conspiring to falsify records or documents and one of furnishing false information. He was acquitted of one charge of furnishing false information. He was released on bail and will be sentenced next Wednesday. The conviction of Mr Imam marks the fourth successful prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office following its investigation into BCCI. However the prosecution proved controversial, provoking the anger of US prosecutors in the New York District Attorney's Office. They have relied upon Mr Imam as a main witness in the US trials and felt his conviction could taint his reputation as a possible witness. Mr John Moscow, assistant district attorney, told a pre-trial hearing in London that because the US authorities believed the SFO would use Mr Imam as a witness - not put him on trial - they had given the SFO documents relating to Mr Imam. The SFO denies giving an assurance that Mr Imam would not be prosecuted. Mr Imam worked closely with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, and Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, its former president. He helped to boost the bank's profits by falsifying documents relating to loans totalling Dollars 2bn apparently made by BCCI to wealthy customers. BCCI never intended these loans to be repaid but was able to claim it was receiving income in the form of interest and fees from the transactions. Mr Iman himself received interest-free loans from the bank which totalled Pounds 1m. Earlier this month the SFO secured the arrest of Mr Abbas Gokal, the head of the Gulf Group, the international shipping and trade conglomerate which was by far BCCI's largest customer. Mr Gokal was arrested at Frankfurt airport by German police after the SFO received reports that he had left Pakistan where he had remained, safe from extradition, since 1991. Proceedings to extradite him to the UK have begun. The SFO is also considering bringing charges against Mr Naqvi. This will depend on events in the US where he is negotiating a plea-bargain deal with federal prosecutors. He was also sentenced to 14 years imprisonment by the Abu Dhabi authorities. Previous SFO prosecutions over BCCI have led to the convictions of Mr Syed Ali Akbar, a former head of the bank's treasury department, Mr Mohammed Baqi, a former head of Attock Oil, and Mr Nazmu Virani, the former property entrepreneur. CORRECTION In Saturday's report on the conviction of Mr Imran Imam, a former Bank of Credit and Commerce International employee, for offences connected with the inflation of the bank's profits, we reported he received an interest-free loan from BCCI. Mr Imam's loan was not given on any preferential basis.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar finishes higher A rumour that the US and Japan had agreed to a lower yen helped to boost the value of the dollar yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. In an otherwise quiet day in foreign exchange markets, the dollar rose by more than Y2 to a mid-morning high of Y106.55 in European trading as talk circulated that Japan and the US had agreed on a Y110 target for the dollar. The US currency later fell back as the market discounted the rumour, and finished in London at Y105.525, a little over a yen higher than the Y104.40 level where it was trading early yesterday. It ended in New York last night at Y105.70. There was little movement in Europe, with the D-Mark slightly weaker. It finished unchanged against the French franc in London at FFr3.398. Sterling also had a quiet day, ending marginally softer against the D-Mark - DM2.5513 from DM2.5531 on Tuesday - and the dollar  - Dollars 1.4766 against Dollars 1.4785. The origin of the frenzied mid-morning sale of yen was a newsagency report suggesting that the US and Japan had agreed a Y110 target for the dollar/yen. Adding fuel to the fire was talk of the Bank of England intervening on behalf of the Bank of Japan. Neither rumour was confirmed. Later the dollar fell a yen to Y105.50 after Reuters flashed a Japanese 'senior monetary source' saying that such a currency agreement was unlikely, currency levels being the domain of the market rather than governments. Analysts agreed that the sharp movement reflected the nervousness of the market ahead of the weekend G7 meeting. 'It was indicative of the fact that the market is concerned that you could actually see something agreed at the G7 meeting,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, responded positively to the comments of a senior Japanese offic-ial that there might be lee-way on the issue of trade targets. 'Those were pleasant words, but clearly we want action,' said Mr Brown. There was little response in foreign exchange markets to comments made by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress on Tuesday. The gist of his comments, which were successful in calming nerves in jittery bond markets, was that inflation was under control. He said the next movement in interest rates was likely to be up, but gave no indication that this was imminent. Attention has now shifted to the release today of January durable goods orders. Mr Cunningham said this had previously been one of Mr Greenspan's favourite leading indicators, in spite of its volatility. He did not, however, expect it to be used as an excuse for tightening. The German currency had an uneventful day, with most attention focused on the dollar/yen. One area for comment was the Bundesbank's generous repo. The central bank allotted DM82.5bn at a fixed rate of 6.0 per cent, adding a net DM10.3bn to the market at the repo tender. Some dealers said the cash injection could be a sign that the central bank was prepar-ing the way for a return next week to a variable tender, which would indicate a willingness to ease monetary policy. Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Discount, said, however, that it was more likely a reflection of technical factors to do with end of the month minimum reserve requirements. Mr Shaw said he would be surprised if the Bundesbank set a fixed rate repo next week. He added that the central bank's monetary policy would probably be determined in the short term by the outcome of the labour dispute in the engineering industry. The D-Mark has recently been under pressure following fears that the dispute involving IG Metall, the country's largest union, might escalate and cause damage. Recent indications are that the union is seeking to avoid conflict. The Bank of Spain cut its key money rate to 8.50 per cent from 8.75 per cent at the regular repurchase tender for central bank certificates. This was discounted in the market as Spain had already reduced its intervention rate on Friday. The Bank of France monetary council is not expected to announce an easing of policy when it meets today. 'I think they would like to see a cut in the German repo rate first and then more than match it,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International. The Bank of England said it would provide a total of Pounds 2.194bn in its sale and repurchase facilities commencing on February 24. The interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent is in line with repos in its regular money market operations. In its daily operations yesterday the central bank provided Pounds 600m of late assistance, taking total assistance for the day to Pounds 978m, compared to a final forecast of a Pounds 1.3bn shortage. The Bank did not operate in the early round of bill offers, and this pushed the overnight rate to an intraday high of 8.5 per cent.</p>

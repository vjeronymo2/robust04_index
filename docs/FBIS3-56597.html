			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the "Russia"  bloc and candidate for president of the Republic of Crimea, gave  a news conference yesterday. He received 38.5 percent of the  vote on 16 January in the first round of elections. Yuriy  Meshkov told journalists that the persuasive results of the  voting in Crimea testify to the possibility of improving  relations between Crimea and Ukraine and put relations with  Russia on a qualitatively new level.    Responding to a question about a possible reaction from  official Kiev toward new Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov expressed  confidence in the ability of Leonid Kravchuk, as one of the  outstanding politicians of the present time, to regulate the  political situation in Ukraine and beyond. In the words of  Yuriy Meshkov, the Ukrainian president stated earlier that the  dislocation of forces in Crimea ruled out a forcible  intervention from outside, since it would lead to unforeseen  consequences. "I have no grounds for not trusting Kravchuk,"  Meshkov stressed.    In spite of the fact that the central point of Yuriy  Meshkov's electoral program is the holding of an all-Crimean  referendum on the status of the peninsula, the presidential  candidate refrained at the news conference from stating the act  of will by the Crimeans, but noted that this will, which was  expressed during the elections on 16 January, should be given  legal form. [Words indistinct] that the referendum will be held  on 27 March.    Yuriy Meshkov confirmed his position regarding the  nonacceptance of quotas in the Supreme Council of the Republic  of Crimea for deported peoples, noting that quotas for Crimean  Tatars in the future parliament would be a violation of the  norms of international law. The candidate for president of the  Crimean Republic described the Assembly of the Crimean Tatars as  a real civil and political force. He also said that Crimea has  enough state attributes but not enough state content: "What we  need are not the outward signs of statehood but the possibility  of resolving all economic, political, and sociocultural issues  by taking into maximum account the Crimean Republic's interests."</p>

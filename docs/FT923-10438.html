			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Prosecution threat to water companies DISCIPLINARY action is being considered against 28 of the 39 water companies in England and Wales over breaches in drinking-water standards, the Drinking Water Inspectorate said yesterday. At least three companies may face prosecution for instances 'where it is very probable that water was supplied that was unfit for human consumption', said Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, presenting the inspectorate's annual report. But he declined to name the companies while investigations continued. The 28 companies that may face disciplinary action include the 10 water-services companies. Nine companies on the inspectorate's list have breached the standards for permissible levels of bacteria in waterworks and five for levels of faecal bacteria. The others are included for bacteria in reservoirs or for supplying inadequate data. However, Mr Healey said drinking water 'is of a very high quality'. 'We are talking about fractions away from perfection.' Even where water failed to pass the inspectorate's standards, which incorporates both UK and EC directives, the inspectorate's advisers had concluded that there was no risk to public health, he added. The comments are likely to fuel the debate about whether the UK's water standards are too high and too expensive. Mr Michael Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 privatised water and sewerage companies, said: 'We have been screaming for the past few years that customers are paying billions in higher water bills for measures not necessary for their health.' Water companies have pledged to spend Pounds 28bn during the 1990s to meet EC standards. Of that, Pounds 1.8bn will be spent by 1995 to meet drinking-water standards. The inspectorate's annual report - the second since it was created in 1990 - showed an apparent deterioration in water quality because of an increase in pesticide levels. A total of 98.7 per cent of tests passed the national legal standards, compared with 99 per cent the year before. However, the 'statistically significant' drop might be due to increased testing for pesticides, the inspectorate said. Excluding pesticides, the 'pass rate' had risen from 99.2 per cent to 99.3 per cent. Drinking Water 1991. HMSO. Pounds 25.</p>

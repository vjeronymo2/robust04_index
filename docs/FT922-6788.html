			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Big aircraft tyre supply order The Dunlop aircraft tyres division, a member of the BTR GROUP, has won a three-year contract worth an estimated Pounds 4.5m to supply the Ministry of Defence with aircraft tyres. This is Dunlop's second successive three-year contract from the MoD and the second time the company has been nominated the main supplier. The construction of the Dunlop aircraft tyre with its multiple piles of fabric reinforcement is designed to combine high performance and long service life. It is also designed to transmit steering and braking forces efficiently and maintain its structural integrity through repeated retreads, unlike a radial tyre. The company has in-house facilities for the dynamic testing of tyres of up to 135,000 lbs load capability and take-off and landing speeds of 335 mph. The aircraft tyres division is based at Fort Dunlop, Birmingham.</p>

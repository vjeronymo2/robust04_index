			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Sunday night [as heard], a pylon of a 110 kv  high-tension power line between Broceni and Skrunda, 3 km from  the Skrunda radar station, was blown up. An investigation into  the incident is currently under way. The explosives used have  not been identified yet. The Skrunda radar station is still  receiving power via another power line from Tukums. Valdis  Lidumnieks, head of the Broceni substation group of the  high-tension power network, reports that the power supply via  the damaged line will be resumed today.    The press center of the Northwestern Group of [Russian]  Forces circulated a statement today saying that a joint  commission of representatives of Latvenergo, the criminal  police, and the Skrunda radar station assessed the explosion as  an act of sabotage. A rapid reaction group from the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, headed by Gunars Liepins, the senior  investigator of the Latvian prosecutor's office for particularly  serious (?cases), has left for the scene of the incident.</p>

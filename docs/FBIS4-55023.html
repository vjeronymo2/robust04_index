			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade 8 May (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], who  arrived in Belgrade today, called for the lifting of the  blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and  announced that his party will do everything to ensure that the  Russian Duma reaches a decision to that effect at its session on  11 May. Asked about the precise date when sanctions against the  FRY will be lifted, Zhirinovskiy said that this will happen "the  day after the results of the elections for new Russian president  are revealed." He pointed out that he will speak at a rally in  Belgrade's Republic Square to mark the 49th anniversary of the  victory against German fascism and imperialism, regardless of  the fact that the rally has been banned.    According to Zhirinovskiy, the ban was not unexpected. He  sees it as a "maneuver" because, as he pointed out, "somebody  wants to be friends with both us and the NATO, but this is  useless." As announced, the leader of the LDPR, who arrived at  the invitation of the Serb National Renewal [SNO], is expected  to meet representatives of the FRY and Serbian assemblies as  well as representatives of the republic of Srpska and the  republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia].    According to Zhirinovskiy, he has arrived in Belgrade  heading  a "specific delegation" consisting of "representatives of  legislative authorities and military experts." During his  meeting with the press he reiterated his opposition to foreign  involvement in the territory of former Yugoslavia and warned  western states against testing the power of the Russian Army.    According to him, there are two solutions to the crisis in  the Balkans -- the first one is for the Balkan peoples to decide  for themselves how they want to live, and the second one is to  send 100,000 or 200,000 Russian soldiers, at the invitation of  the Serbian side, "to bring order to the Balkans within a month."    Zhirinovskiy noted that the LDPR will make efforts to have  the Russian right of veto in the UN Security Council used to  prevent implementation of any measures against the FRY. He  accused NATO of refusing to listen to the "voice of common  sense" from Moscow and of wanting to test the strength of  Russia. "Our army showed what it could do 49 years ago. If they  want to test its power again, they will be able to test it in  their countries' capitals," Zhirinovskiy said. He stressed that  another 22 June (the date when Nazi Germany attacked USSR in  1941) will not happen again, because "we will begin [our  attacks] a few days before that." Stressing that the LDPR is on  the Serb side, he warned: "We can drop ten times as many bombs  on the towns from where the planes which bomb peaceful towns in  Yugoslavia take off."    State Duma Deputy President Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, who is a  member of the delegation, called for a military and political  alliance between the Balkans and Russia. He said that under the  Balkans he also means the new states -- the republic of Srpska  and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]. He said that the  invitations extended to the presidents of the RS and RSK,  Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic, are signs of recognition of  the new states.    SNO president Mirko Jovic explained that the SNO invited  Zhirinovskiy because "the LDPR is the only force in the world  that can destroy the ghastly idea of the so-called unitary world  state," and also because they want to give relevant information  to the Russian delegation, which they will need in the  discussion on the lifting of the sanctions in the Russian  parliament.</p>

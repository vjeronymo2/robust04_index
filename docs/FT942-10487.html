			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures rallied off the bottom towards the close to finish above the June Footsie 3,100 support level, after a session dominated by weakness in gilts and further political uncertainity, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at 3,095. Goldman Sachs executed an order for around 400 contracts shortly after the opening, and June fell back after its completion. The release of higher than anticipated UK consumer credit figures led to a further retreat as lingering hopes of a reduction in interest rates faded. June then traded in a tight range of 3,074 and 3,080 for the next few hours before renewed selling followed the opening on Wall Street. However, firmness in US bonds, together with reports of a big trade in 'over-the-counter' options brought a rally just before the official close and the June contract finished at 3,101, just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume amounted to 12,394 lots. Traded options saw business of 35,436 contracts in total, of which 10,808 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,585 in the Euro FT-SE. A big trade in the Guinness calls and puts made it the day's most active stock option with a total of 5,312 lots. Argyll Group and BP were also busy.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HARRIS: ALL MY WORLD'S ON STAGE  </P> <P> "My hunger for making movies is over," said Richard Harris. "I'm almost 60. I'm  rich. I prefer to do things for my own pleasure."  </P> <P> The actor said he plans to spend the rest of his career working mainly on stage  rather than film.  </P> <P> The lanky, white-haired Irishman, who was homeless and hungry for some months  in London as a young drama student, can now afford to pick and choose his  roles.  </P> <P> Draped in a bathrobe in his cluttered suite in London's Savoy Hotel, the  57-year-old Harris said he plans to play major Shakespearean roles -- King  Lear, Richard III and Shylock -- in London's West End over the next few years  after his latest success there in Pirandello's "Henry IV."  </P> <P> Harris says he prefers to work in the theater rather than film, but adds that  he would do the occasional movie if the script were good enough.  </P> <P> "On stage you have to start your role from scratch at 8 o'clock every night,  and you've got the immediate response from the audience," he said.  </P> <P> "But in Hollywood they're just interested in making money."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth of unknown number of installments: Report on </F> interview with Hu Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang  (1660 2556 0342) specialists of the Group for Analyzing the  National Situation, under the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, by staff reporter Liu Lu (0491 7216); place, date not  given: "High Customs Duties Are Not Beneficial to Opening Up;  Foreign Trade Monopolies Must Be Canceled"]    [Text] Control of foreign trade by the means of import  quotas and import permits has become one of the main sources of  corruption in mainland China's foreign trade sector and  companies. Therefore one of the policy suggestions presented by  Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang to the CPC higher leadership in  their national condition study report entitled "Root Out  Corruption Through Systemic Reform" is "to lower the customs  tariff rate and remove non-tariff trade barriers."    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Although high customs  tariffs can serve to protect national industries in their  infancy, such a policy will be unfavorable to their efforts to  go beyond their infancy. When these industries are monopolized  by a few enterprises, these enterprises may give up their  efforts to upgrade their technology, improve product quality,  and increase their competitive power on the market because they  are protected by high customs tariffs. In any case, they will  continue to enjoy a profit rate much higher than that enjoyed by  other industries. In this regard, mainland China's automobile  industry is a very typical case. The net prices of automobiles,  either completely manufactured automobiles or those assembled in  China, are much higher than the market prices of products in the  same categories in the United States and Japan. Therefore, one  should lower the tariff rate for imported cars by a wide margin  and lift the restrictions on car imports rather than devote much  energy to fighting car smuggling.    Hu and Kang's analysis shows that mainland China's foreign  trade structure, especially the import structure, still retains  some very conspicuous characteristics of the planned economy,  such as foreign trade monopolies, import license and control,  and high customs tariffs. The general managers of some  companies dealing in foreign trade put it bluntly: "If  enterprises were vested with the power to run import-export  trade, what would we rely on for survival?" It is obvious to  all that artificially imposed customs tariff barriers, foreign  trade monopolies, and high tariff rates are, in substance, the  components of a government policy protecting a small number of  government-run organizations, monopoly groups, and vested  interest groups, as well as some manufacturers. This policy has  been hindering the overall opening up of the Chinese economy and  is unfavorable to the effort to promote competition at home and  abroad.    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang have put forward the following  proposals:    -- To lower the customs tariff rate and lift non-tariff  import restrictions. To rescind the import license system for  major commodities, lift administrative control of commodity  imports, reduce tariff rates, and simplify the tariff system.  To withdraw the authorization for localities to reduce import  tariffs or to grant import tariff exemptions. The power to levy  tariffs should go to the central government.    -- To rescind the foreign trade monopolies, authorize  enterprises to handle import-export business directly, and treat  state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises equally.  Enterprises' qualification to run import-export business should  be examined and approved by the departments concerned. Permits  for the import of major commodities can be put on public auction.    -- To lift the ban on foreign-funded business establishments  running commerce, trade, banking, insurance, communications and  transport, postal and telecommunication services, real estate,  and tourism, so as to increase the competitive power of the  domestic tertiary industry sector.    -- To effect a gradual transition to the commodity price  framework of the international market, and to link the  international and domestic markets.    -- To implement a policy to protect China's agriculture and  some industries in their infancy, while introducing a more  liberal policy to mitigate the monopolies in the automobile  industry, the petrochemical industry, and so on.</p>

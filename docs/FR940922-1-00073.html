			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years, the academic and scientific communities have turned their attention to the general issue of conflict of interest on research. One issue that has received particular attention has been the potential for the financial interests of investigators to bias the results of studies. There has been much discussion of the importance of protecting study outcomes from potential bias resulting from investigator interests in the area of applied research, such as research that supports the marketing applications for human medical products. This concern is shared by the PHS and NSF, both of which are currently developing regulations and policies regarding financial disclosure by clinical investigators and by FDA. FDA believes that it is important to the public health to ensure that the data submitted to the agency in support of marketing applications are free of the effects of such bias as much as possible. The agency has concluded that this regulation requiring certification and disclosure of certain financial information of clinical investigators is necessary to enable FDA to approve human medical products on the basis of valid, reliable, and unbiased data. FDA believes that the regulation is fully authorized under sections 505, 510(k), 513, 515, 519, 520(g), 522, and 701(a) of the act, and by section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing these reporting requirements because the information received will enable the agency to determine the reliability of data submitted in marketing applications more effectively. More effective review of products proposed for marketing provides greater protection to the public health, and therefore results in improved implementation of the act. FDA believes that it is essential to be able to inspect the underlying documents forming the basis of a sponsor's certification or disclosure statement. Access to these records is consistent with the agency's overall statutory authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological product, and devices. FDA's authority to require maintenance of records and to provide for agency access to these records was upheld in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Confectioners Association  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Califano,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 569 F.2d 690 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Alternatives Considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA considered several approaches to handling the issue of potential bias of research data resulting from the financial interests of clinical investigators before deciding to adopt the certification and disclosure procedures described in this document. Two other obvious possibilities would be the prohibition of certain financial interests by the agency, e.g., compensation in the form of equity in the firm, and divestiture by the investigator of a prohibited interest. FDA believes that prohibition and divestiture of financial interests might have a disproportionate and unduly severe effect on certain industries in which an individual who has the closest financial ties, e.g., the inventor of a device being tested, is often involved as an investigator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In other situations, such as small start up biotechnology firms, payments to clinical investigators are sometimes made in the form of equity interests, such as stock options, because these firms have limited capital. These industries rely heavily on such arrangements because they are young and not well capitalized and yet are highly creative and produce many novel products. In addition, the agency believes that the proposed approach is more appropriate in light of the fact that a number of Federal programs have been created in recent years specifically to encourage partnerships between industry, academia, and Government in the belief that such relationships result in important innovation. Examples of such programs include the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;480), which encourages technological transfer, particularly through collaboration between industry and the academic community. The Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;517) allow universities and other funding recipients to apply for patents developed with Federal funding (rather than awarding such rights to the Government), and expressly promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;34) is aimed at fostering research and development by small companies and associated university partners. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;502), which amended Pub. L. 96&hyph;480, and Executive Order 12592, provide similar patent and licensing authority to Federal laboratories and encourage them to participate in cooperative research and development agreements with the private sector and nonprofit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

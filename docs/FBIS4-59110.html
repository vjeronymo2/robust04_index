			<p>BFN     [Text] Through its Arabic service, which is controlled by  British intelligence, London radio has interviewed the wife of  the Saudi dissident Muhammad al-Mas'ari, a prominent member of  the human rights committee in Saudi Arabia, who now lives in  Britain. Mas'ari's wife said in the interview that she and her  family are being harassed by the Saudi authorities and that the  latter arrested three of her husband's brothers.    Commenting on this, JANA's Arab affairs editor says: For the  second time in a few days London radio's Arabic service, which  is controlled by the British intelligence, has attacked the  Saudi authorities and reported news, statements, and information  which tarnish the reputation of the Saudi political regime in  such a way that it can clearly be considered as blatant  interference in Saudi internal affairs. Despite this, no Saudi  official reply has been made.    The editor wondered: Why does Saudi Arabia not reply to and  protest this British Government radio station which is being  incited by British intelligence to insult Saudi Arabia and  attack its regime. What would have happened if what this radio  has done had been done by an Arab radio or other Arab media.  Would Saudi Arabia have remained silent and accepted it with  magnanimity, as it once accepted what was published by the U.S.  TIME magazine, which is linked to U.S. official circles, and  what is broadcast by the Arabic service of the British radio  station which is controlled by British intelligence?</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 In a move clearly designed to defuse the current crisis over the  nuclear issue, Pyongyang has accepted Seoul's proposal to hold a  vice premier level meeting next week to prepare for an inter-  Korean summit.   Although Pyongyang media portrayed in a positive  light former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's recent visit--at which  North Korean President Kim Il-song broached the proposal for a  North-South summit--North Korean media have not acknowledged  foreign reporting that it was Kim who initiated the current move  toward an inter-Korean summit during Mr. Carter's visit.                             END SUMMARY   Pyongyang's acceptance, which came in a 22 June "telephone  message" from Premier Kang Song-san to ROK Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok (Pyongyang radio, 22 June), seemed calculated to project  an image of sincerity.  In a departure from the longstanding  inter-Korean practice of counterproposing sundry amendments to  the other side's proposal, Kang said that the North Korean  delegation will be headed by "an official of a vice-premier  level" and that it will be at Panmunjom on 28 June, as suggested  by the South.  Eschewing snide remarks that often marked  Pyongyang's past communication to Seoul (SEE NOTE), Kang  "welcomed" the South's "readiness" to hold a summit.   (NOTE: For instance, in a 6 September 1993 telephone message on  the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, Kang told his  Southern counterpart that it was fortunate that the South,  "although belatedly," came to an "understanding of the true  meaning" of envoy exchange (Pyongyang radio).)   Justification for Shift     Kang sought to justify the abrupt  turnabout in North Korean policy--from the months-long  vilification of ROK President Kim.Yong-nam as a "traitor" to  Kim's acceptance by Pyongyang as a dialogue partner of "the Great  Leader"--by essentially denying that there has been any change.  Ignoring the fact that Seoul's call for the preparatory talks was  in response to Kim Il-song's reported initiative, Kang depicted  the South Korean proposal as in conformity with the North's long-  standing and "consistent" policy of seeking to "remove distrust  and confrontation" between the two halves of Korea through summit  talks.  Appealing to the nationalistic aspirations of South  Koreans, Kang reiterated Pyongyang's call to achieve  "independent" national reunification "without relying on outside  forces."  He did not acknowledge the go-between role reportedly  played by former U.S. President Carter.   Carter Visit     Pyongyang's treatment of the former President's  15-18 June visit seemed designed to show that, despite its  confrontational behavior in recent weeks,  North Korea still  hopes to salvage its relations with the United States.  While  President Kim Il-song's talks with Mr. Carter were routinely  reported to have held in a "sincere" and "warm" atmosphere  (Pyongyang radio, 16 June, KCNA, 17 June), Kim, in a gesture  reserved only for the most distinguished of foreign visitors,  personally accompanied the former President on a visit to one of  the country's "gigantic" construction projects (KCNA, 17 June).  Pyongyang radio also portrayed North Korean Foreign Minister Kim  Yong-nam as being upbeat about the prospects for improved  relations, quoting him as describing Mr. Carter's "extraordinary  visit" as a possible beginning of a "gradual" process of turning  the current "distrust and hostility" between the two countries  into "good-neighborliness, friendship, and mutual respect."  The  radio also quoted Foreign Minister Kim as stating that all U.S.-  North Korean problems, including the nuclear issue, can be solved  if the United States respects North Korea's "sovereignty" (16  June).   In a further indication of North Korean interest in using the  visit to play up the prospects for improved relations with  Washington, Pyongyang radio also reported approvingly, and in  considerable detail, Mr. Carter's comments--made at a post-visit  press conference in Panmunjom--calling for the establishment of  "full relations" between the United States and North Korea.  It  cited the former President as saying that despite "differences of  opinion" between the two countries, outstanding issues can be  resolved through "direct talks."  In addition, the radio cited  him as predicting that the nuclear issue will be resolved  "smoothly" (18 June).   Implications     Pyongyang's willingness to forego polemics with  the South over the summit issue--at least initially--points up  the alarm with which it apparently views the current crisis.  Similarly, North Korean media's upbeat portrayal of Mr. Carter's  visit appears to reflect the North Korean leadership's eagerness  to avoid a showdown with the United States and the international  community.

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONGEST-RUNNING CASE ENDS IN 49-YEAR SENTENCE  </P> <P> The oldest active criminal case in Los Angeles County ended Thursday when  former gang leader Virgil Byars was sentenced to 49 years to life in state  prison for two fatal drive-by shootings.  </P> <P> Byars, 27, turned himself in nearly eight years ago and has been behind bars  ever since. Thursday's sentence, imposed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge  Jacqueline Connor, covers two second-degree murder convictions and guilty  verdicts for three assaults with a deadly weapon and the attempted murder of a  jail inmate.  </P> <P> "We got the max," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Carl Jones called the sentence unduly harsh.  </P> <P> "We won the case at trial," he said, referring to the jury's findings of guilt  on lesser charges than originally sought by prosecutors. "The D.A. is having a  tantrum trying to punish the guy through a harsh sentence."  </P> <P> Byars, whose crimes were among the earliest of the now-epidemic drive-by gang  shootings, had rejected a plea-bargain offer from prosecutors.  </P> <P> He languished in jail for eight years as his case wound its way through the  system, delayed by his dissatisfaction with his court-appointed lawyers and by  his battle to keep tapes of his confession from being admitted as evidence  against him.  </P> <P> Byars fired five of six lawyers who represented him and threatened several of  them, court records show.  </P> <P> When he finally went on trial last year, jurors deadlocked and a mistrial was  declared.  </P> <P> Byars, who said he had no memory of the crimes he was accused of because he was  high on the hallucinogen PCP, was retried and found guilty of the murders last  month.  </P> <P> Byars shot into a car and killed a rival gang member, Cornelius Harris, in 1982  in Southwest Los Angeles, wounding another passenger. Minutes later he fired  into a second car, killing 17-year-old Jody Hayes and wounding two other rival  gang members.  </P> <P> Jones, standing in for Byars' ailing attorney, Joel Isaacson, said an appeal is  planned.  </P></p>

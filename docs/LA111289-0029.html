			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TRAGEDY OF KUSC'  </P> <P> KFAC's demise is difficult for classical music lovers to endure; the continuing  tragedy of KUSC is even more difficult for us.  </P> <P> KUSC seems to have decided to enlarge its format by appealing to a broader  audience. It now features a program of Viennese waltzes, expansion of the news  service to be highly redundant, artsy programs of little merit, and  professional lecturers who would love to educate the listeners to the  highlights of the third movement of whatever symphony.  </P> <P> Music lovers implore KUSC's board of directors to return to a largely mature  classical format, omitting such programs. Short of this happening, the  listening base of KUSC will surely be eroded.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE A. SHAPIRO  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P></p>

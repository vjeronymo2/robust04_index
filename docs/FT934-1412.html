			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The secrets of Speyside - Giles MacDonogh on why a great malt can't be made in a bath tub Speyside malts have a cachet which is denied to other whiskies. The concentration of so many famous distilleries along the banks of the rivers Spey and Livet, in a region circumscribed by the rivers Findhorn and Deveron, creates a geographical image of quality every bit as tangible as Pauillac or the Cotes de Nuits. Whisky is not wine, though. To a large extent, it is created by the engineers who design the stills. Even so, the influence of geography and geology cannot be written off. As Bill Crilly, a chemist who manages the Tamdhu distillery, puts it: 'If it were just about engineering, you'd be able to do just as good a job in your bath tub in Islington.' Clearly, water is important; otherwise, they would not have built so many distilleries along the fast-moving Spey. But the water for the mash comes from wells and springs, not the river. In general this is pure, soft water - although Glenlivet uses a hard water, which runs over limestone, in its mash tun. Crilly told me that you could not make good whisky from hard water. I mentioned Glenmorangie. He smiled. There are mixed views, too, about the sort of barley you use. At the Macallan, they insist that the blend is 75 per cent Golden Promise and 25 per cent Halcyon, a winter barley from England. Others pour scorn on this exclusiveness: they say the quality of the barley is measured by its yield alone and that you cannot taste the difference from one whisky to another. Frank Newlands, at the Macallan, disagrees: 'We had some disgusting stuff called Tyne once. We couldn't use it.' You can taste the difference in a beer; and whisky, essentially, is distilled beer. In the distillery, this beer goes by the name of wash. Some washes smell (and even taste) better than others. Distillers set great store by the friendly bacteria which live in the big, wooden washbacks. They also create flavour in the whisky. Like a lot of wine, the wash undergoes two fermentations: first tumultuous (or 'alcoholic' ) and then malolactic. The more vigorous the first, says Crilly, the better the whisky. Then, there is the crucial factor of the stills, where size and shape are all-important. The usual line is that large, formless stills make dull whisky. They should be small, with bumps called 'boil pots', or with a wide head to give the whisky complexity. The most important of the two stills is the wash still in which the whisky has its first distillation. Here, the sweet esters are created. The whisky should not be made too quickly: about 10 litres a minute is a good rate. Some distilleries run their stills too quickly - an operation known as 'thrashing'. At 35 litres a minute, you will get nasty flavours in the spirit and it can smell of old dishcloths. One or two commercial malts on the market have this odour. The spirit which leaves the second still will be around 66 per cent alcohol on Speyside. This will be broken down with spring water and run into casks. Here is another important factor: the quality of the wood. There is a lot of rotten stuff about, created by the enormous demand for whisky in the 1970s and '80s. Highland distillers are rather sensitive about wood. Casks which do not appear to marry up with the spirit are marked DNR (do not re-use) and thrown out. Age has much to do with quality, too. The youngest whiskies on the UK market are eight-year-olds, such as Glenfiddich and Tamdhu. At this age, there is not a lot of complexity to be had. Quality begins with malts 10 and 12 years old. In the old days, it was said that whisky got 'oily' or 'woody' or 'heavy' after 15 years; but this was true only if the whisky had been matured badly. There are enough 25-year-olds around now to prove how false this argument was. Responsible distillers try to put out their malts at the optimum ages. Glen Grant tends to be rather one-dimensional so that, even at 10 years, it is a pale whisky which smells of little more than honeycomb. Both it and Glenlivet belong to the giant Seagrams group, which has been hiding some of its greatest Speyside treasures in blends such as Chivas Regal, 100 Pipers and Passport. Strathisla is a gem of a distillery in the town of Keith. Its dumpy stills produce a heavy, nutty whisky at 12 years, with vanilla flavour coming from bourbon barrels. Longmorn has long been a favourite among blenders, but outsiders have had little chance to savour the rich delights of its honey and flowers bouquet at 12 or 15 years. There is some good news, however. Seagrams has decided to launch four new bottlings from its Speyside distilleries next year: Benriach, Glen Keith, Strathisla and Longmorn. In the case of Longmorn, this is long overdue: here, elements combine with that little touch of sweetness to make the quintessential Speyside malt.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / De Klerk warns of war if talks fail MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, warned yesterday that South Africa faced a 'devastating war' if talks on a post-apartheid constitution do not succeed. Speaking at the opening of parliament, which excludes blacks, Mr de Klerk said he was confident that a transitional multi-party administration, charged with leading the country to its first one person, one vote election, could be in place by mid-year. He called for a bill of rights to be introduced during this transition period. However his ministerial colleagues, speaking before the opening of parliament, illustrated divisions among government negotiators which could well delay the talks, and force changes in Mr de Klerk's timetable. Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order and a member of Pretoria's negotiating team, insisted the government would not agree to a new constitution unless it ordained permanent, compulsory power-sharing between blacks and whites, while other members of the government negotiating team say this demand has now been dropped. Mr Kriel said differences also remained between the African National Congress and the government over re-incorporation of the nominally independent black homelands, devolution of powers to regional governments and the future of political armies. Other members of the negotiating team insisted there were no further fundamental differences on these issues. However, Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC spokesman, said Mr de Klerk's speech was 'extremely disappointing . . . The country has been terribly let down.' 'Instead of measured steps to involve his negotiating partners more deeply in the process of transformation he has chosen to cast himself and his government as managers of the process,' he said. Mr Pik Botha, the Foreign Minister, briefing reporters before the president spoke, warned of 'grotesque and awesome' consequences if political leaders did not reach agreement, drawing a parallel with Yugoslavia. 'Unless through the process of give and take, realistic agreement is reached . . . then devastation would follow,' he said. Mr de Klerk said 1992, when multi-party talks collapsed in acrimony, was particularly bad. But he said a new spirit was abroad now. Much work had to be done before binding agreements were reached on the transition to democracy, but he said multi-party negotiations could resume in March, resulting in a transitional executive council in June and a transitional constitution by September.</p>

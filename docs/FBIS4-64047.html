			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 26 May -- The "prosperity in unity"  slogan which is written on the Crimean coat of arms today did  not work: The Supreme Council deputies turned down the Cabinet  proposed by the republic's president, Yuriy Meshkov. It has  been decided to return to the discussion after Vice President  Yevgeniy Saburov provides the Supreme Council permanent  commissions a detailed structure of the Cabinet of Ministers, in  which several posts have been offered to politicians and  economists from Moscow.    The discussion in which representatives of different  parliamentary groups took part demonstrated a significant  difference of opinion. To a certain degree it confirmed the  president's description of the evolved situation as the "third  government crisis." Yuriy Meshkov's demonstrative gesture  increased the impression when he left the room when his proposal  was rejected together with the Cabinet which was not approved.    Nevertheless, behind the scenes there is an opinion that the  deputies will be able to find a mutually acceptable way out of  the evolved impasse.    The session will continue tomorrow.</p>

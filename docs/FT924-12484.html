			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Germany determined not to build Eurofighter GERMANY stood firm yesterday in its determination to scrap the four-nation European Fighter Aircraft project in spite of industry estimates that production costs could be cut by 20 per cent. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, dismissed suggestions by his UK counterpart, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, that Bonn might still opt for a revised version of the Pounds 20bn EFA. 'The aircraft will not be built,' he said. Bonn wants the other partners to agree to switch EFA funding to a new aircraft, and in the meantime to slow down development work. But Mr Ruhe made clear last night he was not seeking to build an aircraft without Britain. Budget pressures in all four countries were working in favour of Germany's arguments, he said, adding: 'I don't think the streets of Birmingham are plated with gold and silver.' He questioned whether Britain's coalminers would understand the need for continuing the EFA project. Mr Ruhe and Mr Rifkind avoided the subject when they met for breakfast before a Nato ministerial meeting yesterday at Gleneagles, in Tayside, Scotland. The industrial consortium developing the aircraft sent its confidential study on possible cost savings to the four governments at the end of last week. Mr Rifkind, describing the study as 'most encouraging', said it indicated that costs could be lowered by some 12 per cent by rationalising production arrangements. Removing some of the aircraft's capabilities could increase this to 20 per cent, he said. UK industry representatives said the savings could go as high as 30 per cent. Spain, the junior partner alongside Germany, Britain and Italy, indicated it would support going ahead on the basis of a 30 per cent reduction. However, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, its defence minister, said production would need to be stretched out because of budgetary constraints. Spain said last week it was committed to keeping a four-nation programme and wanted to make the most of the Pounds 5bn already invested in EFA. But production should be delayed 'by some years'. Defence ministers are expected to decide on the future of the project in early December. The German minister said yesterday he had not seen the results of the industrial study, but that there were 'differences of conception' with Britain, especially over the need for a fighter to undertake overseas missions. Germany sought 'a European fighter, not a world fighter', he said.</p>

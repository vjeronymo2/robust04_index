			<p>BFN     [Text] Rosa Elena Simeon, president of the Cuban Academy of  Sciences [title as heard], said today in Barbados that highly  qualified human resources are Cuba's essential instruments to  trigger sustainable development.    Speaking during the First International Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Insular States, Simeon, who is  the minister of science, technology, and the environment, said  that in our country there are hundreds of thousands of workers,  technicians, professionals, and scientists capable of finding  alternative ways to progress, despite the difficult situation  the country is enduring.    The global conference must prepare the Barbados Declaration  which will outline the essential guidelines and the financing to  implement the sustainable development programs agreed upon.</p>

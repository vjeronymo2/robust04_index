Kang Ung-chae, vice-chairman of the State Planning  Commission, said: "The letter of the great leader is a highly  important guideline which we must always follow unswervingly in  the efforts for the ultimate solution of the rural question  under the banner of the socialist rural theses.    "Officials of our commission, bearing deep in mind their  heavy duty for the times and the revolution, will map out plans  in detail and dovetail them to ensure that raw and other  materials are supplied in time to chemical fertilizer factories."    Yu Si-yong, vice-president of the University of National  Economy, had this to say:    "The letter of the great leader is an immortal classical  work  which consummates all the theoretical and practical questions  arising in making a new advance in the socialist rural  construction of our country and a great programme of rural  construction which clearly indicates the way of socialist rural  construction.    "We will deeply study and grasp the ideas and theories laid  down in the letter and thoroughly apply them to scientific  research, teaching and education, thus firmly preparing the  students to be true revolutionaries and competent economic  management officials who resolutely struggle for socialist rural  construction and for the accomplishment of the cause of  our-style socialism."    Chairman of the management board of the Changchon  cooperative  farm in Sadong district, Pyongyang, Kim Myong-yon, said that the  officials and agricultural working people of the farm who  received the letter of the great leader with deep emotion and  joy are filled with an ardent resolve to carry through the  agrarian policy of the Workers' Party of Korea under the banner  of the socialist rural theses. She said they would bring about  a greater upsurge in agricultural production this year in which  fell the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses.    Yi Chong-chun, chief secretary of the Kaechon City, South  Pyongan Province, committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, said  the city party committee would firmly unite the agricultural  working people around the party and the leader and consolidate  the party's rural foundation by carrying through the rural  policy of the party pursuant to the tasks laid down in the  letter of the great leader, so that uninterrupted innovations  may be effected in agricultural production.</p>

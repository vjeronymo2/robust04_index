			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yevgeniy Kiselev on interview with </F> Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray; place and date of  interview not given; from the "Itogi" newscast]    [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Kiselev] So you did not know  at all that a decision on your resignation was being prepared?    [Shakhray] I learned about the decision after it was made,  and the same applies to the new minister. Formally, from the  legal point of view, the decision is correct. But there is also  such thing as official or human ethics. Therefore, my decision  to resign was prompted not by emotions -- I had time to think it  over -- but by the fact that ethical norms were violated.    [Kiselev] Are you under the impression that all this is kind  of natural since people from the 1991 August-December period are  now leaving the pinnacle of state power and the president is  parting with those who featured at the beginning of his activity.    [Shakhray] You know, my feeling -- or observation, rather --  is that it is difficult for the president to part with people he  has worked with for a long time. He finds this difficult as a  person. Psychologically, this may show in the fact that after  spending a long time trying to resolve a cadre issue, he makes a  decision in a very sudden and resolute manner, as if tearing  this problem away from him, so to speak, tearing it like one  pulls a knot without untangling it. And then we have many  examples when we usually say that a person who has been fired  found out about his resignation...    [Kiselev, interrupting] Do you think that the president's  decision not to accept your resignation, which was read by his  press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, also proves the fact that  a person finds it difficult to part with his colleagues.    [Shakhray] May be, may be. The other thing is that it should  not have been announced by the esteemed Mr. Kostikov. I am not  going to mention any personal assessments or lexicon which was  used at the time but if it were up to Kostikov to decide, he  would have accepted my resignation. [passage omitted]    [Kiselev] What are the real reasons for your resignation?  Why is it that you were notified without any warning, that you  were simply told that you were no longer the minister for the  affairs of nationalities?    [Shakhray] If no motives or reasons are stated in the  document releasing me from the post of minister, we can only  learn them from either the prime minister or the president.  Everything else is just our suppositions. The ministry has  become a real tool in the management system. I'll tell you why.  [words indistinct] the ministry has real means, power, and  financial levers in its hands. For example, seven trillion  rubles [R] for Russia's north will be handled by the ministry as  well as R40 billion for Russia's Germans in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements concluded between Russia and  Germany, and R20 billion for the budget fund to support Russia's  peoples which is, in essence, Russia's national policy of  cultural revival of its peoples and which encompasses textbooks,  languages, training of ethnic cadres, and so on. As soon as the  ministry becomes a real institution, its ministers are replaced.  It is obvious that those who are behind the decision believe  that somebody else should operate the control levers. This is  the financial reason of what happened. There are also purely  political reasons, namely that the ministry is headed by the  leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord.    I think this is the outcome of maneuvering which has been  going on for many months. Not all of those drawn into these  maneuvers even realize what has been going on.    [Kiselev] What is the origin of these maneuvers, as you put  it, these intrigues if you like, which have been hatching for  some time? Is it the presidential office or the Federation  Council? Or do they originate here, within the Council of  Ministers?    [Shakhray] Well, again, you and I can only conjecture and  assume. I think that the prime minister demonstrated one of his  characteristics. He does not like reshuffling ministries or  governments which he is working with. He prefers to work with  experienced people. So, this maneuvering does not originate  with the government. I believe in the principle: Don't judge if  you don't wish to be judged yourself. So I won't throw stones  of accusation in any direction. I think that all those who have  a stake in this maneuvering have drawn the spotlight on  themselves without any help from others. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    There are many hypotheses about the reasons for Shakhray's  resignation. One which deserves special mention is the Chechen  connection, the claim that Shakhray's departure is connected  with serious disagreements within the Russian leadership about  the problem of a settlement with Chechnya. When I asked  Shakhray what lay behind these disagreements, he said:    [Begin Shakhray recording] I really feel uncomfortable even  talking about this. Why? Because this is not the view of  Shakhray, or the view of Shumeyko and Filatov, who allegedly  represent a different point of view. The fact is that a formula  for settling this conflict is contained in the president's  message and in parliament's decision, that is, talks and  consultations with the Chechen authorities and consultations  with all political forces in Chechnya. The subject of these  consultations must be a draft treaty on the delimitation of  responsibilities and powers. Then the treaty must be signed  after elections have been held -- in 1994 or 1995, though the  date of the elections is not the issue. If esteemed Vladimir  Filippovich or anybody else says that it will not be done that  way, that we will solve the Chechen problem a different way, he  will be changing the president's official line, changing the  State Duma's official line. The entire logic of events is  leading up to the following scenario: One of the Chechen  leaders will normalize relations with Russia and do his people a  favor and himself a favor as a political leader.    All the intrigue began because esteemed Ruslan Imranovich  Khasbulatov arrived in Chechnya. His contacts with aides to  Rutskoy and other politicians convince me that he will not sit  idle there for long. He will behave as politicians do. He will  enter the federal elections, if they are held there under, say,  an outline agreement for normalization of relations between  Chechnya and Russia. Then a completely different fate will  await other politicians.    So, the personification of figures within the Chechen  Republic, taken together with their previous incarnation on the  Russian Mount Olympus, leads to what you call different  approaches. These are not different approaches. I personally  believe, all told, that the important factor from Russia's point  of view is not personalities -- Shakhray, Ivanov, Sidorov, or  somebody else. The important thing is to ensure that this  tendency, political and economic normalization of relations as a  whole, strengthening of Russia's unity and integrity, should  make headway. [end recording]    Let us focus on three aspects of Sergey Shakhray's interview  which vividly illustrate Russian politics. First, as soon as  any state official gets his hands on real political -- and  especially economic -- levers of power, he immediately becomes  the target of fierce attack from other politicians -- not  necessarily from within the camp of his hardline opponents,  either.    Second, the interview shows quite clearly that on the  Russian  political Olympus there are figures who fear the prospect of  Ruslan Khasbulatov's return to politics more than they fear the  prospect of endless crisis in Russian-Chechen relations.    Last, in spite of everything, Shakhray displays in this  interview maximum loyalty to the president -- and not just in  the interview. He has, as it were, left the door open, saying  that he will not make a final decision on whether to resign or  not from the post of deputy prime minister until he has had  talks with the president -- talks which will probably be held  next week. However if, as he has said, Shakhray realizes as a  result of these talks that it will be impossible for him to  operate normally as deputy prime minister responsible, in  particular, for ethnic and regional policy, his decision to  resign will stand.

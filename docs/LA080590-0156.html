			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> UKIAH;  </P> <P> MARIJUANA PATROL TEAMS SENT HOME  </P> <P> While federal agents prowled remote mountain areas on a sweep to uproot  marijuana, local authorities were forced to send their eradication teams home  because of funding problems.  </P> <P> Mendocino County is disbanding its marijuana team today because the state has  not renewed its funding. The sheriffs of Trinity and Humboldt counties plan to  dissolve their teams unless they get state help. State and federal agents last  weekend began "Operation Green Sweep," which they said was the largest  anti-marijuana operation ever conducted on public land. Since 1984, the state  has provided the three counties with money to patrol the mountains and yank the  illegal plants, valued at up to $3,000 each. Last year the counties received a  total of $2.2 million.  </P></p>

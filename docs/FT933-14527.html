			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / People: Eleco snaps up Callaghan as its chief executive Eleco, the building products, contracting and distribution company, has replaced its former chief executive 41-year-old Michael Webster, who had been in the position for the past six years, with Australian-born Peter Callaghan. Chairman Field Walton explains: 'We had some rather dreadful interim results, which had concerned the whole board.' In February, the company reported a Pounds 2.21m loss for second half 1992. Together with two recently appointed non-executives, Walton says he approached the executive management and explained that he expected to see changes. 'It was the style of management more than anything else. The approach had worked very well for acquiring businesses. But the new acquisitions tended to have been treated as investments. The (recessionary climate) demanded more hands-on management.' Of Callaghan, he says: 'It is amazing he has not been snapped up before now,' adding that he is 'very user-friendly and has a good sense of humour'. His 'hands-on' management abilities, Walton believes, were demonstrated at Camford Engineering, where he was co-opted as deputy chairman by Markheath Securities to turn round the automotive components manufacturer before selling it on to Hoesch. It is understood Callaghan was offered a job by Hoesch both at its German headquarters and in Houston, within its American operation, but that he had declined. For the past 18 months he has been doing corporate advisory work. A production engineer by training, 42-year-old Callaghan also studied business administration in the early 1980s at the New South Wales Institute of Technology - where, coincidentally, Walton had once been offered a teaching post. He then worked for Australian resources company Peko Wallsend before moving to Natcorp Investments where he was operations director.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HSBC lifts Hang Seng index 3%, Nikkei firm Active buying by foreign investors pushed share prices higher, and the Nikkei average briefly recovered the 20,000 technical resistance level before losing some of its gain on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average finished 193.82 up at 19,997.20 after opening at a day's low of 19,848.58 and peaking at 20,117.21 in the morning. Foreigners supported shares, but selling by institutional investors pushed down the index in the afternoon. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 21.84 to 1,631.71, while the Nikkei 300 put on 4.16 at 302.23. Rises outnumbered declines by 810 to 244, with 129 issues unchanged. Volume amounted to 430m shares, against 447m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.74 firmer at 1,363.01. The yen's appreciation against the dollar prompted most investors to remain on the sidelines. The Japanese currency closed Y0.65 up at Y104.30, the first rise to the Y104 level since February 18. Some currency traders, who had hoped that a solution for the yen's recent surge would be discussed at the finance ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries over the weekend, bought the yen. Electronic stocks and large-capital steels were sought by foreign investors. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y13 to Y950 and Toshiba Y17 to Y773. Nippon Steel gained Y3 at Y352 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Y7 at Y707. Multimedia related stocks continued to gain ground. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone climbed Y24,000 to Y976,000 and NEC Y10 to Y1,050. Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan moved up Y50 to Y3,320 and Sakura Bank Y40 to Y1,510. Brokers were also strong, with Nomura Securities adding Y60 at Y2,380 and Nikko Securities Y70 at Y1,390. Trading of shares in Daiei Finance, a consumer credit company belonging to the Daiei consumer group, was suspended in the afternoon following reports of a merger. The company said it will be merging with Riccar and Asahi Agency Travel, two other companies in the Daiei group. Profit-taking depressed some electrical machinery shares. Casio Computer fell Y40 to Y1,300 and Akai Electric slipped Y10 to Y440. In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 194.00 to 22,138.88 in volume of 80.4m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suit retailer, dropped Y190 to Y5,940 following weekend reports that it was under investigation by the Fair Trade Commission on alleged false advertising of its suits. Roundup The region's markets had mixed performances yesterday. HONG KONG finished sharply higher on a technical rebound from last week's heavy losses and on fresh demand ahead of results of HSBC Holdings which were due out later yesterday. The Hang Seng index jumped 309.98, or 3.07 per cent, to 10,410.23, off the day's high of 10,462.63. Turnover totalled HKDollars 4.5bn, down from last Friday's HKDollars 7.2bn. Brokers said a technical rebound was expected after the market's plunge of 725.63 last week. After the market closed, HSBC said 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.58bn, up from Pounds 1.71bn in 1992. HSBC shares rose HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 114 and led the actives list. Its Hang Seng Bank unit gained HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 69.50. Tuesday's government land auction of three residential sites is expected to attract strong interest, said brokers. The property sector sub-index surged 659, or 3.6 per cent, to 19,012.83. MANILA declined steeply following the weak performance last week of Philippine Long Distance Telephone. Brokers said the market was also weighed down by government plans to double the stock transaction tax to 0.5 per cent. The composite index ended 88.52 down at 2,861.61. Turnover came to 861.6m pesos. PLDT fell by some Dollars 5 on Wall Street last Thursday, and the market discounted its slight recovery on Friday. The local price for PLDT dropped 55 pesos to 2,035 pesos. TAIWAN shed 3.1 per cent to end at its lowest level this year in very bearish trade. Margin loan calls produced persistent selling pressure and the prices of major banks collapsed. The weighted index lost 175.63 at 5,414.64 in turnover of TDollars 52.9bn. The financial sector plunged 5.3 per cent, with the Big Three banks closing at or near the day's limit down. BANGKOK tumbled 3.3 per cent to close the day at 1,372.93, down 46.61, on nervousness ahead of local elections this weekend. BOMBAY closed slightly higher ahead of the budget announcement, which came after the close of business yesterday. However, the market moved further ahead in a 90-minute post-budget session, the BSE 30-share index firming 51.02 to 4,287.98. AUSTRALIA bounced back after successive falls to close higher, boosted by steadier overseas markets and a jump in the futures sector. The All Ordinaries index rose 31.3 to 2,180.1. Turnover amounted to ADollars 367.6m. News Corp led the way, gaining 31 cents at ADollars 10.06 with 2.4m shares traded. NEW ZEALAND rose strongly, retracing some of last week's losses. The NZSE-40 capital index added 28.07 at 2,244.35 in volume of NZDollars 40m.</p>

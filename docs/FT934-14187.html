			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): Beset by political wrangles - German privatisation plans / Deutsche Telekom's ability to invest abroad is hampered by its strained financial situation FOR two years, German political parties have been haggling about Deutsche Telekom, the greatest plum in the slow-moving German privatisation process. So far, all that has emerged is a four-page document which is expected to be submitted to parliament this autumn. Inter-party agreement is essential, in order to secure the special parliamentary majority required to amend the German constitution, which defines telecoms as the responsibility of the federal state. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were not enamoured of the initial plan put forward by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition; to win them over, the government has had to agree an awkward, vaguely-worded compromise. The government's objectives are clear - and echo the pleas of Deutsche Telekom itself. First, the operator urgently needs private-sector funding to see through its heavy investment in eastern Germany. Second, privatisation is essential to reduce the operator's public administration fat, to enable it to compete successfully in the liberalising European telecoms market. Since reunification, Deutsche Telekom, which has a turnover of DM54bn, has been been charged by the government with upgrading the entire basic telephone network for eastern Germany's 7.2m phone users. The company also plans to install 5m cables for television connections, lines for 400,000 faxes and 70,000 public telephones. In total, it has committed DM60bn worth of investments in the east by 1997. Its debt, which stands at DM100bn, is expected to rise to DM140bn by 1995. 'We need DM20bn to DM30bn of new equity if we want to continue out investments in the east,' Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom's forceful chief executive, says bluntly. Mr Ricke, who has openly campaigned for privatisation for two years, stresses the restrictions imposed by the state of the German budget. 'When we go to the finance ministry for funds, they tell us they have the same problem,' he says. Mr Ricke is further concerned that the company's ambitions to expand are limited by its public administration status which legally forces it to cover the deficits of the German post and postal bank. Last year, Deutsche Telekom had to hand over DM1.5bn to the two loss-making enterprises out of its annual DM6.45 annual profits. It is also forced by law to hand over 10 per cent of its revenues to the state budget each year. The company's sales rose by 14.3 per cent in 1992, due mostly to eastern Germany. However, it argues it should no longer have to transfer a fixed percentage out of its gross revenues, pointing to its declining profits which fell in 1992 by 10.4 per cent from DM7bn the previous year. Its hands tied at home, Deutsche Telekom is worried about it ability to be a global telecoms player. The company has been anxiously watching the progress of its private competitors in Britain and the US. 'There is a simple formula,' says Mr Ricke. 'When the world changes in the right direction, and I believe private companies can offer better services to their clients, one must follow it.' But Deutsche Telekom's ability to invest abroad is hampered by its strained financial situation in Germany, he adds. Referring to large joint-ventures between competitors, Mr Ricke says: 'Even if we had wanted to do such a thing, we would not have the means to do it.' As for the government, it is eager to remove the cost of rebuilding infrastructure in the east from the Treasury. And the proceeds from the privatisation, which will be partly used to repay for the prior recapitalisation of the company, could help fill a few gaps in the finances of the federal government itself. However, the path to privatisation is tortuous because of objections voiced by the Social Democrats, who are opposed to the establishment of a private company not subject to state control. Mr Peter Paterna, one of party's leading opponents of 'classical' privatisation, argues that a private Deutsche Telekom will betray the much-vaunted German concept of the Burger Post - the idea of post and telecoms as a utility for all citizens. SPD opposition to privatisation is strengthened by its close links with the 600,000 Post Trade Union, which embraces the telecoms industry. The union is fighting to preserve the employment status of its members, who as civil servants enjoy special rights such as life employment and generous pensions. While civil servants cannot by law be fired, a partly private Deutsche Telekom could implement incentive compensation schemes to discourage poorly performing employees. Early retirement programmes for civil servants could also figure in the company's restructuring programme, which plans to eliminate up to 30,000 jobs in the next fews years from its current 230,000 employees. Compelled to compromise with such demands, the government's four-page document proposes to turn Deutsche Telekom and the post bank into three separate joint stock companies, with a holding company overseeing them. In the case of Deutsche Telekom, the government will retain a 51 per cent stake until monopolies are removed in Europe. It is expected to reduce its stake to a minority share thereafter. The holding company will have 'supervisory and co-ordinating' powers over the joint-stock companies. These powers could extent to 'duties concerning the infrastructure,' a response to the SPD's demand that remote regions are not treated less favourably than urban centres. Moreover, its specifies that wage agreements will be decided at the holding company level, thus allowing the trade union to retain greater wage bargaining power than if wages were decided in the three separate enterprises. These clauses have raised concern about the future ability of Deutsche Telekom to act unhindered from state control. 'I am not sure how a law could encompass all the contradictions in this document,' complains Mr Frerich Gorts, former state secretary at the post and telecoms ministry and charged with writing the bill this summer. 'I cannot turn black into white'. But the government is determined to oversee the contradictions in the document and draft the bill. It is counting on that resistance within the SPD to privatisation is fading in the wake of the decision by the European Community to pry open monopolies and liberalise telecoms in Europe by 1998. For liberalisation has opened the prospect that Deutsche Telekom could lose out in the telecoms competitive battles. Already, Mannesmann, the German engineering group and Deutsche Telekom's newly-arrived competitor in the cellular mobile field, has gained a 50 per cent market share on a digital network installed last year in the country. Much will depend the attitude of hard-line Social Democrats in parliament this winter. The retirement at the end of the year of Mr Emil Block, the vice president of the post trade union and flag-bearer of the hard-liners, could herald a further softening in the opposition's stance. If the bill goes through quickly, the company is hoping for a first tranche of its shares to be floated by 1996. The issue could be worth Dm15bn, according to Mr Ricke and independent analysts. If parliament rejects the bill, such a move could be delayed by a couple of years.</p>

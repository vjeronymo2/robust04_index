			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Captial Markets: SocGen's derivatives boost Societe Generale is preparing to launch a derivative product - known as Boosts - aimed at investors who expect a period of stability in a particular market, writes Tracy Corrigan. Boosts is an acronym for 'Banking on overall stability'. It is designed for long-term institutional investors, particularly those whose funds are limited to certain markets, who seek to enhance their returns during periods of stagnation. The purchaser of a Boost anticipates that a certain instrument, such as a government bond, will trade within a certain band for a specific period of time. Every day the underlying instrument remains in the band, the purchaser earns Dollars 1 (if the underlying instrument is denominated in dollars). Thus if a one-year Boost remains in this range throughout its life, the investor earns Dollars 365 (less the upfront cost of the product). Existing strategies such as 'straddles', 'strangles' and 'butterflies', all using options, express a similar view on the market.</p>

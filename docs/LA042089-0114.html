			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Gunmen attacked the first U.N. food convoy carrying famine relief into  rebel-held areas of southern Sudan and forced it to return to Kenya, a U.N.  official said. One of the trucks was blown up and two Kenyan drivers were  wounded when the convoy came under fire near Kapoeta, in southeastern Sudan,  said Nils Enqvist, the regional coordinator of the U.N. World Food Program for  East Africa. Enqvist said that a military escort provided by the rebel Sudan  People's Liberation Army vanished into the bush as soon as the shooting began,  and the 16-truck convoy turned around and returned to Lokichokio. He said the  United Nations will have to organize combat insurance for its drivers.  </P></p>

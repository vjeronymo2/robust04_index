			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle: "Uncertainty Over </F> Conservatives' Leadership Results in Decline in Polls"]    [Text] Uncertainty and speculation over the leadership in  the Conservative Party have resulted in a strong decline in the  [polling company] Opinion's poll for January.    The Conservative Party has declined by as much as 1.9  percentage points and has the support of only 16 percent of the  voters.    Last Friday [8 January] the TV news program "Dagsrevyen"  announced that Kaci Kullmann Five wanted to withdraw as party  leader. This was confirmed on Saturday by the Conservative  leader who cited strong, personal reasons for her choice.  Speculation surrounding the Conservative Party's leadership  situation dominated the media. The Opinion poll was started on  Monday afternoon and thus includes the reaction of the voters to  the situation within the Conservative Party.    Opinion's background material shows that voters are beset by  confusion: Some Conservative voters who sat out the election  last year say that they will vote for the Conservative Party  next time. The Conservative leader's conduct has created  sympathy for the party within this group of voters. But a far  larger portion of Conservative voters belong to the group of  voters who today are unsure of which party they will vote for.  Some Conservative voters will vote for the Labor Party, while  others will vote for the Progress Party which, thanks to the  problems of the Conservatives and not to their own efforts,  advanced 0.9 percentage points in the January polls.    The crystal-clear trend in the polls is the fact that a  focus  on what is being called the Conservatives' leadership crisis is  creating a feeling of uncertainty among Conservative voters.    However, Opinion's background material also shows that the  Conservatives today take advantage only to a small degree of its  voter potential. The Conservative voters feel uncertain and  frustrated, but only a few are defecting in favor of another  party in the first round. That is why it is crucial for the  Conservatives to clean up their own house.    Voter response to the present-day Conservative Party is very  low, but it is still better now than it was three years ago when  the Conservatives had a record low of 14.4 on Opinion's party  barometer. That was in January 1991, a short time after the fall  of the Syse government. In June 1993, support was at 27 percent,  while it is 11 percent lower today. In other words, it is worth  noting that the support of the Conservative Party has shown  enormous fluctuations in the last few years.    Of most interest today is the fate of the Conservatives, but  it is worth noting that the Labor Party continues to improve its  standing, achieving a response of as much as 41.6  percent--progress of 1.8 percentage points. The Socialist Left  Party is struggling hard, and has slipped by 1 percentage point,  to 7.4. The Center party has improved by 1 percentage point and  has achieved a record of 18.1 percent.

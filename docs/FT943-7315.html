			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Management: Dreaming at the top - Belmiro de Azevedo rose from a poor village background to be chairman of the Sonae group / Euromanager to Watch 'My head is in the clouds but my feet are firmly on the ground,' says Belmiro de Azevedo. The management philosophy of one of Portugal's most successful businessmen is rooted in the down-to-earth values of the poor village where he was born and the capacity to dream that helped him climb to the top. By drawing on the spontaneity, aggressiveness and frugality that characterised his background, Azevedo has built the Sonae group into Portugal's biggest private-sector conglomerate, with 1993 sales of Es228bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The company was an almost bankrupt chipboard producer with an annual turnover of only Es5m when he was taken on as a researcher in 1965. Azevedo, 56, tempers Latin passion with a dedication to education and a determination to rise above local horizons and take a global view. Partly thanks to his efforts, Portuguese management style is no longer a pejorative term used to describe sleepy, family-run businesses unaware of international competitors until it is too late. The son of a carpenter from a village near Oporto, Azevedo was given a job at Sonae soon after graduating as a chemical engineer. The owner was president of the sports club where Azevedo made a name for himself as a handball player. The young graduate turned the business around and was rewarded with equity. As he expanded the group, Azevedo succeeded to the chairmanship, becoming principal shareholder along the way. He is now thought to be the third richest man in Portugal, owning assets worth an estimated Es105bn. Sonae's industrial arm is still focused on wood-based products, a sector where the group dominates the Iberian market and has ambitions to become a European leader. But a perceptive move into distribution in 1982 took it into an altogether bigger league. 'Portugal was in the stone age in terms of retailing and an explosion was imminent,' says Azevedo. Sonae's supermarket and hypermarket chains now lead the Portuguese market and account for 82 per cent of group turnover. Sonae's other core activity is commercial real estate. Normally on the offensive, Azevedo is currently playing a defensive role in Portugal's biggest takeover battle. Led by Sonae, the core shareholders of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the country's second largest bank, are fighting a bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, the fifth largest, to acquire a controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA. Family was the first nest of Portuguese management tradition that Azevedo flew. His own appointment and promotion was based on merit and he enforces the same policy. 'A sense that people will rise just because they are family members is the worst possible climate for a corporation,' he says. 'Following the northern Portuguese custom would make it very difficult for Sonae to motivate the best managers.' However, Azevedo does follow his executives' progress with fatherly concern. Sonae has no human resources division for its 8,790 employees. But Azevedo devotes considerable time to personally guiding the careers of the group's top 100 managers. He is keen to ensure that each manager is in the position where his or her abilities are best put to use. As a result, Sonae has a reputation as a management school equal to any of the specialised academic institutions that have recently emerged in Portugal. Small as Sonae was when Azevedo joined, the company exported to more than 60 countries and he spent three months a year travelling abroad. The international outlook he gained is another quality that distinguishes Sonae from many Portuguese companies. 'We approach strategic and organisational issues in global, regional and local terms and strive to be at the cutting edge of technology at an international level,' Azevedo says. Such is his drive to dominate trends affecting the group that there are often more Sonae managers at international business conferences on relevant issues than all the other delegates put together. One result was that supermarkets in Portugal were unexpectedly the first in Europe to have every checkout equipped with a scanner. Education helped Azevedo rise above his background and today it is one of the assets most valued by Sonae. Azevedo himself spends two to three hours a day studying the latest management thinking and attends courses around the world. Dedication to self-improvement is a feature of the Sonae culture and managers are encouraged to spend time teaching at universities, as Azevedo did during his early career. Azevedo supports academic learning with the common sense values of his upbringing. These tell him, for example, that much current management writing is 'bunk, old-hat or repetitive'. Outside the office, he most enjoys conversing with the small farmers who live near his modest farmhouse. Frugality is a hallmark of Sonae and the successful leveraging of resources has played an important role in the group's expansion. Emotion is also a vital element of Azevedo's management style. 'You can't take a purely scientific approach to innovation. You must have dreams and visions as well,' he says. 'I think Latin managers have more flair for this. The margin of error is higher but they are more aggressive in pursuing new ideas.' Azevedo's own combativeness partly stems from a lifelong passion for sport. He says he is addicted to the 90-minute workout that begins his day. 'We can be aggressive with each other in Sonae. If you are too polite the message sometimes doesn't come across as it should.' The right degree of stress is important, too. 'I don't know of anyone who has broken a world record while they were training,' he says. Azevedo is reluctant to acknowledge criticism that his own pugnacity has, in the past, led to a despotic approach to running Sonae. Today, he says, he is involved in less than 10 per cent of decision-making. Associates commend him for recognising his assertive traits and building mechanisms of control and delegation into Sonae that protect the group from any dictatorial inclinations. Four months' absence following an operation last year showed Azevedo that Sonae could prosper without him. It has also taught him that he can afford to spend less time on close control of day-to-day affairs and devote more to strategic thinking. 'I used to spend about three hours a day taking calls or writing to people,' he says, 'now I've cut it down to 20 minutes.' More time for dreaming . . . with his feet on the ground.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA BRACES FOR NEW ROUND OF LAYOFFS;  </P> <P> WORK FORCE: THE MERGER OF GENERAL DYNAMICS PLANTS IN POMONA AND RANCHO  CUCAMONGA MEANS 1,500 TO 2,000 MORE WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> General Dynamics workers and local businesses last week braced for an uncertain  future after the announcement of widespread layoffs at plants in Pomona and  Rancho Cucamonga.  </P> <P> "You take this to heart," said Kit Ramos, a single mother who has worked for  General Dynamics for five years. Though she hasn't lost her job, she worries  about the future.  </P> <P> Her 17-year-old daughter, Jaymes, and 20-year-old son, Neale, have taken jobs  at a flower shop and a discount store to bolster the family's financial  security. Jaymes said that, while her mother worries about her job, she worries  about her mother. "It's like she's stressed," Jaymes said.  </P> <P> The stress comes in the wake of General Dynamics' announcement last week that  it would merge the Pomona division and its Valley Systems branch in Rancho  Cucamonga, laying off 1,500 to 2,000 employees by the end of next year. Earlier  layoffs, beginning in October, 1987, have already cut employment at the Pomona  plant to 4,100. The Valley Systems plant employs 3,500.  </P> <P> The consolidation, blamed on Pentagon cutbacks, started at the top with the  naming of Michael C. Keel, who had been general manager of Valley Systems, as  head of the combined unit, called the Air Defense Systems Division. Sterling  Starr, who had run the Pomona division, will be reassigned after assisting in  the transition.  </P> <P> The streamlining will leave the company with excess production capacity at its  Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants. Company officials said no decision has been  made on whether to relocate some production lines.  </P> <P> Even with the announced layoffs, General Dynamics probably will remain the  largest employer in Pomona, ranking ahead of the Pomona Unified School District  with 2,680 employees, Cal Poly Pomona with 2,500, Pomona Valley Hospital  Medical Center with 2,249 and General Telephone with 2,200.  </P> <P> H. S. (Biff) Byrum, executive vice president of the Pomona Economic Development  Corp., said the layoffs are bad news but will not drastically damage the local  economy. "It's a different situation for us than if we were some isolated town  in the Midwest," he said. Pomona is part of a region with a broad-based  economy, he noted, and as employment shrinks in one sector, it grows in  another. Besides, Byrum said, "pitifully few" General Dynamics employees live  in Pomona.  </P> <P> Of those who work at the Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants, 640 live in  Pomona, according to company figures. More live in three other cities. Rancho  Cucamonga is home to 1,097 General Dynamics employees, Ontario has 723, and  Upland 665. Claremont, with 216 residents employed by General Dynamics, ranks  ninth, behind Fontana, Chino, Riverside and Rialto.  </P> <P> Steve PonTel, president of the Inland Empire Economic Council, a nonprofit  organization that promotes economic growth in Pomona Valley and San Bernardino  and Riverside counties, said the region's economy has been so healthy for the  past few years that workers laid off by General Dynamics were easily absorbed  elsewhere. The problem now, he said, is that the prospective loss of 2,000 jobs  at General Dynamics coincides with the anticipated loss of 12,000 jobs from  closures at Norton and George Air Force bases in neighboring San Bernardino  County and with a national economic slowdown.  </P> <P> In addition, the construction industry, which is the region's most important  source of jobs, is facing some uncertainty over interest rates. The area's  housing market is already soft, PonTel said, with prices of new homes under  $200,000 leveling off, and builders of more expensive homes having difficulty  making sales and resorting to extra financial incentives to close deals.  </P> <P> Bill Jones, president of the Pomona Valley Board of Realtors, said the number  of houses sold in the Pomona area in June fell by 18% from a year ago, but  there are all sorts of factors at work. Plant layoffs, he said, "have an  effect, but it's very difficult to measure."  </P> <P> Mike Radlovic, senior marketing consultant with Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial  Real Estate Services in the City of Industry, said a recent surge in  construction of small industrial buildings in Pomona could offset some of the  General Dynamics layoffs.  </P> <P> He said industrial developers are being attracted by Pomona's low land costs,  cheaper by half than comparable land in the City of Industry or West Covina,  and by convenient freeway access and a pro-development attitude that contrasts  with slow-growth movements elsewhere.  </P> <P> Jerry Hampel, who runs Berliner Kindl, a German restaurant across the street  from the General Dynamics plant in Pomona, said it stands to reason that  layoffs are going to hurt him but "our business has not gone down at all." Thus  far, he said, other customers have come along to replace those who were laid  off.  </P> <P> His wife, Margo, said she rarely hears customers from General Dynamics talk  about layoffs at lunch because "they want to get away from that. They come in  here to relax." But, she added, "every once in a while someone will say, 'Well,  I got my pink slip today.' "  </P> <P> Margo Hampel said the restaurant, a small, dimly lit place decorated with  pictures of German cities and countryside, with beer steins on the wall and  with folk music playing on a stereo, attracts "secretaries and bosses."  </P> <P> Afew doors away is a restaurant and bar catering to blue-collar workers. A  woman who said she had been working there for 25 years said she talks with a  lot of worried workers from General Dynamics. They "don't know if they're going  to be next out the door or what," said the woman, declining to give her name.  "It's rumors, rumors, rumors. Nobody knows what's going on."  </P> <P> About 2,400 workers are covered by union contracts requiring that layoffs be  made largely on the basis of seniority. Layoff decisions in other cases may  hinge on job performance and skills as well as seniority.  </P> <P> Those who are laid off receive 60 days notice and job placement assistance,  said Ole Olsen, chief of human resources at the Pomona plant.  </P> <P> Olsen said laid-off workers are given help in preparing resumes, counseling on  how to search for a job and access to job listings, word processors and copy  machines. Since the most recent layoff announcements, Olsen said, he has been  receiving calls from employers "all over the place" with job openings for  positions ranging from janitor to senior engineer.  </P> <P> Some laid-off workers can find jobs through the Aerospace Human Resources  Network, which was established to retain skilled aerospace workers in the  industry. "Aerospace is still alive; it's just not as healthy as it was," Olsen  said.  </P> <P> But many aerospace workers will have to start over in new industries at  lower-paying jobs or obtain training for other work, Olsen said. Some laid-off  workers are being referred to the federally funded Employment Training Agency  in Ontario, which arranges for training for a variety of jobs, including  computer drafting, appliance repair, construction work, word processing and  graphic design.  </P> <P> Although their colleagues were worried, some employees remained philosophical  last week.  </P> <P> "It's just the defense budget shrinking," said M. F. Robichaud, a systems  engineer at the Pomona plant. "(Layoffs) are going to happen."  </P> <P> Bill Reid, another systems engineer, also seemed undisturbed. "I'll have a job  someplace," he said.  </P> <P> Not only has General Dynamics been hurt by reduced military spending, but the  Pentagon has changed some procedures, resulting in a loss of business for the  firm.  </P> <P> In trying to cut costs by promoting competition, the Pentagon has sought a  second source of production for all of the weapons systems produced at the  Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga plants. For example, General Dynamics no longer  produces all the Army's Stinger missiles and instead has to compete with  Raytheon for the contracts.  </P> <P> The Pomona division makes the Sparrow air-to-air missile; the Standard missile  for use in air defense of ships, and the Phalanx close-in weapons system to  protect ships against missile attack. Valley Systems makes the Stinger missile  for use by soldiers and the Rolling Airframe missile for ships.  </P> <P> The Pomona plant was established in 1952 to construct surface-to-air missiles  for the Navy. Eric Solander, a company spokesman, said the Pomona site, a  former walnut grove, was chosen in part because it was more than 40 miles from  the coastline and would be out of the attack range of enemy submarines. The  Navy bought the land for the production facility and owns most of the buildings  on the 175-acre site.  </P></p>

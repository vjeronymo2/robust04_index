			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Freight fillip for privatisation TWO COMPANIES gave the government's privatisation plans a fillip yesterday by separately announcing plans to take advantage of the liberalised regime. Mendip Rail, a newly formed company, announced that it was to take over the operation of locomotives belonging to the only two companies regularly operating their own engines on BR tracks and offer freight services in competition with BR. The two companies are Foster Yeoman and ARC, aggregates suppliers with quarries in Somerset. They have agreed to pool their nine locomotives and 600 wagons under the management of Mendip Rail. The new company will be headed by Mr Robin Gisby, founder of the Charterail rail freight company which went into liquidation last year. National Power is buying one locomotive from General Motors in Canada and 21 wagons from Powell Duffryn in the UK to move limestone between Buxton in Derbyshire and the Drax power station in North Yorkshire. National Power said it had no intention of becoming a large-scale train operator itself, but hoped its example would encourage other companies to enter the market.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BURNETT, ANDREWS SHARE BOND  </P> <P> Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews say that coming from homes with alcoholic  parents gives them a shared emotional background that has made them great  friends.  </P> <P> In Sunday's issue of Parade magazine, Burnett and Andrews say they have  discovered an almost spiritual tie between them.  </P> <P> "If I believed in reincarnation, I'd say we were sisters in a previous life,"  Andrews said.  </P> <P> "Whaddaya mean, chum? I think we're sisters now!" Burnett replied.  </P> <P> "We're both caretakers," Burnett said. "You see, what Julie and I now realize  is that we were initially drawn to each other because . . . I hope I'm not  talking out of turn, but we're both adult children of alcoholics."  </P> <P> Andrews confirmed the link between them, saying: "I know Carol's family  situation was far, far worse, but I think both of us grew up with the same  kinds of needs and insecurities."  </P> <P> "As adults, Julie and I both try to control situations because as children we  were trying to cope with what was essentially an uncontrollable problem,"  Burnett said.  </P> <P> The two will appear in a television special to be broadcast Dec. 13 on ABC.  </P></p>

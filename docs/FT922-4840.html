			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Investigators probe network of 'war chests' THE ACCOUNTS of Fivetell, one of the companies being examined by investigators trying to find assets outside the control of the administrators to the collapsed Maxwell empire, provide an insight into the activities controlled by members of the family. Fivetell was created by Robert Maxwell in 1984 to purchase a substantial stake in Derby County Football Club, which he bought after a winding-up petition earlier that year was withdrawn. Headington Investments, one of the main Maxwell holding companies, had a substantial shareholding in Fivetell. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell are listed as the two directors of the company in the latest documents filed with Companies House on February 25 this year. Both are also shown as directors of another company called Panlor, and Mr Kevin Maxwell is also a director of Oxford United Football Club. The majority stakes in Panlor are owned by Pandora, the wife of Mr Kevin Maxwell, and Laura, the wife of Mr Ian Maxwell. Mr Kevin Maxwell is shown as having held more than 270 other company directorships, and Mr Ian Maxwell is shown as holding 170. Mr Ian Maxwell is also listed as a shareholder in Fivetell, while Mr Kevin Maxwell is shown to have shareholdings in London &amp; Bishopsgate Holdings, Marblue, Newton, Chambers &amp; Co, Oxford United Football Club and Sheenwood First Nominees. The accounts of Fivetell for the year to May 31 1991 show that a loan of Pounds 3m - believed to be unsecured - was made after the accounts were approved. Fivetell also had an outstanding loan of Pounds 622,000 last year to Publishing and Databank Consultants, controlled by the Maxwell estate. The loan has since been repaid. There may also have been a loan - the status of which is disputed - for about Pounds 2m from Fivetell to Oxford United Football Club. The Fivetell accounts show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 726,000 for the year, and a deficiency of assets of Pounds 1.4m. Fivetell appears to have been used to hold the family stakes in Oxford United as well as Derby County. Both stakes were sold through Robert Maxwell's estate, which is in receivership. Documents for Panlor - which Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell are shown to be directors of - show that the company was created on December 20 last year. No accounts have yet been filed, but the documents show the two 'allottees', holding 49 shares each, are Mrs Pandora Maxwell and Mrs Laura Maxwell. Mr Neil Cooper of Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, who is liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, said he was aware of a number of 'little puddles of money left around' in different companies and trusts which may have been 'war chests'. 'We still don't know the full ramifications of any of these strange companies,' he said. 'But there is still a great deal of energy being spent investigating and tracking them down.'</p>

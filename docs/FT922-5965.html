			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Big primary wins for Bush and Clinton THE penultimate round of presidential primaries saw three big wins for US President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, strong informal support for Mr Ross Perot and further evidence that congressional incumbents are up against it this year. Mr Bush scored 87 per cent in Arkansas in Tuesday's vote, 74 per cent in Kentucky and 64 per cent in Idaho. Mr Clinton won 68 per cent in his home state, 56 per cent in Kentucky and about 50 per cent in Idaho. In Kentucky the Perot campaign had urged a vote for the uncommitted ticket, and it duly materialised - 28 per cent on the Democratic side and 26 per cent for the Republicans. In Arkansas it amounted to 18 per cent. Updated tallies from last week's primary in Washington showed the Perot write-in vote at about 20 per cent in both parties. Mr Jerry Brown, the remaining Democratic challenger, failed to reach the 15 per cent threshold in Arkansas and Kentucky necessary to win convention delegates. Mr Clinton took 64 of the 88 delegates at stake, and is now only about 150 short of the 2,145 needed for the nomination. This he will undoubtedly secure next week in the final primary round, which includes California. Mr Brown's challenge in the state which he once governed appears to be fading fast. However, most local polls suggest that Mr Perot leads both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush, not only in the west but also in industrial states like Ohio, which holds party primaries next Tuesday. Most striking in the last round were the primary defeats of two-long serving Democratic congressman - Mr Bill Alexander in Arkansas and Mr Carroll Hubbard in Kentucky. Both had been caught up in March's congressional banking scandal, when it emerged that many congressmen had written bad cheques at the House of Representatives' bank. The number of incumbent senators and congressmen who have either been defeated or announced retirement now exceeds 60. Predictions of the final toll range from 100 to 150, which would be a post-war high. Republicans hope the current comfortable Democratic majority in both houses could be at risk. The composition of the new congress would assume extraordinary importance in the event that no candidate wins a majority of the electoral college in the presidential election. The rise of Mr Perot has now rendered this thinkable, if still less than probable. Should this happen, the constitution stipulates that the newly elected House choose the president and the Senate the vice-president, with each state, regardless of its size, casting a single vote. Nothing like this has taken place since 1824. The Republican party, meanwhile, suffered the unusual experience of a bruising public debate over its long-standing commitment to restricting abortion. The platform committee, meeting in Salt Lake City, heard arguments not only from pro-life advocates but from the increasingly vocal group of pro-choice Republican women who sense that adamant opposition to abortion could be an electoral liability this year.</p>

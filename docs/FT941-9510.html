			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Peru leaves banks in the dark over law on debt-swap interest Peru has published detailed regulations governing the use of its secondary debt in forthcoming privatisations. They specify that eligible debt instruments will be accepted at face value, but do not cover how accumulated interest and arrears are to be treated. Although Peru's economy ministry considers the debt-swap law is crystal clear, some bankers confessed to being confused and preoccupied over the treatment of interest. A Citibank official in Lima said he 'could not believe the Peruvian government proposes simply to ignore the question of interest,' especially after it 'has taken its debt negotiations so seriously thus far'. The economy ministry calculates that around Dollars 10.2bn of Peru's Dollars 23bn foreign debt will be eligible for use in the privatisations. This includes some Dollars 1.7bn of Peru's total debt with the Paris Club and Dollars 5.6bn in medium- and long-term commercial debt. Copri, the government's privatisation office, will determine in conjunction with the foreign debt committee the minimum amount of debt and cash to be expected in each sale - but at least 10 per cent of the base price must be cash. The price of Peruvian commercial bank debt has soared on the secondary market in the past 2 1/2 years.</p>

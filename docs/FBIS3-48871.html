			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been revealed that a secret note was attached  to an agreement Japan and the United States concluded in 1989 to  expand the access of U.S.-made mobile and portable telephones to  the Japanese market and that the two countries are at odds about  the interpretation of the note. Japan wrote the note as a  "preamble" which stipulates the spirit of the agreement. With  regard to the interpretation of the phrase "equal market access"  in the preamble, the United States has maintained that this  phrase "assures the U.S.- system a share equal to the  Japanese-system." Meanwhile, Japan has refuted the U.S. view,  saying: "It only means that the U.S. system will also be given  an opportunity for access to the Japanese market." The friction  over mobile and cellular phones, which came to the fore again at  the end of last year, has become complicated.    The outline of the 1989 Japan-U.S. agreement stated that new  frequencies would be allocated to the U.S. Motorola-system  apparatus so it could be used in the metropolitan and central  areas of Japan. Following the agreement, Japan Mobile  Communication Co. (IDO) has begun providing service via the  Motorola-system in addition to its original service via the  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) system.  According to IDO, the Motorola system is characterized by  relatively low charges for a telephone call.    However, due to the difference in the number of ground relay  stations, the area available for service via the Motorola-system  is smaller than for the NTT-system. That is why about 310,000  units have subscribed to the NTT-system while only about 10,000  units to the Motorola-system. The United States is dissatisfied  with the figure. Threatening sanctions based on the U.S.  commercial law, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) began investigating the case last December, saying:  "There is a possibility that Japan has not abided by the 1989  agreement." The results of the investigation will be issued on  15 February.    The very note was sent to [then] Deputy USTR Lin Williams  [name as published] of the Bush administration by [then]  Administrative Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications  Yuzai Okuyama (currently president of DDI [Daini Denden  Company]). According to a source concerned, there was the  following clause in the note: "Measures included in the  agreement should reflect the principles of MOSS (market-oriented  sector selective) talks (which Japan and the United States  concluded in 1986) such as transparency, home-country treatment,  equal market access, and nondiscrimination against foreign  companies."    It appears that on the basis of the phrase "equal market  access" in the clause, the United States has asked the Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications "to instruct IDO to take  measures such as increasing relay stations so that the  Motorola-system will grow to the same level as the NTT-system."  However, the ministry has rejected the U.S. request, saying  this "is not an issue the government can touch."    In this connection, Mr. Okuyama says: "Although it is true  that the note exists, I indicated the view in the note that  Motorola-system mobile and portable telephones would be given an  opportunity to access the Japanese market through allocation of  new frequencies. I am sure that the United States consented to  such an interpretation at that time. If, at present, the  country maintains that the phrase assures the Motorola-system of  an equal share with the NTT-system, that is regrettable."</p>

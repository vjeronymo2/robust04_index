			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (11): Privatisations this year Privatisations this year have included 30 per cent of Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional, the maker of Malaysia's Mitsubishi-based Proton cars. This month, the latest model, the Proton Saga Iswara, was launched in Kuala Lumpur by the prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, seen (below) inspecting the new Proton emblem. When he first announced the Proton project in the early 1980s, many critics predicted disaster. Yet today, every other car on the Malaysian roads is a Proton, and the car is exported to 12 countries. As car sales in most countries fall, capacity at the Proton factory is being expanded, with plans to produce 150,000 cars a year by 1995.</p>

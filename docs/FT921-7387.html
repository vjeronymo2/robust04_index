			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Perspectives: Wasted lives in the UK's packed jails - A City group on a moving morning in prison DOES society jail criminals to punish them, or to get them back on the straight and narrow? Penal experts have debated these questions for years; some think they are just two sides of the same coin. But on the slim evidence of a recent morning's visit to a jail - Pentonville, in north London - the answer seemed clear to me and other members of a City group I was with. It should be the second of the two. Our strongest impression was that of waste in the arrangements there - of time, human spirit and, ultimately, public money. Most of the prisoners spend 18 hours a day - sometimes 23  - locked in their cells. They are allowed radios and books, and the more privileged have a common room with snooker and TV. But days are empty and long. You can almost hear morale ebbing and resentment growing. It eats at the self-esteem of those who hope to regain their position in society - or it feeds their lust for revenge. Pentonville is nearly 150 years old but preserves a kind of grim beauty, at least inside. Its half-star shape has four wings radiating from a central point from which every cell door is visible. The galleries have a classical orderliness, spruced-up with fresh white paint. Outside, it is bleak, bricky and enclosed, with the sound of dogs barking. The atmosphere feels surprisingly relaxed. Gates clang, warders joke among themselves, prisoners on tasks outside their cells stand in clusters. The heating is efficient; it has to be because of the idleness to which most inmates are condemned. The cells are cramped, blank and barred. The furniture - a bed, a table and a chair  - is made of cardboard to prevent misuse. Cells that until recently used to have slop buckets are being given their own lavatories. But this has created problems. Prisoners smashed the china pans, so it was necessary to replace them with stainless steel. However, slopping-out gave inmates something to do - a chance to get out and mingle with others. Now, they spend even more time in idleness. At least overcrowding provides companionship. Meal-times are also a break. The prisoners get three hot meals a day and we saw the kitchen preparing a spaghetti concoction, semolina and chocolate tart. It was not the most appetising food I have seen but the food budget is Pounds 12-Pounds 14 a prisoner per week. Even meal-times, though, seem designed to reinforce the emptiness of the prisoner's day; supper is at 4 pm, which leaves an aching 16-hour gap until breakfast. One spark of hope is the Job Club, a little initiative run by charity to help inmates find work when released. In their last two weeks inside, they attend classes to learn interview techniques, play-act interviews and study the results on video. It is a gallant operation run by three people. One is Carole Parker, a diminutive lady who incarcerates herself with a dozen inmates at a time. But although she has a panic button, she has only twice had trouble. 'I'd rather be locked in here with 15 inmates than walk along the Holloway Road,' she says. Bill Abbot, Pentonville's governor, says Job Club is the only one of many well-intentioned schemes that he has seen which has 'got under the skin' of the prison. It has seen 325 inmates since last March. Of those, 50 are in paid employment, 80 in further training, 10 are self-employed and two are doing voluntary work. All who attend Parker's class complain that no one will want to employ them, so there is jubilation every time one finds a job. Implicit in these figures, though, is the fact that 142 of those who passed through the Job Club are probably roaming the streets with nothing to do - perhaps, they are back in jail  - to say nothing of the many who never attended at all. The officers told us they see the same faces again and again. The magic age seems to be 26; if a prisoner manages to mend his ways by then, he will probably make it. If not, a lifetime of crime beckons. The charity behind Job Club was Apex which, by an unhappy chance, announced that it was about to fold only two days after our visit. We were so moved by Parker and her team that a number of our group set about trying to keep them in business. This will either require a slug of private sector money or, as seems possible, intervention from the Department of Employment. There is a deeper question. Why are 900 prisoners (and thousands of others in the UK) kept in enforced idleness when their time could be put to good use, in training, in education, in rebuilding morale? I do not underestimate the difficulties or the efforts of those who have been asking this question for years. But if we are serious about reducing the prison population, we should be doing more to get ex-inmates back into society, permanently. It will take money. But I fear that, otherwise, much of the cash we are spending on our prison service will continue to be money down the drain.</p>

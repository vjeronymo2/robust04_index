It made more specific  and systematic the goal of a establishing a socialist market  economy as proposed at the 14th Party Central Committee and is  an important breakthrough and development in theory and  practice; it will be the guiding principle for conducting reform  of the economic system reform in the 1990's.  <H3>  I. Draw Up the General Framework for Establishing a  Socialist Market Economic System, Design the General Blueprint  for Further Reform </H3>   1. To establish a socialist market economic system is  to make the market play the fundamental role in allocating  resources under the State's macroscopic regulation and control.    The basic prerequisite for establishing the socialist market  economic system is to associate the market economic functions of  perfecting resource allocation and improving efficiency with the  goals of public ownership to safeguard social justice and  promotion of getting rich together. It should reflect the  general regulation of the market economy, learning from and  absorbing the successful experiences of foreign countries, as  well as reflecting the essential characteristics of the  socialist system. The general law of market economics is: All  commodities and all key elements of production including land,  capital, labor force, and technology should go into the market.  The market operation system will play a basic function in  allocation; property rights and relationships must be clear,  profit substances pluralized, and enterprises become independent  legal persons and chief entities in market competition with  self-operation, self-responsibility for profits and losses,  self-development, and self-restriction. The government will  carry out indirect regulation and control through economic  means, to foster a good market situation, protect society's  overall profits, and accomplish the public's goals. Economic  relationships must be legalized, enterprises must operate in  accordance with the law, and the government administer by law.    For initial establishment of the socialist market economy  system by the end of the century, there is much work which must  be done, so we must grasp the key points, and first of all  establish the basic framework of the new system.    2. The basic framework of the socialist market economic  system is composed of five links.    A. Establish a modern enterprise system which is suitable to  the market economy, forming a vigorous microscopic base in which  public ownership is the main body, while multiple economic  compositions develop in the interim.    B. Establish a national unified market system, to achieve  close associations between rural and urban markets, connections  between the domestic and international markets, and promote  perfected allocation of resources.    C. Establish a perfect macroscopic regulation and control  system which mainly uses indirect means, shifting the  government's role of administering the economy, and guaranteeing  healthy operation of the domestic economy.    D. Establish an income distribution system in which  distribution by work is the dominant factor, giving priority to  efficiency, giving consideration to fairness, encouraging part  of our regions and part of our people to get rich first, going  the way of getting rich together.    E. Establish a multi-level social insurance system,  providing  social insurance for urban and rural residents which is  appropriate to China's situation, to promote economic and social  stability.    Just as it is stated in the "Decision": "These principle  links are organic main entities which are associated and  mutually restrictive, and compose the basic framework of the  socialist market economic system." Meanwhile, it also clarifies  the basic special features of the socialist market economy. We  must accelerate reform measures around these key links, to  establish the basic framework of the socialist market economy.    3. Correctly learn and grasp the key and mutual links  for establishing the socialist market economic system framework.    The basic and key link in establishing the socialist market  economic system and a modern enterprise system appropriate to  what the market requires is clarification of property rights and  relationships. This is because the enterprise is the main entity  of the market, and the modern enterprise system is the basic  system in the socialist market economy system. Without a modern  enterprise system, the socialist market economy would be a river  without water, a tree without roots. Because the enterprise is  an economic entity which is composed of the various key elements  of production, key elements of the market, the whole market  system including labor force, capital, and technology are  prerequisites to establishing a modern enterprise system as well  as the certain result of modern enterprise economic operation.  Among these key elements of production, the person is the most  vigorous element. To be complete in establishing a modern  enterprise system, in order to arouse and bring into full play  the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of labor, we must  establish a reasonable income distribution system, smash  egalitarianism, and implement earning more for more work. This  will reflect the principle of giving priority to efficiency,  giving consideration to fairness, and forming the market  economy's system of operating by motivation. Only in this way  can we improve labor productivity and economic efficiency.    We should realize that in the process of developing the  socialist market economy, the market is not a universal:  Establishment of a perfect and efficient macroscopic economic  regulation and control and a social insurance system cannot be  replaced by enterprise action and the market operation system,  because enterprises and the market do not have, indeed cannot  possibly have, macroscopic regulation and control functions, or  a system of social insurance. The macroscopic regulation and  control system is the regulator of the socialist market economic  system, while the social insurance system is the market economic  system's safety valve and stabilizer. It is only by establishing  a perfect macroscopic regulation and control system in which  indirect measures are the dominant factor, and by establishing a  multilevel social insurance system, can we ensure that the  socialist market economy will be systematic, complete and  unified. By having this type of new system, we can enhance  economic and social stability, and ensure that the domestic  economy will operate regularly and healthily.  <H3>  II. Give the Highest Priority To Arranging Property Rights  and Relationships, and To Establishing Modern Enterprises;  Clearly Set Forth the Concept of "Legal Person Property Rights" </H3>   1. The market conditions required for state-owned  enterprises to achieve self-operation, and self-responsibility  for profits and losses.    In 1984, in the "CPC Decisions On Economic System Reform" it  was made clear that state-owned enterprises should achieve  self-operation and take responsibility for their own profits and  losses, but so far this goal has not been accomplished, because  two difficult points have yet to be resolved: One is that the  market conditions required for enterprise self-operation have  not formed, and the second is that we haven't found the specific  pattern for enterprises to accomplish responsibility for their  own profits and losses, so we haven't resolved the theoretical  and practical problems concerned in enterprises' property rights.    Enterprises' self-operation requires a market condition, and  establishment of that condition is the result of a series of  reforms which support the system. To establish a commodity  market, we must reform the planning system, the circulation  system, and the price management system. Going a step further, a  commodity market alone is not sufficient for enterprise  self-operation; there must also be key element markets as well,  chief of which are the capital market, the labor force market,  and the technology market. This in turn calls for reform of the  investment system, the financial system, and the labor and  personnel matters system, as well as a social insurance system.    According to a survey by a relevant department, there are  several basic special features in China's market conditions, as  follow:    First, there is a very great difference in degree of  development between the commodity market and the key element  markets. The commodity market developed more rapidly, the key  element markets more slowly.    Second, there is a considerable difference in market  conditions confronting large, medium, and small enterprises.  Small enterprises face better market conditions, so have greater  rights to self-operation; the market conditions are worse for  large and medium enterprises, especially backbone enterprises  which produce important products, so they have a lesser degree  of self-operation.    Third, there are sizable differences in the market  conditions  faced by enterprises' from different industries. Enterprises in  industries which produce investment type products and  manufacture consumer products enjoy better market conditions,  since they have greater rights to self-operation; enterprises in  sectors which produce raw materials and basic industries face  less favorable market conditions, having fewer self-operation  rights.    Fourth, there are major differences in market conditions  across different regions. Markets in special economic zones and  development areas developed better than did markets in other  areas.    From the four differences listed above, we can see the  achievements of past reform as well as the backward links in the  reform process; we can confirm that there is a practical base  for continuing to go forward as well as confirm the key points  of further reform. On this basis, we can determine the channels  by which to exchange the enterprise operation system.    2. Reform of state-owned enterprises demands a  breakthrough in the theory of property rights.    Regardless of whether profit or loss, both are embodied in  enterprise property rights. Enterprises must achieve  self-responsibility for profits and losses, must become the main  body of their property rights; if the property of state-owned  enterprises comes into the category of public ownership, how can  enterprises become the main body of property rights? This is the  urgent problem we must resolve to realize the pattern of  state-owned enterprise taking responsibility for their own  profits and losses.    Theoretical circles and executive departments carried out a  useful probe of enterprise property rights reform. Generally  there are three ways in which it is worded: 1) Legal person  property controlling rights; 2) legal person ownership; 3) legal  person property rights.    Concerning enterprise legal person property controlling  rights: According to the regulations of the "Enterprise Law" and  "Transformation of the Public Ownership Industrial Enterprises  Operating System," enterprises share ownership, using it and  levying penalties in accordance with the law. Discussions have  shown that many people are confused about this concept: Although  the "General Regulations of Civil Law" confirmed that the right  of separation was an independent property right of civil  affairs, people still viewed it as an administrative right,  which was an enterprise activity right not touching upon  property rights and relationships. Therefore, it is difficult  for enterprises to accomplish value-preservation and  value-addition of state-owned capital, and self-responsibility  for profits and losses.    Concerning enterprise legal person ownership: Legal person  ownership, the structure which deals with shareholder rights in  the legal relationship between enterprise and investor, is now  the general rule of civil law and commercial law in each  country. Enterprises share in legal person ownership as  independent civil affairs main entities, and independently  engage in legal activities, undertake legal responsibility, and  can eliminate investor direct involvement in the enterprise's  production and operations activities. Legal ownership is only a  legal form; it cannot change the nature of the enterprise's  ownership. That is determined by the characteristics of the  shareholders who actually control the corporation.    Concerning enterprise legal person property rights: In this,  the enterprise has independent controlling rights to property  that the state has authorized the enterprise to operate and  manage in accordance with law. Legal person property rights are  an association of operational rights and the legal person  system. Enterprise operational rights are spoken of in  comparison with state ownership, setting the focal point on the  relationship of property, rights and responsibilities between  the enterprise and the state. Legal person property rights are  spoken of in comparing the enterprise's other civil affairs  rights, setting the focal point on the relationship of rights  and responsibilities between the enterprise as an independent  legal person and the enterprise's property. What is the  difference between legal person property rights and enterprise  operation rights? One is that operation does not include profit  rights, while "enterprise legal person property rights" includes  related content concerning profit rights. Another difference is  that after affirming the concept of enterprise legal person  property rights, the state will not accept responsibility for  enterprise debts. Explaining enterprise legal person property  right helps to understand correctly and implement further  enterprise operational rights, and helps to clarify property  relationships, protect state ownership, and accomplish  value-preservation and value-adding for state owned assets. So,  the "Decision" used the wording of "enterprise legal person  property right."    3. Establishing the modern enterprise system is the  direction of state-owned enterprise reform.    What is the modern enterprise system? What are its basic  special feature? According to international experience and  China's practical situation, it first of all clarifies property  rights relationships. When an enterprise has the legal person  property right, it can become a legal person entity, assuming  responsibility for civil rights and responsibilities. Second, it  permits enterprises to self-operate, taking responsibility for  their own profits and losses in all legal person property,  paying taxes in accordance with regulations, taking  responsibility for asset value-preservation and value-adding for  investors. Third, investors undertake limited responsibility in  the amount of assets they invest. Fourth, enterprises organize  production and operation according to market demand, and in  market competition, only excellent will win while the bad will  fall by the wayside; there will be no indirect government  intervention in enterprise operations. Fifth, it will establish  a scientific enterprise organizational structure and management  system, establishing a mutual encouragement and restrictive  operating system among owners, operators, and employees.    The corporation system is the major legal pattern of the  enterprise system under the modern market economic system. The  basic special features of the enterprise legal person are: One,  it has the status of an independent legal person, the same civil  action abilities as a natural person, to sue and countersue;  two, it takes responsibility for its own profits and losses, a  company of the shareholder investment form assumes independent  civil responsibility; third, it is a totally independent  economic entity for taxpaying; fourth, it adopts a regulated  system of cost and financial accounting.    4. The fundamental conditions for enterprises to be the  main entity of market competition.    The risky and competitive special features of a main entity  in market economy activities determine that for the enterprise  to be the main entity of market competition it should have two  fundamental conditions.    One is that enterprises determine their own activity and  direction according to market demand, determining its own  combination of enterprise production key elements and  operations. Enterprises determine as they will what to produce,  what to operate, how to conduct production and operations. The  second is that enterprises can independently bear the  consequences of market activity, which is that the enterprise  should become the main entity in legal property rights, having  independent property rights and responsibilities.    5. The advantages and pattern of the corporation system.    In reorganizing the state-owned enterprises we can eliminate  the original legal framework for public ownership enterprises.  The advantages to this are:    One, the enterprise will take its own responsibility for  profits and losses, getting out of the strange circle which  confronts state-owned enterprise reform. State-owned enterprises  are being remolded on the corporate system, in which the state,  representing the public as shareholders, undertakes limited  responsibility for enterprises according to the amount of its  investment, and entrusts operations to directors; enterprises  take responsibility for their profits and losses on the basis of  legal person property right. The biggest restriction on  enterprises is self-responsibility for profits and losses; this  responsibility can prevent enterprises from abusing ownership,  with loss of state owned capital.    Second, it helps in clarifying property rights  relationships.  Remolding into the corporate system requires clarification of  property rights relationships between government and  enterprises, confirms the government's ownership organs, and  sends representatives of shareholders to attend board of  directors meetings.    Third, it creates the conditions for separating enterprise  from government and for enterprise self-operation. The corporate  system remake requires separation of government from capital,  unification of capital and enterprises, and this furnishes the  preconditions for separating government from enterprises.  Meanwhile, the separation of ownership rights from operating  rights is assured by a clear, stable system of regulations and  by the enterprises' internal organizational structure. It will  provide reliable organization and system conditions for freeing  enterprises from inappropriate governmental administrative  interference, and will protect enterprise self-operation.    Fourth, it is only after enterprises have taken  responsibility for their profits and losses that they will  really be able to face the market. For public ownership  enterprises, the state does indeed take joint responsibility for  their profits and losses. Moreover, this is done without looking  into the responsibility for profits and losses. Therefore,  enterprises face more toward government rather than the market,  so even should the government want to push them, they might not  be able to. After enterprises assume responsibility for their  own profits and losses, facing the market will become an  internal requirement for an enterprise looking to survive and  develop.    Fifth, the responsibility system for profits and losses by  enterprise operators and employees will be better implemented,  promoting enterprise efficiency and improved benefits. Because  the owner goes into the enterprise, property rights restrictions  will be more strict, making it easier to confirm responsibility  for profits and losses of operators and employees, establishing  a more efficient system for incentives and restrictions. In  addition, it will serve to increase flexibility in enterprise  operations and promote fairness in competition among various  kinds of enterprises.    The corporate system can take a different pattern: A small  number of natural monopoly industries and public welfare  industries can be remolded into state single capital  corporations and multiple investment entities can be remolded  into limited responsibility corporations or joint stock  corporations in accordance with law. The joint stock system can  better regulate the relationships between the state and  enterprises, and is the efficient form suitable for development  of the market economy. We must create the conditions, positively  and reliably extending the range of experimental sites,  regulating it and letting it develop in a healthy manner. There  can be only a small number of joint stock corporations in the  market. Implementation of the corporate system should stress  replacing the operational system, with steady expansion via  experimental sites.  <H3>  III. Current Emphasis Should Be on Developing a Production  Elements Market To Establish a Unified Open Market System;  Markets for Labor Force and Capital Are Important Components of  the Elements of Production, With New Breakthroughs and  Developments, Both Theoretically and Practically </H3>   1. Current emphasis on development of a production  elements market.    The "Decision" noted that "current emphasis must be on  developing a production elements market." Why must this be  emphasized?    The weak link in current market construction is the serious  backwardness of the elements market, which does suit the needs  of establishing the socialist market economic system. At  present, direct financial markets occupy only about 10 percent  of the gross capital used in China, with the capital market in a  preliminary stage. The circulation of the labor force is still  fundamentally unchanged from the pattern of the original system.  The actual turnover rate of scientific and technical  achievements is not very high; for example, only 5 percent of  the scientific and technical achievements in the  electromechanical industry received widespread popularization.  Production elements bring a very low price in the market. This  has become a barrier to the establishment of a national,  unified, open market, a barrier to making maximum use of the  market's fundamental role of resource allocation.    Bringing all production elements into the market is an  essential requirement of the socialist market economic system, a  vital part of establishing and perfecting the market system, as  well as a key problem in perfecting resource allocation. The  production element markets include those for capital, labor  force, technology, and land. Without development of the element  markets, reasonable circulation of production markets would be  impossible to accomplish, and it would certainly be impossible  to really achieve perfected resource allocation.    2. A clear proposal for the concept of a labor force  market is an important breakthrough in economic system theory  and practice.    In the past, theoretical circles, and especially economic  departments, always used such concepts as "labor services  market", the "labor market" and "labor employment market." The  "Decision," clearly proposed the concept of the "labor force  market." Actually, the labor force market is one type of  production element market, an important component of the market  system; only when the labor force market is proposed with  perfect assurance can we accelerate the establishment of the  socialist market economic system.    Now that the people are the masters of the state, how can  the  labor force be seen as a commodity property? The chief reason  such a problem exists lies in confusion over the two ideas of  labor force and worker.    In fact, the labor force is not equivalent to the worker.  The  concepts of labor force and worker have connections as well as  differences. Labor force refers to labor capability of the  worker; worker refers to the main entity of labor which is the  person. The workers exchange their labor abilities in the labor  force market but not their persons. In the process of this  exchange, the two sides negotiate supply and demand equally and  make mutual choices for mutual benefits.    Workers have different levels of personal talent, so they  have different levels of working ability. Ownership of the labor  force lies with the main entity of labor, that is, the person,  and this supplies both the possibility and the practical base  for the existence and development of the labor force market. As  the only active element, the labor force plays an important role  in production elements. If the other production elements go into  the market, with only the labor force kept out, it will be  impossible to establish a unified open market system. Only when  the labor forces goes into the market, and the qualifications  and value of workers receive a fair evaluation, can enterprises  and workers carry out two-way selection on a free will basis,  and thereby promote perfected allocation of labor resources and  the entire resources of society.    It is irrefutable that there actually exists a considerable  amount of the labor force market in our economic life.    China has a big population, an abundant labor force  resource,  so the contradiction of labor supply exceeding demand will exist  for a long time. According to figures supplied by relevant  departments, by the year 2000 China will face the employment  pressures of 320 million people, so it is urgent and essential  that we speed up the creation and development of a labor force  market.    At present, China's labor force is still in a stage of  preliminary development. Looking at the main entity of market  competition, establishment of this has been blocked in all  state-owned sectors, due to the fact that the labor and  personnel system has not yet implemented complete reforms. There  is still basically a lack of guaranteed rights and benefits for  the market main entity. Looking at the market operating system,  the pricing standard for the labor force lacks unity; over quite  a large area, wages reflect neither the cost of the labor force  nor the labor force supply and demand situation, so the  operating system for market regulation does not function.  Looking at market competition order, there is a lack of  essential measures to protect competition, regulate and control  the market, and provide legal supervision. Looking at the market  service system, the social protection system is not completely  established, with a very low degree of social benefits, such as  employee training, medical benefits, job-related injuries,  retirement insurance, and unemployment compensation. Therefore,  it is only through further reform, accelerating the creation and  development of a labor force market, that we can possibly deal  with the massive employment pressures in future economic  development.    Affirming the concept of a labor force market will not  affect  the working class's master position. Admitting a labor force  market does not mean that workers are a commodity. Workers have  the right to exchange and retain their labor force, have the  freedom to choose jobs; this merely reflects the fact that  workers are masters of their own labor force, so as to  accomplish equal labor and employment opportunities. Under  capitalism, private ownership of the means of production brings  a separation of the workers from the means of production,  obliging workers to sell their labor force to become employed,  so the individual ownership rights of the labor force change in  nature. Under socialism, workers exchange their labor force with  collective workers, and participate in democratic management,  achieving true private ownership of the labor force. When we  speak of the master position of the working class, we mean the  whole working class, and the individual worker is not equal to  the whole working class. The individual worker's exchange and  retention of his own labor force doesn't mean he has lost the  status of being a part of the working class.    3. Positively and reliably develop the capital market,  to promote socialist modernization.    A. Capital must be converted into social wealth.    Is capital allowed to exist in the socialist market economy?  This is a big and important problem which must be resolved in  economic reform and development. Since the "three big  remoldings" in China, the economic category of capital has  almost been cancelled, replacing it with funds, viewing capital  and the capital market the same as capitalist and capitalism.    In a situation where multiple economic compositions  simultaneously co-exist, admitting the existence of capital is  helpful to development of the domestic economy. At present, the  different development speeds of the different economic  components is closely relate to whether they operate according  to the regulations on capital circulation. For example, some  enterprises earn fake profits while actually losing, some "three  forms of capital enterprises" have fake losses while actually  earning profits. Privately owned enterprises seek as much  depreciation as possible, while some state owned enterprises  rarely mention it if they mention it at all, with the result  that some state owned enterprises "rest on their laurels," their  capital funds going down while their assets to liabilities ratio  rises greatly, their average profit level dropping, and the  capital value-addition increases slowly. This is one important  reason why in recent years there has been a steady decline in  that proportion of the domestic economy that is state owned.    Under capitalism, currency is converted to capital, with  capitalists use this capital to occupy surplus value. Under  socialism, the question is not whether to create surplus value,  but who will possess the newly increased surplus value? Will it  be converted to social property? Will it benefit the people and  society? When we engage in the socialism market economy, capital  value-addition means the expansion of owners' capital which  includes, chiefly, public ownership. It is helpful in developing  socialist productive forces, in increasing the comprehensive  national power of socialist countries, and in improving people's  living standards.    Converting national funds into national "capital"  establishes  the relationship between the state and enterprises according to  "capital" ownership rights. This aids in separating enterprises  from government, in managing enterprises well, and also helps  the state strengthen macroscopic regulation and control of  enterprises through the economic means of investments and loans.  Enterprises engage in operational activities through the means  of capital, and have to make up losses through capital; if they  make profits, it will become the owner's benefits. The  enterprise's purpose is to capital value-addition. The initial  step in establishing a system which keeps enterprises within  boundaries is to have powerful restrictions on capital. This is  the only way to avoid the phenomenon of "eating up all the  benefits" and an "enterprise tending to be a empty box."    Allowance for the existence of capital must create changes  in  the ownership pattern. As positive promotion is provided for the  state ownership economy and the collective economy, there must  at the same time be encouragement for development of individual,  private, and foreign investment joint ventures in order to  establish a pattern of taking public ownership as the dominant  factor, absorbing the simultaneous development of multiple  economic components. Some public ownership enterprises which  took in investment from employees and collective enterprises,  issued B stock and H stock, the enterprises and the legal person  blended as one. This is just as the "Decision" said, that "with  property rights moving and reorganizing, more and more economic  units will have mixed property ownership, and will establish new  a property ownership structure." This is a development in  ownership theory and practice.    Allowance for the existence of capital must create changes  in  the distribution system as well. The "Decision" declared:  "Encourage deposits and investment by urban and rural residents,  allowing production elements which are a part of individual  capital to participate in distribution of profits and benefits."  We must adhere to a system in which distribution according to  labor is at the center, with simultaneous existence of a  multiple distribution pattern. This requires that two  relationship problems be handled well: One, the relationship  between distribution by work and distribution by capital; and  two, the relationship between state owned capital and privately  owned capital. Not only should we encourage a part of the people  in some areas to get rich first, but we must also try to avoid  division into two opposite extremes, while we gradually  accomplish getting rich together.    B. The capital market should positively and reliably develop  security and stock capital.    The capital market can also be called the long term fund  market, which is the market for fund debits and credits or  security exchanges of medium and short term capital markets over  one year. The money market can also be called the short term  capital market. Since reform, there have been major changes in  the domestic income distribution pattern. The proportion of  resident deposits in national gross deposits has risen to its  current figure of more than 70 percent from 23.55 percent in  1979. The huge amount of resident savings are largely in the  form of deposits. Thus, at the same time we are stabilizing  savings, we should positively and reliably develop security and  stock capital. Regulate the structure of the capital market,  with step by step regulation of stock market expansion. This  will improve the proportion of enterprise self-owned capital,  which can appropriately strengthen enterprises' ability to  undertake financial regulations by the central bank. Currently,  banks bear most of the debt load for state-owned enterprises, so  when money is tight, there is a direct effect on enterprises'  production and operational actions. Because China's state-owned  enterprises do not now have a true self-restrictive operations  system, in their pursuit of output and development speed,  enterprises do not consider the costs of collecting capital in  the market; but financial macroscopic regulation and control is  direct control of credit and not indirect control of the  currency supply. In this situation, it is easy to keep direct  investment separate from changes in market demand, so the  market's perfected resource allocation function cannot be  brought into full play. We must establish a credit rating  system, and regulate the issuance of stocks and securities to  promote healthy development of the capital market.  <H3>  IV. Macroscopic Regulation and Control Is Chiefly Through  Economic Means, Bringing Into Full Play the Enthusiasms of  Central Authorities and Localities </H3>   1. The socialist market economy requires a perfect  macroscopic regulation and control system.    The socialist market economy system must emphasize bringing  the market's basic resource allocation function into full play.  But on the other hand, it must be understood that the market is  not universal; it is spontaneous, blind, and sluggish, so we  must strengthen macroscopic regulation and control. Establishing  a macroscopic regulation and control system will compensate for  the market's shortages. Therefore, the market mechanism function  and macroscopic regulation and control are linked to one another  and they supplement each other; each is indispensable.    The "Decision" stipulated that macroscopic regulation and  control must stress "maintaining a general equilibrium in the  gross economic total, to perfect the economic structure and lead  to steady, rapid, and healthy development of the domestic  economy while promoting comprehensive progress of society." In  addition, it made it clear that "macroscopic regulation and  control is chiefly by economic measures," establishing a  macroscopic regulation and control system by means of further  reform, without reverting to the old, planned economic system.    To establish a macroscopic system for regulation and  control,  it is necessary to establish a system which is both mutually  supportive and mutually restrictive among plan, finance, and  revenue and expenditures, to strengthen combined coordination of  economic operations. A very important question is just what kind  of role will the central bank play in macroscopic regulation and  control. At present, the policy objectives of the central bank  are not only to assume the huge burden of supporting economic  growth, it is also responsible for stabilizing currency. In  addition, it must always make economic development its highest  priority, with an expansion tendency in currency policy, and  this weakens its function of stabilizing currency. The  "Decision" specified quite clearly that: "The prime objective of  the central bank is to stabilize currency value, regulate the  total currency supply, and maintain the international balance."  Confirming the central bank's policy objectives was beneficial  to stabilizing currency and controlling inflation.    2. In the near future, we must take major, important  steps in revenue, finance, investment, and planning system  reform.    The key points of revenue system reform are: 1) Establish a  tax division system; that is, change the current local revenue  contracted system into one that establishes a central tax,  shared tax, and local tax on the basis of an equitable division  between the central government and localities' rights; 2) reform  and perfect the tax system, and spread more widely the  circulation tax system in which the value-added tax is the  dominant factor, on the principle of a unified tax law, a fair  tax burden, a simplified tax system, and an equitable division  of power; 3) reform and regulate the double entry budget.    The focal points of financial system reform are: 1) The  People's Bank of China must operate as a true central bank,  regulating and controlling the currency supply primarily through  economic means; that is, changing from relying chiefly on  management of the scale of credit to the use of such measures as  the deposit reserve rate, the central bank credit interest rate,  and open market business to conduct management; 2) the current  specialized banks must be converted into commercial banks; 3) we  must organize policy type banks, separating policy type business  and commercial type business; 4) reform the foreign exchange  management system, and with the market as the foundation,  establish a controlled system for a floating foreign exchange  rate with a unified and standard foreign currency market.    The focal points of investment system reform are: 1) Change  the main entities of investment in competitive type projects  from government to enterprises, giving enterprises  self-determination in policy and strategy, and gradually  establishing risk responsibility for legal person investment and  bank credit; 2) replace the current administrative examination  and approval with a system of registering projects and putting  them on file, a major and important reform in the transition  from the planned economy to the market economy; 3) encourage and  take in investment from every sector for the construction of  fundamental projects.    The focal points of planning system reform are: 1) The plan  must be based on the market, usually an oversight plan; 2) The  mission of planning work is to establish a logical development  strategy, achieving the purpose of regulation and control and  industrial policy, with accurate economic forecasts; 3) Put  macroscopic, strategic, and policy-oriented key points in  prominent positions in medium and long-range planning; 4)  Establish new domestic economic business accounting and a  macroscopic system for economic oversight and estimates.    3. Alter the role of government by reasonably dividing  the central government's rights and the economic management  rights of localities.    Is it first level macroscopic regulation and control or  second level macroscopic regulation and control? What we refer  to as macroscopic regulation and control is regulation and  control of the gross economic output. Therefore, macroscopic  regulation and control rights must be concentrated in the  central government; localities should not be making decisions  concerning the issuance of currency, setting fundamental  interest rates, and regulating and controlling major tax rates.  This is the only way that we can assure a balanced gross  economic output, perfect the economic structure, and establish a  national, unified, open, market system. To maximize the  enthusiasm of localities, the "Decision" set essential  management rights for each province, autonomous region, and  municipality directly under the central government: 1) Fix  regional laws and regulations, policies and plans which are in  accord with the nation's laws, regulations and macroscopic  policies; 2) replenish local taxes, increase local revenue, and  regulate activities in these localities through local revenues  and budgets; 3) fully exploit local resources, promoting  economic and social development in these localities; 4) organize  and construct rural and urban cooperative banks to support  regional economic development.    Transforming the role of government and reforming government  organs is urgently needed if we are to establish the socialist  market economic system. The "Decision" set out clear regulations  on the function of government economic management, that it is  "chiefly, to establish and carry out macroscopic regulation and  control, do a good job of constructing the infrastructure,  cultivate a market system, regulate societal distribution and  organize social insurance, control population growth, protect  the environment, and manage state owned assets in order to  accomplish the objective of developing the national economy and  society. We must transform the role of government administrative  departments, simplify the administrative structure, strengthen  the role of social administration, and not intervene directly in  the production and operational activities of enterprises.</p>

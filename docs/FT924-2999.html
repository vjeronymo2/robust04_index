			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Indian riots death toll tops 700 INDIA was gripped by a third day of violence yesterday, with the death toll following the weekend destruction of the Ayodhya mosque rising above 700. Police and troops were deployed in many cities in an attempt to suppress continuing riots, arson attempts and stone-throwing attacks. Worst-affected was Bombay, the commercial capital, where 150 have died. In the city of Surat north of Bombay, 20 people were burned to death when a building was set on fire. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, appealed for calm, saying Indians had lived together for thousands of years. But he had no further measures to announce on dealing with the violence or other consequences of Sunday's assault on the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants during a rally organised by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition grouping. The government has yet to disclose how it will fulfil two important pledges made to Moslem leaders: a ban on militant activist groups and the rebuilding of the Ayodhya mosque.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market nervous as copper surges A WAVE of nervousness surged through the copper market yesterday as traders who had been gambling that the price had further to fall decided to scramble for cover. Copper for delivery in three months crashed conclusively through the psychologically important USDollars 1,850-a-tonne level on the London Metal Exchange, touching Dollars 1,875 at one stage. Profit-taking caused it to ease back and close at Dollars 1,865, up Dollars 52 or nearly 3 per cent from Wednesday's close. The traders' nervousness, also noticeable on the New York Commodity Exchange, was triggered by the possibility of disruptions at some of the world's biggest copper mines, suggested Mr William Adams, an analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group. In the US, present labour contracts at Phelps Dodge's Chino mine, Asarco's Ray mine and RTZ's Bingham Canyon all end this month. In Chile, unions at Chuquicamata, the world's biggest copper mine, late on Wednesday rejected the first offer of a new two-year contract from management at state-owned Codelco. The price of copper collapsed in April, falling by about one quarter from Dollars 2,200 to Dollars 1,710 a tonne, its lowest level for 5 1/2 years. Analysts said copper's price had been defying gravity for more than a year and had not been reflecting the widespread recession in some of the world's biggest industrial markets. However, executives from Asarco and Phelps Dodge, in London to talk to institutional investors this week, are reporting a very sharp increase in copper demand in the US, which is far outweighing the downturn in Europe. Demand in Japan remains flat. Mr Adams suggested that the next technical barrier to copper's upward move was to Dollars 1,885 a tonne, then to Dollars 1,920.</p>

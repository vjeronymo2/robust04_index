			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT on 4 March carries in its  regular 17-minute newscast two reports on the fighting in the  republic.    An unidentified correspondent reports from the 3d Corps  Press  Center and says that "over the past few days, the ustasha  provocations have not been intense enough to provoke our army's  troops, which have been consistently observing the orders of the  military command. Yesterday was marked by mainly small arms  provocations by the enemy side. Sniper fire at our defense  lines in the regions of Nevic Polje and Ciglane on the Vitez  front, and at our positions around Busovaca from the direction  of Pabjak, Kula, Radenovac, Komar, and Donje Polje constituted  the most frequent provocations. In Gornji Vakuf, the ustashas  fired several Tromblon grenades in addition to small arms  provocations, but our soldiers did not respond."    He adds that "the chetniks from their artillery strongholds  continue to shell civilian buildings sporadically. They fired  several mortar shells at Zavidovici, and they fired a dozen  artillery shells of various types at villages close to the  defense lines. The chetniks also fired several shells at  Bugojno from the direction of Donji Vakuf, which resulted in  sizable material damage."    An unidentified correspondent from Gracanica reports that  "in  a counterattack carried out on this front, our defenders  liberated two dominant peaks where the chetniks had killed  dozens of innocent civilians in the course of the war.  Overnight, the aggressor from the direction of Bosansko Suho  Polje used 82-mm and 120-mm mortars to shell civilian targets in  Klokotnica [words indistinct] at Stefan Polje. During the  night, the chetniks brought in fresh forces and equipment to the  Trebava [River] front. Over 60 truckloads of men arrived in the  areas of Paleznica and (?Sember) Rijeka, while five tanks have  been deployed facing our defense lines. This implies that the  chetniks will today launch an even fiercer offensive in these  areas."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting  Services has refuted accusations made by National Party  president Mr. Baldwin Nkumbula that the government is  intervening in the running of the media in Zambia. Reacting to  a statement made by Mr. Nkumbula at a National Party press  conference that government is hindering freedom of the press,  Information Deputy Minister Mr. Eric Silomba said the  allegations were false. He wondered why Mr. Nkumbula could say  this when he was covered adequately by the press during the  National Party convention in Mongu. Mr. Silomba said it is not  the government's intention to block any political party from  publicity.    Mr. Nkumbula claimed today that a free press will never  exist  in Zambia as long as media heads are appointed by the party in  power.</p>

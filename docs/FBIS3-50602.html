			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Potosi] </F>   [Text] Justice Ernesto Poppe Zubieta yesterday said during  a news conference: They could not find any evidence against me  in either the Ibarra or the Meco Domingez case. The United  States is interested in having me removed from office because I  demanded to know where the property and assets seized from drug  traffickers ended up. I was against Supreme Decree 21060  because it was inhuman. I rejected Article 55 of that law,  which supported private businessmen, enabling them to hire  workers without due regard for their rights.    I am a genuine member of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary  Movement] Party, but of the historical and loyal MNR, not the  MNR that lets its name be used so that the United States may  govern our country through a gringo made in Bolivia.    This trial is totally ridiculous. It is a political and  biased trial. Nothing was proved against me. The Bolivian  state is overburdened with corruption, so much so that  corruption has become the property of the Bolivian Government.  Corrupt practices are rampant in the three branches of  government -- the Executive, the Legislative Branch, and lower  levels of the judiciary. Malfeasance and corruption are  prevalent in the judiciary because there are no mechanisms in  force to prevent this, such as better salaries and wages, or  increasing the number of judges to prevent the backlog of work.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Katarzyna Jedrzejewska: "Budget in Sejm </F> Deputies' Hands; 1993 Deficit Was Lower Than Expected by Half"]    [Text] Last year's deficit in the state budget was  lower than expected by almost a half. Instead of the planned 81  trillion zlotys [Z], the deficit was "just" Z43.8 trillion. So  in the final analysis, it was even lower than predictions made  two months before the end of 1993, when there was talk that it  would be Z53 trillion.    Still, results of the final Treasury note auctions for 1993  sent a clear message: The deficit must have been even lower, and  that in spite of the fact that revenues proved higher than  expected by more than Z25 trillion.    Today, as work on the 1994 budget continues, Sejm deputies  who are members of different Sejm commissions are suggesting an  increase in expenditures by an additional Z20 trillion compared  to what the government had proposed. This must be supplemented  by the Agricultural Commission's proposals to increase  agricultural expenditures by -- according to preliminary  calculations -- Z10 trillion. As a result, the parliament --  while adopting the 1994 budget law -- will have two options:  either to approve exactly what the government proposed (with  possible shifts in expenditure amounts between different  sectors), or to enact higher expenditures. The latter solution  would require another decision: Are we in favor of increasing  budget revenues, the budget deficit, or the money supply?    Before decisions are made, it is worth taking a look at how  much room there is for maneuvering, if at all. The Council of  Ministers asked itself a similar question slightly over a month  ago. As a result of a three-day debate, the government managed  to come up with just Z2 trillion of additional revenue; and that  was not from taxes since the finance minister had already done  everything possible in that area by proposing amendments in tax  laws which resulted in a total of Z25 trillion of additional  revenue.    Sejm deputies are currently hoping for revenue from taxes to  be imposed on stock-market derived income, which was not planned  in the government's budget draft. But one will not be able to  extract more than Z3 trillion out of that source, and it could  be much less than that.    Nobody in the Sejm talks about increasing the budget deficit  anymore, which was a suggestion made so often in previous years.  Last year's problems with finding the money to finance the  planned deficit proved more of a lesson than even the finance  minister's very lengthy and persuasive speeches.    Today, pressure is directed somewhere else -- at the Polish  National Bank. Sejm deputies are demanding an increase in the  money supply by Z14 trillion, whereas the bank's representatives  oppose the idea. There are fears that such a measure could  become just another lesson in economics.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 4 SAPA -- Federal Party leader  Frances Kendall on Monday [4 April] expressed support for an  editorial in the latest issue of the London SUNDAY TIMES,  calling for the postponement of regional elections. The  editorial accused the National Party and the African National  Congress leaders' propaganda machines of "perpetrating an  enormous fraud on 40 million South Africans" by claiming the  interim constitution was a federal one even when many foreign  experts had pointed out it was not.    Ms Kendall said the only way to bring the Inkatha Freedom  Party (IFP) into the democratic process was to devolve real  powers to the regions, then elect regional structures -- not the  other way around. "All of the regional elections should be  postponed to allow Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington the  opportunity to recommend constitutional changes and have them  implemented. In the meanwhile, a nationally elected body can  run the country rather than the authoritarian Transitional  Executive Council (TEC)," she said.    Ms Kendall added that the state of emergency and clampdown  on  the IFP would not solve the fundamental issue that the  constitution was not federal, and the real issue of federal  power was the underlying cause of violence in the country.    Meanwhile the National Party (NP) called the tone of the  SUNDAY TIMES editorial "hysterical", adding that its criticism  confirmed "we South Africans know more about how to solve our  problems than a British editor 6,000 miles away." The NP said  it was acutely aware of risks facing South Africa at present.  "That is exactly why President (F W) de Klerk took the  initiative in proposing a meeting between himself, (ANC leader)  Mr (Nelson) Mandela, (IFP leader) Chief (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi  and the Zulu king which will take place on Friday."    It said that to allege that the NP was guilty of an enormous  fraud exposed the newspaper's lack of understanding and  knowledge of the situation in South Africa. "The newspaper's  implicit claim, that the NP sees the state of emergency in Natal  as a solution, is without foundation and an indication that its  editor did not read President de Klerk's statement when he  announced the state of emergency." The state of emergency, the  NP stressed, was never intended as a solution.</p>

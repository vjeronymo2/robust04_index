			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Glaxo AN IMPRESSIVE set of half-year figures from pharmaceuticals group Glaxo prompted one of the biggest daily turnovers in the stock recorded over the past decade. By the close of trading yesterday, more than 23m shares had been dealt in London and the share price, which reached a high of 710p at one stage, closed a net 22 ahead at 684p. When the figures were announced early in the session, the share price shot up sharply, offering an opportunity for UK institutions to sell into strength. But the momentum was checked only briefly and it soon rallied ahead of the start of trading on Wall Street. US investors were equally enthusiastic about Glaxo's figures and it was only towards the close in London that the selling pressure returned. The market was reassured by a denial that Glaxo was planning a massive rights issue, contrary to speculation that has dogged the stock over the past few weeks. Also, the headline profits figure of Pounds 819m was way above the forecast range of Pounds 780m to Pounds 800m, and analysts were particularly impressed by sales of Glaxo's main earner, the ulcer drug Zantac, which grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn. Most houses raised forecasts. Hoare Govett, around the top of the range, moved to Pounds 1.728bn for the current year and Pounds 2.032bn for 1994, while James Capel moved to Pounds 1.675bn and Pounds 1.82bn. However, even the bulls conceded that US sentiment was likely to drag on the share price for some time. Reaction to the results helped the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector. Wellcome gained 9 at 907p and SmithKline Beecham rose 4 1/2 to 443 1/2 p in the 'A's and 3 1/2 to 385 1/2 p in the Units. Stores deal After weeks of speculation, Kingfisher finally sealed the deal to buy Darty, the French electrical group, and the relief factor sent the stock surging. Sentiment was also helped by Kingfisher's estimate of its profits to January 1993, which at Pounds 233m were several million ahead of most analysts forecasts. The shares jumped 30 to 557p in heavy trade of 8.5m. The upbeat presentation and details of the deal prompted a welter of upgrades as analysts took account of the effect of France's leading electrical retailer on Kingfisher's profits. Kleinwort Benson increased its current year preliminary estimate from Pounds 255m to Pounds 320m, while others were said to be as high as Pounds 340m. There were also a number of buy recommendations issued. However, the merger was not without its critics. Questions over the state of the French electrical market, the French economy and Darty's financial situation were all raised by analysts doubtful over the synergies of the takeover. One bearish analyst said 'I cannot see the value for shareholders in this deal', and retained his negative stance. A more positive Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura commented: 'I am reasonably assured. The deal is earnings enhancing and it takes Kingfisher into a new market without dilution.' On the domestic front, Kingfisher said Comet was performing well, although the DIY chain B&amp;Q was in the doldrums. This was said to be the main reason for the fall in Ladbroke shares, off 2 at 196p, and the weakness in WH Smith 'A', steady at 425p. Conglomerate Hanson was steady in reaction to the news of the US tax proposals. Mr Jack L. Kelly of Goldman Sachs in the US argues that Hanson will not be affected by the levy on transfer pricing, which constitutes the most significant part of the proposed taxes on domestic profits from foreign companies. BAT Industries recovered 6 to 964p, with investors relieved that President Clinton did not include higher US tobacco taxes in his State of the Union address. Analysts said that UK building shares with transatlantic interests had largely anticipated President Clinton's tax plans, although Wolseley, the sector's most US exposed company, declined 6 to 550p on the back of worries about the US recovery. Turnover of 1.5m shares masked a 4.27m overnight agency cross trade in Taylor Woodrow, one of the leading UK housebuilders, which closed 2 up at 80p in line with a generally firm market. George Wimpey appreciated 9 to 139p as the market responded well to its attempt to avoid the mistakes of the 1980s by reorganising the way it buys building plots. Mining group RTZ slipped 5 to 646p in the registered stock after announcing that it is to enter the coal business through a Dollars 470 (Pounds 330.9m) purchase of Nerco of the US. The oil majors held up following announcement of the new US energy tax. BP added 1 1/2 at 262 1/2 p and Shell Transport 4 1/2 at 582p. Mr John Toalster of Strauss Turnbull said that although there was no short-term impact there was 'long-term cause for concern and, in an industry which is suffering very badly, you don't need an extra negative against you'. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson rose 17 to 626p after it announced 1992 profits well above market forecasts at Pounds 46.3m, against Pounds 27.9m last time. Analysts of the financial sector had expected a figure of around Pounds 35m but the bank cut its net provisions to Pounds 7m from Pounds 39m in 1991. Enthusiasm over the improvement spilled over into the rest of the sector. Schroders rose 65 to 1573p, SG Warburg 9 to 626p and Hambros 8 to 300p. Specialised medical products group Amersham International advanced 21 to 716p following a well-received presentation to about 35 institutions by Hoare Govett. Presentations to City analysts by Kwik Save were said to be unimpressive and the shares retreated 2 to 800p. J. Sainsbury received a boost from BZW, the shares rising 5 to 516p. Associated British Foods advanced strongly as Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken turned buyer. Some in the market believe the group may benefit from any restructuring in the bakery market. The shares climbed 10 to 474p. Carr also liked Great Universal Stores following a visit to the mail order business. Analyst Mr John Chataway said: 'We think our forecast of a 10 per cent rise in profits in mail order will now definitely be met.' The shares put on 23 at 1608p. Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott fell 12 to 288p after announcing a one-for-three cash call. The company is issuing 6.49m shares at 235p a share to raise Pounds 14.7m. Shares in security group Chubb firmed 4 to 277p as the company held presentations for several City institutions. A reported recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have boosted BTR, the shares appreciating 3 to 552p with some 3m traded in the equities and the equivalent of 2.7m in traded options. Danka Business shares were wanted and they closed 18 up at 573p. The rally in the US dollar helped British Airways gain 7 to 287p, while the market continued to appreciate plans by BAA for a fifth terminal that were announced on Wednesday. Shares in the UK airports operator moved ahead 11 to 781p. Mersey Docks continued to bask in the glow of good results adding another 9 at 318p. Engineering group Wheway moved forward 1 1/2 to 9p after McLeod Russell, an investment holding company, launched a hostile Pounds 14.3m takeover bid. The offer values Wheway stock at 10.2p per share. A shortage of stock in GKN saw the shares harden 7 to 476p. Motor distributors were in demand and Thomas Cowie gained 5 to 200p, while Pendragon rose 8 to 263p. Aerospace and engineering group Smiths Industries continued to languish on fears that a big customer may cancel or defer aircraft orders. The shares eased another 2 to 347p. In textiles, Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, closed 7 up at 251p as a volatile trade in the company continued. Shares in Dawson International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, were held at 226p by reports from analysts touring the company's US operations.

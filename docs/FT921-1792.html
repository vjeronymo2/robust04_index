			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Clinton adds voice to calls for reform of Congress GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, overwhelming favourite to be the Democratic party's presidential nominee, yesterday added his voice to the calls for reform in the way the US Congress does business. But he did so in a materially different way from President George Bush's demand that the solution lay in throwing out the Democrats from their long control of the legislature. Interviewed on TV, Mr Clinton agreed that Congress was too entrenched in its way, was too subject to pressure from special interest groups, and probably enjoyed too many perks. But the real problem, he went on, was the lack of a real partnership between the president and Congress. The Reagan and Bush administrations had been so intent on confrontation that they had 'let Congress drift in an unfortunate way'. It was, he said, typical that Mr Bush should veto, as announced on Friday, the lastest economic reform package passed on Capitol Hill. It was a serious attempt to deal with real economic problems, Mr Clinton said, and inappropriate for the president to block it simply because it would have increased income taxes on the wealthiest Americans. In the 1980s, he said, citing a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, national income had been significantly redistributed in favour of the better-off. If president, he would ensure no repetition of this. This represents Mr Clinton's first attempt to counter the latest tactic in the Bush strategy of declaring war on the Democrats in Congress. This is designed to capitalise on some of the scandals engulfing the legislature, which have in turn accentuated the mood against incumbent politicians. In calling for Congress to mend its ways, while putting much of the blame on the president, Mr Clinton hopes to rally the party behind him.</p>

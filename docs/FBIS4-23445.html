			<p>BFN     [Text] There is no doubt that the Chadian Government and  its armed opposition never agree: The National Awakening  Committee for Peace and Democracy in Chad [CSNPD], the southern  movement led by Moise Kete, has just denied an official report  that a strategist from its military wing has defected to the  government in Ndjamena. According to Rene Ngakouto Beyeme, CSNPD  spokesman in Bangui, the report is nothing but a mind-poisoning  gimmick on the part of the Chadian Government. Allain Georges  Ngatoua has the details:    [Begin recording] [Ngatoua] The CSNPD spokesman, Rene  Ngakouto Beyeme, explained this morning in Bangui that Moise  Kete's movement does not have a military strategist named  (Makna) in its ranks. Mr. Beyeme told reporters that the report  carried by LE PROGRES, the mouthpiece of Idriss Deby's Social  Movement for Democracy in Chad, is completely false.    [Beyeme] I say, and I repeat, that within the CSNPD we have  no military strategist or officer named (Makna). The story  about the 250 fighters referred to Ndjamena is absolutely false.  Furthermore, we are aware that when Deby visited the south of  the country, he set up committees charged with recruiting young  men into the Army, with or without their consent, and this is  being done at the greatest expense of the parents of these young  men. One Doub Alifa, sultan of the erstwhile kingdoms of  Bagereye, is the man in charge of these committees. All I can  say is that in the political staff [preceding word in English]  to which I belong, there are politicians, not military  strategists. [end recording]</p>

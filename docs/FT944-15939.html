			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Big Brother is watching - Insurers are keeping tabs on your life style Eat, drink and be merry is cheering advice in this stress-ridden world but, when it comes to life assurance, Big Brother is watching and taking notes. He is interested in your consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and cream cakes, how much exercise you take, who you sleep with, and whether your granny's heart attack indicates an hereditary weakness. All these factors are taken into account by life office actuaries when they assess your risk rating for life assurance. The more convivial your life style, the greater the likely impact on your life expectancy and the more expensive this vital family protection insurance will cost. Term assurance pays out a lump sum if you die within the period covered. Most company pension schemes include this benefit, but the self-employed and those without access to a pension scheme must shift for themselves. Mortgage lenders usually insist that borrowers should take out life assurance to pay off the loan if the worst happens. And parents saving for school fees often are advised to use term assurance to guarantee that the fees will be paid if the main income-earner dies. With more than 100 insurers offering products in this market, it is important to shop around for the best deal: with an uncompetitive provider, you can end up paying double - sometimes more. You should also check if you need to set up a trust for the policy so as to avoid inheritance tax problems. Smoking has long been recognised as a health hazard and insurers began offering discounts to non-smokers more than 10 years ago. This year, Sun Alliance and Providence Capitol introduced discounts for 'preferred lives' - those whose life style and family medical history indicates a longer than average life span. If you are under 50 and looking for a minimum cover of Pounds 100,000, Sun Alliance's 'life style' discount knocks up to 12.5 per cent off its standard non-smoking rates. A man of 40 who wants cover of Pounds 100,000 for 15 years would pay Pounds 28.80 a month if he was a non-smoker but only Pounds 25.50 with the discount. To qualify for that, you must not have smoked for five years, drink more than 21 units of alcohol a week, or work in a hazardous occupation. Most applicants for standard term assurance are asked to have a medical to check such things as blood pressure, pulse, and their height and weight ratio. They are screened also for nicotine (the 'cotenine' test) to check they were not being economical with the truth over their smoking habits. They will be asked if any family member (parent or sibling) has had diabetes, heart disease before age 60, cancer before age 50, or any hereditary ailment. Anyone taking drugs or medicines regularly, could lose the right to a discount. Ronnie Martin, individual risk marketing manager at Sun Alliance, stresses that the company is not trying to restrict its client base to fitness fanatics. 'We continue to accept 99.5 per cent of all applications - we are not excluding anyone. Equally important, we have not put up our standard rates against which these discounts apply.' Providence Capitol's preferred lives discount applies to its whole-of-life policy. This is very similar to term assurance but could also provide a small cash payment at the end of the term. The company's executive contract is designed for larger sums assured - typically Pounds 250,000, with a minimum premium of Pounds 50 a month. But the equivalent monthly premium for Pounds 100,000 is Pounds 26.70. There is a similar health screening process to that used by Sun Alliance. The table, provided by The Exchange database in Woking, Surrey, shows the top 10 rates for Pounds 100,000 cover for 15 years for a man of 40. Scottish Widows, for example, charges Pounds 24.55 a month but Scottish Life would charge Pounds 46.50. Other insurers are expected to introduce preferred life discounts shortly, although the most competitive reckon they can hold their market share without taking this step. But if you are less than super-fit or there is a family history of, say, cancer, it is worth checking the underwriting conditions of standard policies. Some insurers ask only for the most basic information while others require a similar level of detail to the preferred life questionnaires. At this stage, it is hard to judge the long-term implications of more stringent underwriting for the less fit. Big insurers like Sun Alliance should be able to maintain competitive standard rates - but watch out for smaller insurers who may cherry-pick the low-risk applicants and either refuse cover for the rest or raise premiums to an exorbitant level.  ---------------------------- TOP 10 RATES*  ---------------------------- Company               Premium                       (Pounds)  ---------------------------- Scottish Widows         24.55 Sun Alliance LS**       25.50 Providence Cap***       26.70 Sun Alliance            28.80 Permanent               28.96 Norwich Union           29.20 General Accident        29.40 Zurich Life             29.40 Scottish Prov           29.97 CU (select term)        30.10  ----------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * The table shows the monthly premium for Pounds 100,000 life assurance.

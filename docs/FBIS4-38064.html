			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda] </F>   [Text] A dream came true for four Israeli pilots,  including Brigadier General D., head of an Air Force division:  They flew an enemy aircraft. The flights took place in an East  European country about six months ago, BIT'ON HEYL HA'AVIR  reveals in this week's issue. The pilots flew the MiG-29 --  the Arab countries' most advanced aircraft -- four times, with  each flight lasting approximately 20 minutes at a temperature  under 0 degrees centigrade.    This unique opportunity to inspect the plane yielded several  distinct conclusions. According to one of the pilots, the  MiG-29 is easy to operate and maneuver and is energetic and well  equipped. It has excellent radar, a very advanced detection  system, and a more sophisticated throttle than that of the F-16.  As for its aerodynamic performance, it definitely belongs to  the state-of-the- art aircraft in the category of the F-15 and  F-16.    The most important conclusion for us: The MiG-29 is  incapable of reaching Israeli borders from either Iraq or Iran,  although it certainly can pose a threat to Israeli aircraft  attempting to reach those countries. The Air Force division  head summed up: We have a clear advantage over this aircraft,  but if we are forced to confront it, we may run a certain risk.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Slower pace pleases dealers - The bond market has enjoyed something of a surge WHILE the Japanese equity market has suffered declines in trading volume and prices over the past year, the bond market has enjoyed something of a surge. Falling interest rates and an improving inflation outlook have contributed to a rally in Japanese government bond (JGB) prices. Bond yields at the 10-year maturity have fallen from a high of 8.72 per cent in September 1990 to around 5.4 per cent. While the rally has been based squarely on domestic economic fundamentals, overseas buying of JGBs has added an extra zest to the rise in prices. Last year overseas investors bought a net Dollars 21bn equivalent Japanese bonds, following a hefty Dollars 17bn injection of cash in 1990. However, like the equity market, the Japanese government bond market has seen a spectacular collapse in trading volume from the inflated levels of the late 1980s. Last year average daily volume in the cash market ran at around Y4,000bn - only around half the level of 1987. But where equity market participants see the decline in trading volume as a threat to market stability, bond market participants are generally pleased to see a less frenetic pace of activity. The decline in volume is almost wholly attributable to a decline in proprietary trading by the big securities firms and banks. Investors have stayed in the market and the commissions of brokers has been largely protected. The big Japanese banks and securities companies still take large positions in the market. Daiwa, which accounted for around 15 per cent of all market turnover last year, estimated that around 40 per cent of its cash market activity is related to proprietary trading. However, the number of active players has declined and with it the volume of trading on intermediaries' own accounts. At the peak of the market there were 25 banks with active JGB operations and 30 securities firms. Dealers estimated only a dozen securities firms and perhaps four banks were now active. The decline in large position-taking has changed the behaviour of the market. 'In the past dealers were only interested in whether Nomura was buying or selling on any given day. Now the JGB market has become more rational,' commented Mr Eric Miller, head of bond futures at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. The decline of market volatility has been accelerated by the development of financial instruments which allow intermediaries and investors to hedge bond market positions. Market participants can now choose from listed bond futures, over-the-counter options and options on futures. By far the most popular derivative financial product is the 10-year bond futures contract listed on the Tokyo stock exchange, which trades an average of 2m contracts a month. Open interest is at present Y15,000bn. As with the cash market, futures trading volume has declined as speculative money has left the market. Open interest in the 10-year bond future reached Y18,000bn in 1989. Ten-year futures trading volume is down by around 30 per cent on its 1989 peak. The concentration of cash and futures trading activity at the 10-year maturity is seen as a weakness by many market participants. The designated 'benchmark' 10-year government bond issue attracts 99 per cent of all cash market volume. Investors do not have access to a liquid financial instrument through which they can manage exposure to medium-term interest rate risk. Intermediaries can not easily undertake arbitrage trading by, for example, taking a short position in a non-benchmark government bond issue. The lack of arbitrage trading between different maturities can lead to prolonged pricing anomalies which would soon be closed in other markets. Some of the structural shortcomings of the Japanese bond market may be apparent to investors at the present time. The best of the bull market in 10-year Japanese government bonds may now be over. While economists are anticipating at least another half point cut in official interest rates, bond yields at the benchmark 10-year maturity are probably close to bottoming out. Many investors are looking to switch into shorter-dated bonds, but are struggling to find appropriate liquid instruments. Japan is also notable for lacking a developed corporate bond market - something that bankers are keen to remedy. In the past, most Japanese companies have raised debt finance either from banks or in the international bond market, not least because the fees of underwriting firms were lower. But new practices have emerged and fees are being trimmed. Last autumn, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched the first Japanese domestic bond issue sold to investors under the fixed price re-offer mechanism favoured in the international bond market. Companies are also being allowed to issue shorter maturity bonds. In the past, only corporate bond issues over five years maturity received regulatory approval, a policy designed to keep the shorter maturity funding market free for banks. In January last year, Chugoku Electric launched the first four-year domestic bond issue by a Japanese corporation. Earlier this year Tokyo Electric Power launched the a three-year issue. The combination of new techniques, lower fees and more flexible maturities is likely to attract more Japanese companies to the domestic bond market in favour of the international market. Formidable obstacles to the development of a liquid corporate bond market do remain, however. For example, clearing and settlement of corporate bonds remains cumbersome. Banks and securities firms have yet to agree on how a new streamlined system would work.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNESSEE TOO MUCH FOR MARYLAND  </P> <P> When facing No. 1-ranked Tennessee, she who hesitates is lost.  </P> <P> Maryland found that out Friday night as Tennessee's experience and defense  carred it to a 77-65 victory in the semifinals of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. women's basketball tournament.  </P> <P> "I wish we could have given them a little better game," Maryland Coach Chris  Weller said. "They are just flat-out a much better team than we are at this  point. Their defense was unrelenting throughout the game."  </P> <P> Tennessee (34-2) will play Auburn for the championship Sunday in the Tacoma  Dome.  </P> <P> Oddly enough, it was the Terrapins (29-3) who inspired a big run by the  Volunteers in the second half, from which Maryland never recovered.  </P> <P> Carla Holmes hit a three-pointer for Maryland to give the Terrapins their only  lead of the half, 42-41, at 12:55. That seemed to be the challenge the  Volunteers needed. Tennessee reeled off 12 straight points and that, the  Volunteers seemed to say, was that.  </P> <P> "Tennessee is a smart team," Weller said. "If you get a little run on them,  they are going to be patient and come back."  </P> <P> Tennessee, which prides itself in this area, outrebounded Maryland, 43-36.  </P> <P> "I think it was the most important statistic," said Tennessee Coach Pat  Summitt. "In the second half, it was all Tennessee."  </P> <P> As usual, Tennessee's big front line was most impressive. Center Shelia Frost  scored 25 points and Bridgette Gordon contributed 24.  </P> <P> "I thought Sheila Frost had one of, if not the best, games of her career,"  Summitt said. "She told me on the way over here, 'I'm going to play well  tonight.' It made a difference."  </P> <P> The first half was tight until Tennessee, trailing at 15-14, scored eight  straight points, four by Gordon and four by Frost.  </P> <P> "That's what this team has been able to do this year," Summitt said. "Put  together strong runs."  </P></p>

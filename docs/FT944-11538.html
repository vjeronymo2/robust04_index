			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Reliance Electric opts for General Signal Reliance Electric, the US industrial motor company which is the target of a bid battle between industrial groups General Signal and Rockwell International, said yesterday it supported the lower of the two bids, from General Signal, writes Tony Jackson in New York. Reliance agreed a Dollars 1.3bn merger with General Signal in August, and the offer was capped last month by a Dollars 1.5bn hostile offer from the much larger Rockwell. Reliance said under the terms of its merger agreement with General Signal, the latter was entitled to a Dollars 50m fee if its offer was terminated. Taken with the 'many uncertainties and conditions' attached to the Rockwell offer, the Reliance board said it was 'unable to take a position' on the offer. It said the General Signal offer was 'an attractive transaction, with significant benefits for Reliance shareholders'. Rockwell said yesterday it was clear it had made the best offer, and that it intended to proceed. Rockwell's offer is in cash, General Signal's in shares.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Losses at EniChem up to L742bn LOSSES at EniChem, the troubled Italian state-owned chemicals group, leaped in 1991, to L742bn (Dollars 615m) after minority interests, compared with L86bn in the previous 12 months. Before minorities, losses rose more than 10 times to L722bn from L68bn in 1990, while at parent company level losses amounted to L732bn. A dividend, cut to L15 a share last year, will not be paid. Group sales fell by 6 per cent to L13,424bn. The result, which was worse than expected, confirms the immense difficulties facing the group, which re-entered the public sector after the collapse of the Enimont joint venture and sale of its stake by Montedison in November 1990. EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals company, has failed to get to grips with the severe problems facing the world chemicals industry. Long-awaited disposals and strategic alliances to move away from base chemicals have been put off, and large-scale redundancies and plant closures have been pushed aside by political considerations. Meanwhile, wrangles within EniChem and with its parent, the Eni energy and chemicals holding company, have complicated matters. EniChem blamed its results on the sharp fall in product prices due to weak demand and over-capacity in many sectors of the industry. The effect of declining prices, not matched by a drop in raw materials costs, was reflected in the collapse of operating profits, to L77bn from L743bn in 1990. The group's problems have been severely exacerbated by the extreme weakness of its balance sheet, which has left it under-capitalised and facing a heavy debt burden. This has only been partly mitigated by the transfer of some activities, notably refineries and the heavily loss-making fertilisers operation, to other parts of the Eni group. Although net debt fell by L1,337bn to L7,004bn at the end of last year, the figures mask contrasting tendencies. While just over L2,850bn of debt was shifted off the balance sheet though the transfer of activities to Eni, borrowing increased by over L1,500bn to help finance cash-flow and maintain investments.</p>

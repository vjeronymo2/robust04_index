			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / A tonic for Euro-malaise: Lionel Barber on what may be the final stages of the Gatt talks The Gatt world trade talks have moved decisively into an end-game. Failure remains possible; but high-level talks in Brussels this week between the US and the European Union have left the impression that the two powers that can make or break the negotiations are committed to striking a deal. On Monday, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, aim to unveil an outline agreement on all outstanding issues, including agriculture. They want to create a bandwagon effect, sweeping along all 103 countries in the Gatt negotiations in Geneva so that an agreement can be reached by the agreed deadline of December 15. It is a hard-sell, high-risk strategy. Much mind-numbing technical work remains to be done. Many wonder if there is enough time to reach a comprehensive deal that will persuade Latin American and Asia to climb aboard. For the moment the mood is cautiously optimistic. On Thursday night, EU foreign ministers gave Sir Leon a vote of confidence to make the final trade-offs to achieve a deal. A few ministers grumbled about a lack of detail, but French veto threats were absent. 'There is a common approach, there is enough cohesion, there is confidence in the Com-mission,' said Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister. Still, if a final deal is to be struck, many disputes must be resolved. One of the stickiest is US demands that the Europeans further open their markets in films and broadcasting. The EU counter-proposals for measures to protect 'cultural specificity' remain unacceptable in their present form. The US is also hanging tough on textiles and steel; and there is no agreement on new world trade rules to replace Gatt. One possible solution is a new Multilateral Trade Organisation which would license the terms under which members could take action against unfair trading practices. But the calculation in Brussels and Washington is that the stakes are too high to countenance failure. 'We have an awesome responsibility,' said Sir Leon. 'Failure would carry with it the risk of a downward spiral of protectionism leading to immense damage to the world economy.' Such rhetoric has echoed through the negotiating corridors regularly since the Uruguay Round started in 1986; but it is now taken seriously. This is most true of Europe, where a shift of opinion has taken place as business and political elites have woken up to the risks of failure. Big business now realises that Europe missed 'an historic opportunity' in 1990 to conclude a deal at an earlier Gatt meeting in Heysel Stadium, Brussels, said a leading French businessman. 'They did not push hard because those were good economic times. Failure would be catastrophic now.' The fear of the 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies of protectionism and competitive currency devaluations reminiscent of the 1930s has galvanised European industry. While estimates of an annual Dollars 250bn boost to the world economy are long-range and perhaps exaggerated, business leaders argue that a deal would deliver a much-needed lift to confidence. This was a theme in the report 'Beating the Crisis', by the European Round Table, the business leaders' group, unveiled yesterday in Brussels in the presence of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He, too, has undergone something akin to a conversion on Gatt. A year ago, Mr Delors was happy to deliver sermons on the plight of the French peasant and the need to stand up to 'Big Brother' across the Atlantic. But recently he warned his fellow Frenchmen to snap out of their 'national psychodrama' and to avoid retreating behind a modern-day Maginot line, the ineffective defence system built between the wars to stop a German invasion. The analogy is telling. It suggests that a collapse of the Gatt talks - if attributable directly to the French government - could crack the Franco-German alliance which remains the anchor of the European Union, whatever its present strains. In this spirit, members of the German Industry Federation have pointed out to their counterparts in the French Patronat that, since German manufactured exports account for 13.8 per cent of world manufacturing exports, Germany's vital interests are at stake in a Gatt deal. UK officials are equally blunt. They draw a picture of a European Union split between northern free-traders and a protectionist rump of Latin countries led by France. The likely result would be a rash of unilateral actions against cheap imports, the end of a unified EU trade policy, and the end of the single European market. The broader concern is that Europe gets caught in a world of managed trade between blocs. Last month's Apec summit in Seattle was viewed in Brussels as an implicit threat that the US could gain preferred trading partnerships in the fast-growing Asian markets. When Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned this week that a failure in the Gatt talks would damage the transatlantic alliance, he was taken seriously. Similarly, Europeans fear a trading system without established rules and codes for regulating the subsidising and dumping of exports and settling trade disputes. It would mean 'a licence to kill', said a senior Commission official. This reveals the widespread sense of vulnerability in Europe provoked by the conflict over the Maastricht treaty, the collapse of the European Monetary System and now the phenomenon of mass unemployment. A Gatt deal would not be a miracle cure, but it would restore confidence in Europe's ability to act collectively on a matter of vital interest.</p>

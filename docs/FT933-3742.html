			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: An upset in the ratings game - US Open Tennis / TV's 'Super Saturday' in New York has been ruined by Cedric Pioline, Alexander Volkov and Wally Masur. John Barrett, for one, is pleased EVEN without the 11 players who retired, defaulted or otherwise withdrew, the 25th US Championships of the open era have provided enough on-court shocks among the men to be sub-titled 'Slaughter on 10th Avenue.' No Gershwin melody ever sounded as sweet to Cedric Pioline and Magnus Larsson, unlikely heroes from France and Sweden, who beat respectively the top seed and world No 1 Jim Courier, and the 1989 champion Boris Becker, seeded No 4. These two upsets shook the tennis establishment and sent a chill through the CBS television network whose prime time coverage of today's semi-finals will be Cedric Pioline, the No 15 seed, versus the unseeded Australian Wally Masur, and Alexander Volkov of Russia against the Pete Sampras of the US, the No 2 seed. This is hardly what CBS had planned for 'Super-Saturday', an annual day of disgrace in the tennis calendar when the women's singles final is sandwiched between the two men's semi-finals. The winning men playing their final the following day. Accordingly I have little sympathy for the officials who put ratings before their responsibility to the performers and the paying public. I cannot think of another leading sport where the finalists do not know when they will compete. As for the men having no day of rest before the final, this is unfair on them. I well remember the fiasco in 1985 when John McEnroe won a magnificent five-set battle against Mats Wilander. It was brutally hot and humid and McEnroe was exhausted. The following day, against Ivan Lendl, who had easily beaten Jimmy Connors, McEnroe slid tamely to defeat. With a day's rest we might have had the final we deserved. Yet there is a simple answer. If the championships were moved one week earlier the final weekend would coincide with Labor Day. The two men's semis would be played on the Saturday, the women's singles and men's doubles on the Sunday and the men's singles and mixed doubles on the holiday Monday. This simple solution will doubtless be sacrificed to TV schedules - in other words, money. A pity this, because the income of the USTA would not be seriously threatened by laying down the conditions for the bidding networks. In any case one must question the wisdom of increasing the prize money so sharply. There really was no pressure from the players or anyone else to raise it from Dollars 8,210,200 last year to Dollars 9,022,000 this (more than double the 1988 total). Night play is another example of commercial exploitation taking precedence over sporting fairness. The US Open, like the Australian Open, is two tournaments: one played in daylight, the other under lights. There have been players, such as Bjorn Borg, who simply could not see as well at night. His plea not to play Roscoe Tanner, the fast serving American left-hander, at night in 1979 was ignored. Borg lost. Cynics suggested that national interest had overridden impartiality. The foolish scheduling this year, which spread the first round singles matches over three days instead of two, caught up with the organisers when rain prevented Becker from playing more than two points of his night match against Andrei Cherkasov on the first Wednesday. Further rain interrupted the conclusion on Thursday as Becker struggled back to win 6-4 in the fifth. Now, to win the tournament, he would have had to survive six best-of-five set matches in 10 days, a totally avoidable situation. Fatigue was certainly a contributory factor as a jaded Becker eventually lost to Larsson. Yes, there has been some controversy this year but there have also been some impressive performances from other relative newcomers such as Andrei Medvedev, Richard Krajicek and Todd Martin. Certainly today's athletic young giants are bigger and stronger on average than players were 20 years ago. With their powerful graphite rackets they have produced an impressive match-winning formula. Yet, wonderful as it was to see Sampras cutting down his boyhood nemesis Michael Chang so impressively on Wednesday - a 6-7 7-6 6-1 6-1 victory of accelerating expertise - there were few rallies to admire. Today's technique is based on pace rather than placement, on power instead of finesse. Quick winners are the order of the day. None of this would have been possible with the old smaller-headed wooden rackets. Any attempt to hit the ball really hard without perfect stroke production would have led to error and, even if it had gone in, the ball would not have travelled as fast as it does today. In those days there was a premium on skill. The champions of the wooden era hit the ball in the middle of the racket more often than their challengers and could exploit tactical superiority. Strength and fitness alone were no guarantee of success. Masur, who arrived somewhat fortunately in the semi-finals for the first time (he was 0-5 down in the final set of his fourth round match against fellow Aussie Jamie Morgan), said: 'I am not a power tennis player. I don't serve at 125 mph and crack my forehand. I usually have to hit two or three shots to win a point. That is probably because I was brought up playing with a wooden racket. These days some of the guys don't construct points because they don't have to. They have got the ability to virtually win it from anywhere on the court.' It would be interesting to stage a tournament among today's top players with wooden rackets. We might be surprised by the results. I guarantee that we would find it more entertaining.</p>

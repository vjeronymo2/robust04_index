			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PLAYERS: WHO'S WHO AMONG THE BEST IN THE COUNTY  </P> <P> This year's batch of top high school football players in Orange County has  plenty of quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers. You can't miss them.  </P> <P> They're the guys who scramble left and right behind the line, then complete  50-yard passes. The guys who break three, four, five tackles for that crucial  first down. The guys who make diving catches in the corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> But before we get to all that junk, here's the guys who do the dirty work. The  young men down in the trenches. The fellows who block, tackle and snarl.  </P> <P> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the . . .  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP FIVE LINEMEN  </P> <P> Mike Burns, senior, linebacker (Esperanza) -- Big, strong and fast, which  coaches tend to like in a linebacker. Burns is 6 feet 3, 235 pounds but runs  4.6 in the 40-yard dash. He started five games at outside linebacker as a  junior. He had three sacks and forced one fumble in the season opener against  Santa Ana. Burns then moved to inside linebacker at the start of Empire League  play, but tore ligaments in his ankle midway through the second quarter and  missed the remainder of the season.  </P> <P> Jeremy Hogue, senior, defensive tackle (El Toro) -- Another in a long line of  great linemen at El Toro. He was a second-team all -- South Coast League  selection last season and has beefed up to 255 pounds on his 6-4 frame. He also  has the ability to play from sideline-to-sideline, according to Charger  coaches. Hogue plays on the El Toro basketball team, a testament to his ability  to move quickly with his size. A 4.0 student, he was elected one of the  Chargers' captains this season.  </P> <P> D.C. Olsen, senior, linebacker (Fullerton) -- A 6-1, 220-pound physical player,  who also has good speed. He was a first-team all-Freeway League selection last  season. Besides being a standout in football, Olsen is one of the best baseball  players in the county. Last season, he set a county record for home runs with  13. He also led the county in runs batted in (39), runs (42), hits (50) and  doubles (13). Played guard last season for the Indian football team, but will  move to fullback this season.  </P> <P> Brian Pearsall, senior, defensive tackle (Villa Park) -- A second-team all --  Orange County selection last season. A key member of a defense that held four  teams to fewer than 10 points. Pearsall has added weight and is now 6-3, 235.  He also has good speed, in fact Coach Pat Mahoney said he considered moving  Pearsall to defensive end. Mahoney also calls him the key to the Spartan  defense. Pearsall was selected as a team captain for the second consecutive  year. He also will play offensive tackle.  </P> <P> Karl Schroller, senior, offensive tackle (Fountain Valley) -- If nothing else,  college recruiters are impressed with Schroller's size (6-7, 280). But he can  also play. Schroller is strong; he power-cleans 275 pounds and bench presses  300. He has also been clocked at 5.05 in the 40. Quiet off the field, but has a  nasty disposition on it, according to Baron Coach Mike Milner. He didn't play  football until his sophomore season, but has learned the game quickly. Will  become an even better player in college, Milner says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP FIVE SKILL PLAYERS  </P> <P> LaQuan Beckton, senior, running back (Los Alamitos) -- Missed three games  because of an injured ankle and played in the shadow of Erik Mitchell  (Colorado), who gained more than 1,000 yards. However, Beckton still had his  moments. He had one 100-yard game and finished with more than 400 yards and  scored five touchdowns. Beckton will be the official point of the running game  this season. At 5-9, 200, he has the size to run over would-be tacklers, but he  is fast enough to run past them.  </P> <P> Tyler Cashman, senior, wide receiver (Los Alamitos) -- One of the most  versatile players in the county. He has the speed to play wide receiver and the  size (6-4, 205) to play tight end. He is also the team's punter. Coach John  Barnes said Cashman can place kick and also would be a good quarterback. Last  season, he caught 45 passes for 823 yards and seven touchdowns. Besides his  ability as a receiver, Barnes said Cashman is a solid blocker and a team  leader. A first-team all-Empire League selection in 1989.  </P> <P> Rob Johnson, senior, quarterback (El Toro) -- An all-Orange County selection at  wide receiver last season. He also backed up quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who  is at Stanford. Johnson played at quarterback on the freshman and sophomore  teams and led the sophomore team to a 9-1 record in 1988. He is the son of El  Toro Coach Bob Johnson and brother of Bret Johnson, who led the Chargers to two  Southern Section championships. Johnson, who is 6-4, 205, has a strong arm and  good speed. Last season, he caught 60 passes for 1,300 yards and 15 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Sean Saunders, senior, running back (Foothill) -- The leading rusher in the  Century League last season with 846 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. He  isn't the biggest back (5-9, 175) or the fastest (4.75 in the 40), but he's a  hard runner and durable. Saunders gained 153 yards against University and 131  yards against Irvine. Coach Marty McWhinney said Saunders will carry the ball  even more this season. Saunders worked with a running coach during the  off-season and lowered his time in the 40 from 5.0 to 4.75.  </P> <P> Tony Solliday, senior, quarterback (Capistrano Valley) -- He already has shown  why he is among the best. He completed 15 of 23 passes for 221 yards and three  touchdowns in the Cougars' 29-15 victory over Honolulu Damien last week. In  1989, Solliday completed 151 of 249 passes for 2,377 yards and 20 touchdowns.  In the Southern Section Division III semifinals against Paramount, Solliday led  the Cougars on a 63-yard touchdown drive that tied the game, 21-21, with 21  seconds left. He completed six of seven passes for 53 yards on the drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NEXT FIVE  </P> <P> David Ackerman, senior, offensive tackle (Foothill) -- One of the main reasons  Sean Saunders will gain more than 1,000 yards this season. McWhinney said  Ackerman worked overtime in the weight room during the off-season and is now  6-1, 240, up 10 pounds from last season.  </P> <P> Jeremy Brion, senior, defensive back/running back (Capistrano Valley) -- Might  be the best defensive back in the county. He intercepted three passes in the  Cougars' victory over Honolulu Damien last week, matching his season total from  1989. Against Damien, he gained 58 rushing yards in 10 attempts.  </P> <P> Julian Ford, senior, tight end/linebacker (Trabuco Hills) -- A blue-chip  recruit at either position. He caught 34 passes for 595 yards and six  touchdowns last season. In two years on the varsity, he has caught 17 touchdown  passes. Ford also has the size (6-3, 215), speed and ferocity to play  linebacker.  </P> <P> Brian Haas, senior, linebacker/tight end (El Toro) -- A first-team all-South  Coast League selection last season. He played mostly on defense in 1989, but  did catch a crucial touchdown pass in the Chargers' regular-season victory over  Mission Viejo. Haas has good speed and size (6-2, 217).  </P> <P> Todd Kehrli, junior, quarterback (Corona del Mar) -- Led the Sea Kings to the  Division VI championship as a sophomore. Even though Corona del Mar relied more  on its defense and running attack, Kehrli still completed 122 of 254 passes for  1,662 yards and 10 touchdowns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1,000-YARD CLUB  </P> <P> Visko Ancich, senior (Tustin) -- A tough, tackle-to-tackle runner. He gained  633 yards last season and averaged 5.1 yards per carry with eight touchdowns.  Also a good receiver, led the team in receptions the last two seasons.  </P> <P> Gerrick Emry, junior (Esperanza) -- The Aztecs traditionally have a good  offensive line and someone has to benefit. This year it will be Emery who has  speed (10.0 in 100 yards) and size (6-1, 200).  </P> <P> Ron Goods, senior (Tustin) -- Sure, Ancich will get 1,000 yards but Goods will  be right there too. A perfect complement to his running mate, Goods has been  clocked at 4.55 in 40. He gained more than 338 yards last season, but had to  share time with Kelvin Love, who graduated.  </P> <P> Josh Ireland, senior (Santa Margarita) -- Gained 1,080 yards and averaged 7.7  yards per carry in 1989. With the Eagles' weak free-lance schedule, he should  easily match those numbers.  </P> <P> Kenny Overby, senior (Sunny Hills) -- Gained more than 900 yards last season as  the Lancers' No. 2 back. Good speed and a strong runner who is out of the  shadow of Brian Pizula, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season.  </P> <P> Brian Remmel, senior (Orange) -- The focal point of the Panther offense a year  ago. He gained more than 1,300 yards and led Orange into the Division VIII  playoffs. May get the ball less because of the return of tailback Acen Childs.  </P> <P> Mike Sullivan, senior (Sunny Hills) -- Same situation as Tustin, but the  Lancers nearly had two 1,000-yard rushers last season. Sullivan played wingback  last season, but still gained 558 yards rushing and averaged 8.5 yards per  carry. He is faster than Overby.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MR. VERSATILE  </P> <P> Randy Karliner, senior, quarterback/linebacker/punter (Ocean View) -- The hopes  of the Seahawks pretty much rest with Karliner. He led Ocean View to a 7-4  record and the Sunset League co-championship. Karliner passed for 1,356 yards  and 14 touchdowns, and was also the team's second-leading rusher. On defense,  he is the team's best linebacker and averaged nearly 40 yards per punt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THEY'RE BACK  </P> <P> Acen Childs, senior, tailback (Orange) -- He had more than 300 yards after the  Panthers' first two games then injured his knee. Childs isn't the biggest  player around (5-9, 160), but has good speed. With Remmel, he should give the  Panthers a potent running game.  </P> <P> Mike Cunningham, senior, wide receiver/defensive back (Edison) -- He had 13  receptions for 270 yards and five touchdowns when he broke his thumb. He missed  four games, but still led the team in interceptions with four. A versatile  athlete who can play quarterback if needed.  </P> <P> Ben Rooker, senior, running back (Trabuco Hills) -- When healthy, he could be  the best running back in Orange County. But he has played only parts of two  season because of knee, ankle and groin injuries. Rooker, who is 6-3, 225,  gained 459 yards and averaged 7.1 yards per carry in five regular-season games  in 1989.  </P> <P> Chris Singletary, senior, quarterback/linebacker (Rancho Alamitos) -- He was  considered dangerous on both sides of the ball, but broke his leg in two places  during the first game of the season. Singletary spent six months in a cast, but  is 100% recovered. At 6-1, 225, will likely play linebacker in college.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THEY'RE GONE  </P> <P> Danny Maestas, senior, running back (El Toro) -- He scored 10 touchdowns last  season and was projected as the team's starting tailback. However, he injured  his knee during summer workouts and is out three to five weeks.  </P> <P> Chris Adams, senior, running back (Capistrano Valley) -- He was supposed to be  the replacement for 1,000-yard rusher Paul Shaheen. However, Adams injured his  back during summer workouts and is out indefinitely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TRANSFERS  </P> <P> Casey Sullivan, senior, quarterback (Laguna Hills) -- He threw for 1,430 yards  and 12 touchdowns last season for St. Monica. Sullivan will give the Hawks a  strong passing attack to go with a good running game.  </P> <P> Shad Vickers, senior, defensive back/running back, (Tustin) -- Gee, just what  the Tillers needed, another good running back. Vickers gained 787 yards and  scored six touchdowns last season for Irvine. Because of Ancich and Goods,  Vickers will play mostly on defense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SLEEPER  </P> <P> Donnell Dowdy, junior, defensive back/quarterback (University) -- Last season,  Dowdy intercepted six passes -- second-best in the county -- and returned three  for touchdowns. He was a first-team all-Southern Section selection even though  the Trojans had a 2-8 record. Dowdy, who is 6-3, 205, will also play at  quarterback this season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TOE  </P> <P> Josh Klein, senior, (Newport Harbor) -- The best kicker in the county. He made  12 field goals, nine of which were longer than 30 yards. Klein, who is also an  outstanding soccer goalie, had one field goal of 45 yards and another of 44.  </P></p>

Representatives of the Supreme Command Headquarters led by  Lieutenant Chiradet Diphian, director of the Supreme Command  Headquarters Intelligence Department, filed a lawsuit with  Police Major General Wannarat Khotcharat, commander of the  Police Crime Suppression Division, against General Vang Pao,  General Thonglit Chokbengbun, and their colleagues for having  set up outlaw organizations -- the Lao National Liberation Front  and the Lao National Liberation Army -- in Thailand. The two  organizations are responsible for acts of terrorism along the  border with Laos in Phayao and Nan Provinces.    Police Major General Wannarat disclosed that the police  director general had assigned him to appoint a working team to  investigate this case. He said he is confident that the two  accused will be brought to trial, although the military has  reported that they are now living outside the country.    Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak reaffirmed  that the Thai Government is always ready to cooperate with the  Lao Government in the suppression of terrorism in Laos. He  said:    [Begin Wichit recording] They are in Laos. Thailand is  willing to cooperate with Laos.

It was predictable because the ideology of  "socialist legality" fully permitted such a concealed form of  denial of justice. On the other hand, one does not want to  believe that the court today can so blatantly and defiantly take  advantage of these obsolete norms of criminal procedure. The  more so with a case that is being followed throughout the world.    Understandably, a supplementary investigation is to the  advantage of the procuracy and the investigation team in order  to cover their tracks. But why would the court play into their  hands?    IZVESTIYA has been writing about the V. Mirzayanov case  since  the criminal proceedings were initiated. We have discussed  various angles of this story, which is incredible from the  standpoint of common sense, and tried to understand the  underlying causes of these repressive measures that have been  taken against the scientist. We have tried to understand the  logic of a state which, on the one hand, votes for an  international Convention on Chemical Disarmament and, on the  other, jails a person who has spoken out against Russia's  "military-chemical" weapons. We have appealed to the reason of  the investigators and procurators, proving that the scientist's  action, regardless of how it may have displeased the  bureaucrats, was for the good of public interests and not to  their detriment. Alas, they would not listen to us.    But still there was hope in the court, a power that is  independent of other state institutions, that is capable of  listening to both sides and necessarily expressing an  independent viewpoint regarding the conflict between the  bureaucrats from the military-chemical complex and the citizen.  Let me emphasize: The court does not have the right to refuse to  hand down a verdict. It must say quite specifically whether the  person is guilty or not. That is the point of the judicial  practice.    According to the rules of criminal law in effect, the  arguments of the investigators were quite adequate to put  Mirzayanov behind bars. Were it not for one circumstance or,  more precisely, constitutional condition: Any normative legal  documents affecting the rights, freedoms, and obligations of a  human being and a citizen may not be applied unless they are  officially published for universal knowledge of them.    The lists of state secrets have the stamp "secret" and are  not published anywhere. In other words, from the standpoint of  human rights and the Constitution, it is as though the lists do  not exist. And it is impossible to bring criminal charges  against a person on these grounds.    Did the investigators from state security and the  procurators  supervising them know this? They knew, of course, but instead of  human rights and the Constitution they chose a different point  of reference--criminal law of the 1961 model which is in force,  alas, to this day and allows references to unpublished normative  acts.    Alas, the court also followed in the footsteps of state  security and the General Procuracy. And V. Mirzayanov, who was  trying to protest, they brought up short using a well-known  investigatory device--they put him under guard. That is how the  judicial investigation began. And the judicial proceedings  rolled on along the trail that had already been blazed by the  investigation--the person with more rights is right.    In the investigators' version the chemist told the world  something that he was categorically forbidden to divulge. It was  forbidden, naturally, by the Lists. One small thing was lacking:  Take the Lists in hand, put V. Mirzayanov's article in front of  them, compare the texts, and draw a conclusion--did the  scientist really divulge a state secret? Did he say what the  Lists had forbidden him to divulge? The entire investigation  would take a half hour! Then they could to present the Lists and  their conclusions to the accused and his lawyer--go ahead and  refute them, defend yourself.    But no: The investigation took more than a year and was  actually reduced to a matter making it as difficult as possible  for the accused to exercise his right to a defense. This was  done in a brilliantly simple way--instead of the content of the  List itself, the contradictory opinion of experts regarding  points of the secret document was presented.    What was the court supposed to do in this case? In the first  place, as the defense anticipated, examine the text of the List  itself and understand the nature of the disagreements among the  experts. In the second place, if the help of specialists was  needed, schedule a new expert appraisal but with different  experts. The court did nothing of the kind. It followed the same  path as the investigators--it refused to include the List in the  criminal case and it entrusted the repeat of the expert  appraisal to the previous specialists.    The result was familiar--the experts again expressed  disagreements. And the main document on which the accusation was  based remained outside the investigation. Now there is already a  judicial investigation. The circle has closed: The person with  the greatest rights is right.    Why did the investigation team and the court so stubbornly  conceal the List from the accused and his defense?    "I think there was just one reason," answered V.  Mirzayanov's  defense lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. "The paragraphs of that  document were not convincing enough to be indisputable evidence.  Moreover, if the List were published today, V. Mirzayanov's  innocence would be obvious to everyone. No expert opinion would  be necessary."    It is known that the procurator is not overly delighted with  the preliminary and the judicial investigations. Apparently he  did not manage to obtain convincing evidence of V. Mirzayanov's  guilt. If he is not proven guilty, is he then innocent? And will  the procurator give an acquittal? Not at all. He used a tested  weapon of "socialist legality"--he asked the court not to  pronounce a verdict, actually to deny the accused justice, and  to return the case for additional investigation.    It is not difficult to guess the results of the  supplementary  investigation. Such cases as V. Mirzayanov's do not go to court  a second time--they are "buried" in the procuracy forever. And  regardless of the procuracy's justification for closing the  case--whether it be because the accusation was not proved or  because the situation changed--the decision cannot be called  just. For if there is no judicial decision, there is no justice.  And that is the most terrible outcome of V. Mirzayanov's  case--to be left with the investigatory brand for his entire  life.    Incidentally, V. Mirzayanov himself agreed with the  suggestion of the state plaintiff and did not object to having  the case sent back for further investigation. The lawyer A.  Asnis backed his client up. Why?    "We had no other choice," explains the lawyer. "We chose the  lesser of two evils. There is no point in referring to the law  in a society where legal principles and constitutional norms are  not enforced. Even if the procuracy has real power over the  court, obviously, it too has to decide. After this trial,  neither Mirzayanov nor I had any hope left of obtaining justice."    I do not know the arguments the court used to justify its  decision; journalists were not informed of that. But of one  thing I am sure--the judicial investigation conducted following  the model and likeness of the state security investigation did  not add to its glory and did not lead to the truth. And I am  afraid that the judges in these scandalous proceedings were  quite suited to the typical position of bureaucrats of some  "legal protection department" who actually act and make  decisions in deference to their more influential colleagues--the  procurators and investigators.    So for now let us not foster any hopes in that beautiful  slogan about the separation of powers. Judging from the case of  Vil Mirzayanov, it seems that we have only one  power--military-chemical.</p>

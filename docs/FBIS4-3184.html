			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Newsletter by reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Hu </F> Xiaoguang (5170 2556 0342): "Tashkent Joyfully Welcomes an  Honored Guest"]    [Text] Tashkent, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- After a long flight of  6 and half hours, the special plane taken by State Council  Premier Li Peng and his party from Beijing slowly touched down  at Tashkent Airport at 1400 sharp local time today.    The sun shone brightly and a gentle breeze could be felt in  the Tashkent afternoon. An Uzbek Foreign Ministry official told  reporters that today's welcoming ceremony was the most solemn  held in Uzbekistan since it declared independence. A guard of  honor comprising the airborne force, air force, tank force, and  army units was used for the first time as was the newly  inaugurated airport terminal for reception of foreign guests.  It shows that Uzbek leaders attach very great importance to the  further development of Sino-Uzbek relations as well as Li Peng's  visit.    Uzbek President Karimov looked particularly happy today. He  led the acting chairman of the Supreme Soviet, prime minister,  various ministers, and ranking officials to greet Premier Li  Peng and his party at the airport.    This was the second time Karimov and Li Peng were to meet  each other. The two leaders held friendly talks in March 1992  when President Karimov paid a state visit to China. Premier Li  Peng's current visit marks the first visit by a high-level  Chinese leader to Uzbekistan since it declared independence.    The city of Tashkent carried out renovation of its main  streets especially to welcome Premier Li Peng's visit. When Li  Peng and his party's motorcade drove through the level, clean,  and tidy streets, pedestrians on both sides waved their hands to  greet the visitors. Uzbek and Chinese national flags and various  colorful flags fluttered in the wind on some main streets.  Large signs with Chinese characters reading "Welcome Premier Li  Peng's Visit to Uzbekistan," "Friendship, Peace, and Friendly  Relations Between Uzbekistan and China,"...met the eyes of  honored Chinese guests at the intersections. All this added an  atmosphere of warmth and friendliness to this famous ancient  city in central Asia, and made visitors from Beijing feel warm  and comfortable.    Tashkent's news media attached great importance to Premier  Li  Peng's visit. Today's KHAIK SUZI [renmin yanlun bao 0086 3046  6056 6158 1032], an official newspaper of the Uzbek Government,  carried a front-page headline in Chinese characters:  "Respectable Chinese Premier Li Peng, We Warmly Welcome Your  Visit to Uzbekistan!" It noted in a published news item: Uzbek  leaders are convinced that Premier Li Peng's current visit will  further promote the development of mutually beneficial  Sino-Uzbek relations on an equal footing.    In the past week, Tashkent's newspapers and TV stations have  carried extensive reports on China's situation -- the ancient  culture and beautiful scenery of the Chinese nation, the modern  look of Shanghai and other industrial cities, rapid economic  development enjoyed by special zones, and so forth. Chief  editor (Alihanov) of the Uzbek State TV Station said to  reporters: "We expect more Sino- Uzbek joint ventures will be  established after Premier Li Peng's visit. It is advantageous  to the two countries."    Premier Li Peng's visit has become an important topic of  conversation between citizens on Tashkent's streets which are  permeated with a jubilant atmosphere. The people are looking  forward to continuous development of friendly Sino-Uzbek  contacts which go back to ancient times. They hope the ancient  silk road blazed by their forefathers will glow with new  splendor.</p>

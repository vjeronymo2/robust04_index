			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VANDAL BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR DERAILMENT IN WESTMINSTER  </P> <P> A vandal who flipped a switch on a train track apparently caused two  locomotives and two boxcars carrying thousands of rounds of artillery shells to  derail Tuesday night in Westminster, railroad officials said this morning.  </P> <P> The Southern Pacific train, called the Huntington Beach Switcher, was at the  crossing at Hoover Street about two miles from Seal Beach Naval Weapons  Station, heading toward Anaheim, when the locomotives and cars slipped off the  track.  </P> <P> "All the cars were upright, although some were leaning. None of the ammunition  was damaged in any way," said Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland. "There  were no detonators aboard, so there was no real risk of explosion. No railroad  carries live stuff."  </P> <P> Westminster officials were close to evacuating about 1,000 people in the area,  including a nearby hospital and several retirement homes, after the 6:35 p.m.  accident. But they decided against the precaution when naval ordnance experts  determined the cargo was undamaged.  </P> <P> Aboard the two derailed cars were 2-foot long, 5-inch diameter, 38-caliber  shells, which are shot from guns aboard battleships.  </P> <P> Early this morning, the two stranded but undamaged boxcars were towed back to  the Seal Beach station, where the ammunition was to be stored until it can be  shipped out again.  </P> <P> By dawn today, about 15 green-helmeted Southern Pacific workers were repairing  300 feet of twisted rails and torn railway ties at Westminster Boulevard and  Hoover Street. Using a crane-like device, they hoisted the damaged rail and  pulled broken ties from underneath.  </P> <P> Southern Pacific road master Larry Magathan, who was supervising the repairs,  said new rails and ties were on the way. He predicted that the rails would be  repaired by Friday.  </P> <P> "Right now, we think it is vandalism," said Bill Currier, a superintendent with  Southern Pacific. "We think they tampered with a switch."  </P></p>

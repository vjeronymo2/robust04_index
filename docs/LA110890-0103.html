			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> WELLMAN IS CLOSING IN ON 1,000 YARDS  </P> <P> With 46 receptions for 792 yards this season, senior flanker Gary Wellman is on  pace to become USC's first 1,000-yard receiver.  </P> <P> He needs 23 receptions to break Erik Affholter's school record of 68 in one  season.  </P> <P> That also would move him into third place on USC's all-time receiving list. And  if he maintains his average of 88 yards a game, he will break Jeff Simmons'  school record of 973 yards in one season.  </P> <P> Wellman made 45 catches in his first three seasons at USC.  </P> <P> Linebacker Brian Tuliau tore ligaments in his left ankle in Saturday's 31-31  tie with California and may be out for the season, Coach Larry Smith said.  </P> <P> Giles Pellerin, a retired phone company executive from Pasadena who has  attended 699 consecutive USC football games, is expected to extend his streak  to 700 when the Trojans play Oregon State Saturday at Corvallis, Ore.  </P> <P> The streak started in 1926, when Pellerin was a sophomore at USC. Pellerin, 83,  will be given a game ball if USC beats the Beavers, Smith said. JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

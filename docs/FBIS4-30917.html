			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 26 -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (MSZ) has drawn up four programmes intended to give economic  support to the implementation of the Polish eastern policy.  Another two are being prepared, the MSZ told newsmen on  Thursday. The programmes called "Wokulski," "Partners,"  "Transit," "Contact," "Market," and "Democracy" will be  implemented and coordinated by a council for eastern policy,  which is to be established soon.    The "Wokulski" project will promote Polish exporters. "We  want to provide equal opportunities to Polish and western  investors backed up by investment insuring companies," MSZ  official Jerzy Kowalczyk said.    "Partners" will promote creating equity ties between Poland  and its eastern neighbours. The project also provides for  establishing a data bank of investment information and an  assistance fund supporting Polish businessmen.    Under the "Transit" programme, Poland will be able to use  its  geographical position by opening duty-free zones, providing  banking services and acting as intermediary in business with the  east.    "Contact" has been designed to support contacts between  people at all levels, including the signing of visa-free  traffic, readmission, border crossing development, the youth  exchange and the promotion of polish culture in the east.    Some of the projects have already been discussed by Polish  and Russian foreign affairs ministers, Andrzej Olechowski and  Andrey Kozyrev and according to Jakub Wolasiewicz, director of  the Ministry's Europa II Department, "ninety per cent of the  proposals have been accepted" by Kozyrev.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Lufthansa sell-off plan approved The German government yesterday approved plans for the progressive privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, and promised to reduce its stake in a first step from 51.4 to 38 per cent, by not participating in a DM515m (Pounds 206m) rights issue. The three-phase process of privatisation would be completed as rapidly as the capital markets allowed, possibly by the end of 1995, said Mr Matthias Wissmann, transport minister. The agreement thrashed out by Lufthansa, the transport and finance ministries, and the state pensions fund (VBL) was approved by the cabinet yesterday, after winning the support of unions and employees at the airline. Lufthansa shareholders will be asked to approve the first step of the process, the capital increase of DM515m, as well as an unspecified number of special shares for employees, on top of the existing DM1.52bn nominal capital, at their annual meeting on July 6. Mr Wissmann confirmed that the government hoped to encourage the widest possible range of shareholders in the privatised airline, but precise details had yet to be worked out. He declined to comment on whether or how foreign ownership of shares might be restricted, except to confirm that the matter was under discussion. He said that after the capital increase, the government hoped to sell a first tranche of its remaining shareholding before the end of the year. A second tranche to dispose of the entire state shareholding could be sold before the end of 1995. Lufthansa announced on Monday it expected to return to profit this year, and paid its first dividend to ordinary shareholders since 1989. The European Court yesterday rejected an Air France appeal against a decision by Brussels in 1992 to authorise the purchase by British Airways of 49.9 per cent of Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), a French airline. Air France had claimed the acquisition could cause access problems on French air routes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General 'Abd-al-Rahman Sa'id, </F> deputy leader of the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army, by  Talhah Jibril in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Jibril] You were in charge of the Army's command.  Why did you not fight al-Bashir's coup?    [Sa'id] I will go back a little to talk about the memorandum  handed to al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's government. In this memorandum we  spoke about the neglect suffered by the Armed Forces. We asked  the government to pay attention to our Armed Forces, and to  achieve that we demanded that all parties participate in  government and that a solution to the problem of the south  should be found.    The memorandum was signed by all officers of the Armed  Forces  command. And everyone pledged not to embark on any coup  attempt. Because we believed that some officers might seize the  opportunity to seize power. At the same time the National  Islamic Front [led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi] began to criticize  the Army's command on the pretext that the Armed Forces command  was working to remove the Front from government -- which was  untrue, because we did not speak about one party in particular.  Actually we broached Sudan's problem and the civil war in the  south. Even though some officers spoke openly about the need to  seize power, our position as a command was the need to safeguard  democracy and protect the democratic experiment. [passage  omitted]    [Jibril] As the Legitimate Command, what are your means to  restore legitimacy?    [Sa'id] In September 1990 we issued the political  declaration, through which we addressed every member of the  Armed Forces. We told them that what had happened was a trick  aimed at the Armed Forces. So now that matters have become  clear, the Army elements must work with us to get rid of this  situation so that the Armed Forces' dignity can be restored.  The statement encountered a great response inside the Armed  Forces. We pointed out in the statement that we as the  Legitimate Command favor changing the regime from within the  Armed Forces, not from abroad or with foreign assistance. And  indeed a large number of officers and noncommissioned officers  responded to us. We were about to finish the regime off, but  some mistakes caused the plan to be foiled and aborted. So the  first option remains to change the regime through the Armed  Forces. As for the second option, it is to work with the  Democratic National Grouping to restore democracy. This is why  we spoke to the officers inside the Armed Forces or those  officers who have been dismissed about the need to remove the  regime through mass action and military action. We did not say  which should happen first.    [Jibril] Do you take into account the possibility of the  popular defense militias' aborting any move designed to change  the regime?    [Sa'id] True, it will not be easy to change it, and the  Popular Defense Forces must be taken into account. But you  should also know that the forces trained by the regime are not  all loyal to the National Islamic Front. Independent elements  have also joined the Popular Defense Forces. We have all the  details relating to the popular defense forces, whether with  regard to their camps or armament. And when the change process  begins, we will work to neutralize these forces. But we must  expect losses and casualties, because we are aware of the  regime's viciousness. We will confront them with the same  viciousness. [passage omitted]    [Jibril] There is talk about the existence of camps inside  Sudan to train fundamentalist groups from various parts of the  Arab and Islamic worlds. What is your information in this  connection?    [Sa'id] We have comprehensive information about this issue.  We warned about the existence of such camps a long time ago. We  submitted maps showing the places where these extremist groups  receive their training. We have our sources inside the country  and inside the Armed Forces. They supply us with this  information. We have handed this information to the quarters  concerned. But some of these quarters have concealed this  information. When the regime discovered the accuracy of our  information, it moved the camps to other places. [passage  omitted]</p>

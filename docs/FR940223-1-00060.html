			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing this action for the following reasons. First, non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags may pose potential risk to human health and the environment, and this risk may be greater for non-encapsulated uses than for any other disposition of the slags. This is because the slags contain significant total concentrations of toxic metals of concern. For example, the concentrations of lead in the slags are typically in the range of 1000&hyph;2000 parts per million (ppm) and concentrations of chromium can approach 1000 ppm. (See data from the BDAT Background Document for K061 slag in the RCRA public docket for today's rule.) These slags may also potentially leach metals at levels that would require regulation under subtitle C ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at levels greater than the generic exclusion levels in &sect;261.3(c)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, non-encapsulated uses of the slags may be viewed as uncontrolled disposition of the material. Thus, this may lead to many potential exposure pathways for the waste, not just those the Agency previously evaluated in assessing this wastes' hazardousness. The major non-encapsulated use of K061 slag is as an anti-skid material on road surfaces. This involves spreading the material on road surfaces during icy or snowy conditions to provide traction for vehicles (see comments from Horsehead Resource Development Company on April 12, 1991 proposal). Although the K061-derived slag as applied to the road surface is initially relatively coarse, the wear caused by vehicular traffic will break down the slag into finer particles. These particles may then be dispersed through particulate releases to the air, or to surface and ground water by run-off during precipitation or melting ice/snow. Some commenters were concerned about potential exposure to metals in the K061 slag through inhalation of air releases and ingestion of nearby contaminated soils, concerns the Agency shares. Without a more detailed assessment of the risks posed by such non-encapsulated uses, the Agency believes it is appropriate to prohibit these uses at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, these potential risks are ones that are very difficult for the Agency to evaluate with certainty with available methodology, particularly given the current lack of data the Agency has on non-encapsulated uses of the slags and the tight timeframe for this rule. Because of this, some of the potential exposure pathways, such as ingestion, inhalation or surface water runoff pathways, cannot be readily evaluated. Additionally, commenters to the August 19, 1991 rulemaking did not provide any reliable means for assessing the risks posed by non-encapsulated uses of these slags. (See 56 FR 41172.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is again soliciting information that may be used to estimate potential risks for non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag and the likely exposure pathways of greatest concern. When used as an anti-skid agent, HTMR materials could accumulate on the road surface and travel to nearby receptors. Particulates could be inhaled by people downwind or transported in the air and deposited on land or water bodies. Storms can also wash HTMR materials to the roadside. At the edge of the road, constituents in the slags could either travel overland to water bodies or percolate into the ground and reach the groundwater. Ingestion of contaminated soil could occur either from the deposition of HTMR slag particulates or from highway run-off. The Agency requests comment on other potentially significant exposure pathways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there are techniques that may be used to estimate pollutant loadings from roads, these techniques would have to be tailored to the characteristics of non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags. The following paragraphs describe potential approaches to estimate the risks from these pathways and the data or assumptions necessary to construct estimates of potential risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Airborne Particulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the appropriate data, the Agency believes it is possible to estimate the rate at which particulates become airborne from road surfaces. Critical parameters include the traffic volume, the mean vehicle speed, the type of road surface ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  unpaved or paved), particle density, and particulate size. The Agency believes that HTMR slags are most likely to be applied as an anti-skid agent on paved roads. Many State transportation departments have traffic volume estimates for most significant roads in their jurisdiction which could be used to estimate particulate generation rates. The Agency does not have adequate data regarding the distribution of particle size in HTMR anti-skid material or how that distribution could change after weathering and vehicular traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another critical parameter is the frequency at which HTMR slags would be applied to roads as a de-icing agent. The Agency does not have direct measurements of application rates of HTMR materials as de-icing agents. In 1981, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) reported that application rates of de-icing salt ranged from 400 to 1200 pounds per mile of two-lane road. The Agency requests comment on whether HTMR materials would be applied at rates comparable to that of de-icing salt or other compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

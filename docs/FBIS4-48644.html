			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roelf Meyer, provincial affairs and </F> constitutional development minister, and Deputy Minister Valli  Moosa by SABC announcer Freek Robinson, in the Cape Town studio,  on the "Agenda" program -- live; italicized passages in English]    [Text] [Robinson] Good evening and welcome from the Cape.  There is a hive of activity here, even on this Sunday, as the  new members of Parliament prepare for this week's first historic  sitting of South Africa's first legislative body, elected by all  the people in the country. All 400 members of the National  Assembly in Parliament have been inaugurated, as well as the 90  members of the Senate, on Friday. Now the work can begin. But  how will the new Parliament function? That is what we are  discussing tonight. With me are two ministers of the government  of national unity, Mr. Roelf Meyer, the minister of provincial  affairs and constitutional development, and then also the deputy  minister of this department, Mr. Mohammed Valli Moosa. Let us  begin with this portfolio and its name, which is a little  different to the one you held previously. Mr. Meyer, how will  you divide the functions between the two of you?    [Meyer] Well, let me first say that the department, as it  was  previously known, namely Constitutional Development, of course  dealt with the management of the negotiating process and the  creation of the new constitution as we know it now. From this  point the main aim is support for the constitution writing body,  that is the two houses of Parliament who have joint tasks and  who have to oversee the creation of the so-called final  constitution. I believe that our department will primarily have  a support function, to ensure the completion of that task.  Concerning the working relationship between my colleague Valli  and myself, I want to say that we -- as was my approach in the  past -- will work together as a team. We do not have specific  divisions of functions between us and over the past week we  already met with advisers in the department. It will not be any  different from the type of cooperation we experienced in the  previous dispensation, over the past few years.    [Robinson] But you are from different parties. Mr.  Moosa, would you like to emphasize certain things more? Would  you do that through your party or would you first like to find  consensus with Mr. Meyer here before you go to Parliament with  any suggestion?    [Moosa] Well, there's no denying that Mr. Meyer comes  from a different party than myself and of course we have been  elected by the .. [changes thought] Our parties have been  elected by our constituencies because of the policies which we  had and our policies are not exactly the same on all matters,  but notwithstanding that, we have been the architects of the  concept of the government of national unity, and I think the  positions which Mr. Meyer and I are in at this point in time is  an ideal position to give reality and meaning to the concept of  government of national unity and it's for that reason that we  really need to be working as a team. We've already agreed that  we would work as a team and we have started doing that.    You must understand that the role of  constitution-making, and the role of the department, and the  role of government would be slightly different over the next two  years as it was over the past few years. Over the past few  years you had a situation which can be characterized as a  conflict, on the one hand, between the government and various  other groups, the ANC being the principle of those groups. At  this point in time there isn't such a situation. You don't have  a situation where the government of national unity is in  conflict with one or other major political party as such and the  main work of the debate about constitution-making will take  place in the constitutional assembly, and for us as a department  -- would be to facilitate and to give whatever backup we can  give there in that sense, and of course our own party-political  aspirations we will tend not to voice them within the department  -- but in Parliament, of course, when I speak in Parliament,  when Mr. Meyer speaks in Parliament he would be speaking on  behalf of his party and he would articulate the viewpoint of his  particular party which would be different from my viewpoint. I  think we have had a discussion and we don't believe that that  would in any way prejudice our ability to work as a team and  fulfill the duties which the president has allocated to us.    [Robinson] Well let us come to the practical aspects of  that,  Mr. Meyer. The first thing that has to happen is this  constitutional body -- as it is officially referred to in the  constitution -- has to meet, that is the Senate in other words,  and the National Assembly together -- these two bodies together  must write the new constitution within the next two weeks. The  first task is for this body to meet. When, specifically, will  this happen?    [Meyer] This will happen on Tuesday morning, at 11 AM [0900  GMT]. This will be a formality really. The constitution states  that it must meet within a certain period from the first sitting  of the Senate, this joint meeting ...    [Robinson interrupting] Can we just get clarity on this  issue. The Parliament must meet in any event -- for its opening  -- now if it meets for the first time then will that at the same  time be the constitutional body or is that the Parliament?    [Meyer] I think one must differentiate between the two. When  the National Assembly and the Senate meet on Tuesday, then they  are meeting as the constitution writing body, and then they will  meet to elect their own chairman to that relevant body. When  Parliament meets at 2.15 PM [1215 GMT] the afternoon, to listen  to the president's opening address, then it meets as a joint  assembly of the National Assembly as well as the Senate.    [Robinson] In other words the Parliament?    [Meyer] In other words the Parliament, then as the two  separate bodies, although the venue is the same and the people  who are meeting are the same people.    [Robinson] Well, that's an interesting point, Mr.  Moosa. There's been speculation in the press about the position  of Mr. Ramaphosa. Would he, for instance, be a candidate for  the chairmanship of that Constituent Assembly?    [Moosa] Well, what I would say is that the  Constitutional Assembly, for us certainly as the ANC and I think  for many other parties, has been one of the most important  bodies that we have succeeded in creating as a result of the  process of negotiations. It occupies a central position in the  interim constitution and it has the massive task of finalizing a  new constitution for this country, finalizing the boundaries of  the regions, finalizing what the powers and functions of the  provinces are going to be, finalizing the Bill of Rights and  various other matters, and therefore, if I can speak for the  ANC, we place a tremendous amount of weight on the  Constitutional Assembly and you can be certain that the person  we chose to be the chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly  would be one of the most senior members of the ANC. I'm not in  the ... [changes thought] I have just come from a caucus meeting  now. I am not in a position to ... to .. you know, say it on  the air, but I can assure you that it will certainly be reserved  for one of the most respected people in the organization.    [Robinson] Mr. Meyer, we are used to this -- there are these  negotiations between the National Party and the ANC -- for  example, the speaker of Parliament is an ANC member, but the  chairman of the Senate, the president of the Senate as he is  called, is someone from the National Party. Who is actually  going to sit as chairman of that Constituent Assembly?    [Meyer] I think it has been an arrangement between Mr. de  Klerk and Mr. Mandela, namely that two of these posts -- the  executive chairmanship, namely the speaker and the chairman of  the constitution-making body would be filled by the ANC, and the  Senate's presidency by the National Party. This is a prior  arrangement and who these people are going to be will be left to  both parties to decide. So at this stage it is the ANC's choice  regarding that chairmanship.    May I just add something as regards the role of this body?  It has a prescribed role. The constitution defines in detail  what its task is going to be, and how it must carry out this  role as regards the putting into place and the acceptance of the  final constitution for South Africa. But at the same time one  has to reiterate this for the sake of peace of mind, namely,  that an extensive task regarding the putting into place of a  future constitutional dispensation has already been finalized  during the multiparty negotiations process which we had over the  last three years. What is indeed needed now, of course, is to  implement the existing constitution as it now stands in two  ways. The one is to market it to the public at large, and the  broader public must get involved in it, also through specific  institutions and sectors of the...    [Robinson, interrupting] How? How?    [Meyer] Let us say the church community and the business  community, for example, have a specific interest in the  acceptance of the final constitution.    [Robinson] Can they get involved in committees, for  instance,  to come forward and give evidence?    [Meyer] That will have to be determined by the  constitution-making body itself; in other words, it is not for  us to prescribe. But the way I see it, there are specific ways  whereby opportunities can be created to enable institutions from  outside to give input in that regard, because what is the  eventual objective? To my mind the objective is to see to it  there is a broad involvement and acceptance of our future  constitutional dispensation. The second is to take a look at  specific technical aspects of this constitution. There are  certain issues which come to mind and which have to be examined  for further improvement; such as, for instance, the Bill of  Fundamental Rights. Chapter 3 as it now stands in the current  constitution and which deals with that aspect will, in my  opinion, have to be improved further in its entirety. It is not  complete enough, and I think that all the parties in the  negotiation process have already indicated this.    From the point of view of the National Party we have already  pinpointed certain issues which we would like emphasized and we  are sure that the ANC has also indicated that they would like to  have certain clauses expanded. In any case, there is a  constitutional principle which states that the Bill of Rights  must conform to all recognized universal fundamental rights. So  we must maintain that criterion, and it will also be the  constitutional court's task to decide whether the constitution  meets that particular constitutional principle. There are other  aspects as well. From the point of view of the National Party,  we would like to see that the constitution be improved, also  some of its federal characteristics, and we must determine to  what extent it is necessary to improve it. And also other  aspects such as the concept of a government of national unity.  Our agreement is that this government of national unity should  govern for five years, that is, until 1999. This means that the  final constitution will have to undergo a change. And these are  some of the aspects which we have to investigate and improve on.    [Robinson] Well, Mr. Moosa, would you foresee that  the present constitution, the interim constitution, would be  changed radically over the next two years?    [Moosa] Well, I think some aspects of the constitution  have to change. As Mr. Meyer has said...    [Robinson, interrupting] What in particular, [words  indistinct]?    [Moosa] Well, I don't think that I'm particularly, I'm  having sleepless night about any particular aspect, but on the  one hand, I think what has been said already -- all provisions  concerning a government of national unity would have to be  reviewed and they'll have to be up for discussion. That was a  specific agreement for a period of five years. Whether you  replace it, and what you replace it with, how you form the new  executive after five years, what shape that government would  take -- those are questions that will have to be answered. On...    [Robinson, interrupting] Even the possibility of  continuing the government of national unity?    [Moosa] Well, I wouldn't like to preempt what the  Constitutional Assembly is going to do, but most certainly from  the ANC's side, our approach always has been that a government  of national unity is a temporary measure in order to ensure that  there is a smooth transition, and that we have never seen it as  a permanent position as such. And then you must remember that  it's the first time in this country that we are setting up the  type of provincial governments that we have now in the  constitution. None of us can say for certain as to how well  that provincial dispensation is going to work in practice. Once  we put it into practice, then there will be a need to amend the  interim constitution in order to make it more workable, in order  to make the system of provincial government more smooth.    We would also find, now that we have democratically  elected provincial governments, and democratically elected  premiers, those provincial governments may well want to demand  additional powers. You must know in the past there were no real  representatives of provinces at the multiparty negotiating  table. Those who came from regional governments didn't really  enjoy status because they were not regarded as democratic. So  that would come under discussion, and we could well have a  situation where the position of provinces are strengthened, but  that is a possibility also that could emerge.    On the bill of rights, I would also agree. You know,  there are very controversial and sensitive issues, like the  abortion question. Now, the present bill of rights that we  negotiated merely skirted around the issue simply because at the  multiparty negotiations we didn't think we were in a position to  legislate on that sort of question. It is a very fundamental  question to many people, it can divide societies. On that kind  of issue the Constitutional Assembly will have to encourage very  broad debate in society, with all concerned groups, particularly  the religious community, women's organizations also. And that  whatever the new constitution says about that matter must  reflect the dominant view in society.    [Robinson] We had initially planned to have a commercial  break at this point, but I think we should continue with this  discussion. Let us now go on to provincial government as Mr.  Moosa has already mentioned that. Now, I want to refer to these  points: first, the establishment of liaisons between the  national government and provincial governments, and does the  constitution make provision for a commission in the provincial  government, Mr. Meyer?    [Meyer] The commission in provincial government could play a  very important role. It could contribute towards development in  the provincial government, and could also present important  advise regarding communication between the central and  provincial government. It can also play an important role,  specifically in the constitution-making body, on how provincial  government should develop in the future. So, the commission is  an important body. The constitution specifically makes provision  for establishing it, and this should be done during this coming  week. The constitution specifically states that the commission  should be set up within a month after the new constitution has  been implemented.    [Robinson] Have you already appointed members for this  commission?    [Meyer] My colleague and I have held joint consultations  with  the president on this matter and we are now in the process of  consulting with other parties, and an interesting point is that  members should be appointed from every province by the president  after consultations, respectively, with the other premiers. So,  in other words, it is important for joint consultations, and...    [Robinson, interrupting] To stop you there, how do these  consultations with the premiers take place, over the telephone,  or is there a specific body, I believe there is actually such a  committee of premiers?    [Meyer] Not yet, so far. I will get back to that aspect,  but before I get to it, there is the whole issue of consultation  with the premiers: A colleague and I discussed if this should  take place on the basis of consultation between parties, and  when we have obtained the names from our respective provincial  colleagues, we will get together for deliberations on this, and  if we can reach a consensus, then we will make a recommendation  to the president.    [Robinson] You say you have agreed to liaise at party level?  That effectively means that Mr. Moosa here will consult with  seven premiers, and you effectively only with one. Now who is  going to liaise with Dr. Mdlalose in Kwazulu/Natal?    [Meyer] That is incidentally so, but at the same time you  must remember that the National Party also has representatives  in those provinces where the premiers are ANC members. So in  other words, I also liaise with National Party representatives  in those provinces, and we try to get the maximum possible  consensus among us before a recommendation is made to the  president in that regard. The final decision on the matter will  rest with the president, but as in most cases -- and I think  this is the tone that has already been set -- it takes place in  the spirit of the government of national unity. This is the  atmosphere and spirit fortunately in which liaison takes place  in this specific instance.    But to return to the other aspect that you referred to on  the  issue of consulting with the premiers and a possible committee  of premiers, it is being speculated that at the meeting of  premiers this coming Wednesday here in the Cape, the president  and the deputy president will be present, at least at the start  of the meeting. The meeting will take place chiefly to discuss  some of the common points which also constitute stumbling  blocks, and have visibly come into being particularly with the  phasing in of provincial governments, and with the issue of  rationalization of administrations. We must remember that up to  now we have had up to 17 different administrations, according to  the old constitution. All those are being converted into one  central administration, plus nine provincial administrations.  And I personally think it leaves room for potential  uncertainties and also confusion, because in the end it concerns  those who occupy posts, and the provision of services to people.  And all this we will have to try and sort out. For this reason,  it has been decided to hold the meeting this coming Wednesday  specifically with premiers here in the Cape.    [Robinson] Just on the question of being fair to all  provinces, Mr. Moosa, would you in any way discriminate against  the other provinces, Western Cape and Natal, that are not under  the control of the ANC, because physically you are in a position  to dish up the money. You could withhold money to those  provinces.    [Moosa] Well, fortunately the constitution has very  detailed provisions as to what the relationship between central  government and provincial government should be. There are  certain constitutionally entrenched powers which belong to the  provinces. The only thing which we are working on at this point  in time is how to transfer the administration and the executive  authority for these powers to provinces. But they are entitled  to certain powers, and that's in the constitution. As far as  financial matters are concerned, there again are detailed  provisions on that. There are also provisions for the  establishment of a financial and fiscal commission on which all  the provinces would be represented, and that financial and  fiscal commission would do all the analysis and develop  recommendations and proposals for central government as to what  the allocations and budgetary requirements of the various  provinces should be. But even apart from all of that, what you  must remember is that as a government, as a government all of  South Africa's people are our people. Whether they live in a  province that's controlled by one party or another party is a  separate matter as such. The reconstruction and development  program is for all the people. The houses that are going to be  built, or the electricity that would be provided must be  provided as much for a province controlled by Tokyo Sexwale as a  province which is controlled by Frank Mdlalose, and that is the  policy of the government.    [Robinson] Just this -- there are two other bodies that  I would quickly like to refer to because our time is running  out. One is the Afrikaner Homeland Council. So how do you feel  about this question now after the election, of providing for  that, and looking into the matter of a volkstaat [homeland]?    [Moosa] Well, we had -- the one thing that you must  know is that the government would, and the parties which are in  the government would keep to their undertakings, and we had  undertaken prior to the elections that we would enter into  negotiations through this body called the Afrikaner Homeland  Council on the question of a volkstaat. And one of the  assessments that would now have to be made after the elections  is what is the support base of those who say that there should  be a volkstaat, where is the support base of that? And we would  have to begin to look at the feasibility of that. So that's a  matter that we would enter into negotiations with, quite  honestly, with those who believe in a volkstaat, but I think  that everybody would have to accept the realities of the  democratic will of the people, and I think that the election  results are a real good basis for us to take those negotiations  hopefully to their conclusion in a fairly short space of time.    [Robinson] Thank you very much Mr. Meyer [as heard], in  conclusion -- in a few seconds unfortunately -- we still have  the council of traditional leaders. Just tell us briefly what  they do specifically?    [Meyer] Bodies like that have been appointed to see to the  interests of traditional communities on a national scale, and  particularly of the highest in these communities, the so-called  chiefs; to coordinate and to liaise, and this body has also been  set up to make sure that this function can be fulfilled  according to the prescriptions of the constitution.    [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Meyer, thank you Mr. Moosa.</p>

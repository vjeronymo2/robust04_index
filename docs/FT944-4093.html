			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Sweden to resume index-linked issues Sweden said yesterday it would resume index-linked treasury bond issues in the new year. 'We have now left the worst market turbulence behind us, as well as sources of unrest such as the general election and the EU referendum,' said Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office. Sweden is the world's biggest sovereign issuer on international bond markets. The debt office raised SKr3bn by issuing index-linked bonds in the spring, but it had to abandon the practice during the summer because of Swedish bond market turbulence. It was the first time that a bond linked to the Swedish consumer price index had been launched. The debt office says index-linked bonds lower its funding costs providing inflation remains low while covering investors 'against unanticipated increases in the inflation rate'. Investors in fixed-rate Swedish bonds have been demanding a risk premium on fears of a resurgence in inflation. Swedish inflation is currently 3 per cent, while the benchmark five-year bond yields 10.34 per cent. The debt office aims to raise about SKr7bn through a series of index-linked bond auctions in the first four months of next year. In the first issue, planned for January 16, bonds with a nominal value of SKr1bn will be offered. There will be a new tranche in an existing 20-year loan and a new 10-year loan. Sweden has a total of SKr500bn of treasury bonds outstanding.</p>

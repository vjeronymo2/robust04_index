			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAINTS RUN OVER BENGALS, SPOIL HOMECOMING, 21-7  </P> <P> Perhaps the Cincinnati Bengals should have stayed on the road.  </P> <P> The Bengals returned to Riverfront Stadium Sunday after five consecutive away  games and lost to the New Orleans Saints, 21-7.  </P> <P> Craig Heyward and Rueben Mayes each rushed for more than 100 yards and a  touchdown to lead the Saints (3-5), who simply overpowered the Bengal defense  -- statistically the second-worst in the NFL -- by rushing for a season-high  249 yards.  </P> <P> Heyward rushed for a career-high 122 yards in 19 carries and Mayes gained 115  yards in 30 carries. It was the third time in the Saints' history that two  backs have topped 100 yards in the same game.  </P> <P> The 249 yards were the most allowed by the Bengals since New England had 281  yards in the last game of the 1985 season.  </P> <P> "We couldn't stop their run," Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said. "That's fact. They  bowled over us at times.  </P> <P> "They opened holes and when we'd hit their runners, they'd fall forward. We  didn't knock them back. There were running lanes, and when we made contact, we  didn't knock the man backwards."  </P> <P> The Bengals (5-4) shuffled their linebackers and their defensive alignments to  try to stop the rushing game. They suffered a major loss late in the first half  when strong safety David Fulcher left the game with a separated right shoulder  that will keep him out for four to six weeks.  </P> <P> The Saints scored all three of their touchdowns on the ground. Gill Fenerty  scored from the one-yard line, Mayes from the six, and Heyward from the one on  what turned out to be the drive that broke the Bengals.  </P> <P> Leading 14-7, the Saints got the ball at their own nine late in the third  quarter and ground out a 16-play drive that consumed 9:32. Heyward scored with  10:03 left for his first touchdown of the season.  </P> <P> The Bengals' lone score came on an eight-yard touchdown pass from Boomer  Esiason to Eddie Brown in the second quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right route to self-regulation Sir, In the light of your leader ('An end to foot-dragging', January 12) on the prospects for the Personal Investment Authority, we wish to declare our support for the formation of a properly constituted PIA. We believe it is our duty to work within the context of government policy which we understand to be in favour of both de-regulation and self-regulation. The industry must continue to seek ways to take responsibility for and improve its own conduct and demonstrate that it can make self-regulation work. Since its inception, we have been strong advocates of the PIA - ensuring a level playing field which will unify the industry, and win back the confidence and respect of consumers. In the vast majority of cases the industry discharges its responsibilities to consumers both properly and professionally. The financial services industry plays a vitally important role in family and business life, and it is of great concern that it is not currently held in higher esteem. Agreement on and support for a properly constituted, single regulator will help to achieve this, while at the same time addressing those issues which need attention. We are concerned to note the dislocations which are arising in the building of that partnership; the PIA needs the support of all practitioners in order to be effective. We share some of the deep concerns being expressed about aspects of PIA, the costs involved in establishing it and the nature of its governance. We do not believe, however, that such problems are insurmountable. We believe that a 'top-down' approach to the establishment of the PIA, with a supervisory board comprising a majority of genuinely senior public interest members - chosen for their objectivity and experience, overseeing an executive committee drawn from practitioners - would produce the right solution. The PIA remains achievable, but needs help to regulate effectively a fast-growing and complex industry. We look forward to studying the PIA prospectus, which we understand will be available very soon, and which we hope will allay our residual concerns.

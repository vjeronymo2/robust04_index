			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: Speculative questions Sir, Thank you for providing your readers with the articles 'Behind the ERM crisis' (December 11 and 12). Although I read the FT regularly, I am apparently illiterate when it comes to understanding the huge markets which can pump billions through the system in a few hours. Does the FT know why Britain lost Pounds 10bn defending its currency while the French, you report, 'made an estimated FFr1.2bn in profit at the speculators' expense'? Who are these speculators, and where do they get their money from? A principle of democracy is involved in these questions. If readers like myself do not understand the mechanics of currency movements, how can we control politicians who deal in huge sums at our expense?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign news media  condemned the United States and its followers for kicking up a  row of "nuclear suspicion" against Korea.    The Syrian paper NIDAL AL SHA'B said the United States has  schemed to open all facilities of people's Korea through the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and instigated the  IAEA to put pressure on Korea to bring it to its knees.    The paper exposed that the purpose of the row of "nuclear  suspicion" by Washington that shipped nuclear weapons into the  Korean peninsula is to make people's Korea kneel down, not to  prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.    A Czech paper charged that even after the Democratic  People's  Republic of Korea had sincerely implemented the agreed points  reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York, the United States  put forth an unreasonable precondition, spreading a rumour that  North Korea is not only producing nuclear weapons but also  intending to "attack" South Korea.    The act of the United States is a laughing-stock of the  world, said the paper.    The Mozambican magazine TEMPO noted that it is a gross  violation of the U.N. charter that the United States reversed  the agreed points of the DPRK-USA contact in New York and  brought the "nuclear issue" to the United Nations.    The magazine stressed that the U.N. Security Council should  refrain from violating the U.N. charter to follow the lead of  the United States and the United States should withdraw all its  Armed Forces of aggression including nuclear weapons from South  Korea and take a sincere attitude toward the DPRK-USA talks.</p>

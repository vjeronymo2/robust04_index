			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Seven UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] observers will monitor the confrontations at  the Brcko front from Saturday, 7 May. They will be joined by  another nine UNPROFOR members on Sunday. This is the result of  the talks held today between Sergio de Mello, the UN deputy  special envoy for civilian affairs and Nikola Koljevic, the  vice-president of the Bosnian Serb Republic. The military  delegations were led by Dutch Colonel Jup and commander of the  [Serbian] East Bosnia Corps Gen Novica Simic.    The observers on the Serb side will be deployed at four  points in Brcko and will be able to communicate with their  fellow observers who will be deployed on the Muslim side. Our  main objective is to prevent confrontations around Brcko and,  following the Gorazde crisis, to prevent crises in general,  Sergio de Mello told reporters. We want to show that we do not  want war and that everything can be resolved through political  negotiation, Koljevic said.    The result of the talks today was also that the commander of  the [Serbian] East-Bosnia Corps Maj-Gen Novica Simic and the  commander of the [Muslim] Second Corps Nazim Sadic will most  probably meet soon.    They will try to agree on a cease-fire, to put into practice  the agreement reached by Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi Akashi, it  was said at the press conference. [passage omitted]</p>

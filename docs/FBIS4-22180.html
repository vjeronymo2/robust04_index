			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Major Volodymyr Melnyk, Ukraine's </F> deputy prosecutor general, by Volodymyr Cherkas; place and date  not given: "Crimes Are Crimes Also in the Army" -- first  paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction]    [Text] A session at Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office  was discussing what seemed an individual case: Why legal  proceedings against serviceman V. Bobrov had been discontinued.  In issue No. 45 of 11 March 1994 our newspaper had written an  article on this case, entitled "Scene of Crime -- Barracks."  That is why our reporter was invited to attend the session.  General Major Volodymyr Melnyk, Ukraine's deputy prosecutor  general, kept asking his subordinates: "Who discontinued the  hearing of this case? On what grounds?" In response to this,  the participants portrayed the criminal situation in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces and the tough situation of military  prosecutorial bodies in such a way that it was hard to believe  this was true. This prompted a newspaper reporter to conduct an  interview with the deputy prosecutor general.    [Cherkas] Are numerous violations of the law really  flourishing in the Ukrainian Army?    [Melnyk] Everything that you heard at the session is true.  Violations of accepted norms in interpersonal relations, ultra  vires acts, dodging of military service, embezzlements, thefts  of military equipment and property have recently become  commonplace. For instance in 1993, the number of violations of  statute provisions that regulate relations between servicemen  increased by 19 times in general. In particular, in Defense  Ministry troops the growth rate was 34 percent. Soldiers are  often "educated" by means of battery; the hazing of conscripts  reigns in many military units; order is built on the "punch the  mug" principle. The number of cases of battery increased by  more than 70 percent. Do you understand what this means? This  is mass bashing!    Here is an example. At the beginning of March, six sergeants  from the Chernihiv garrison were brought before the court. They  had been drunk and had beaten up their 66 subordinates so  severely that one of the soldiers died. This had been done  right in front of the company duty officer who had done nothing  to calm down the drunkards. On 16 March, a "senior" soldier and  a conscript quarrelled about lack of bread. The "senior" hit  the newcomer on the chest four times; the latter fell down and  never got up. He died for a piece of bread!    Similar facts of violating the regulations of statutory  interpersonal relations have lately occurred in Sevastopol,  Ivano- Frankivsk, and some other military garrisons. Speaking  in general, we should state with alarm that in January-February  the rate of this crime has increased by 14 percent in all of  Ukraine's military formations, and by 37 percent in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces.    There is another alarming trend: The suicide rate in the  Army  is increasing. In 1993, 123 servicemen killed themselves. Over  the first two months of 1994, there were 24 such cases. The  number of cases of draft-dodging has also grown -- desertion,  going AWOL, and so on. Last year, more than 3,000 such crimes  were committed. This year, there have been 400 of them. Almost  2,000 violators are still on the run. While hiding, they  exacerbate criminal situations and often commit heinous crimes.  Last year, 414 such cases were disclosed.    Unfortunately, thefts of arms and military property have  become more commonplace in the Army. Not long ago, 15  Kalashnikov assault rifles and 15 Makarov pistols were stolen  from one of the units in the Kharkiv garrison. Six assault  rifles and a machine gun with ammunition have been stolen from a  coast guard unit in Yevpatoriya.    It is startling that the storage of weapons and property is  not organized in an appropriate manner. Last year, losses  caused by mismanagement, embezzlements, and thefts cost the  state a fortune -- 70 billion karbovantsi. This sum includes  the 65 billion caused by the disappearance of fuel and  lubricants. Gasoline, kerosene, lubricants, and diesel fuel are  pumped into Army reservoirs, and only God knows where they  vanish.    We have lately observed the alarming phenomenon of Mafia  elements penetrating into the Army circles. Some time ago,  profiteers in uniforms were booked in one of the units in the  Odessa military district. Those were military financiers who  had made agreements with local dealers and used Army assets --  hundreds of millions karbovantsi -- for trading. Here is  another example: In July 1993, the Defense Ministry Directorate  for Material Supplies signed an agreement with a small  commercial enterprise for the shipping of undershirts and  transferred 5.6 billion karbovantsi to the dealers. Soldiers  never saw the undershirts, while the smart dealers paid back the  money five months later, this time significantly devaluated.    [Cherkas] Regarding this, let me ask you a hackneyed  question: What is the prosecutor doing? At the session that  you have just conducted, military prosecutors maintained that  they would not be able to continue work under the current  circumstances.    [Melnyk] Their stories are absolutely true. The point is  that the former chiefs of Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office  virtually destroyed the existing system of military prosecution,  claiming that the Army did not need it. Although genuine legal  experts opposed this, their voices were ignored. For example,  General Major of Legal Service V. Melnychuk, military prosecutor  of the Western region, appealed to various state institutions  but nobody paid any attention. As a result of this, the most  experienced military lawyers abandoned the Army for other legal  bodies. We found ourselves, so to say, back where we started.  Although the military prosecutor's service has been legalized  again, it is to be comprised of 484 specialists, while as of  today, we have only 300. Eighty eight of these people are  investigators, charged with the following primary tasks:  Supervision over the observance of Ukrainian laws by bodies of  command, military formations, combined units, units, and  subunits, establishments, and military educational institutions,  the officials of the Armed Forces, the Border Troops, the  National Guard, the Department of State Protection, the Security  Service, and other military formations in Ukraine. Can you  imagine the scope of their responsibilities? The monthly  workload of a military investigator is five times the volume of  the workload of a territorial [civil] investigator. And you are  asking what military prosecutors are doing. From morning until  evening, and often at night these people hardly have time to  breathe. Getting to the venue to carry out an investigation is  another problem, because there is either no car or no gasoline.  Military lawyers continuously apply for termination of Army  service. We have no one to replace these people -- there is not  a single educational institution in Ukraine training specialists  for military prosecution.    Still, even under these conditions people work and  persistently uphold legality and order in the young Army of  sovereign Ukraine. In 1993, 36 percent more criminal cases were  investigated and sent to courts than in 1992. Purposeful  preventive activities are being carried out in the Army. Taking  advantage of the occasion, I want to address servicemen's  parents by means of the Supreme Council newspaper [HOLOS  UKRAYINY]: The military prosecutor's service will do everything  in its power to ensure their sons' legal protection. At the  same time, I appeal to all the employees of military prosecutor  offices to step up legal supervision in every way regardless of  the current tough situation, to firmly keep watch over the  protection of our state laws.    [Cherkas] You should agree that our conversation with  Ukraine's deputy general prosecutor was not very optimistic.  The cited facts from servicemen's lives portray a miserable  picture. I am reading the HOLOS UKRAYINY article "Scene of  Crime -- Barracks" dealing with the same issues. Perhaps, the  writer of the article did not look into the current situation of  the military prosecution attentively enough and his criticism of  the "bureaucrats in prosecutor chairs" is not quite balanced.  As it appears from the cited facts, military lawyers do not  twiddle their thumbs. The criminal situation in the troops is  indeed horrendous. In my opinion, prosecutorial supervision  alone is not enough. Apparently the education and  sociopsychological services of the Defense Ministry and other  military formations fall short of their task. We probably need  distinctly coordinated activities of the chiefs of all the  military services to curb the reign of the violators of the law;  and to persistently ensure the triumph of the military statutes  and the military oath. The president of Ukraine, who is  commander in chief of the Armed Forces should also put in his  weighty word in this regard. Crimes are crimes also in the Army.</p>

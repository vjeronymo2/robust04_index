			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gas move benefits British Borneo Greater exposure to the gas market helped British-Borneo, the exploration company, to offset the effects of a declining oil price and report a 14 per cent increase in net profits to Pounds 8.7m for the year to December 31. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo had had 'a hell of a year. I think we have now come of age.' The company increased its oil and gas revenues by 56 per cent to Pounds 28m. Mr Gaynor said British-Borneo had maintained its exploration success rate of 40 per cent for the third consecutive year. It intended in the current year to step up investment in exploration, particularly in the US, from about Dollars 18m a year to up to Dollars 30m. The changes to the petroleum revenue tax introduced in the last budget had made the North Sea a less attractive option. Exploration costs were some four times higher as a result, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo had doubled investment in the US to about Dollars 9m in the year just ended, helping it to benefit from the 15 per cent increase in the average US gas price during the year. Part of the revenue improvement was due to becoming an operator, as opposed to being a hands-off investor, for the first time, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo was beginning to see opportunites to build up its oil assets in light of the weak price. Any acquisitions and investments would be funded through cash flow, Mr Gaynor said. Income from the group's portfolio of oil and gas investments fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.4m. However, the group realised some Pounds 4.3m from the portfolio which ended the year with a market value of Pounds 19.3m. The dividend was maintained at 4.433p, for a steady total of 7.1p. Earnings rose from 16.93p to 19.33p.</p>

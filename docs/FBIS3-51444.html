			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with prospective Liberal Party presidential </F> candidate Ernesto Samper; place and date not given]    [Text] Ernesto Samper returned to Colombia Thursday night  after a two-week trip to the United States, Asia, and Mexico. On  Friday he gave the following written interview to EL TIEMPO's  political editor.    [EL TIEMPO] During your absence, President Cesar Gaviria  said  that dark forces were trying to create friction between the two  of you. Do you think such forces exist?    [Samper] If the president says so, it must be so. The  important thing is what he and I feel. I strongly support his  actions concerning the government, the Constitutional Congress,  drug traffic policy, and the internationalization of the  economy. Along with the majority of the Colombian people, I  believe President Gaviria's liberal government has been good for  the nation and I support the renewal he has undertaken.  Furthermore, the president knows when and on what occasions I  have supported him at the times when he needed it. He also knows  that I am not a person who keeps score on political debts.    [EL TIEMPO] Some commentators say some ministers should be  removed from the cabinet to emphasize your conceptual and  political differences with the president. What do you think?    [Samper] As I said before, I support President Gaviria's  liberal government, so I find no reason to consider such a  decision. Also, it is the president who decides about changing  ministers.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you think there are electioneering intentions  in the book by Mauricio Vargas that portrays you as a weak  person more concerned about political position than about ideas?    [Samper] I will confess to you that I have not read the book  by SEMANA's editor, though my friends agree that it is an  anti-Samperist treatise. Nor do I know if there are political  intentions behind it. If so, that would be the start of a new  phase of politics in Colombia, a dirty war, which I am sure the  Colombian people will categorically reject. The raw material for  the political debate cannot continue to be inner-circle gossip,  backbiting, and rumors. The people have the right to have the  candidates talk to them about solving the problems of  unemployment, corruption, or the lack of security; that is what  we are really interested in.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you feel your campaign is being well run?    [Samper] Yes. It has gone well and the polls show that. I am  concerned, though, about the changing course the campaign is  taking. The Colombian people know my style of politics, based on  ideas and proposals, like the ones I have been presenting during  the past six months about issues like unemployment, agricultural  recovery, or the fight against corruption. Now we are  trivializing politics, reducing it to gossip, trivia, and the  calumny of the passing moment. That is not good for anybody.  Colombia should think big; that is what the Colombian people  expect from those who aspire to lead the destinies of the nation.    [EL TIEMPO] Do you think you have lost spontaneity because  of  your advisers' strategies?    [Samper] If I have to lose spontaneity, I would rather lose  my advisers.    [EL TIEMPO] Have you perceived uneasiness among your  supporters in Congress about the way the campaign is going?    [Samper] I have not heard much about that; I will look into  it more in the coming week. Although I know the people urging  these changes are acting in good faith and constructively, I  believe the campaign should be measured by its results. And the  results show that when I first began my campaign in May, the  polls put Dr. Pastrana 21 points ahead of me; now, six months  later, our own polls and those of the president show that I am  six points ahead of the candidate of the Pastranist sector of  conservatism. That means we are up 27 points. How can people say  the campaign is not working with results like that? I want to  convince the leaders who are with me now so that, with their  valuable assistance, we can appeal to other social sectors that  have traditionally not taken part in elections. My campaign  strategy has been to reach out to those sectors and open up new  areas for dialogue in universities, unions, and associations.    [EL TIEMPO] Now that the Conservative Party has endorsed  Andres Pastrana, do you think he is a rival who will force you  to go to a second round?    [Samper] Some people in Colombia have an admirable capacity  for being surprised by normal events. Who was not aware that the  Conservative Convention of the Pastranist sector of conservatism  would announce its support for Pastrana, as it did last week?  What would really have been surprising and democratic is if the  convention had chosen a popular vote process, as liberalism did,  to select the conservative candidate in a transparent and  participatory manner, or if at the convention organized by Dr.  Pastrana, Dr. Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and other conservative  candidates for the nomination had been present. Unfortunately,  that did not happen. Anyway, I am sure of getting enthusiastic  support from liberalism and other political groups after the  party vote so I will win the first round by a KO [knockout].    [EL TIEMPO] What did you learn during the trip from which  you  have just returned?    [Samper] We did not realize Colombia's importance  internationally. We tend to concentrate on small details, so we  lose sight of what Colombia represents, the way the  international community sees us. While people outside look at  Colombia through a telescope, we focus on things through a  microscope. We need to change that. If Colombia wants to move  forward, we have to think big. For example, President Salinas  told me he is convinced that Colombia could play in the same  arena as Mexico: in the Pacific Rim community, in the Group of  Three, and through the latter it could join in NAFTA [North  American Free Trade Agreement], a connection that would right  away generate over 150,000 new jobs, as Minister [of Foreign  Trade] Santos was told.</p>

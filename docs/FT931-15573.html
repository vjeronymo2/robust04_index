			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hadleigh reduces deficit to Pounds 0.36m The implementation of a cost savings package enabled Hadleigh Industries, the USM-quoted specialist supplier of transport and storage products and services, to reduce losses from Pounds 535,000 to Pounds 357,000 pre-tax for the half year to September 30. The group has been trading profitably since the period end and its forward order book is 'healthier' than for some time. Directors believe this will lead to a 'significant' improvement in the second half. First half sales amounted to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 14m). The pre-tax figure was struck after taking account of interest charges of Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 296,000) and exceptional provisions of Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 288,000). Losses per share emerged at 3.3p (4.87p) and the interim dividend is omitted  -1.25p was paid previously but the final was passed. At September 30 gearing stood at 83 per cent (74 per cent).</p>

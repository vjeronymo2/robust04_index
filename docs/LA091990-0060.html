			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CS NORTHRIDGE, ON VERGE OF UPSETTING USC, FALTERS  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge has shown repeatedly that it can play with Top 20  competition in its inaugural Division I season, but the Matadors demonstrated  again Tuesday night that they are still this close to upsetting the nation's  powerhouse teams.  </P> <P> Against 15th-ranked and four-time national champion Southern Cal, visiting CSUN  came within two points of winning the match, but the Trojans forced a fifth  game and prevailed, 12-15, 15-10, 7-15, 19-17, 15-10.  </P> <P> "We had them and then they slipped by us," said Northridge setter Beth Welch,  who had 44 assists and seven aces. "We're on the edge. We just need a little  push to get us off the edge and on top. We are coming so close."  </P> <P> In Coach Walt Ker's mind it was the little things that made the difference.  </P> <P> "One more serve in-bounds, one less bad pass . . . better communication," Ker  said. "I had two thoughts for my team -- one, that it was the best match of the  year, and two, that the little things, passing and serving could have allowed  us to walk away with a 3-1 win."  </P> <P> Instead, CSUN dropped to 0-3 against Top 20 teams, 9-5 overall. USC extended  its win streak to five and improved to 5-3 behind the the play of 6-foot-2  All-American candidate Lonise Norfleet, who had 27 kills, nine in the second  game.  </P> <P> "I think the difference was the play of Lonise. She just had a career match,"  USC Coach Lisa Love said. "Although I shouldn't say that because that's the way  she's played all year."  </P> <P> Of all the Matadors, Welch knew what to expect from Norfleet -- they were  roommates at the U.S. Olympic Festival -- and USC, a team she played against  the past three years while at Washington State.  </P> <P> CSUN's confidence stemmed from winning the first and third games and  maintaining momentum at the beginning of the fourth game as first server Welch  reeled off three aces in a row and Patricia Fitzsimmons put a spike down for a  4-0 advantage. But USC came back on four kills by Norfleet, an ace by Megan  McCallister and a CSUN error to gain a 6-4 advantage.  </P> <P> The match seesawed from there with USC scoring three in a row to take a 14-13  lead. But CSUN tied the score, 14-14, and a long Norfleet hit brought the  Matadors to match point.  </P> <P> USC took the lead on two kills by Katie Haller, but Kathleen Dixon forced a  16-16 tie with a kill. Two sideouts later, a USC error again made it match  point for CSUN, 17-16, but a kill by Norfleet gave USC the sideout. A hitting  error by reserve Jill Trehearne tied the score, 17-17, and Trehearne's block a  moment later earned CSUN the sideout.  </P> <P> But CSUN lost its advantage on a kill by McCallister and the Trojans scored the  final points on a block and an ace by freshman Missy McCaw for a 19-17 win that  forced a fifth game.  </P> <P> USC never trailed in the decisive game.  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver climbs to 4 1/4-year high The US investment funds that are attempting to force up the silver price helped push it to 574.75 cents a troy ounce in London early yesterday, its highest point since November, 1989. The market failed, however, to breach the important technical level of Dollars 575 an ounce and fell back to close in London at Dollars 570.5, up 5 cents on the day. Hedge funds, including the Quantum Fund operated by Mr George Soros, the high-profile financier and currency speculator who started the run-up in the gold price about this time last year, are rumoured to have spent USDollars 1bn to buy physical silver. 'There certainly does seem to be an investment programme under way in silver by some of the big US hedge funds,' said Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, in his latest analysis of the market. 'They are prepared, my informants say, to put in another Dollars 1bn. Their spot price objective, it is generally agreed, seems to be Dollars 8 an ounce.' Mr Tony Warwick-Ching, analyst at the CRU International consultancy group, said the outlook for silver was certainly better than for some time following three years of supply deficits. But he estimated there was still between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes of silver in stocks world-wide, enough to satisfy demand for at least a year. The US funds were attracted to silver partly by a big buying spree in India following liberalisation of import restrictions there last year - CRU estimates India imported 2,800 tonnes in 1993 compared with 800 tonnes the previous year. Mr Warwick-Ching pointed out that Indian demand had dropped dramatically when the silver price reached Dollars 5 an ounce, showing how price sensitive it was. 'And India could start selling again,' he warned. 'India exported a great deal of silver when the price boomed in the early 1980s.'</p>

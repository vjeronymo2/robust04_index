			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL TO HOLD HEARINGS ON IOWA BLAST  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee announced Friday that it will hold hearings  next month on the Navy's inquiry and subsequent finding that a troubled sailor  apparently caused the fatal explosion aboard the battleship Iowa.  </P> <P> "We have unearthed significant new evidence that casts new light on the Navy's  conclusion that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig committed suicide and mass murder  in the gun turret," said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the  Armed Services subcommittee on investigations.  </P> <P> Mavroules said his panel has been reviewing "several aspects of the Navy  investigation -- especially its technical competence and its psychological  analysis."  </P> <P> Mavroules refused to provide specifics but expressed concern about a "question  of interpretation" of the evidence. The congressman cited an FBI report that  said its laboratory investigation on the incident was inconclusive.  </P> <P> "I want documentation," Mavroules said in an interview. "Unless the Navy does  that, it's a discredit to the investigation."  </P> <P> The House hearings, scheduled for Dec. 12 and 13, will include witnesses from  the Navy and FBI, Mavroules said.  </P> <P> Navy officials on Thursday had defended their conclusion that the April 19  blast in gun turret No. 2 was "most likely" caused by Hartwig, who died along  with 46 shipmates in the explosion.  </P> <P> Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the Navy's technical and criminal  investigation into the blast, testified Thursday that additional tests  conducted since his report Sept. 7 found "unique foreign material" on the  projectile from the exploding gun barrel.  </P> <P> He said the material was iron wires coated with calcium, chlorine and oxygen,  which would be produced by "some types of non-electronic explosive devices."  </P></p>

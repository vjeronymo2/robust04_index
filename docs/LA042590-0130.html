			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE TO GET EQUAL TIME ON KCOP  </P> <P> Riverside County congressional candidate Jeffrey Jacobs will appear on KCOP  Channel 13's public-affairs program "A.D.I." May 6 as a result of the station  broadcasting a film last week that featured his competitor, Ralph Waite,  station manager Rick Feldman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jacobs will be on the 6 a.m. show for 10 minutes, the same amount of time that  Waite was on-screen for "A Wedding on Walton's Mountain," a 1982  made-for-television movie that KCOP aired last Wednesday.  </P> <P> Under federal law, television and radio stations must provide equal time to  opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has qualified for the ballot  appears on a broadcast outside of bona fine newscasts, interview programs,  documentaries or spot coverage of news events, provided that the opposing  candidates request such time within seven days of the broadcast.  </P> <P> Both Jacobs and Waite are seeking the Democratic nomination for the 37th  Congressional District seat now held by Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta).  STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

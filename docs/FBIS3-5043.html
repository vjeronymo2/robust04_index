The protesters marched in downtown Seoul, shouting "Yankee  Go  Home", "Get Out Yankees Who Raise the Danger of War on the  Peninsula" and "No `Patriots'".    The AP news agency said the protesters demanded an end to  the  heavy U.S. military presence in South Korea and the cancellation  of the plans to deploy "Patriot" missiles there.

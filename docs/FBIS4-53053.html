			<p>CSO     [Text] "Dainidenden (DDI) has an excellent eye for  businesses with good potential." Eight groups, composed  primarily of communications firms, have announced feasibility  studies on personal handiphone systems (PHS), and special  attention is being focused on the activities of DDI. DDI and  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) together launched tests in  Sapporo half a year ahead of the other groups. The reason for  DDI's early start was progress on its proprietary technology.    DDI's pioneering attributes are clearly visible in the  development of its land stations which communicate with PHS  units and the progress made in the development of data bases for  managing customer information. Further development will require  an interface to link with the NTT network, but NTT has announced  a model of that interface via the Telecommunication and  Telephone Technology Committee.    NTT Service Development Department's Personal Service  Development Project Committee chief Tadao Kobayashi says, "The  status of current feasibility studies reveals whether or not  interested parties were initially serious about development of  PHS systems," in providing an indirect evaluation of DDI's  posture on PHS.    The land stations used by the eight groups can be broadly  categorized into two types. Aside from DDI, they all use land  stations which emit signals with an output of 20 milliwatts.  Since PHS uses a standard communication interface, there is  little incentive to develop proprietary facilities, unlike  cellulars that use two different formats.    However, DDI uses a format with a transmitter output of 500  milliwatts or 25 times greater. According to managing director  Yoshio Senmoto, "DDI faces fewer restrictions in terms of  locating land stations as long as it can reduce the numbers," as  a result of being able to cover more space by using high output  stations, whereas NTT-format land stations can handle only calls  which are within a radius of 100 meters. The DDI format also  reduces the frequency of "handovers," interruptions in  communications that are experienced when a PHS user moves from  one land station area to the next land station area.    Industry sources estimate that use of 20-milliwatt land  stations in the 23 wards of Tokyo would require the installation  of more than 20,000 land stations, but NTT could use public  telephone boxes and electric power company-affiliated firms  could use electrical utility poles. DDI opted for high-output  land stations as a last resort to overcome the issue of  locations for land stations. However, regardless of the high  output feasible for land stations, the output from PHS units  will be limited to 10 milliwatts. If the land stations were not  capable of receiving the weak signals from the PHS units, then  there would be a problem. DDI has overcome that potential  problem by improving reception at the land stations by  converting to civilian use technology held by a military  equipment maker in Israel. Managing director and chief of the  Management Planning Department Sanshiro Fukada states, "Both the  specific name of the company and the nature of the technology is  secret," but DDI has made use of technology of foreign  manufacturers who have been thorough in their efforts at PHS  development.    DDI opted for that course of action because its assessment  was that primary communications makers were organized into a  consortium called the "NTT family" and that it would be  difficult to surpass rival NTT in the area of technology through  the use of domestic equipment. In its efforts to develop a  compression technology system for digital signals with a U.S.  venture firm, DDI used 20 firms worldwide such as in Europe, the  United States, and Israel in the area of research and  development and parts procurement. Managing director Senmoto  states DDI's objective was to "make itself a model for  development" amidst the prevailing air of international trade  friction.    Investment costs thus far have totaled 10 billion yen.  However, circuits to be used are not proprietary. Rival NTT's  integrated services digital network (ISDN) circuits will be used  to link land stations.    Of the eight groups engaged in feasibility studies, three  groups such as those affiliated with electrical power companies  will use proprietary network circuits. Proprietary networks will  entail infrastructure costs, but will eliminate access charges  associated with the use of NTT ISDN circuits. PHS which is  dependent on low user rates could face an issue of survival or  death if it involved the payment of access charges.    Department chief Kobayashi of NTT suggests, "In principle,  access charges are based on actual cost, but if they are too  high, they could lead to the failure of both user and service  provider," but if DDI were to be forced to use NTT ISDN  circuits, it may not be able to use its proprietary technologies.    Unlike long-distance telephone and cellulars which have been  provided by all of the NCC (new common carrier) companies, PHS  is a service that can be provided by all communication companies  with a uniform service initiation time frame. DDI which offers  Motorola cellular services has also rejected the NTT format for  PHS service. However, on cellulars it went with technology  borrowed from Motorola, but on PHS they are challenging the  competition with proprietary technology.    According to managing director Fukada, it is because of this  reason that the company feels a strong sense of crisis that "It  will lose to the competition if it lags in technology." DDI  launched itself into the PHS effort under the leadership of  Messrs Senmoto and Fukada, formerly of NTT, despite assertions  of caution within the company. DDI just may become the center of  a highly turbulent situation while establishing technological  distinctions which separate it from the competition.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Elkem shares fall despite gains Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, more than doubled profits in the first half but its shares fell 6 per cent on disappointed market expectations. Pre-tax profits amounted to NKr139m (Dollars 18.1m) for the period, compared with NKr61m a year ago. The market had been looking for a NKr175m profit and marked the company's shares down NKr5.50 to NKr79. The company has been unable to take full advantage of rising aluminium and silicon metal prices because of forward contracts. It has suffered from reduced production due to maintenance and upgrading work and from high prices in the short-term power market. Net sales rose to NKr4.41bn from NKr3.78bn. Income from operations increased to NKr243m from NKr218m while profits from associated companies climbed to NKr40m from NKr29m. Net financial expenses fell to NKr144m from NKr186m. The company says the underlying trend in its main markets is positive.</p>

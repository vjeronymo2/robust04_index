			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: What you'll pay THE MAIN conditions covered by all critical illness policies are heart attack, some types of heart surgery, cancer, stroke, kidney failure, paralysis, and major organ transplant. Definitions can, however, vary widely and a large number of other conditions are covered by the different insurers. The sum assured is usually backed by units in investment funds. Insurers often quote two levels of premiums. 'Maximum' means that premiums and the sum assured are guaranteed for a set time limit, usually five or 10 years; after that, premiums can be expected to rise if the sum assured is not to fall. With 'standard' cover, the sum assured and premiums should remain steady for life if the funds involved achieve growth at the projected rate. But, if they do not, then any cash value built up might be used to make up the shortfall, or the premiums may increase. Reviews normally take place every five or 10 years. Because of the complexity of the subject, you should always discuss your needs with a financial adviser before making any decisions. The following is a selection, not an exhaustive list, of companies offering critical illness insurance. The premiums quoted are for the most comprehensive standard cover for a male non-smoker aged 40 next birthday, including death benefit, with a sum assured of Pounds 100,000. But because levels of cover can be very different, the premiums may not be comparable directly. Abbey Life has offered critical illness insurance since 1987. It says it will be moving to adopt the NFIFA's definitions at the first reasonable opportunity, but its own definitions are very similar. Standard cover is Pounds 126.35 a month. Allied Dunbar's Lifestyle range of policies was re-launched in February. Before doing so, the company looked at the definitions on which NFIFA was working and says its own are at least as extensive. Premiums for Lifestyle Plus, the most comprehensive cover, are Pounds 126.48 a month. Cannon Lincoln was, in 1986, the first to offer critical illness cover in the UK. Its Financial Foundations plan was launched last month to provide a range of options such as permanent disability, long-term care and surgical cash benefit cover, which can be combined in any pattern. The fullest cover costs Pounds 122.85 on a standard premium basis. Friends Provident has already adopted the NFIFA guidelines for critical illness options on mortgages. Stand-alone policies are under review and, when re-launched, the guidelines probably will be used. The premium for a stand-alone policy is Pounds 132.25 a month. Life Association of Scotland recently re-launched its Vitality policy, with an expanded list of illnesses covered, and has adopted the NFIFA definitions. Standard cover costs Pounds 128.63 a month. Pegasus' critical illness policies were re-launched in 1991 with changes, and additions have been made since then. Pegasus is planning to adopt at least the equivalent of the NFIFA standard definitions. It offers two levels of cover - Priority, limited to the core illnesses, and Ultimate, including permanent disability etc. The monthly premium for Priority is Pounds 103.35, and for Ultimate Pounds 127.05. Prolific will be adopting standard definitions in its Self Assurance plan by the end of the year, and for critical illness cover on its mortgage plan by mid-July. It offers both personal and business policies. Personal cover costs Pounds 104.49 a month. Skandia Life is about to adopt the NFIFA definitions, including applying them to existing policies, except where the existing definition is broader. Cover under the Lifetime plan costs Pounds 126.36 a month.</p>

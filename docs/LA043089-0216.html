			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISAPPOINTED GRATEFUL DEAD FANS ARRESTED AT CONCERT  </P> <P> About 10 people were arrested Saturday night after about 100 police officers  were brought in to control a crowd of about 500 disappointed fans who could not  get into the Grateful Dead's concert at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Irvine police Officer Bob Lennert said police moved in after fighting broke out  between some members of the crowd and the concert's security officers.  </P> <P> Most of the crowd broke up shortly after a dispersal order was issued at 8:30  p.m. by Irvine police. The remainder left after about 100 officers -- who were  called in by Irvine police from several surrounding communities -- began  walking in formation toward the entrance to the concert, authorities said.  </P> <P> Officers at the scene reported that some members of the crowd had been throwing  rocks and bottles.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about an hour after the concert began before 15,000  people in the amphitheater.  </P></p>

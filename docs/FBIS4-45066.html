			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article on the National Planning Institute's "Report on </F> Human Development in Egypt," prepared in conjunction with the UN  Development Program]    [Excerpt] The first "Report on Human Development in Egypt"  was published Monday afternoon. The report, prepared by the  National Planning Institute and the UN Development Program,  ranks the governorate of Port Said first and the governorate of  Sawhaj last regarding human development. It states that all  Egyptian governorates suffer from a housing shortage, close to  42 percent of Egypt's urban population lives in Cairo and  Alexandria, and Cairo is the most densely populated governorate.    The ceremony [on the occasion of the publication of the  report] was held under the auspices of Deputy Prime Minister and  Planning Minister Kamal al-Janzuri. It was attended by the UN  Development Program's resident representative, Kirstant Muwaziyu  [name as transliterated], and by professors of the National  Planning Institute, officials of the UN program in Egypt,  economics professors, and groups of intellectuals and  journalists.    Regarding per capita income, the report ranks the  governorate  of Port Said first, the governorates of Damietta and Cairo next,  and the governorate of Sawhaj last.    The report states that, relative to international human  development averages, human development in the governorates of  Port Said, Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta, and Suez is average; it  is lower than average in the governorates of Lower Egypt, except  for Damietta and al-Buhayrah. The report states that the  governorates of Upper Egypt, except for al-Jizah, suffer from an  extremely low rate of human development.    The report indicates a large disparity between the  governorates of Egypt regarding the individual's average share  of income. It attributes the leading position of Port Said,  Damietta, and Cairo to the capital turnover in those  governorates. It also stresses that the paucity of the  population in Port Said increases the individual's average  annual share of income there.    The report adds that Asyut and al-Minya lag behind all of  the  governorates with respect to the individual's share of income.  The report advocates restructuring the general state budget to  favor human development. It emphasizes the general role played  by internal and external security regarding stability, consumer  pricing based on economic foundations and a carefully considered  procedure, the adoption of measures to reduce the severity of  poverty in the framework of production projects, and the  harmonizing of businessmen's social responsibility with their  profit-oriented goals.    The report warns of the effect of unemployment on the  development plan. It calls for the selection of suitable  production methods to cope with the problem, encouragement of  private-sector projects to create new jobs, the provision of  social and health services to workers, and the easing of tax  burdens. The report also warns of the income distribution  disparity. It cautions against redistributing factors of  production in the manner of the agriculture reform in the  fifties. The report calls for the attainment of a decentralized  popular partnership and the development of capabilities and  organizational cadres in the area of management. The report  reviews Egypt's economic performance and the economic  experiments tried in the country. It states that the growing  population increase will swallow the majority of income. It  warns that economic growth by itself will not help slow  population growth. The report states that economic growth in  Egypt has usually depended on, and been influenced by, external  factors. It adds that economic growth is linked with economic  imbalances, e.g., the balance of payments deficit and the budget  deficit.    The report states that the unemployment problem has been  exacerbated by the fact that economic growth, although it has  been low, has not been based on a labor-intensive production  model. The report calls for the creation of suitable jobs as  part of the state's general employment policy.    At the same time, the report stresses the need to blend  economic growth with the distribution of income to create a  society based on fairness and equality. The report states in its  general remarks that the population increase has become a burden  on the educational system and state budget. It advocates  lowering the birth rate to reduce this burden in the future. It  calls for establishing an employment insurance fund to remedy  problems stemming from the redistribution of the labor force  among public, private, and trades projects. The report  emphasizes the pervasiveness of education in Egypt; almost one  out of four persons in Egypt is either a student or teacher,  which is higher than the average ratio. The report commends  Egypt's achievements regarding the education of girls, and it  states that there is no shortage of teachers in Egypt's  educational system.    The report also addresses the housing problem, pointing to  the shortage of housing units that has accumulated over the past  30 years, which has forced people to occupy dwellings that are  in danger of collapsing. The report states that all Egyptian  governorates suffer from a housing shortage.    Regarding the labor market, the report states that the  policy  of free education and the compulsory hiring of graduates has had  extreme effects on the labor market. The report warns that the  taxation burden in connection with the privatization of public  enterprises will increase unemployment. It states that coping  with this problem will be a challenge facing any future human  development strategy for Egypt. However, the report emphasizes  that the public-sector's control over investment has enabled the  renewal and expansion of the infrastructure base. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions attack 'vindictive' benefits clawback rules VICTIMS of workplace accidents are being deterred from taking compensation cases to court because of government rules on the clawback of social security benefits, according to unions. Before September 1990, only 50 per cent of social security payments had to be paid back out of court awards. That was increased to 100 per cent under the 1989 Social Security Act. The rules apply to awards of more than Pounds 2,500. The TUC says the scheme is 'vindictive' and court awards to individuals are reduced to 'virtually nothing' after social security clawbacks. Up to five years of benefits paid to accident victims can be reclaimed from costs and compensation ordered by the courts. Unions argue that returns to the Benefits Agency are comparatively small, while the consequences for individual victims can be severe. Official figures confirm that between September 1990 and April last year a total of Pounds 3.7m was repaid to the agency out of court awards, while costs of Pounds 1.7m were incurred in the administration of the scheme. The figures were disclosed at the end of last year in a letter from Mr Michael Bichard, chief executive of the Department of Social Security Benefits Agency, to Mr Graham Allen, Labour MP for Nottingham North. The UCW postal workers' union, which has been monitoring the effects of the new rules, cites the case of a postman who was involved in a road accident while on duty and was forced to retire through ill health following a broken arm with pains in his back and upper body. His compensation claim took more that 2 1/2 years to settle and the final award was Pounds 24,000. He had claimed a disablement pension and other benefits totalling Pounds 15,000 from the Department of Social Security, and his sickness pay from Royal Mail was Pounds 5,000. Under the new rules his award was reduced to Pounds 4,000, the union said. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary and chairman of the TUC's social, health and environmental protection committee, said the 'vindictive system' meant 'the government is benefiting financially from individuals' suffering'. He said that as well as many claimants losing thousands of pounds, others were being deterred from even making any claims. The Benefits Agency said yesterday the scheme was 'underpinned by a simple and fair set of rules which ensure that the negligent parties meet their liabilities rather than passing on some of them to the taxpayer'. The agency added: 'Ministers are satisfied that the scheme is working well and there are no plans for major change.'</p>

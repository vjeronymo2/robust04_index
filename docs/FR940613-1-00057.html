			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's approval review focuses primarily on the basic state authorities (laws and regulations) needed to achieve the underlying objectives of the federal regulations covering the UST technical standards, corrective action, and financial responsibility requirements. The UST state program approval process is also based upon a performance-oriented approach. The statutory test for an approvable state program is that it be ``no less stringent'' than the federal requirements and include as many categories of UST systems (or be as broad in scope) as the federal requirements. EPA reviews the state's specific statutory and regulatory provisions as well as their interpretation by the attorney general of the state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed rule is not intended to present a barrier for states to receive state program approval. A state is not required to have enacted a security interest exemption in order to receive approval of its program from EPA, since failure to have such a provision would merely make the state program broader in scope than the federal one. However, EPA encourages states to adopt statutory and/or regulatory provisions comparable to the final federal UST lender liability rule so that credit-worthy UST owners and operators will have access to funds to upgrade or replace their tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a state program includes an UST security interest exemption, EPA will evaluate it against the criteria in &sect;281.39, as proposed in this notice. These criteria stem from the key components contained in this proposed rule. A state program that exempts a holder from UST corrective action, financial responsibility, and technical requirements as an owner may be approved if: The holder is maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum UST or UST system; the holder does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system; and the holder does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing. In addition, a state program may be approved if it exempts a holder from corrective action and financial responsibility as an operator and if, in addition to the three previous criteria, it requires the holder to demonstrate that its tanks have been emptied and secured, and that it has either permanently or temporarily closed the UST or UST system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The state's program application should address the issue of UST lender liability in the ``Scope'' section of its state program description, under &sect;281.21(a)(3) of the State Program Approval regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Economic Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed elsewhere in this proposal, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability are making a significant number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators of USTs. A more analytical approach to describing the current lending climate and the potential effects associated with today's proposal is through a discussion of lending rates that UST owners are currently faced with, in comparison to those that may prevail after promulgation of a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

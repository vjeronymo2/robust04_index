			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAMPED CHRONICLE OF AMERICA'S TOCQUEVILLE;  </P> <P> GENET: A BIOGRAPHY OF JANET FLANNER BY BRENDA WINEAPPLE (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS:  $24.95; 361 PP.; 0-089919-442-7)  </P> <P> From 1925 until 1975, Janet Flanner wrote The New Yorker's Letters From Paris  under the pseudonym Genet. The daughter of a prosperous Indianapolis mortician,  who killed himself when she was 19, and a woman whose theatrical ambitions had  been frustrated by her marriage and the birth of three daughters, Flanner fled  the Midwest by marrying a classmate from the University of Chicago and moving  to New York.  </P> <P> Before long, she fled the marriage in the company of Solita Solano, the first  of the several women she loved, and the two settled eventually in Paris. The  career of this writer with the ambiguous pen name, considered by admirers  "America's Toqueville," provides the focus for Brenda Wineapple's respectful,  responsible but lackluster biography.  </P> <P> On the face of it, Flanner's life promises to make a rich and intriguing tale.  On her arrival in Paris in the '20s, she was drawn into the community of  expatriates whose names still glitter today: Gertrude Stein and Alice B.  Toklas, Sylvia Beach, Ernest Hemingway, Kay Boyle. . . . In addition to her  Letters From Paris, The New Yorker published her lengthy profiles of some of  the foremost figures in 20th-Century art, literature and politics, among them  Pablo Picasso, Edith Wharton, even Adolf Hitler. Although she left France for  the United States during World War II, on her return, she traveled widely to  report on the war's aftermath, including the Nuremberg trials.  </P> <P> For years, with the suavity of an international diplomat, she simultaneously  sustained relationships with three beautiful women -- Solita Solano, Noel  Haskins Murphy and Natalia Danesi Murray -- "keeping present and former lovers  and friends away from one another, arranging itineraries and schedules so as to  prevent discord as much as possible and to protect herself and others."  </P> <P> If Wineapple's account lacks the animation such circumstances would seem to  engender, the difficulty may lie in the subject herself. To a considerable  extent, Wineapple makes clear, Genet functioned not just as a nom de plume but  as a mask, permitting Flanner to remain, in true New Yorker style, "witty,  distant, and uninvolved." The journalistic advantage of this persona was that  it permitted a double vision, placing Flanner "inside history because she was  there, as well as outside it, as an American in Paris, a woman, a spectator."  </P> <P> But the disadvantage to the biographer is suggested by Flanner's resistance to  writing her memoirs: "After so many years spent studiously avoiding the word I,  she was hardly about to embark on a project in which the first person was  essential. Moreover, she must have thought that writing her memoirs would make  public her private life, and this she would not do. Her life had been an  eminently private one, devoted to concealment, not revelation, and the  conscious crafting of an identity."  </P> <P> So adamantine a veneer prohibits the biographer, and therefore the reader, from  bringing the person crouched beneath it to life; the veneer itself must simply  do. The remark of one critic reviewing Flanner's generally acclaimed Paris  Journal might apply to Genet as well: "Rather than objectivity about events  which no longer excite and which are too fragmentarily related to rank as  history, the reader might prefer more of Miss Flanner herself."  </P> <P> In fairness, however, a responsible biographer can reveal only what her subject  has permitted to become known. All the same, Wineapple might have strengthened  her presentation through more penetrating literary judgment and livelier  literary techniques. She cites, for example, one of Flanner's major themes, her  lifelong wistfulness for the past, noting that in 1921, she believed that "the  civilization of today, influenced by bourgeoise self-interest, is moving away  from an ideal," embodied in the Acropolis.  </P> <P> By 1968, "the world seemed more and more incomprehensible, with its burgeoning  skyscrapers, its ugliness, its continuing violence, its youth subculture, its  scatalogical language," and Flanner "craved a turning backward," this time not  to Attic glory but to the same 1920s she had earlier decried. But Wineapple  never explores the significance of this implicit intellectual stasis for  Flanner the woman or Genet the writer.  </P> <P> Genet's strengths, according to Wineapple, lay in "her strong reactions, her  vivid pictorial sense, her sharp metaphor, her common sense, and even the  crushes she sometimes got on people and movements." With the exception of  common sense, these qualities are largely missing from the biography.  </P> <P> A brief passage in the preface describing one of Flanner's homes suggests that  Wineapple can use concrete detail evocatively, but for the most part, people,  places and incidents fail to come alive. Instead, the style is relentlessly  expository. Apparently believing herself duty-bound to account for Flanner's  whereabouts at all times, Wineapple, for instance, shuttles us back and forth,  back and forth, back and forth across the Atlantic on nearly indistinguishable  trips that leave us woozy with jet lag.  </P> <P> Genet's lack of flair should not dissuade readers interested in 20th-Century  literary and social history. Through her thorough research, Wineapple has  documented the life and world of a writer whose journalistic style, urbane and  ironic, remains an antidote to gonzo journalism and related disorders.  </P> <P> Moreover, the volume itself is appealing; the cover is attractively designed,  using an antique endpaper; the text is printed in a handsome typeface on  good-quality stock; a small array of photographs is well-selected. It should  well please all biographiles.  </P></p>

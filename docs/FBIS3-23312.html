			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kemal Yurteri: "Drug Trafficking Shifts to </F> Ports"]    [Excerpts] Ankara--Developments in the Balkan countries and  the Caucasus have forced the drug traffickers to make  significant changes in the routes they use to transport their  narcotics from Turkey to Western Europe and from Western Europe  to North America. While narcotics were smuggled into Turkey from  Iran and Syria in the past, the drug traffickers are also  bringing in supplies from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and  Uzbekistan at the present time. It is common knowledge that  they used the "Balkan route" to transport their narcotics to  Europe in the past. However, the recent use of ports in drug  trafficking has drawn attention. It has been reported that even  the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has complied with the changes in  transportation routes and moved to intensify its activities in  Italy and Greece. [passage omitted]    Regarding the PKK, the report said: "It has been ascertained  that the PKK will maintain its underground activities, intensify  its drug trafficking operations, take harsh steps to continue to  extort funds, and shift its activities from wherever it is  banned to neighboring countries (particularly to those that have  a coastline). The obstruction of PKK's activities in the  countries in which that organization is banned will be  impossible if its members are not expelled."</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUARDIAN ON CHINA KILLINGS  </P> <P> In his June 11 column ("Leftist Cacophony for Human Rights Grows Silent on the  Beijing Massacre"), Alan M. Dershowitz asserts that China's bloody crackdown  produced "a resounding chorus of silence" from U.S. leftists. Without quoting  any of their positions, he claims Marxist papers, including the Guardian, "were  busy trying to fit the events in China into their political orthodoxies." Based  on this premise that the left has refused to condemn China's leaders,  Dershowitz argues that leftists' criticism of human rights violations by  right-wing regimes is hypocritical.  </P> <P> Dershowitz's premise is false, however. The Guardian, an independent radical  news weekly that is widely read on the left, denounced the killings in no  uncertain terms, in a front-page editorial June 14, our first issue after the  crackdown. (Previous issues included favorable reports on the pro-democracy  movement.) The editorial stressed "the necessity of incorporating democratic  rights like freedom of assembly and the press into socialism."  </P> <P> A survey of left organizations published in our June 21 issue further  contradicts Dershowitz's "chorus of silence" claim. Nearly all major U.S. left  groups published editorials or issued statements strongly condemning the  Chinese decision to crush the student protests. The Workers World Party, cited  by Dershowitz as typical of left opinion, was in fact the only national Marxist  group to support the repression.  </P> <P> One is led to conclude that Dershowitz's blatant misrepresentation of the  left's position was an effort to fit events into his political orthodoxy.  </P> <P> WILLIAM RYAN  </P> <P> Editor, Guardian  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

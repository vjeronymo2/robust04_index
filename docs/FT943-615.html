			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Early promise comes to nought - A look at a gloomy pattern emerging in computing services Almost half the computing software and services companies floated on the main market in the past 18 months have seen their share prices decline precipitously after returning results below expectations. The latest, McDonnell Information Systems - where the shares fell from 216p to 112p last week on pre-tax profits Pounds 4m short of analysts' forecasts  -is especially surprising. MDIS, 25 years old and a former subsidiary of the US aerospace group McDonnell Douglas before a leveraged management buy-out two years ago, had been regarded as an unspectacular, solid performer with niche markets in police, public sector and banking software. The flotation in March, valuing MDIS at Pounds 260m, was the largest in the UK computing services sector this year. Other disappointments have proved to be Coda, a supplier of international accounting software; Data and Research Services, which specialises in optical mark recognition; Azlan, a distributor of networking products; and Clinical Computing, the specialist in medical software. Inevitably, the problems experienced by these companies is casting a shadow on computing services; not a sector the City understands particularly well in any case. Their difficulties may also affect the prospects of companies such as Computer Management Group, a large Anglo-Dutch concern which plans to come to market next year and which has a similar reputation to MDIS for sound management and planning. The market will be watching closely the performance of recently floated companies such as Quality Software Products, which reports today. It is a supplier of large-scale banking software where one or two sales can make a large difference to profitability. Mr Clay Brendish, chairman of Admiral Computing Group, one of the few UK computing services companies to improve profitability through the recession, said: 'This hurts the industry because computing services is many industries in one'. The lumping together of many different kinds of activities - from software development to computer maintenance - in the single category is part of the problem. Each of the companies had different reasons for its failure to perform to expectations. MDIS failed to sell more copies of a highly priced banking software product; Coda saw a decline in popularity of the computers on which its software runs; DRS and Clinical Computing experienced delays in orders caused by circumstances outside their control; Azlan, which issued a profits warning in June, said buying patterns had changed. None of this cuts any ice with Mr Richard Holway, publisher of a newsletter* which reports the financial performance of the UK computing services industry. Pointing out that some of the more rarefied issues such as Division, a supplier of virtual reality, and Phonelink, an on-line information service, could rightly be regarded as speculative, he goes on: 'The real shocks have come from companies with previously sound performances.' Of all the computing services companies to come to market in the past decade, only 4 per cent have not suffered a reversal. Five per cent have gone broke, 57 per cent have made a loss at some time and 34 per cent have experienced reduced profits before tax. Mr Holway makes two points: The quality of earnings for software and services companies is not as sound as they would have people believe. Mr Martin Read, managing director of Logica, has emphasised the importance of repeatable revenues in improving the quality of a company's earnings. MDIS, DRS and Clinical Computing, however, proved to be heavily dependent on orders that failed to materialise. The forecasting skills of software and services companies leave much to be desired. A competent company should be able to forecast its performance for the following three months with reasonable accuracy. Yet Mr Jerry Causley, MDIS chairman has said he believed until the beginning of September that he would make his target for the year. Are trading problems, which companies know about or suspect, being ignored or brushed over in the haste to complete a listing? Some recently floated companies say the way their brokers handled their flotation was 'a shambles'. Mr Holway snaps: 'The issues should have been delayed or investors warned. They were not'. The beneficiaries, inevitably, are venture capitalists, company directors who sold shares and the brokers themselves. The losers are small investors and the industry's credibility. *System House, Richard Holway Ltd, New Acre 18 Great Austins, Farnham Surrey, 0252 724584.</p>

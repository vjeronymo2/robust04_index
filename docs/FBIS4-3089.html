			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Daily News: "State Firm Files for Bankruptcy"] </F>   [Text] For the first time a State factory in Shanghai has  filed for bankruptcy, and 10 more enterprises, including a joint  venture, are expected to follow suit.    Shanghai No 2 Webbing Factory recently filed for bankruptcy  in a local court, marking the start of a readjustment of  State-owned assets. This is a crucial step in the deepening of  economic reform, designed to increase the value of State  property.    The factory is the first State enterprise in the city to ask  for bankruptcy.    In the 1980s, local courts heard the first case of  bankruptcy  involving a collective enterprise. From 1992 to 1993, more than  50 township enterprises and service ventures filed for  bankruptcy.    In the last few years, some State enterprises in the city  have continued to lose money despite the thriving economy.    From January to November last year, according to the  Municipal Economic Commission, the State-owned assets of local  industrial enterprises totalled 118.8 billion yuan ($13.66  billion) and their gross liabilities totalled 87.8 billion yuan  ($10.1 billion).    This liabilities ratio of 73.9 per cent is much higher than  the world level for industrial enterprises of 50 per cent.    Local economic analysts believe the time is ripe for the  bankruptcy law to be applied to industrial money losers. This  will guarantee the real value of national assets by accelerating  property transfers and exchanges, they say.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PROBE OF COUNTERFEIT AIRCRAFT PARTS ENSNARLS MISSION VIEJO MAN  </P> <P> An Orange County consultant was charged with conspiracy, and officials at two  Los Angeles area companies were implicated in a scheme that resulted in the  placement of counterfeit parts in military and commercial planes, according to  court documents filed Wednesday in Seattle.  </P> <P> The scheme was outlined in federal court as Bruce J. Rice, president of Rice  Aircraft Inc of Hauppauge, N.Y., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and  two counts of mail fraud in connection with the sale of the counterfeit parts.  The firm pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy and mail fraud.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Bruce Clark said no accident had been attributed to the  parts, which were rivets and other fasteners sold between 1977 and 1988.  </P> <P> One way Rice Aircraft was able to sell its used parts was through an alleged  kickback scheme, according to court records. The company paid kickbacks to  employees of competitors in order to get advanced looks at their bids on  important projects. It is alleged that Rice Aircraft would take that  information and then underbid its rival firms, thereby winning significant  contracts.  </P> <P> Richard K. Ohlman, a Mission Viejo parts broker, was charged Wednesday with  conspiring in 1982 with Rice and Rice Aircraft to pay kickbacks to employees of  Boeing Co.  </P> <P> Officials at Hi-Shear Corp. in Torrance and Deutsch Fastener Corp. in Lakewood  -- both parts manufacturers -- allegedly accepted kickbacks from Rice.  </P> <P> Ohlman, 70, declined comment when contacted at his home Wednesday. If  convicted, he faces up to five years in jail and a $5,000 fine.  </P> <P> Employees at Hi-Shear and Deutsch Fastener were not charged with a crime  because they had agreed to cooperate as witnesses in the government's case  against Rice, Clark said.  </P> <P> Clark said the employees at Hi-Shear and Deutsch were acting on their own and  not at the direction of management. Neither company has been accused of  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Besides getting bid information, the employees allegedly supplied Rice Aircraft  with test reports that were used to indicate that the counterfeit parts had met  safety specifications even though they had not.  </P> <P> Rice Aircraft's scheme worked this way, according to documents filed by the  U.S. attorney's office: It took used or damaged nuts, bolts and rivets and had  them stripped and replated. It then sold the parts as new under the original  manufacturer's trademark.  </P> <P> "There were in excess of a thousand transactions detailed involving aerospace  manufacturers and airlines throughout the Free World," Clark said. Federal  officials said they have been unable to identify and retrieve all of the  counterfeit parts.  </P> <P> Among the airlines that purchased the used parts were United, American, Air  France, TWA, Pan Am and Varig. They were used for everything from ensuring the  integrity of the aircraft's structure to keeping panels inside the aircraft  from coming loose.  </P> <P> Bruce Rice, 42, faces up to five years in prison and has agreed to pay a  $500,000 fine. The U.S. District Court in Seattle could impose an additional  $250,000 fine and order restitution of up to $1 million. Rice Aircraft has  agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.  </P> <P> The Rice case grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistle blower in his company  and was investigated by a special federal task force called Northwest Defense  Contracting.  </P> <P> The Seattle task force, made up of the FBI, IRS and several other agencies, has  been investigating criminal practices in the aircraft parts and supply  business.  </P> <P> During the last year, counterfeit fasteners, ball bearings, valves and circuit  breakers have surfaced throughout the nation. They have been found in numerous  areas where public safety is a concern including nuclear plants, commercial  airliners, missiles and school buses.  </P></p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Police seek to bottle up Osaka riots HUNDREDS of riot police patrolled slum streets in Osaka last night after four days of violent clashes with destitute labourers left several dozen people injured and the area strewn with debris and gutted vehicles. Twelve arrests were made as many of the Airin area's 30,000 day-labourers protested against the suspension of welfare payments by the local government. But the real cause is Japan's economic downturn, which has hit labourers harder than mainstream workers. At around 5am each morning, the day-labour market opens in the dirty concrete building which has been at the centre of the protests. Job touts with presumed gang links hold up notices offering two or three days' work clearing a building site or filling a job-spot in a small factory. The crash of Osaka's property market and the slowing of factory orders have left many of the men reliant on handouts. A special fund was exhausted last week, inspiring the protests by the destitute, whose desperation is heightened by drink dependence or debts to gang-run loan shops. Last night, hundreds of the workers were sleeping outside the job market, where they were hoping to get work in the day's muster. Placards around the building demanded government help. Small groups of workers huddled together, discussing tactics. Meanwhile, hundreds of riot police with shields and batons at the ready massed in a nearby police station. The clashes are the most serious since a week of rioting in the same district two years ago left 200 injured. Police fear the riots will be a feature of the economic downturn, as the labourers' desperation becomes more acute, and that the troubles may be a beacon for extremist right-wing groups. One factor fuelling the protests is outrage at a police confession that a local officer had taken bribes from gangsters.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK mortgages The equity market could not quite decide how to take yesterday's mortgage increase by the Skipton Building Society. Initial alarm gave way to relief that other larger lenders would not immediately follow suit. That may yet prove to be optimistic. The Skipton's move is a harsh reminder that competitive pressures in the retail savings market are still strong despite two cuts in National Savings rates . The risk remains of other societies being forced to raise rates. If this does not happen, some damage must already have been done. Mere talk of possible higher rates seems calculated to depress further housing market confidence. As confidence ebbs, the government looks even more boxed in. It could not after all reduce National Savings rates a third time without a truly embarrassing loss of face. Nor does the foreign exchange market relish reminders of the government's acute desire to avoid a mortgage rate increase. Each such reminder only serves to dilute its faith in the authorities' determination to raise interest rates if necessary to defend sterling. Perhaps it is just as well that, for yesterday at least, exchange dealers had the distraction of concerted intervention in support of the dollar to keep their attention away from sterling.</p>

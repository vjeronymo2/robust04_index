			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution hits Pru NEWS that Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest general insurance group, is pulling out of the rest of the commercial lines business in the UK plus a profits downgrade instigated by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL), the stockbroker, saw the insurance group's shares under heavy selling pressure yesterday. The stock fell 11 to 281p, or 3.8 per cent, on hefty turnover of 5.6m shares. The latest move by Prudential follows its decision earlier this year to pull out of the general insurance broker market. Pru's commercial lines interests involve small business, individual commercial policies and commercial motor insurance. Mr Jonathan Sheehan at Credit Lyonnais lowered his current year profits estimate from Pounds 450m to Pounds 415m, citing three main factors. Firstly, the deterioration at M &amp; G's reinsurance business, secondly, a slimming down of the business which could involve provisioning of up to Pounds 10m. Thirdly, he mentioned the recent firmer trend in sterling and expectations of provisions against the Canadian life business. The Laing analyst said he had told clients to top-slice their holdings in Prudential. Ladbroke blow A profit downgrade in Ladbroke by one of the company's joint brokers sent the shares reeling in very heavy turnover, although they later rallied. Smith New Court chopped Pounds 19m from its 1992 forecast to Pounds 191m and Pounds 10m from 1993's to Pounds 220m. Some houses were already revising their figures last night after learning of the Smith move and speaking to the company. Others are expected to follow suit on Monday. Smith blames higher interest charges owing to currency fluctuations and other charges arising from changes in debt. The shares tumbled on the news, falling 9 before rallying to close just 4 off at 180p. Turnover was a heavy 11m. Analysts said that Ladbroke's secure and high-yielding dividend helped underpin the shares, despite the downgrade. Dealers were astonished at the continuing level of demand for shares in Tadpole Technology, the computer work station designer, whose shares made their market debut on Monday. Opening at 73p on Monday morning, compared with a placing price of 65p a share carried out by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based stockbroker, Tadpole shares shot up to 85p that day, to 113p on Tuesday, 135p on Wednesday, 143p by Thursday and rounded off a tumultuous week by soaring to 194p yesterday, a day's gain of 48p. Turnover yesterday reached 2.1m shares. Some traders, shocked by the performance of the stock, advised caution and suggested switching some of the profits made in the stock into other shares in the sector. The impact of this switching saw Sage leap 21 to 498p, Sanderson move up 18 to 242p and MicroFocus improve 58 to 2618p. A roller-coaster ride in Great Universal Stores finished with the shares closing 12 ahead at 1630p, after being 35 off at one stage. One leading broker was said to have brought a large line of stock in the previous day's trading at 1640p and been finally forced to cut and run, selling 200,000 into the market when the price reached 1595p. A further 100,000 dribbled out at lower levels. Bargain hunters then appeared and the price moved swiftly ahead in heavy turnover for the tightly-traded stock of 1.2m. There was good two-way business in Hillsdown, with the shares slipping 3 to 111p. Food retailers, which this week hit a five-year high against the FT All-Share, drifted back in average trading and a modicum of profit-taking. Tesco fell 3 to 245p on 6m traded, Sainsbury, 3 down to 529p and Kwik Save 5 to 777p. Argyll continued to slip, Goldman Sachs yesterday becoming the latest to consider its recent surge to be overdone. However, the US-owned broker says it still expects the shares to outperform in the long-term. Yesterday they lost 6 to 386p. Profit downgradings from several brokers hit English China Clays, and the shares fell 7 early in the day before recovering to close 3 off at 426p. BZW reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 85m and the following year's figure by Pounds 14m to Pounds 98m. Mr Mark Cusack at the securities house blamed tough trading conditions particularly on the industrial minerals side for the reduction and added: 'Volumes are holding up but prices and margins are under continuous pressure.' Kleinwort Benson and S. G. Warburg were also said to have reduced forecasts. Shares in Cookson Group ignored a modest profits downgrading from County NatWest and closed 6 up at 184p, after the same broker recommended the stock. County reduced the current year figure by Pounds 5m to Pounds 70m but moved the stock to a 'Buy-Outperform' recommendation because of 'Cookson's ability to get substantial growth without the need to assume any economic upturn.' Profit-taking in Tomkins saw the shares fall 10 to 237p, making it the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE 100 stocks. Turnover reached 3.6m. Burmah Castrol edged up 4 to 670p with a number of broking houses taking the view that the stock has been oversold on worries about the extent of the economic downturn on the Continent, and especially in Germany. British Petroleum rallied modestly, edging ahead to 222p on almost 9m traded, helped by the small rally in crude oil prices. Specialists noted more of the recent large-scale selling by UK instititutions, with all of the stock said to be winging its way across the Atlantic Ocean to the US, where the big institutions continue to see the company as a strong currency and recovery play. An early bout of profit-taking caused a retreat in Reuters. The shares closed 22 lighter at 1351p. RTZ also suffered the same fate, falling 6 to 638p on trade of 1.1m. But it was a stock overhang that was said to have weakened BAT and the shares gave up 8 to 946p. Turnover in Hanson rose to 12m with a substantial part of the day's volume said to be a result of a programme trade. The shares closed 3 lighter at 223p, with the company's reports and accounts landing on investors' desks in the last half-hour of trading. Hotel group Forte gained 3 to 167p as BZW was said to be recommending the stock in the wake of its deal this week to sell its Gardner Merchant catering subsidiary. First Leisure improved 7 to 307p following remarks from the chairman that trading was holding up. A squeeze sent Thorn EMI forward 9 to 813p. An upgrade and buy recommendation from Smith New Court helped Resort Hotels add 1 1/2 to 25 1/2 p. Among engineers, Siebe which reported figures earlier this week, jumped 6 to 397p, with Charterhouse Tilney said to have shown a keen interest in the stock. A stock overhang following a large sell order depressed IMI and the shares closed 15 lower at 237p. In transports, a large US seller of Tiphook, which reports figures on Monday, caused a slide in the stock towards the end of the session. The shares fell 25 to 284p, making it the day's biggest fall in the market in percentage terms. BICC, a weak market in recent days, picked up to close a net 17 higher at 304p with the shares said to have been recommended by one of the UK integrated broking firms. Insurance broker Sedgwick attracted exceptionally heavy support and moved up 6 to 156p amid hints of a big broker buy note in the near future. Building materials and contracting group Tarmac jumped 6 to 105p, after 106p, as the market responded to the latest burst of takeover speculation. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (36).

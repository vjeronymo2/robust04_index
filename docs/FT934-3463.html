			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Almost respectable - Germany / Increased business Jodag Mobilsysteme, based in Heidhofe in the middle of the rolling hills of the Schwabishe Alb, in the south-west German state of Baden-Wurtemmberg, is typical of many mittelstand, or medium-sized companies. Typical in that, in the 90 years since it was founded, it has evolved from being a craft business into a modern manufacturing company, like many companies in south Germany. It started life making wooden carts used for transporting hay and manure; now, it is one of Germany's largest makers of portable containers used inter alia as temporary offices and accommodation across much of eastern Germany. It was, until recently, a family-owned company. But the former owner reached retirement age without finding an obvious heir. In 1990, he turned 67 and realised that none of his five daughters, nor their husbands, was willing or able to take over the business. The problem of management succession is common to many thousands of mittelstand companies: Jodag's solution was highly unusual. Mr Wolfgang Sander, an engineer in his mid-fifties with a history as a company doctor, a desire for a new challenge and no previous connection with the container manufacturer, bought himself a major stake in the company, backed by the German arm of 3i, the UK venture capital company, together with Candover and one domestic institution. 'It was very attractive for me to make such a move,' reflected Sander recently, on the motivation behind the management buy-in. 'It offered enormous opportunities for developing the business and my career. And, of course, there is the chance to make some money if all goes well.' Sander is still a rare breed in German industry - the experienced manager who is prepared to leave the security of a job in big business and willingly take the financial risks associated with a buy-out. Rare, but not unique, as at least two other recent cases show. Mr Jurgen Grossmann, a main board director at the troubled Klockner-Werke diversified steel group, teamed up earlier this year with Druker &amp; Co, a Frankfurt-based investment banking boutique, to buy the group's special steel subsidiary for a symbolic DM2 (79p). In November, two businessmen bought LVH - a large German food production company - from the DG Bank, advised and backed by the Hamburg-based Thomas JC Matzen buy-out specialist and by CINVen in London. According to Mr Dirk Brandis, at Matzen, this is one of Germany's largest and most complicated buy-outs, with the move to new ownership linked with a new commercial strategy for the loss-making company. Together with Jodag, these transactions illustrate forces which are leading to increased buy-out and buy-in business in Germany. The volume of such deals is far from being enormous - indeed, advisers consider themselves lucky if they put together two or three deals a year. But in a market which has traditionally frowned on such transactions as an unpleasant intrusion of Anglo-American financial jiggery-pokery, there has been a perceptible pick-up in business opportunities within the last six months alone. The ultimate cause of this is the German recession, which is hitting both large companies and mittelstand companies hard. Germany's big, publicly quoted companies are virtually all conglomerates. Many are now under financial pressure, forcing management to think hard about strategic priorities. 'Portfolio clarification' has become a priority: managers are realising that businesses will have to be sold in order to concentrate limited resources on newly-identified core businesses. The idea of 'focus' still has a revolutionary flavour for German corporates, and as yet it is only the more troubled companies - such as Klockner Werke or FAG Kugelfischer - which are engaged in wide-ranging winnowing of their business portfolios. But analysts expect unbundling to gather favour through the 1990s, creating more opportunities for management buy-outs and buy-ins. For the mittelstand, the problems are different: the downturn has merely served to exacerbate the difficulties of finding successors to the ageing owner-managers who built up their businesses in the aftermath of the war. 'Often management is the most logical successor,' comments Siegfried Druker, whose firm backed Mr Grossmann's buy-out from Klockner-Werke. 'A management buy-out is the obvious solution.' Without obvious successors within the existing management, there is scope for an outsider to take control by means of a buy-in. This is likely to become increasingly popular, given the reluctance of large German corporates to buy mittelstand companies at a time when recession in forcing them to slim down. In the past the German banks and their investment affiliates may have acted as 'buyer of last resort', but there is a tendency for banks to scale back their industrial holdings as they, too, focus on their core businesses. This leaves the field open to buy-out specialists and adventurous managers. Eastern Europe, including former East Germany, is discussed on the next page</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Back to full employment ECONOMIC POLICY is subject to sudden shifts in fashion. Such a change has occurred in recent months, as unemployment has replaced inflation as the number one policy concern for developed country governments. Of course, finance ministers in Washington this week for the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting have made their customary pledge to remain vigilant against a new surge in inflationary pressures. But with 32m people currently unable to find jobs in industrial countries, it is easy to see why unemployment is the more immediate worry. This change in approach is not simply a reflection of the depressed state of the world economy. Instead, it results from a growing realisation that unemployment is likely to stay worryingly high even after growth re-emerges. That both the left-of-centre British opposition parties now feel confident enough to revive full employment as a goal of policy, after a decade when such a commitment was thought to imply inflationary irresponsibility, shows that the unemployment debate has moved into a new era. This renewed concern is a product of the growing impotence that Europe's governments as well as the European Commission currently feel about economic policy. They can no longer rely on a cut in interest rates or a fiscal boost to restore something approaching full employment. But they cannot ignore the protectionist pressures or social disruption that high unemployment implies. Nor does the evidence suggest that the developed world's favoured supply-side policy prescriptions - labour market deregulation, more spending on active labour market measures and limited unemployment benefits - have had much success in cutting unemployment. Wage flexibility Not so, says the British government, supported by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook. High unemployment in Europe, UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke stated again this week, is the product of over-regulated and inflexible labour markets. The UK and the US, by embracing deregulation and wage flexibility, have achieved a superior record of job creation than continental Europe. The chancellor is a little less than half right. Compared with the US, Europe's record of job creation has been miserable. US employment has risen by 30m in the past 20 years, three times as fast as in the European Community. The Commission has already acknowledged that regulation has gone too far, especially in southern Europe where restrictive hire and fire rules have stifled job growth. Of course, Britain's claim to be part of this Anglo-Saxon success story is rather weak. When the effects of the UK's two recessions are included, British employment has barely grown over the past 14 years. But even over the period 1982-90, British unemployment was higher on average than in France and Germany as well as the US, while UK real wage growth has been slow to respond to rising unemployment. Unprecedented levels But the US administration has not rushed to preach the gospel of deregulation as the answer to Europe's unemployment problem. As officials at the US Labour Department well know, the country has a problem of joblessness among young and prime-age men, which is at least as severe as in Europe. Employment growth in the US and the UK in the 1980s occurred because female employment, increasingly in part-time and service sector jobs, has grown to unprecedented levels. But the number of US and British men with jobs has continued to fall, especially among unskilled and poorly educated. European governments have also experienced the latter shift. What they have not permitted is the offsetting growth in less well-paid female employment. This gender-based change in the pattern of employment is at the heart of the economic changes that have hit the developed world over the past two decades. Technological change, and to a lesser extent developing country trade, mean that the demand for unskilled labour has fallen sharply since the 1960s other than at increasingly low wages. In the UK and the US, where manufacturing employment has slumped and relative wages for unskilled workers have fallen dramatically, women have taken the service sector jobs that have replaced them. Unemployed men have not - they are subsisting on benefits or, especially among young US men, turning to crime instead. This is the issue that governments must address at President Clinton's unemployment summit next month: how they can revive the employment prospects of unskilled men. Education and training are the obvious long-term solution, while public sector jobs or subsidies for private sector employment seem a better alternative than either subsistence on benefits or the kind of US inner-city problems that withdrawing welfare benefits would encourage. But one thing is clear. Developed countries cannot ignore the problem any longer. Its social consequences are increasingly damaging. And it will not go away.</p>

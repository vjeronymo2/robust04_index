			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Franklin defends Body Shop stance The US ethical fund that triggered a fierce debate over the activities of Body Shop International over the last few weeks has concluded that some of the criticisms against the company were justified. In a long-awaited article in its Insight magazine, Boston-based Franklin Research &amp; Development Corporation said there was a gap between Body Shop's 'image and its reality' and called the company's response to criticism bombastic and offensive. It also stressed that Body Shop's problems were 'quite correctable' and that it was 'currently making improvements in almost all areas'. Franklin added: 'Through clever public relations, the Body Shop has carefully cultivated an image which is inconsistent with the company's sometimes less than impressive performance.' The assessment stands in stark contrast to the conclusions of other organisations such as Eiris, the London-based ethical investment research service, which suggested recently that the criticism directed against Body Shop was unfair. News that Franklin had recommended clients to sell Body Shop shares, backed by its disposal of 50,000 shares held on behalf of clients, helped precipitate dozens of media articles and contributed to a drop in the share price which has fallen since mid-August from 242p to close yesterday at 206p, up 6p. Franklin said it had learned from the experience of the last few weeks to be 'more diligent in checking company claims' and expressed frustration that Body Shop had refused to provide information to those trying to verify its claims. It said the company's overall record of environmental auditing and disclosure was impressive, but called on it to state the source of the ingredients in its products on their packaging. It said the language the company used to describe its 'Trade not Aid' activities 'still requires revision if it is to truly reflect the scale of the projects it supports'. Ms Joan Bavaria, president of Franklin, said yesterday that it had not given the company an overall rating, and that while it was still not recommending clients to buy the shares, it 'would certainly entertain buying the stock again in the future'. Responding to the criticism Body Shop said: 'Franklin's major criticism is that we defend ourselves too aggressively. We strongly, of course, disagree. 'When it comes to protecting our company, our shareholders and our reputation we will continue to act quickly and forthrightly.' Body Shop added, 'By devoting a whole issue of their newsletter to us, they're subjecting us to a level of scrutiny they would not reserve for their other investments. 'Show us other UK firms that are doing as much as us. At least we're trying. We're highlighting the issues.'</p>

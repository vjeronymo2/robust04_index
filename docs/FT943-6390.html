			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Bratislava starts to catch up with ally Shortly after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 that ousted communism in the former Czechoslovakia there was a crisis in Bratislava's supermarkets. They ran out of yoghurt. The distribution system, geared to a centrally planned economy, collapsed and it suddenly became impossible to get domestic products. 'We have very good yoghurt in Slovakia,' notes Mr Peter Kresanek, mayor of Bratislava. 'But three years ago you couldn't buy Slovak yoghurt, only Austrian.' Happily, local producers soon got the hang of the market economy and Slovak yoghurt is now on display again. Ironically, it is now a big hit with the thousands of Austrian shoppers who stream across the border from Vienna, just 65km to the west, every weekend to take advantage of the city's lower prices. With the average Austrian industrial wage of Dollars 3,200 against Slovakia's Dollars 200 a month, the attractions are obvious. The crowds of Austrian shoppers testify not just to the geographical closeness of the two cities, but also to a new business relationship that has developed since the revolution. It is a two-way relationship. Since border restrictions were eased thousands of Bratislavans have begun to travel to the Austrian capital daily to work on construction sites, as cleaners, or in shops and restaurants. As a result unemployment in Bratislava, at less than 5 per cent, is far lower than the Slovak average of nearly 15 per cent, and higher Austrian wages give Bratislavans more spending power at home. 'The relationship is very good, both on the personal and the economic level,' Mr Kresanek says. For many Bratislavans the restored links are symbolised by the close personal and working ties between Mr Kresanek and his Viennese counterpart, Mr Helmut Zilk. At the height of the Velvet Revolution Mr Zilk made an unexpected appearance at an anti-government rally in Bratislava to tell 100,000 cheering Slovaks that the people of Vienna stood by them in their struggle. The gesture, remembered with affection by many Bratislavans, is credited with reawakening links between the two cities. Mr Zilk became an honorary citizen of the Slovak capital shortly afterwards, and the two men meet regularly. Austria is by far the biggest foreign investor in Slovakia, accounting for over a quarter of all foreign investment in the country at the end of June. About half the total Austrian investment of Dollars 275m (Pounds 177m) in Slovakia is in Bratislava. Slovak exports to Austria last year were worth over Dollars 300m, and grew to nearly Dollars 200m in the first half of 1994. Ambitious plans are on the drawing board to improve road and rail links, upgrade services on the Danube for tourism and cargo and even revive a passenger tram line that ran between the two cities from 1914 to 1946, although the economic cost of the latter is believed to be prohibitive. The relationship, not surprisingly, is becoming increasingly competitive. Business people in Bratislava trumpet the city's cost advantages and well-educated workforce, but admit its drawbacks. 'Bratislava can beat Vienna on cost, but not on infrastructure,' says Mr L'ubomir Kardos, a Bratislava businessman who says he wants to expand his stationery business into Vienna. Some successes have been noted. Organisers of the annual Bratislava Trade Fair claim to have won exhibitors away from the Vienna fair by offering display space at a fifth of the cost. With Vienna airport roughly half way between the two cities, the Slovaks are counting on their lower costs to lure more business east.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Tax change hits EZTs - At a glance Investors will find it more difficult to shelter tax through Enterprise Zone Trusts, as a result of a tax change announced this week. Industry experts believe that the number of new EZTs being launched could be halved as a result of the rule change, which will restrict the appeal of EZTs to investors who are prepared to hold the investment for a full 25 years. The government acted to stop a loophole in its legislation on capital allowances which allowed property owners to offer investors an exit route from an EZT before the end of the trust's 25 year life. Existing trusts are not affected.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): TUC proposes role in product improvement UNIONS were yesterday urged to make use of new management techniques in order to establish a role in improving product quality. The call came in a paper published by the TUC as part of the most fundamental review of its role for a quarter of a century. In the paper, which will be central to discussions among union leaders this year, unions are advised to learn as much as possible about human resource management (HRM) and total quality management (TQM) techniques in order to gain from them. An analysis of trade unionism in the 1990s by Lord McCarthy, a Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, argues that although most workers are sceptical of HRM, the techniques stem from managers' acceptance that people are not merely another factor of production. Lord McCarthy says that some overt attempts to improve involvement and commitment 'turn out to be ways of loading (workers) with additional responsibilities without appropriate changes of job description or upgrading'. However, he says the increased awareness that working people are the key to organisational efficiency can be seen 'as an opportunity to show that unions can contribute constructively to the pursuit of total quality'. He also says unions can make pay demands that reflect their members' contribution to improved performance and lower unit costs. They may be accompanied by 'more flexible and speedy procedures for resolving outstanding differences'. TUC Towards 2000, A Consultative Document.

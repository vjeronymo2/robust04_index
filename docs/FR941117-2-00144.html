			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The distributor for a Company having a multi-class system will adopt compliance standards for any portfolio which has a multi-class system, which standards will relate to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a portfolio having a multi-class system to agree to conform to such applicable standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors with respect to the multi-class system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors of a Company having a multi-class system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Each portfolio having a multi-class system will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, conversion features, CDSCs, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in a portfolio in every prospectus relating to such portfolio, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each such portfolio will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in a portfolio in every shareholder report relating to such portfolio. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each portfolio's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such portfolio. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of any portfolio's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the portfolios may make pursuant to a Plan in reliance on the exemptive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. If a CDSC arrangement is implemented with respect to shares of a portfolio, applicants agree to comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. If a Company implements any amendment to its Distribution Plan(s) (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment to an Administrative Plan or Plans) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Non-CDSC Shares under the Plan, existing Convertible CDSC Shares will stop converting into the Non-CDSC Shares unless the Convertible CDSC Shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that Convertible CDSC Shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Non-CDSC Shares''), identical in all material respects to the Non-CDSC Shares as they existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Non-CDSC Shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Convertible CDSC Shares for a new class (``New Convertible CDSC Shares ''), identical to the existing Convertible CDSC Shares in all material respects except that the New Convertible CDSC Shares will convert into New Non-CDSC Shares. New Non-CDSC Shares or New Convertible CDSC Shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Non-CDSC Shares or New Convertible CDSC Shares shall be borne solely by the Company's adviser and/or distributor. Convertible CDSC Shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Non-CDSC Shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Non-CDSC Shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Convertible CDSC Shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Margaret H.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Convertible zloty gives Poland's exports zip - Sharp rise in trade is most tangible sign of reform POLAND HAS reacted with alacrity to the restoration of internal zloty convertibility and the throwing open of foreign trade to private entrepreneurs. A sharp increase in foreign trade has been one of the most tangible signs of economic change throughout the first 30 months of the country's reform programme. Imports as a percentage of gross domestic product, for example, have risen from 13.6 per cent in 1989 to 22.8 per cent last year while exports almost doubled from 9.2 per cent of GDP in the last year of the old regime to 15.3 per cent. The government is now banking on a further increase in exports this year to help break the back of a domestic recession which has seen industrial production in the state sector drop by more than 40 per cent. The fragile coalition government which emerged after elections last October signalled its intention to make exports more competitive by dropping the former policy of maintaining an overvalued zloty as an 'anchor' against inflation and a means of opening monopolistic domestic producers to the chill winds of competition. The shift began with a 17 per cent devaluation last May coupled with the introduction of a crawling peg system which allowed the currency to devalue by 1.8 per cent a month in the autumn. This was followed by a 12 per cent devaluation in February this year. As a result exports rose 5.7 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn between January and April while imports dropped 15 per cent to 3.7bn in the same period. This has turned a Dollars 269m trade deficit over the first four months of 1991 into a surplus of Dollars 612m this year, over four times the Dollars 153m surplus registered over 1991 as a whole. The speedy response to market signals is largely a reflection of the pace with which private entrepreneurs moved into an arena which used to be the preserve of lumbering state-controlled foreign trade companies. Private traders handled more than half last year's imports and 20 per cent of exports. At the same time trade shifted radically away from the former Soviet trading bloc Comecon area. Three years ago over a third of Polish trade was with the Comecon countries. Last year this had shrunk to a mere 17 per cent while the share of trade with European Community markets has soared from from 32 to 55 per cent. In a few cases however the shift to dollar payments for trade formerly conducted in the now defunct 'transferable' rouble has in fact increased trade. While neighbouring Czechoslovakia paid roubles for coal it stayed at the back of the queue despite the fact that the Polish mines were only a few kilometres away from the consuming Czech power stations and steel plants. Now the Czechs pay in dollars, however, sales from Poland's Silesian coal mines have risen from 1.4m tonnes in 1989 to 830,000 tonnes already in the first four months this year. Meanwhile Poland's ever-closer trading links with the European Community have caused a fog of confusion to descend on the details of the country's trade. To blame is the Single Administrative Document introduced by Polish customs in January and modelled on documents in use throughout the EC and the European Free Trade Association. Form-filling errors on a massive scale have led the statistical office to withhold foreign trade data until all the returns can be checked. The statistics are expected to reveal however that imports of consumer goods from the EC have dropped sharply this year. The lower zloty has increased the incentive for Polish entrepreneurs to produce such items domestically on sophisticated imported machines. The weaker zloty has also increased the competitiveness of exports such as steel products, already up 43 per cent last year. The risk here is that further Polish export penetration could trigger safeguard clauses and reverse the free-trade promises held out by last year's association agreement between the EC and the three central European countries-Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The survival of Poland's steel industry is becoming more and more dependent on exports which accounted for a quarter of the 9.8m tonnes of rolled steel produced in 1990 rising to 38 per cent of last year's lower output of 8.1m tonnes. Textiles and above all agricultural products are the other sensitive area with the EC but the present association agreement, with its commitment to a dismantling of barriers to trade in industrial goods by the end of the century, leaves most of the farming questions to further talks next year. But, according to Mr Witold Pereta, the head of Animex, a privatised meat and animal trader, Brussels need not worry as Poland's ailing agriculture may not even be able to supply the permitted quotas. 'In 1993 Poland will be permitted to sell 7,200 tonnes of mutton into the EC. But with the drop in our sheep population I think we'll have problems in finding that amount,' he says. Production costs at home are also so high that Animex is no longer exporting its Krakus brand ham to the US but is producing it under licence near Philadelphia in a company a quarter owned by the Polish group. Meanwhile, signature of the EC association agreement has made Prague, Warsaw and Budapest realise that trade barriers among themselves could soon be higher than with the Community. Accordingly talks are in train to liberalise trade within the triangle and bring it in line with the EC agreement. Such developments however are making the Americans uneasy at the prospect of facing new barriers in central Europe. The US has already protested against tariffs introduced last year to dampen rising imports and protect foreign currency reserves. American exporters argue that they are being discriminated against in favour of the EC. But Germany, Poland's main supplier and market, is only a few hours truck ride away for Polish traders and Poland's economic integration with the EC is expected to deepen by the year. This is in spite of the enormous political importance attached to attracting investment from and trade with the US and a long-term belief that Poland will also be well-placed to benefit from the eventual economic regeneration of the former Soviet Union.</p>

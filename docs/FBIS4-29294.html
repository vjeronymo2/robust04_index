			<p>BFN     [Text] Denpasar, Bali, June 16 (OANA-ANTARA) --  Negotiations between Indonesia and the U.S. on quotas for  textiles and textile products held here last week have suffered  only a temporary setback, an industry and trade official has  said.    "With the adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), the quota system, which is against the spirit of  GATT, will certainly be scrapped," Assistant to the coordinating  minister for industry and trade Kosim Gandataruna said in Nusa  Dua (Bali) Wednesday.    After closing the 10th convention of the International  Apparel Federation (IAF) here, he said: "If the negotiations  have become stalled because of certain problems, this will not  last for longer than a decade."    He said that in the short-term Indonesia's exports of  textile  and textile products to the U.S. will continue despite the  failure of negotiations.    In reply to a question asking why the U.S. stubbornly  maintained its uncompromising stance during the negotiations, he  said that the U.S. side continues to link trade with, among  other things, human rights practices in Indonesia.</p>

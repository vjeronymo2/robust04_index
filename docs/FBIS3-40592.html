			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aftab Ali: "Murtaza Bhutto's Political Position </F> and Public Support"]    [Text] Dear readers, there are workers of the PPP [Pakistan  People's Party] among you, and there are those who support the  People's Party. Some of you are followers, and some of you who  oppose it are also readers of the daily MUSAWAT. Therefore, an  issue that requires a lot of contemplation is being presented to  you all men and women. You will remember that until the fall of  the Nawaz Sharif government, for about 14 years, the late Mr.  Bhutto's son, Murtaza Bhutto, was declared responsible for about  90 percent of all terrorist activities, as the founder and  leader of the al-Zulfiqar organization. All efforts were made to  accuse Murtaza Bhutto and the al-Zulfiqar organization of every  political assassination, relentless firing incident, and bomb  blast. In this context, the so-called independent communications  media also played a condemnable role, and declared Murtaza  Bhutto, the founder of a terrorist organization, al-Zulfiqar, a  dangerous traitor and enemy of society. Some of them tried to  prove all this, and, at times, they accused Madam Benazir Bhutto  of protecting al-Zulfiqar. Madam Bhutto has always denied this,  and has expressed her contempt for violence in politics. The  communications media always presented the activities of the  so-called al-Zulfiqar with large headings and in several  columns. When news about the denial of such efforts was made  available, and those PPP members were honorably acquitted by the  court, they were published in the newspaper in an obscure  manner. Now this same communications media and bureaucracy are  going through a revolutionary change. The communications media  that was always in the forefront for assassinating Murtaza  Bhutto's character is publishing news even when Murtaza Bhutto  sneezes, as if it has been a heavy blow to the nation. After  all, Murtaza Bhutto is the son of the martyred Bhutto. He is  also Nusrat Bhutto's son and Madam Benazir Bhutto's brother.  Now, even news about the laughing and crying of his wife, Ghanui  Murtaza, and his son, Zulfiqar Murtaza, are being printed on the  front page. We can say to the media about this sudden change:  "Oh, camel, do you have any part of your body straight?"  However, just presenting this proverb is not enough. This is a  very deep and dangerous game, and many masked players are  involved in it. These are the same elements that have always  tried to destroy the PPP and have wanted to topple its national  position, so that they could gain their group and personal  interests. They wanted to destroy this party totally. At first,  they targeted this party and its leaders using al-Zulfiqar, and  when all their illegal efforts failed to end the party's unity  and national status, they declared the party to be controlled by  a dynasty. They still failed. They then declared this a party of  Sindh and the Sindhi people. The unity of the party workers all  over the country did not allow them to succeed in their efforts.  Those same faces want to play the same dangerous game in the  name of Murtaza Bhutto. The readers must remember that Nawaz  Sharif used to target Murtaza Bhutto in his meetings in Punjab.  He used to repeat the accusations levied against him, and try to  prove that Benazir Bhutto was politically associated with  Murtaza Bhutto, in order to hurt Benazir's position in Punjab.  He also declared Murtaza Bhutto an enemy of the country. At the  same time, when he would go to Sindh, he asked Murtaza Bhutto's  uncle, Mumtaz Bhutto, for cooperation and agreement. He also  announced starting of Murtaza Bhutto's election campaign. Even  before the government had taken back its accusations against  Mumtaz Bhutto, his identity card was issued, and at the same  time, his nomination papers were approved. The late Mr. Bhutto's  election symbol, "a fist," was also given to him. Dear readers,  we do not mind Murtaza Bhutto's return to the country, his  running for election, or the fact that he has formed a separate  committee with a separate symbol. These are all good things.  Murtaza Bhutto has the right to return to Pakistan, and as a  Pakistani, he has the right to run for election. He also has the  right to form a separate organization. However, Murtaza Bhutto  has not decided how to use all these rights, and who will  cooperate with him now. Have not these people opposed his  father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, in the past? Have not they been  involved in a dangerous conspiracy against Benazir Bhutto and  his father's party? We are sure that this has happened  continuously, and this is evident from Murtaza Bhutto's actions.  For example, Mumtaz Bhutto has separated from his supporter,  Sabak Majid, and entered the political arena. Sabak Majid was a  spokesperson for the party's bitter enemy, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and  was almost a "martyr" in his anti-Benazir efforts. He did not  even get a taste of a false case against him, as Benazir Bhutto,  her associates and supporters, and her husband, Aasif Zardari,  did. Some of them had to suffer in jails and be separated from  their children and wives. All these are important instruments  for strengthening a nation's foundation. Let us think for a  second. Mir Murtaza Bhutto is elected from two National Assembly  election districts and six or seven state election districts.  (This is not possible, though.) The first thing to note here is  that he will have to give up either the national or the state  assembly membership. He will have to resign from all the state  assemblies he is elected to and keep one National Assembly seat.  This way, by representing Murtaza, he will not only act against  Benazir, but also fulfill his efforts of 14 years against  Murtaza's late father's party. Second, Mumtaz Bhutto is a  non-political person, whose non-political and irresponsible  actions made the citizens of Sindh hate the PPP. Because of his  non-political actions, the PNA [Pakistan National Alliance]  campaign in Sindh emerged against the late Mr. Bhutto. In  addition, after having Mr. Bhutto hanged, Mumtaz Bhutto showed  his deplorable and condemnable cowardice by becoming quiet. In  other words, he established a front to sabotage Bhuttoism.  Finally, we would like to request that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, if he  is elected or loses the election in his political effort,  through the people's support or lack thereof, must do his  political duty. Dear readers, you and I know that Murtaza Bhutto  is the son of the late Mr. Bhutto and Mrs. Nusrat Bhutto, and is  Benazir Bhutto's brother. He had been leading a life of  self-imposed exile for a long time. His politics have been the  politics of crooks. Therefore, instead of popular support, he  has the support of a group only. Second, the former governments  had always given him bad publicity. Therefore, he failed to get  popular support. He had not done any public service. All he did  was impose exile on himself, and had one member or another of  his Shaheed Committee run for the National Assembly. In this  situation, Murtaza Bhutto should consider that if he wins two  seats, then he will either be a rolling stone in the National  Assembly, will play the role of a second-class politician, or  will become the victim of horse-trading. He will be unable to  form an important role for himself. He will always have the  opposition of the members of his late father's party, because he  will be running against them. The second fact is that if he  gives up his seat in the National Assembly and maintains a seat  in the state assembly, even if six or seven other seats remain  with his supporters, then Mir Murtaza Bhutto should ask himself:  "In this large house, if the other party has the majority, will  I sit with the opposition party?" Just like other pro-MQM  [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] people, where every party has two or  four members, will he also become a toy in the hands of the MQM  or the Nawaz group with his seven members? That is what happened  to Jam-i Sadiq, Muzaffer Shah, and the Jatoi groups in the past.  He must think about all the facts and find out if he would be  able to play a clear and important political role in this  situation. In our opinion, first of all, whether or not he runs  for election, and whether he wins or loses, he should request  that the courts pardon all the cases against him. After he is  excused from all these accusations, he should then come to the  people. He should work toward providing stability to the  government, and should serve the nation and the people, as his  martyred father wanted. He should cooperate with his sister,  Benazir Bhutto. He should free himself from such nonpolitical  people as Mumtaz Bhutto and corrupt people like Sabaq Majid. If,  after Benazir relinquishes politics, he wants to lead the party  in the future, then he should first work as a party member. He  should establish his place in the party. He should get out of  corrupt politics, and should think about the nation, the people,  and the world. He should adopt moderation and prudence in his  politics. All this can be attained. He should attain it when he  gives up the Shaheed Committee and joins the party of the  martyr. He should give up the symbol of "fist" and take up the  symbol of the "arrow," because an arrow has a much farther reach  than a fist.</p>

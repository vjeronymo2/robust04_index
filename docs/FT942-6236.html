			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Danes question subsidies for E German shipyard Denmark is to take up with the European Commission complaints by the Association of Danish Shipbuilders over the level of subsidies to the MTW shipyard at Wismar in eastern Germany. The Danes fear that subsidies to MTW (now owned by Bremer Vulkan of west Germany) and other yards in former East Germany will put their own yards out of business. Under the terms of a 1992 European Council agreement MTW was allowed to receive DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) from the EU - DM1bn in investment subsidies and DM600m as an operating subsidy covering the three years 1994-1996. The final tranche of the latter was paid last month. A condition of the operating subsidy was that it should comprise a maximum of 36 per cent of 'normal turnover' for the period. Danish shipbuilders claim that the turnover will in fact be much lower than envisaged at the time of the agreement, elevating the subsidy as a share of turnover to a much higher level. The Danes point out that other European shipyards are not allowed receive a subsidy of more than 9 per cent, and that a serious effort is under way by member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to agree on abolishing shipbuilding subsidies altogether. They believe the Wismar yard is too big to be able to operate profitably.</p>

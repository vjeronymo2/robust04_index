			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Steward complains of change in status UNTIL July, Mr Roger Weston was paid by Royal Mail to negotiate full-time on behalf of about 2,000 members of the UCW postal workers' union in and around Reading. Now he drives a van, delivering parcels, and spends only 12 hours a week on the problems of about 180 colleagues in the delivery section of his depot. The decline of the full-time shop steward is one aspect of the shrinking influence of unions, highlighted in the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey. Previously, as a full-time UCW branch official, Mr Weston was responsible for sorting out a host of matters - from disciplinary issues to disagreements over rotas - on behalf of all three Royal Mail sections in his area. This year the UCW and Royal Mail concluded an industrial-relations agreement that included a revised framework for negotiating at local level. It provoked a restructuring of the union's branches, with the relationship between the union and the employer forged at the workplace level rather than at branch level. 'My responsibilities are the same and I still have use of an office and a telephone but my role has been diminished,' says 46-year-old Mr Weston, who held his full-time post for six years. 'The men still treat me as the old Roger Weston, but my status has changed among the managers. 'For example, they tended to ask me before they made any radical changes to shift patterns. Now it's more individuals coming to me to say that their shifts have been changed and can I sort it out for them.' Mr Weston believes one of the reasons that Royal Mail had such good industrial relations was that full-time officials took the time to resolve difficulties as they arose.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by newscaster </F> Francoise Palange live in the studio -- interview was preceded  by televised report on the bombing of Sarajevo]    [Text] [Palange] Our guest tonight is Foreign Minister  Claes. Mr. Claes, there is now a feeling of helplessness; what  must be done next?    [Claes] We must admit that we are indeed helpless, but I  think that there are some limits that should never be exceeded  for ethical and moral reasons. Now, I am personally convinced  that those limits have been reached, which means this situation  must be brought to an end. But let us not forget that any  solution bears some risks, which means risks for the [Belgian]  blue helmets too. This time, something must be done. I fully  support the proposals made by Alain Juppe. On the other hand, I  do not believe in the result of the negotiations; I personally  witnessed on several occasions the signing of documents and  well, two minutes later, the pledges made were flouted.  Consequently, the "civilized world" -- if I may say -- must  make it very clear that the situation is no longer acceptable  and take actions.    [Palange] What do you mean concretely by "actions?"    [Claes] Well, air strikes and bombings are not ruled out if  the withdrawal of the Serbian troops surrounding Sarajevo -- as  Mr. Juppe requests -- cannot be achieved. The blockade of the  city and the cruelty which prevails in the region must be  brought to an end.    [Palange] This even if the Serbs -- as some people fear --  turn against the blue helmets?    [Claes] There is indeed some risk, but I know that the armed  forces have already developed plans to reduce this risk, for  example, by concentrating troops. Still, risk exists. Take the  Belgian [troops] stationed there, engineering and transport  divisions -- well, they need the protection of other troops,  otherwise they really are at risk. But again, for ethical and  moral reasons, we must intervene now.    [Palange] I now propose we take a look at the results of an  opinion poll conducted by Survey and Action, a study group which  examines the development of Belgian society, which asked the  opinion of our fellow citizens on the right of humanitarian  intervention and on the intervention of the Belgian troops in  Bosnia. [Palange reads questions and poll results]    "Is it necessary to intervene -- even militarily -- to put  an  end to conflict or protect civilians." Seventy-one percent of  the Belgian population say "yes."    "Do you think that Belgium should maintain or even reinforce  its troops in former Yugoslavia." Fifty-three percent of the  population say "yes."    "Would Belgian casualties be justified in former  Yugoslavia."  Here only 41 percent of the Belgians say "yes" and 49 percent  say "no."    "Is it necessary to bomb the [Serbian] artillery positions."  Thirty-four percent say "yes" but 59 percent say "no."    It can be seen that the results are contradictory: The  Belgians are firmly in favor of the right of humanitarian  intervention, but more than half of the people surveyed are not  ready to sacrifice human lives.    [Claes] Evidently there are enough, there is a  contradiction.  Political action means choices. At certain times, risks must  be accepted; this is the job of any politician. Personally, I  say that in the present case, values must be defended which  justify accepting some risks. [passage omitted]    [Palange] These pictures [from Sarajevo] lead me to ask Mr.  Claes a last question: Is Russia responsible for the inactivity  of the United Nations? Indeed, it is known that the Russians  are the traditional allies of the Serbs.    [Claes] It would be too easy to say so. Let us be frank,  even the Western countries could not agree on providing the UN  generals with the necessary means [for carrying out their  mission successfully]. Having said that, it is true that a  definite development has been taking place in Moscow since the  last elections. Moscow has made it known that new deliberations  by the Security Council are necessary for military action. The  Russian Parliament passed a resolution which supports the Serbs.  So, I understand that the United States hesitates to convene a  new meeting of the Security Council. This allows me to say that  NATO will meet first. I suppose there will be unanimity here at  NATO, and I hope this unanimity within NATO will prompt the  Russians to ponder the issue before they oppose dramatic  measures against the Serbs in the Security Council.    [Palange] And when will this NATO meeting take place?    [Claes] In the next few days. It will be a meeting at the  ambassadorial level.    [Palange] Thank you Mr. Claes for answering our questions.</p>

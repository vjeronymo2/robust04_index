			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / BTR close to Pounds 100m investment in China BTR, the industrial holding company, is expected today to announce a Pounds 100m investment in mainland China via its Australian subsidiary, BTR Nylex. The company is planning a move into the country's bottling industry, which is failing to meet national demands at a time when beer production is forecast to overtake that in Australia. A BTR executive said the company's investment was expected to be at least ADollars 200m (Pounds 93m) during three to five years. This is a substantial direct investment in China, where foreign companies' involvement has to date been modest. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, has been travelling in Hong Kong and southern China during the past week and was expected yesterday to be signing completion documents in Guangzhou, southern China. Mr Norman Ireland, the group's new chairman who has just taken over from Sir Owen Green, BTR's founder chairman, said he was unable to comment until an announcement had been made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He expected a statement would be made in the UK today. The deal would fit in with the conglomerate's strategy for Asia - BTR Nylex last week announced a ADollars 115m deal in Indonesia for its wholly-owned Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company subsidiary. When Sir Owen was asked by a shareholder at BTR's annual meeting last week if he was planning to expand into Asia he reportedly said: 'Watch this space. If you are patient the question you ask will be answered in a very full and satisfactory way.' Further signals of an impending deal were picked up by financial analysts when Carlton United Breweries, a subsidiary of the Australian Foster's lager group, last week signed a brewery deal in China. Foster's USDollars 7m (Pounds 5m) agreement with the state-owned Princess Brewery in Guangdong province, south China, is part of an anticipated USDollars 140m involvement by the end of this century in a network of breweries across the country. Foster's expects to sign a further agreement soon in northern China and anticipates that within five years it will produce more beer in China than in Australia. BTR Nylex is a big supplier to Carlton in Australia and the company's presence in China would be reassuring to the Australian brewer.</p>

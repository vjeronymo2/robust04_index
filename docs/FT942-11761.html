			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;L arm takes majority of Orsan Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, yesterday announced that it is to sell its majority holding in Orsan, a food additives producer, to Amylum of Belgium, a subsidiary of Tate and Lyle, for FFr414m. The sale is part of Lafarge Coppee's strategy of withdrawing from the bio-technology sector and effectively marks the end of this area of diversification. It will also reduce Lafarge Coppe's borrowings by about FFr1bn, following the transfer of debts to the Belgian company. Orsan is involved in the manufacture of amino acids from starch and the production of monosodium glutamate from molasses. It has an industrial alliance with Ajinomoto of Japan, which holds 20 per cent of Orsan's shares. Under the terms of the deal, Lafarge Coppee's Copabio division is to sell its 61 per cent holding for FFr210 per share. This compares with a price of FFr237 per share when Orsan was suspended on Monday.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: For sale, lives of loneliness - Solitary souls might like a taste of island life IT TAKES a very special type of person to carve a life on an island. Resourcefulness is the prime requirement as I discovered when last visiting Ramsey, 625 acres off St David's Head, west Wales, more than 11 years ago. There I met the sole inhabitant, 19-year-old Tom Sutton, whose daily routine included collecting driftwood for the fire, mending the radio or generator, treating a goat for mastitis and nursing an injured peregrine. On Ramsey, as with all small kingdoms, one is both liberated and imprisoned; I remember Tom telling me that he sometimes dreamed of steak and chips as he watched the lights of the mainland during long winter evenings; but he just turned up the volume on his Gilbert and Sullivan records and got on with the chores. The island is now for sale again. Tom does not live there any more but he still takes control of the bird counts, including the chough and that harbinger of spring, the wheatear. Ramsey's sole inhabitant for much of the year is Sue Ward, whose grown-up family lives on the mainland across the treacherous Ramsey sound where tidal currents are so strong that white water boils around and over the sharp pinnacles of rock known locally as The Bitches. Ramsey is one of a host of islands that have come on to the market. Many are off the Scottish coast, where islanders sow and reap according to the season, their daily lives ordered by the sun. Islands are cheap today, although not quite the bargains they seemed before the second world war when places such as Tanera Mhor, the largest of the wild and beautiful Summer Isles near Ullapool, changed hands for Pounds 1 an acre. Today, both Ramsey and the 800-acre Tanera Mhor can be bought for considerably less than Pounds 1,000 an acre. Both have solid, comfortable houses and good outbuildings. Humberts has invited offers of Pounds 550,000 for Ramsey and Savills, which has been seeking a buyer for Tanera Mhor for more than three years, has reduced the guide price from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 450,000 (there is a rental income from a fishing enterprise of Pounds 45,000 a year). As usual, the sale of an island generates many inquiries; several parties have expressed interest in Ramsay and a sale is expected soon. Savills reported considerable interest in the 3,400-acre Scottish isle of Gigha (pronounced Ghia), for which offers of more than Pounds 2m were being sought. In 1989, I flew there by helicopter, skimming across Arran and the Kintyre peninsular to land in the middle of Sir James Horlick's rhododendron garden. Some of the 160 inhabitants have never felt the need to leave the island; most have several jobs, including Seamus McSporran whose 14 include postman, fireman, harbour master, policeman and undertaker. Gigha - which has a tiny satellite, Cara, populated only by otters, seals, wild goats and birds - has six farms, a fish farm, an award-winning hotel (closed at present) and a small golf course. The buyer also inherits a baronial title. Step forward Derek Holt and his wife who have just paid the asking price to the owner, the Interallianz Bank of Zurich. The Holts own Holt Leisure Parks based in Greenock, near Glasgow. Their daughter and her husband - both with tourism and farming experience - will live with their baby in Achamore House, the island's main residence. A new career awaits whoever chooses to live on Arran, 'the peaked island' off the Ayrshire coast dominated by Goat Fell. In a tranquil, wooded valley beside a rushing stream, Ronald Stewart and his wife, Barbara, built a splendid business at the Lagg hotel. Now they have new plans and the hotel and its 15 acres, plus consent for 10 four-bedroom houses, is being offered through Glasgow solicitor Turner MacFarlane Green, with a guide price of Pounds 550,000. Still in the Western Isles, Strutt and Parker is selling most of Rona's 1,600 acres of rugged and beautiful land; only 142 acres owned by the Defence Research Agency is not included. The guide price for this little kingdom, between Skye and the mainland, is just Pounds 200,000. One of the most beautiful of all islands is Garinish, 57 acres in the Kenmare estuary off Ireland's County Kerry. The island and its six-bedroom house, plus 30 acres and a pier on the mainland, are being offered by Knight Frank and Rutley with Dominic Daly of Cork; the guide price is IPounds 1.2m. Knight Frank and Rutley also is seeking a buyer for Lihou, the smallest inhabited Channel Island off the coast of Guernsey. The guide price is Pounds 850,000. Across in Alderney, also famed for its wild flowers and colonies of gannets, John D. Wood is selling the home of John Arlott, the late cricket commentator. The house is chiefly 19th century, bounded by a high wall giving shelter and privacy. The guide price is Pounds 650,000. Other islands for sale include Spit Sand fort, one of four built in the Solent in the 1860s to defend Portsmouth. The fort, with 15 ft walls, 50 rooms and a maze of passages, was offered for Pounds 675,000 last summer; Humberts says it will consider any reasonable offer. Friday island, on the Thames, is offered by Hamptons. Just downstream from Old Windsor lock. There is a little cottage there, but some work is required. The price was reduced recently to Pounds 125,000. Osea island, in the Blackwater estuary, near Maldon, Essex, was bought in 1906 by Frederick Charrington, of brewery fame, after he saw a young mother pleading with her drunken husband for money to feed their children. Charrington set up a temperance community on the mile-long island. The house and chapel has been converted into five houses and seven flats. Savills offers them for between Pounds 57,000 and Pounds 140,000, with the assurance that new owners can drink without let or hindrance.</p>

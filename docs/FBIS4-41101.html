			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marat Salimov report: "The Regions Have Created an Oil </F> Cartel"]    [Text] The Association for Economic Interaction of Russian  Oil and Gas Producing Regions yesterday approved its charter.  The oil and gas union sets some fairly ambitions goals. They  include the upholding of sectoral interests within the country  and moving towards OPEC on the foreign market.    Although there were original fears that the creation of the  Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas  Producing Regions could be hindered by the contradictions which  exist between the regions, a decision to form it was made after  all. The new association's weight is enhanced by the fact that  Fuel and Energy Ministry Yuriy Shafranik has been elected its  president for a year. Therefore the association has ensured  itself direct access to the prime minister and the president,  which is a direct prerequisite for successful lobbying activity.  According to the association's initiators -- deputies from oil  producing regions and directors of fuel and energy enterprises  -- the organization will make it possible to actively stand up  to the budget favorites of the legislative bodies and the  government: the agrarian sector and the social sphere. Although  it is an open secret that the fuel and energy complex is the  milk cow for both these sectors of the national economy as well  as for the state sector, ensuring 60 percent of Russian exports  and 40 percent of hard currency budget revenues: With needs of  7.1 trillion rubles, it has received 1.1 trillion in state  investments.    However, apart from the functions traditional for such  associations (getting money from the budget), the association is  laying claim to something more. Under its charter, in addition  to direct influence on state economic policy in the energy  sphere, its tasks include coordination of the regions' activity  in producing, processing, pricing, and marketing oil and gas  products. The possibilities for performing these functions are  ensured by the association's composition, which includes  representatives of Russia's major oil and gas producing regions:  Tyumen, Tomsk, Orenburg, and Sakha Oblasts, Khanty-Mansi and  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs, and the republics of Bashkiria,  Komi, and Tatarstan.    Therefore in the event that agreement is reached between the  regions, the association will be able to set monopoly prices for  oil and gas products both on the domestic and the CIS market.  The essence of its lobbying activity in the Federal Assembly  and the government will be to make sure that in the absence of  requisite budgetary support, no antimonopoly sanctions are  applied against the sector's enterprises. The rationale behind  the pricing activity can be very simple: The oil and gas  complex has to resolve its financial problems with available  market methods, and price control is a forced measure. Besides,  the association will have a chance to join the well-known OPEC  cartel, which establishes world oil prices, as a nongovernment  organization. The association's charter says directly that at  the first stage the task is to ensure participation in OPEC as  an observer. In the event that OPEC membership is secured,  Russian regions will have guaranteed access to the world market  and will therefore not need to maintain the volume of export  deliveries at the expense of price concessions. So, the  Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas  Producing Regions presumably can become the first Russian oil  cartel with all the inherent functions.</p>

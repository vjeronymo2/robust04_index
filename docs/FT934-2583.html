			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (4): Power with responsibility - Security and moderation are the Saudi aim Whatever the short-term pressures on Saudi Arabia's oil policy, the kingdom appears determined that these shall not divert the world's biggest oil exporting country from its longstanding goals of enhancing market stability, increasing integration of its upstream and downstream operations and pursuing a strategy designed to assure security of supplies at generally moderate prices. But with prices dipping in late November to a five-year low, these pressures have never been greater on the kingdom since the Gulf war, during which Saudi Arabia boosted production from 5.4m barrels a day to nearer 9m b/d to fill the void left by lost Iraqi and Kuwait production. Since then, Saudi Arabia has stubbornly clung to its expanded share of total Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries output and, despite the recent weakening of prices, refused to consider cutting output below 8m b/d, its present production. At the last ceiling-setting Opec meeting in October, however, the kingdom held its production level at 8m b/d even while allowing other members to raise their allocations to meet an expanded official level of 24.52m b/d. Some analysts interpreted this as the kingdom resuming its pre-Gulf war role as the organisation's swing producer. But Saudi officials resist the thought resolutely. 'That is not right at all,' says one. 'No short-term action on our part should be interpreted as a change of policy.' While the burdens of Saudi Arabia's budget deficit problem and the intense pressures of hard-pressed Opec colleagues have combined recently to raise the importance of price in the calculus of Saudi oil policymakers - 'it's an important, key issue', says a senior official - Saudi Arabia remains committed more fundamentally to assuring that the world receives secure supplies of oil at prices which will not discourage its use in favour of other energy sources. Accordingly, the kingdom has proceeded apace with expansion plans at Saudi Aramco which will see the world's biggest integrated oil company capable of sustained production of 10m b/d by the middle of next year. Present ceiling capacity, according to Aramco staff in Dhahran, lies at around 9.4m b/d. Much of the initial de-bottlenecking which allowed for the expansion was undertaken during the surge to boost output during the Gulf war, accelerating plans laid before the conflict. Costlier work to bring on stream new fields south of Riyadh, notably the super light crudes in the Hawtah field, will be complete by next year. The total cost of the expansion will be around Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17bn according to Aramco staff. Exploration is also continuing, with Aramco concentrating on areas around the western province and the Red Sea coastal plain. 'We're essentially going back to areas explored first in the 30s and 40s with better technology,' says an Aramco official. But it was another event this year which consolidated Aramco's position as perhaps the world's biggest oil group. The company could already boast being the world's biggest exporter and its custodianship of the kingdom's 258bn barrels of recoverable crude gives it unchallenged reserves - more than a quarter of the world's known oil. In June, however, the government announced Aramco's merger with Samarec, which was then the state-run refining and marketing arm. Although the act was entirely consistent with the kingdom's long professed policy of integrating its oil industry, both to achieve cost efficiency and to assure greater market stability, it nevertheless took industry executives by surprise. In particular, many wondered why Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, took a step which essentially eliminated Samarec as a distinct entity after having made such efforts to define the group's corporate identity. Saudi officials, however, prefer to characterise the step as simply one in a natural progression towards a fully integrated oil industry, saying that the timing was 'irrelevant' and that Samarec had always been viewed as a provisional entity. But many oil executives in the kingdom believe the move was designed to impose on the kingdom's refining and marketing operations what is universally considered to be Aramco's tighter and more efficient management ethos. 'Samarec was run like a government department not a top-notch corporation,' says a US oil official. Six months into the merger and the administrative union appears almost complete. Aramco has subsumed most of Samarec's operations into a new 'business centre' headed by Mr Abdelaziz Hokail, who headed a 100-strong task force which managed the dovetailing in July. So far, very few of Samarec's 11,000 staff have lost their jobs and those who have, say Aramco staff, have gone voluntarily. The result is to endow Aramco with a considerable addition to its refining capacity, which before the merger lay solely in the Aramco-managed 300,000 b/d Ras Tanurah refinery north of its Dhahran headquarters. Now Aramco manages the 394,000 b/d capacity at the kingdom's three domestic refineries in Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu and the kingdom's interests in the joint venture Yanbu (250,000b/d) and Jubail (240,000b/d) export refineries. It also assumes the state's interest in the 325,000 b/d Rabigh plant, jointly owned with Mr John Lakis, the Greek businessman. Aramco staff sought to stress throughout the merger that none of Samarec's current operations would be affected - a promise oil executives outside the group say has been largely honoured. However, the stamp of new Aramco management has already had a marked effect on what had been Samarec's ambitious future planning. A Dollars 4bn multi-stage plan to upgrade quality at all the previously Samarec-run refineries was immediately placed under review by the Aramco managment, and there it has remained for the time being. Foster Wheeler, the US engineering consultants who had been hired to oversee the Samarec plan, were released. Aramco officials have said only that an upgrade of some form will eventually proceed, something many in the industry agree is necessary. But to date the sole specific upgrading project is that being overseen by Brown and Root, the US engineers, to enhance quality at the Ras Tanurah plant - a Dollars 1-Dollars 1.2bn project which will be under way early next year. Meanwhile, Aramco's ambitions further to integrate its international operations took a knock in early November when long publicised plans for a Dollars 10bn joint venture refining project with a trio of Japanese oil companies fell foul of internal disagreement among the Japanese partners and was cancelled. The project would have further consolidated Aramco's aim of securing supplies of its crude to refining contracts close to its main consumer markets. The policy began in 1988 with Aramco's 50-50 venture with Texaco, creating Star Petroleum to serve markets in the US eastern seaboard. A 35 per cent share in Ssangyong, the South Korean oil group, followed in 1991 with the same intent. The Japanese deal had been seen as the next natural step. However, Saudi officials say that talks are advanced with two southeast Asian oil companies to replace the cancelled project with one of equivalent scale and scope. One of the potential partners is understood to be Nippon Oil, one of the three Japanese groups in the original consortium.</p>

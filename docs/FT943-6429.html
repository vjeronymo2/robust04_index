			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Business Travel: The anatomy of a Club Class flight - Millions of people travel business class each year. But few are aware of what goes into providing the extra services. Charles Jennings visited British Airways to explore  .. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Air-conditioning  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The air enters the cabin from the cabin side walls, above head height and below the overhead lockers, and is extracted from the side walls at floor level. There are three air-conditioning units on each 747, changing the 51,950 cubic feet of air in the entire passenger area every three minutes and keeping it at a constant temperature of about 70'F (some airlines, it is rumoured, only run two of the three air-con units at a time in order to save fuel, but at the expense of freshness). To keep it clean, the air is filtered through paper filters which are changed every 6,360 flying hours. Cigars, of course, are not allowed: no air-conditioning unit can cope with the smell.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Windows  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- These are made of three separate acrylic panes. The outer two are load carrying, while the inner is simply a protective panel. There is an air-gap between each pane. Normally, the outer pane carries the full load of pressurisation. If the outer pane should fail, the middle pane panes are designed to take at least twice the maximum normal cabin pressure on their own: equivalent to a load of over a ton on a single pane. It does not matter if the inner pane is scratched or accidentally damaged, as it does not take any pressurisation load. Thus the risk of doing a 'Goldfinger' and being sucked out at 50,000 feet is slim.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pressurisation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fresh air is drawn into the plane from ducts on the fuselage, heated and pressurised to around 8 lbs per square inch. This is equivalent to the air pressure found at the top of an 8,000ft mountain. There is no risk attached to this, but it does make it difficult to boil water (as the air pressure drops, so the temperature at which water will boil rises) and BA flights have been known to carry special cooking units for passengers who have especially requested boiled eggs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Baggage hold  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is pressurised, but not usually ventilated (unless livestock is being carried). Thus, the baggage travels throughout the flight in the air in which it took off. It is loaded in containers shaped to fit the contours of the plane, swivelled round on a platform of chrome ball-bearings which line the floor and then pushed down to the far end of the hold by rams built into the hold bulkhead. The emergency oxygen supply cylinders are also located beneath the cabin floor; the oxygen being piped up into overhead masks in the cabin.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cabin floor  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Inside the cabin, 70 square metres of carpeting are used to cover the floor of Club World, with the same area of foam underlay (principally to give passengers the impression they are walking on a thicker pile carpet then they actually are). The aisle carpets (which receive the heaviest wear) are replaced every three months; the rest have to make do with hoovering until the next major redecoration.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Seats  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are between 60 and 70 seats in the Club World section of a 747-400, all made of aluminium, with steel used at points of extra stress. The backs will recline at an angle of up to 38 degrees to the vertical, they can withstand a 9G static loading and there is no passenger heavy enough to break them. Moreover, all Club World seats were recently recovered in 17 miles' worth of wool fabric.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lifejackets  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Each seat has a lifejacket under it. These lifejackets are checked every 310 flying hours (coinciding with a particular maintenance check). To date, however, no commercial passenger jet aircraft has had to ditch into the sea. So no one has ever used the lifejackets in the circumstances for which they were designed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food facts  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food and drink consumption: The chilled food is heated in the galleys, using conventionsal fan-assisted ovens, not microwaves. In a typical year, Club World passengers will ge through 50 tonnes of lobster, 84 tonnes of salmon, 120 tonnes of beef and 2 tonnes of caviar. More prosaically, they will also use up 30 litres of mustard, 5,000 portions of cheese biscuits and 1.5m individual chocolate boxes. Club World also gets through 250,000  bottles of champagne, selected from a number of different champagne producers. On every flight, there will be nearly 3,000 items packed on to Club World trays; the chinaware is Royal Doulton.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Entertainment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The seat backs now carry individual 6in x 7in LCD colour video screens with a compensation mechanism to allow for variations in the angle of the seat back relative to the viewer. There are eight video channels, allowing for 54 hours of video per flight. The cabling for the video and audio channel control, and for the overhead light switch and call button, travels up one of the main seat legs and along a tube located across the bottom of the seat backs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hand washbasins  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- These do empty out into the air, rather than into a holding tank - the source of those myths about home counties housewives catching Beri-Beri from a passing plane. The waste water emerges through two drainpipes beneath the aircraft - one just ahead of the wings, the other at the tail. Both drainpipes are kept heated, to prevent them from freezing. 1.3m tablets of soap are used up every year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Blankets, washbags, headsets etc.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reflecting the fact that business people are more likely to be male than female, BA gives out 1,032,500 men's washbags each year; and 462 women's washbags. 63,000 blankets are used (each being washed several times before being replaced), as well as 400,000 headsets and 324,000 napkins. The equivalent  of 20 tonnes of aromatic petals go into the essentce dupplied in Club amenity bags.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lavatories  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There is one lavatory for every 18.5 passengers, each lavatory serviced by a tank holding 16 litres of water. On average, one passenger in five will produce what are known as 'solids' during a flight, approximately a quarter of a pound's worth. More generally, every passenger can expect to produce a pound of liquid during a flight, In the unlikely event that a lavatory should fill up, sensors warn the cabin crew, which then shuts the lavatory down.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food storage &amp; preparation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food is heavily chilled before loading on to the plane, then kept in special cold boxes, refigerated with dry ice. On average, a 747 long-haul flight will be loaded with a total of 4.5 tonnes of food and drink (or 61,000 individual items) before take-off. The food itself is prepared for BA by its own in-house long-haul catering unit at Heathrow  -Catering Centre South; the largest kitchen in Europe. The contents of the basic menu selection change every three months, but at any given time, there are 180 different menus in circulation, each tailored to regional differences in language, culture and diet.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Holding tanks  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The waste material is sucked down the lavatory by a vacuum system, passed along a pipe, and is collected in four holding tanks at the rear of the plane. Older 747s use 'recirculating toilets' in which the waste matter is broken down by powerful chemicals and the resulting blue water is reused to flush the lavatories. At the end of the flight, the holding tanks are pumped out by a special ground vehicle. To cope with all this activity, Club World gets through just under 1m rolls of lavatory paper a year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: British Airways  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DELIVERING THE NEW YEAR BABY  </P> <P> To use such a precious gift as birth and turn it into a trivial contest of  who's first leaves me to question the ethics of not only Dr. Turner Jr., but of  the parents of newborn Myra Palmer.  </P> <P> Dr. Turner stated "I knew God had a hand in it." If God had a hand in it he  would have used it to slap Turner's face and bring him to his senses!  </P> <P> JOEY R. KRYS  </P> <P> Orange Parks Acres  </P></p>

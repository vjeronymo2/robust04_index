			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hutchison raises HKDollars 4.5bn HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday said it had raised HKDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 582m) through a placement of 250m shares at HKDollars 18.3 each. The company said the funds would be used to finance its expansion in China and its telecommunications business in Britain. The placement was effected at a 5 per cent discount to yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 19.3. Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison's group managing director, said that on the mainland the company had investments in port development in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, as well as power station construction. He said the funds would also be used in the UK where its 65 per cent owned telecommunications subsidiary has a large capital expenditure programme. Analysts estimate that Hutchison needs to spend more than Pounds 300m over the next two years. The Hong Kong business community has been expecting Hutchison to come to the market for funds for some time. Cheung Kong, Mr Li's flagship in Hong Kong, took 100m shares of the placement to maintain his 40 per cent interest in the company; the remaining 150m shares were placed with investors. The capital raising should help Hutchison's balance sheet. According to Crosby Securities, Hutchison's net debt rose to HKDollars 13.1bn in 1992 from HKDollars 5.3bn in 1990.</p>

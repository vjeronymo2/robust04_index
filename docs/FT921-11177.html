			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Tees &amp; Hartlepool port chief leaves job MR JOHN HACKNEY, chief executive of Tees &amp; Hartlepool port, yesterday cleared his desk after accepting defeat in the acrimonious battle over the port's privatisation. In a letter to the authority's workforce, Mr Hackney said that he and the rest of the management-employee buy-out team had abandoned their plan to seek a judicial review of the government's decision to sell the port to a consortium called Teesside Holdings. 'Having analysed the situation carefully, my colleagues and I, together with our financial backers, have concluded that a challenge is no longer a practical proposition,' he said. Mr Hackney's departure - along with that of Mr Charles Wellington, company secretary - came as Teesside Holdings formally completed the purchase of the port and sent in its own chief executive, Mr John Holloway. The company refused to discuss on what terms Mr Hackney had left. Teesside Holdings is a three-way venture between Powell Duffryn, the quoted industrial group; Humberside Holdings, an unquoted associate of Powell Duffryn; and 3i, the venture capital group. The selection of the consortium brought strong protests because it was neither the highest bidder nor the one offering the greatest degree of employee participation. Maritime Transport Services, the Thamesport container terminal operator that bid for the port, said the outcome had led it to question its involvement in bidding for any of the other 14 trust ports due for privatisation. Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough and an outspoken critic of the result, has won an adjournment debate on the issue for Wednesday.</p>

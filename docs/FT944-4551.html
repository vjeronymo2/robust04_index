			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Foreign stake in Garuda sell-off The Indonesian government plans to sell a stake in the state-owned Garuda to a foreign airline before shares in the national flag carrier are sold to the public on the stock market. Finance ministry officials said this would help Garuda to restructure its operations and reduce dependency on government-sponsored commercial loans to fund its business. President Suharto has approved the plan but the government has not yet set out a schedule for Garuda's privatisation, or decided how large a stake to sell and whether a foreign airline will hold a majority stake.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Fiat bruised at crucial time: Arrests have added to the group's problems FIAT, the flag bearer of Italian industry, has begun a delicate damage limitation exercise to offset the impact on the group of the continued imprisonment of Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, its chief financial officer. Mr Mattioli has been held in a Milan jail since February 22 when he was arrested with Mr Antonio Mosconi, chief executive of Toro, Fiat's insurance arm, for alleged illicit funding of political parties. They are being detained in connection with their previous roles on the board of Cogefar-Impresit, the Turin-based group's construction company. Last May Mr Enzo Papi, then Cogefar-Impresit's managing director, was imprisoned for 55 days by Milan magistrates and only released after confessing to the payment of a L1.8bn (Pounds 785,000) bribe for a Milan metro contract. Mr Papi, who resigned from Cogefar-Impresit, has been questioned again in recent days. Fiat management on Tuesday declared the group's full solidarity for the two imprisoned executives and called for their fate to be clarified as quickly as possible. It said it was concerned that 'this judicial affair, because of the resort to preventive detention and uncontrolled dissemination of restricted information before any sentence, affects the reputation of these people and the image of the company at a moment when it is directing all its energies to provide jobs and be competitive'. Whatever the outcome of the arrests, Fiat has been bruised at a crucial time. Mr Guiseppe Turani, Italy's best known writer on corporate affairs, commented after the arrests: 'Fiat has been hit by Milan magistrates at perhaps the most delicate moment in its history, or at least during that period which began almost 30 years ago when the 'Avvocato' (Giovanni Agnelli) became president.' The Fiat group, with its core business in the automotive sector, is confronted by three vital challenges: to produce successful new models; to forge new international alliances; and to produce an effective management structure to cope with the departure next year of Mr Agnelli. The challenges have already increased because of the downturn in Fiat's main markets and Mr Agnelli's forecasts of a bleak 1993. On top of this, the group can scarcely afford damage to its reputation or instability in Italy, which accounts for 44 per cent of car sales, nor lose the services of Mr Mattioli. Mr Mattioli, aged 52, has been with Fiat since 1975 and has worked closely with Mr Cesare Romiti, the group's chief executive. Last November he was promoted in a management shake-up designed to prepare the way for the departure of Mr Agnelli who has said he intends to step down in June next year. He is to be succeeded by his brother Mr Umberto Agnelli. The management structure was slimmed down and split in effect into two broad sectors - industry and industrial development under Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and financial control and resource management under Mr Mattioli. Mr Garuzzo and Mr Mattioli reported to Mr Romiti who has also hinted he will step down at about the same time as Mr Agnelli. In Turin Mr Garuzzo and Mr Mattioli were both tipped as possible successors to Mr Romiti. In any event Mr Mattioli has had the task of managing resources against declining profits (forecast for 1992 at half the L1,609bn of 1991) and the need to find resources to fund investment of L47,000bn during the rest of the decade. The prospect of Fiat raising cash by selling some of its non-core activities such as Rinascente, the stores group, or even Toro insurance and the Cogefar-Impresit, has helped push Fiat shares up steeply since the beginning of the year. Also fuelling the rise have been rumours of talks about a new alliance on the car side. Last week Mr Agnelli specifically ruled out the Japanese but was silent about the possibility of a European partner. The Milan bourse rumour mill says the price is being talked up to make Fiat shares more attractive for an alliance. A tie-up with Renault is mentioned. Renault has denied this as it already has its hands full with Volvo, and Fiat says an alliance now when it is investing so heavily in new models makes no sense. But the shares are still rising - despite the impact of the arrests. This suggests foreign institutional buying of the shares in the belief Fiat will benefit from devaluation and from its new models due when, as it is hoped, the market picks up next year. Fiat will need luck and good management. The Italian business community is watching closely how long Mr Mattioli is kept in jail and whether he can emerge unscathed. As Mr Agnelli put it last week: 'Being caught up with the magistrature is always worrying. 'It's a bit like being on the operating table - one hopes it will all go well but there is always a risk.'</p>

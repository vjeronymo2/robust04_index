			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: A reception and private preview of 94 works of art from  director/screenwriter/producer Billy Wilder's collection, which go on the  auction block Nov. 13 at Christie's New York. The Beverly Hills Hotel's Crystal  Ballroom was jammed with paintings, people and paparazzi. Picasso's "Head of a  Woman," which previously hung over the fireplace in Billy and Audrey Wilder's  apartment, drew intense scrutiny, as it carries the sale's top estimate of $5  million to $7 million. Not to be missed were paintings by Miro, Balthus, Braque  and Klee. Wilder was the epitome of cool; he drank a Heineken and mingled.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Art-that-got-away war stories. The Giacometti that could have been  had for $3,500, but of course that was 30 years ago. Balthuses went for a song  in the '60s and now look at them. Also, talk about the Wilder estimates. They  were insane. They were fair. The name alone made people come running.  </P> <P> Who Was There: A little bit Hollywood, a little bit Hancock Park. From  Christie's Christopher Burge and Terry Stanfill; also, Robert and Vivian Rowan,  Cesar Romero and Lee Minnelli, Ann Miller, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams,  designers David Hayes, Luis Estevez and Gus Tassell, David Begelman, Walter  Matthau, Jerry and Lois Magnin, Shirley and Isadore Familian, Michael Chow,  Father Maurice Chase, Norman and Lyn Lear, Marcia Weisman, Tina Sinatra, Nathan  and Marion Smooke, Wendy Goldberg, Jerry Moss, Joanna Poitier, Jo Ann and  Julian Ganz, Sammy Cahn, Armand and Harriet Deutsch, Jackie Collins, Maurice  Tuchman, Henry and Jayne Berger, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Stephanie Barron and  Robert Rifkind, Ginny and Henry Mancini, Fred and Janet de Cordova, Karen  Gould, Susan and Peter Strauss.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: Proverbial cocktail attire, i.e. pearls and pinstripes. David  Hockney, as usual, made his own fashion statement in chinos, dirty bucks, work  shirt, blazer and red polka dota bow tie, untied.  </P> <P> The Food: Proverbial hors d'oevres passed on trays, i.e. mushrooms stuffed with  crabmeat, cold shrimp and cocktail sauce, steak tartare. Open bar.  </P> <P> Quoted: "I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now I'd buy everything back,"  Billy Wilder announced.  </P> <P> Overheard: "The joy of collecting is when you see something you like the heart  goes boom, boom, boom."  </P> <P> Security Guard Count: 10.

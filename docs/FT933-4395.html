			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Bank challenged over regulatory powers THE BANK of England is facing the first full-scale challenge to its authority as a regulator to supervise and recommend the closure of banks in the UK. The Lord Chancellor's department has this week convened a banking appeals tribunal under the 1987 Banking Act, in what is believed to be the first instance of an institution successfully triggering a formal appeal. Bank of England officials are submitting evidence to defend their plea to a High Court judge in October last year requesting the provisional liquidation of Mount Banking, a small Asian-owned bank. The tribunal was sought by the principal shareholders in Mount, Mr N. Shah and Mr SBR Shah. Details of the tribunal are being kept secret, but the Lord Chancellor's office confirmed yesterday that a three-person tribunal had been convened this week chaired by Mr Jonathan Mance QC. The two other members are a banker and an accountant appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The office said that there had been seven or eight previous attempts at an appeal in the past 18 months, but all had been rejected at preliminary hearings attended by Mr Mance. Most were withdrawn voluntarily. The grounds for closure were doubt about whether the management of Mount was 'fit and proper' and not that it might be insolvent. Unaudited figures for the bank at March 31 this year show assets of Pounds 188.6m against liabilities of Pounds 163.4m. There are also additional provisions conservatively estimated at Pounds 10m. The members of the tribunal will have to determine whether the action taken by the Bank was justified and what measures should still be taken  - which could fall short of withdrawing its banking license. Documents circulated last month by accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick, Mount's administrators, show that Standard Chartered, the international banking group, may make a 'significant claim' against Mount believed to run to many tens of millions of dollars. Mr Andrew Milne, a solicitor with Zaiwalla &amp; Co, which is acting for Mount's owners, said the Bank of England had petitioned for closure as a result of the Standard Chartered allegations, which he claimed were 'proved completely false'. He alleged that investigators had conducted a 'fishing expedition' to justify the closure on other grounds after they found no evidence supporting the claims. Two weeks after its provisional liquidation, Mount Banking was placed in administration. Last month creditors approved a voluntary arrangement permitting a number of options for the bank's future, subject to ratification this week. Mount Banking has 3,000 depositors, who are mainly Asians resident in India and East Africa, with just a few who live in the UK.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: Italy's messy road to liberation ANALYSIS of the Italian political scene no longer consists of 'Porn star in poll victory shock.' The shocks of last Sunday's vote demand greater skills than that; but not much more in my case, for I believe it was all the fault of the Americans. More of that later. There was some cogent analysis among top Italian commentators, notably Norberto Bobbio in the Turin daily, La Stampa. He noted, pessimistically, in his pre-election forecasts that tradition was unpromising: 'The history of united Italy is constituted by a succession, not of governments and oppositions which have alternated, but of regimes whose successor has made a tabula rasa of its predecessor.' Each regime had wiped out what the former government had done and, since the second world war, there had been a single government - one of the centre. Today, though, there no longer was a centre. Perhaps, Bobbio concluded hopefully, Italy would now join 'the main highway of great democracies.' There would be a left and a right and both would be dragged towards the middle. This image of a vacuum where the centre parties used to be, and which would suck others into it, dominates the minds of Italians. The Vatican's Osservatore Romano alone was agnostic: 'The centre represents purely and simply a point of convergence of the extremes.' The Italian desire to impose physical laws on its failed system was not shared elsewhere. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, our old friend Johann-Georg Reissmuller decided that 'government standstill could follow bad government.' But what upset him, as a man of the right, was the prospect of a communist revival. He said that although the Communist party had not benefited from Italian corruption, it had received Soviet subsidies and its leaders had climbed the political ladder when the party was still loyal to Moscow. 'How can it be that broad strata could expect the political and moral regeneration of the state from such people?' Why not? The political and moral regeneration of Germany after 1945 occurred with the active participation of many who were infinitely nastier than anything the Italian Communist party might produce. In fact, the post-communist Party of the Democratic Left in Italy, which rejected the tutelage of the USSR long before its opponents rejected the embrace of organised crime, has a fair claim to join in any programme of political reconstruction. It has, after all, a good record in local government, partly because it could not participate fully in the system of bribes and kickbacks that is responsible for the present crisis. Anyway, Italy is not the only place where there is a revival of communists without any revival of communism. The implacable realities of post-communism have led to people looking again to representatives of a discredited system in those countries where a communist party has exercised power. It is not necessarily a worrying trend; almost everywhere, top former communists have done too well out of capitalism to start thinking about wrecking it. The success of the MSI is not part of what might seem to be a parallel phenomenon - the revival of fascism in countries with a communist past. The MSI got a lot of votes partly because it was not anything else. But here we come to the nub of problem: Sunday's vote was, in fact, an anachronistic revolt against history. Some months ago, I wrote that Italians do not blame outsiders for their problems. I was wrong, for those with long memories do. Perhaps one of the reasons for the success of the neo-fascist MSI was that it, too, was not only outside the corrupt network of organised crime and political cronyism but it also has anti-Mafia credentials. The predecessors of both the communists and the MSI, obviously, were targets of American hostility. In 1943, Washington made a deal with the Sicilian gangster, Lucky Luciano, to facilitate the Allied landings in Sicily, and the Mafia regained its position - as part of the coalition against Mussolini who had almost wiped it out. It prospered in that odd triangle of power constituted by the Christian Democrats, Washington and the Catholic church. Each had its own reason for tolerating the Mafia. Neither the Communist party nor the MSI played any part in the evolution of the system which the Americans brought into being in 1944 when the Allies entered Rome. So, while the other pillars of the system collapse, the Mafia will, perhaps, be put back into the bottle from which Washington released it. In Sicily itself, 75 percent of the electorate voted against the Mafia. Curious, is it not? Washington's one-time partner in Sicily faces popular rejection while its enemies on the mainland have triumphed over its cold war friends. As Bobbio said, any change in Italy wipes out the immediate past. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

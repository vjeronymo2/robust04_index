[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's advisers stressed  on Monday [28 March] that there was "nothing of concern" in this  formula which, as France and most of its partners had wanted,  keeps the blocking minority in the Council at 30 percent of the  votes. To take into account the enlargement of the European  Union [EU] to 16 members, this minority will pass from 23 votes  out of 76 to 27 out of 90 on 1 January 1995.    The compromise reached to meet the concerns of the British  and the Spanish -- the obligation to arrive at a consensus  agreement within a "reasonable time" in the event of there being  a minority of 23 to 26 votes opposing a decision -- appeared  yesterday to pose less of a problem to Paris than it had the  night before when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had considered  this arrangement to be "too imprecise." A government expert on  European issues said: "We have put into writing what is  currently the usual practice." To illustrate the artificial  nature of the debate on the voting rights, he stressed that it  is very rare that a formal vote is needed (in his opinion "10  times at most" in more than 30 years of European Council  meetings, which is probably a considerable underestimation) and  that "each time a EC state considers that a decision poses a  problem for it, either politically or economically, and even if  it stands alone in this, no decision is made."  <H5>  More Reservations in Brussels Than in Paris </H5>   Unless it is given a legal value by writing it into the EU  treaties, as London has demanded, the formalization of what was  until now simply common practice has apparently led to more  reservations in Brussels than in Paris. In the European circles  of the Belgian capital, it is suspected that the Ioannina  compromise will aggravate the risks of paralysis of the European  Council, at least until 1996 when the reform of Community  institutions begins, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.    The French Government does not underestimate this risk, but  nor does it regard it as a catastrophe. After all, a senior  French official observed, the ability of the European Council to  make decisions has only been partially altered since several  areas -- some of the most important ones -- of Council activity  are not affected by the Ioannina procedure. This notably  includes decisions relating to the budget, taxation, and trade  policy.    The European governments have until this evening to make  their feelings known on this institutional compromise. In Paris  yesterday it was hoped that no one would now block an  arrangement that had had such a difficult birth.</p>

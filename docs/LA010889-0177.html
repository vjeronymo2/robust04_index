			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> RACHEL AND HER CHILDREN Homeless Families in America by Jonathan Kozol (Fawcett  Columbine: $8.95)  </P> <P> According to Jonathan Kozol, in New York City in 1986 there were reportedly  28,000 homeless people in emergency shelters, with an estimated additional  40,000 unsheltered citywide. Many of the families with whom Kozol spoke do not  fit the expected stereotype: Many had been evicted from their homes for not  meeting mortgage payments because of layoffs or bankruptcy from extensive  medical costs.  </P> <P> "We have no hope . . . nowhere to go," the Rachel of the title told Kozol. "Can  you let the government know that we exist?"  </P> <P> Beyond the heart-rending personal testimony of families stationed in shelters  or hotels, the book is an indictment of the government's neglect of the growing  crisis, as it cut "virtually all funds to build or rehabilitate low-income  housing."  </P> <P> "We're getting out of the housing business. Period," said a Housing and Urban  Development deputy assistant secretary in 1985.  </P> <P> "If (Kozol) is supremely lucky," Times reviewer Garry Abrams wrote, "the book  will prove strong enough to become . . . what Michael Harrington's 'The Other  America' was more than 20 years ago -- a call to conscience that stimulated new  national policies and helped kick off a new era."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRATER VIOLET A Novel by Christopher Isherwood (Michael di Capua Books/ Farrar,  Straus &amp; Giroux: $5.95)  </P> <P> Ostensibly autobiographical (Christopher Isherwood narrates, with  characteristic amusement and charm), "Prater Violet" tells the story of a young  British screenwriter's induction into the chaotic and often hilarious world of  film making (specifically, adapting a musical, the title's "Prater Violet,"  into a full-length motion picture vehicle for a tempestuous Austrian director).  </P> <P> Isherwood is the classic naif, all-seeing, eminently agreeable as he is pushed,  pulled and alternately ignored as the film script he has composed lurches into  production.  </P> <P> In the end, the movie will be a success; the director, the stars move on to  other enterprises. Isherwood, fortunately for us, returns to prose fiction and  memoir, and, when "Prater Violet" comes to a nearby theater, he cannot bring  himself to see it.  </P> <P> (Several of Isherwood's other works, including "My Guru and His Disciple,"  "Christopher and His Kind" and "The Memorial," have been reissued by Noonday /  Michael di Capua / Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE STRANGE NATION OF RAFAEL MENDES by Moacyr Scliar (Ballantine Books: $4.95)  </P> <P> Rafael Mendes awakens one morning in Sao Paolo dreading to hear reports  exposing the near-failure of his finance company.  </P> <P> What he discovers instead is a package delivered to him containing yellowing  notebooks and clothes that belonged to his estranged father, now dead, which  leads him to a genealogist and the revelation that his family is actually  Jewish -- having become "New Christians" during the Spanish Inquisition.  </P> <P> Soon, strange dreams begin, featuring the faces and histories of ancestors such  as the biblical prophet Jonah, the Spanish physician Maimonides and a slew of  Rafael Mendeses.  </P> <P> "Reading 'The Strange Nation of Rafael Mendes' is like riding with a friend who  drives recklessly," Mark R. Day wrote in these pages. "The novel lurches  forward unexpectedly . . . dangerously skirting precipices separating the  plausible from the absurd." It's frustrating at times, "but exhilarating and  ultimately rewarding."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MONTESSORI A Modern Approach by Paula Polk Lillard (Schocken Books: $8.95)  </P> <P> Education, as defined by turn-of-the-century educator Maria Montessori, means  "a natural process spontaneously carried out by the human individual, and . . .  acquired not by listening to words but by experiences."  </P> <P> Paula Polk Lillard's "Montessori," first published in 1973, is particularly  relevant today in view of many parents' ambitious and often counterproductive  expectations for their children. The once-controversial Montessori philosophy  appears far more reasonable: "It takes into account the child's instinct and  legitimate need for purposeful activity," not permitting adults to exploit the  child's talents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TELL ME A RIDDLE by Tillie Olsen (Delta / Seymour Lawrence: $7.95)  </P> <P> Tillie Olsen's excellence lies particularly in her ability to capture the modes  of speech of characters of all ages. In this collection of short fiction, Olsen  eloquently portrays the destitution and struggle of the Depression years in a  mother's thoughts of her daughter's childhood ("She was a child seldom smiled  at . . . a child of anxious, not proud, love"); the slurred speech of a sailor  on shore leave ("Wha's it so quiet for? Hey, hit the tune box . . . wha time's  it anyway?") or the words of 12-year-old Parrie about her favorite teacher  ("She's my most, wish I could get her but she only teaches 'celerated").  </P> <P> Most evocative of all is the title novella, the final bout between a couple  married 47 years ("Vinegar he poured on me all his life; I am well marinated;  how can I be honey now?"), which won the O. Henry Award in 1961.  </P></p>

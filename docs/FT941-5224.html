			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / College lecturer wins race bias case A technical college carried out institutional discrimination and victimisation 'in the truest sense' against a black lecturer, an industrial tribunal has ruled, Lisa Wood writes. The Commission for Racial Equality said yesterday that Mr Stanley Jenkins' complaints of racial abuse from students were disbelieved by Thanet Technical College in Broadstairs, Kent. When Mr Jenkins started industrial tribunal proceedings under the Race Relations Act the college started an inquiry into his teaching performance. The tribunal said: 'It was a manifestly unfair attempt to put pressure on Mr Jenkins to curtail his proceedings.' The award for damages to Mr Jenkins, who is still employed by the college, has yet to be set.</p>

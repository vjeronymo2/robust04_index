			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (17): EC partners and US apply pressure / Patent - the pharmaceuticals industry is impeding progress towards a new law MORE THAN 40 years after the first draft was prepared, Turkey is still struggling to put a modern patent law on to the statute books. Today the issue is back on the agenda, with legislators under growing pressure from both the US and the European Community, and from a government publicly committed to meet the standards set by the country's trading partners. The sticking point, as ever, is the question of pharmaceuticals, an industry which depends vitally on patent. Battle lines are now drawn between the foreign multinationals keen to protect their inventions, local drug companies fearful of losing market share, and a health ministry concerned to contain drug costs. Drug patent remains a sensitive issue, even in developed countries. In Turkey, the commercial interests of the foreign drug companies seem increasingly at odds with the health needs of the broad mass of the population, at a time when the state-run health insurance Scheme is all but bankrupt. The debate might seem somewhat academic when you consider the number of products which will be directly affected by the legislation. In a Turkish market worth around Dollars 1bn in 1991, patentable drugs account for only around 20 per cent of sales; and besides, the law would not affect products already on sale. According to one calculation, the introduction of a patent law would result in price increases of around Dollars 25m. The foreign drug companies insist that this is not a financial question. They point out that, of the 72 patentable products, 24 are currently being imitated by 200 locally produced generics, the cheap copies of off-patent brand name products. This pirated trade represents less than 7 per cent of total sales. The drug companies' case is that patent is necessary to encourage invention. The protection provides a brief and well-earned monopoly for the inventor. Without it, the research base on which the industry's future depends is endangered. Patent could also stimulate an indigenous research effort. 'They all have research and development units, yet all all they do at the moment is reformulate someone else's products,' says one somewhat aggrieved drug executive. 'The law was prepared for Turkey and not to please anyone else,' says a leading member of the government commission set up to prepare what will be the first revision of a 1879 patent law. Nonetheless, the international pressure to address the issue is growing. The US has not ruled out resorting to powers provided under the 301 clause of the 1989 Trade Bill, which could affect Turkey's preferential trade tariffs on textiles and other key exports. Mrs Tansu Ciller the economic minister, discussed the issue with Ms Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative during a visit to Washington earlier this year. EC officials are insisting that patent legislation is part of Turkey's commitment to provide free movement of goods and services under Ankara's 1963 association agreement with the Community. With the draft now going the rounds of ministers and committees, the lobbying has become frenetic. At a conference in June, Dr Alberto Aleotti, chairman of the International Pharmaceutical Producers Union, was invited to present the case for patent. Turkey, he said, 'has great market potential in Asia and the Middle East, but cannot penetrate these markets with copied products.' In Ankara, in October, the presidents of the Austrian and Bulgarian patent offices, among others, spoke on the issue at a seminar organised by the Trade and Industry Ministry - an exercise to steel the nerves of Turkish lawmakers before the draft goes to parliament. Mr Tahir Kose, the trade minister, promised the package would be passed by the end of the year. The draft, however, appears to be stuck in the State Planning Organisation. Moreover, much to the annoyance of the foreign concerns, the SPO, in alliance with the health ministry and the powerful local drug concerns, has introduced the new concept of a transition period for the application of the law. 'In effect, the Turkish industry has already had a transition period of 32 years. If that is not enough, they will never catch up,' says one aggrieved foreign producer. 'If you're planning to be present in the international market, you have to have a patent law,' says Mr Ayhan Suskun, head of the pharmaceutical division at Eczacibasi. 'But the important point is, how soon.' Eczacibasi is said to be one of the main companies lobbying for a transition period, which might seem somewhat curious given that 70 per cent of the company's turnover is made up of drugs produced under license with foreign partners. Patent lawyers are even arguing about different transition periods for process and product patent, but foreign companies say this misses the point. The issue, they say, is to provide pipeline protection, a concept adopted in bilateral patent accords between the US and some of its trading partners. The idea is to protect a product from the time the molecule is invented through the clinical trials to the moment the drug is finally approved by the public health authorities. At present, there is no such provision in the law. 'When we submit molecules for registration, it may take another 10 years before we develop the product. What this new law implies is that no new molecules will be protected in Turkey for the next 22 years,' says a US drug executive. The other complaint is that Turkish legislation still makes no provision for clinical testing, which drug companies say is an essential step to encourage a domestic research industry. The picture is fairly dismal. Patent lawyers, such as Kaan Dericioglu, now believe the law may get derailed even before it reaches parliament. Mr Dericioglu argues that it may be better to exclude pharmaceuticals altogether, to allow at least some form of patent legislation to go on the books. But as one foreign executive put it, more optimistically: 'The government at least is now in a position to make the political choice.'</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barnes &amp; Noble approach to Pentos Pentos, the specialist retailing group which includes the Dillons bookshop and Athena cards and poster chains, is considering an approach from Barnes &amp; Noble, the US bookstore group. Any arrangement between Pentos and B&amp;N to open a range of cut-price bookshops would revive the controversy over the future of the net book agreement, which governs most book sales in the UK and allows publishers to decide on the minimum price for a book. However, while Mr Bill McGrath, Pentos chief executive, is said to be keen to explore whatever possibilities arise, any decision is some way off. Analysts expect the group to make a rights issue in the near future, and an announcement on any arrangement with B&amp;N would not come until after that - probably in December or early next year. Mr McGrath, who took over as chief executive in December, is said to believe that the NBA will disappear, but not to favour taking the pro-active stance of his predecessor, Mr Terry Maher, in undermining it. In particular, he is unlikely to want to intensify pressure on the NBA, which is supported by publishers, when the group is keen to maintain cordial relations with its suppliers. A similar rationale appears to lie behind the group's denial that Athena might not be able to reach new payment arrangements. 'Athena would not contemplate doing anything unilaterally that would damage the relationship with its suppliers,' the company said.</p>

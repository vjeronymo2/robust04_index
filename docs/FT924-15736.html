			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait falls as expected KUWAIT, which reopened on Monday following a two year closure forced by the Iraqi invasion, closed its week apparently 22.4 per cent down on a temporary index set up by an independent company; but the fall came within pre-opening predictions, agencies report. Alshal Economic Consultants said yesterday that its provisional 'Alshal Index' for the period measured the value of stocks between August 1, 1990 - the last trading day before the August 2 Iraqi invasion - and the last trading day of each week. The index closed at 77.6, down 22.4. Volume during the three days was 2.89m shares valued at 1.21m Kuwaiti dinars (Dollars 4.14m) for an average of 963,000 shares, and 403,000 dinars a day. Initial trading was limited and local observers said that trading was cautious because of the weakness of the economy, which had led to preductions of a 25 per cent fall in the market before it reopened.</p>

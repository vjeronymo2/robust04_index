			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's Tibet  Autonomous Region is reporting a fast-growing economy thanks to  efforts to expand overseas and domestic co-operation.    It has set up 28 joint ventures funded by the United States,  Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.    It has also signed contracts for development projects with  overseas firms, with a total investment of 9.63 million U.S.  dollars.    Also, some 16 domestic firms in the interior provinces have  set up business centers in Tibet. More than 20 Tibetan  enterprises have started co-operation projects financed by their  counterparts in the interior, involving a total of 30.48 million  yuan, mainly for developing transportation, light industry,  textiles, electronics, commerce and trade.    In 1993 the region sent more than 50 trade delegations to  the  interior provinces and other autonomous regions of the country.  And over 100 inspection groups were asked to come in the region  to promote economic development.    About 20 of these joint-venture projects set up so far in  the  region are in the high-tech sector, accounting for 48.7 percent  of the total.</p>

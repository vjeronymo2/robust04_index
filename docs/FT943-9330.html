			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Russian GNP 'to fall by 10%' A decline in industrial production of between 35 and 38 per cent in 1994 was predicted in a report issued this week by the Russian Central Bank. However, because industry accounts for a decreasing portion of the Russian economy, the bank predicted that GNP will decline by only 10 per cent. In the report, which has become the central bank's annual public declaration of its goals, bank officials said that their target is to bring inflation down to 8 per cent a month by the end of the year. Earlier this year the Russian Central Bank, whose chairman was once described as 'the worst central banker in the world' because of his enthusiastic extension of soft credits to Russian industry and agriculture, considerably tightened its monetary policy. This change in policy has had moderate success in reining in runaway inflation, but the Russian economy now faces a new inflationary threat. Unable to easily obtain credits from the government, Russian enterprises have extended loans to one another, creating a growing mountain of debt which threatens to paralyse the country's financial system. In this week's report the central bank suggests that commercial banks be asked to participate in the increasingly urgent efforts of the Russian government to find a solution to the issue of inter-enterprise debt.</p>

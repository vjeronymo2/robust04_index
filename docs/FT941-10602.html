			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Banks offered escape from bad loans For more than two years, the weakness of Japan's banking system has depressed the stock market while persistent fears of a credit crunch have undermined business confidence. The Finance Ministry and the banks have traditionally dealt with bad loans by slowly writing off their loans. But declining investor confidence and increasing criticism over the delay in write-offs have forced the inclusion in yesterday's package of measures allowing banks to shift deteriorating assets off balance sheets. The ministry will allow banks to set up a company to buy restructured loans  -loans on which the banks have agreed to waive interest rates in order to help financial restructuring - made to non-bank financial institutions, such as housing loan companies. During the late 1980s, banks, brokers, and manufacturers tried to take advantage of low interest rates and booming stock and property markets by setting up finance companies, many of which now face financial problems due to reckless lending. After selling off a restructured loan at a discounted price to the company, which the banks themselves will have to fund, a bank will write off the difference and the company will monitor the financial restructuring of the borrower. The ministry also urges banks to accelerate the write off process or to make provisions against their bad and risky loans. The Finance Ministry also wants the banks to step up the use of the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, set up last year to buy the property collateral of problem loans. The guideline also recommends banks to increase their capital base through issuing preferred stock and subordinated loans. In order to add liquidity to the property market, the ministry will ease restrictions on property-related lending.</p>

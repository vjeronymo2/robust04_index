			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Farm trade deal could lead to 10% price rise  -Agriculture The Gatt farm trade deal could lead to a 10 per cent rise in world agriculture prices in spite of expected increases in production, as it limits the dumping of subsidised food exports on world markets. Export subsidies by the US and European Union have depressed world prices in recent years. The Gatt deal will mean 50m tonnes less subsidised wheat on world markets from 1995 to 2000, changing the wheat trade from one almost dominated by subsidies to one approaching free trade. Reductions in farm income support will remove important distortions to world farm trade. The deal also begins to open up more markets worldwide by converting barriers to farm imports into monetary tariffs which are then reduced. The inclusion of agriculture in the Uruguay Round brings farming into a set of international rules for the first time. It also sets important precedents for future negotiations over farm trade - tariffs, for example, are much easier to reduce in future than non-tariff barriers to trade. Most analysis of the effects of the deal is hypothetical, but many economists say world prices will rise as subsidised exports are reduced. 'Current world prices equal production costs minus the average of US and EU subsidies. As subsidies are knocked off, prices will rise,' said Mr Brian Gardner, director of EPA Associates, the farm consultancy in Brussels. Outright winners from the deal will be farmers in Australia, Argentina and to a lesser extent, New Zealand - among the so-called Cairns group of negotiating countries - which can produce more and will enjoy wider access to previously closed markets. Australia estimates it will raise agricultural exports by over Dollars 1bn. These exporters will not necessarily be looking to target directly the US and European Union, since countries need only guarantee access for up to 5 per cent of the market for a particular product. But they will be looking to ship to huge markets in Russia and China which were previously supplied by subsidised products from the US and EU. The value of subsidised exports must be reduced over six years under the terms of the now-infamous Blair House accord by 36 per cent below a base period of 1986 to 1990. At the same time, the quantity of these subsidised exports must be cut by 21 per cent. These are the provisions which almost brought the entire agreement to its knees when the French government called for modifications, fearing their farmers would lose export markets. The US and EU later agreed to stage the cuts from a higher 1991-1992 base line, allowing European farmers to export an extra 8m tonnes of cereals over the six-year period. Europe has managed to preserve direct payments to farmers as compensation for falling prices. Although income support for farmers must be reduced by 20 per cent in developed countries over the life of the deal - 13.3 per cent in developing countries - the EU gained exemptions for some direct payments. This means farmers can still be paid for growing less and for structural adjustment which is an important part of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The EU farm industry will see its income decline in the short term, although this can be attributed more to CAP reform than to the Gatt settlement. In the long run, farmers can make up for reductions in their artificially high support prices by increasing output or improving productivity. At the same time, introduction of tariffs to imports rather than non-tariff barriers will afford European farmers even greater protection than they enjoy now. But these tariffs will be reduced by 36 per cent over six years for developed countries - 24 per cent for developing countries over 10 years. The tariff issue has caused great controversy in Japan and South Korea - where governments have for years enforced bans on all rice imports, a non-tariff barrier which is difficult to convert into a monetary levy. Canada's supply management system will also have to be altered. The wider effects of an overall Gatt deal are expected to boost incomes in many countries, leading to rising demand for food products. This in turn is likely to feed through into higher prices. But developing countries which are largely dependent on food imports will lose out because they will be forced to pay more.</p>

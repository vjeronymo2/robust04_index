			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / US drive for healthcare progress Senior members of the US Congress have launched intensive discussions on ways to break their impasse over the overhaul of the US healthcare system by suspending the compulsory elements of a reform for several years to see whether voluntary measures can do the job. Opposition Republicans have so far resisted the key element of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan, which would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers and pay for 80 per cent of its cost. But, at a White House meeting yesterday morning, Senator Daniel Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Senator Robert Packwood, the senior Republican on the committee, began discussions with Mr Clinton on possible methods by which the employer mandate would be triggered only if vountary measures had failed to bring health care to all. Both senators warned, however, that there was at the moment no majority in their committee for any healthcare plan. They said that Mr Clinton had asked them not to press for an immediate vote on his plan, which in its current shape would be defeated. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have accepted to a large extent the president's goal of universal health coverage in the US, but most Republicans and many Democrats have been reluctant to accept the degree of compulsion necessary to achieve that goal. Since almost all large US companies already provide health insurance to their workers, the Clinton plan's employer mandate would be largely targeted at small businesses, which are a cherished constituency for members of Congress. As a possible compromise, various senators have been discussing different forms of trigger: a hard trigger, which would implement the employer mandate if, after a certain number of years, the US had not achieved 95 to 97 per cent coverage, or a soft one, which would merely sound an alarm but not bring any automatic action if this target were not reached. Administration officials have rejected soft triggers as inadequate, but appear to be open to the idea of hard triggers. Many members of Congress, however, view hard triggers with suspicion. 'Triggers are for guns, not legislation,' said Congressman Sam Gibbons, chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee. At the White House meeting yesterday, Senator Packwood floated a possible compromise based on the fast-track procedures adopted to facilitate trade treaty negotiations or military base closures, whereby Congress must vote yes or no, but cannot amend the proposal. 'There was interest in the fast-track concept,' Senator Packwood said. He added, however, that the division came over whether the mechanism should more closely resemble a trade treaty, whereby Congress must vote yes before it can take effect, or a base closure, which takes effect automatically unless Congress votes no within a fixed period.</p>

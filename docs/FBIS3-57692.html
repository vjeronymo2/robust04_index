Russia made an official proposal for a meeting between  President Boris Yeltsin and President Lennart Meri last autumn.  The summit was then expected to take place in November or  December.    Olljum reiterated that the meeting between the presidents  can  take place only after the principal issues of the  Estonian-Russian relations have been resolved. He had in mind  in the first place the setting of the final deadline for the  Russian troop withdrawal.    "From the first, we were not sure the summit could soon take  place," Olljum told BNS. "It was primarily Russia's statement  that sparked interest in the press."    Olljum voiced hope that the troop withdrawal deadline --  Aug.  31 -- proposed by Russia will be officially confirmed at the  upcoming meeting between the Russian and the Estonian  delegations next week.    Estonia agreed to the deadline in principle but will not  accept any strings.    When Russia for the first time suggested the August deadline  last autumn, it made a number of stipulations concerning "social  protection" of Russians residing in Estonia, money for housing  construction, and other issues.    Olljum expressed the opinion this was a "propagandistic  step."</p>

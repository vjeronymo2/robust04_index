			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: New York Just how strongly the US economy is growing will become clearer this week, as the first economic data for November are published. Since its record low of 5.78 per cent on October 15, the long bond's yield had climbed to 6.33 per cent by last Monday. In the circumstances, the nine basis point fall in yield by last Friday, thanks largely to Opec's failure to agree production limits, marked an important recovery. The market is braced for either a continuation of, or a slight increase in, the pace of economic activity in October. Anything which suggests the economy is moving ahead at a sharply higher level would weaken prices. Revised third-quarter GDP figures on Wednesday are expected to show a modest increase on the 2.8 per cent growth rate reported, with most estimates at between 2.9 per cent and 3.1 per cent. The same day brings the survey of the National Association of Purchasing Managers for November. The NAPM index, which jumped to 53.9 in October from 49.8 in September, is projected to rise to anything from 54-56.5. Friday's November employment figures will provide the last big test of the week. Bond market economists expect non-farm payrolls, which grew by 177,000 in October, to show an increase of anything from 175,00-230,000. But just how much good economic news can the bond market take?</p>

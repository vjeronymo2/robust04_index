			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Brooke hints at post-election pact with Ulster Unionists MR PETER BROOKE, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave the clearest hint yet that the Tories would consider a pact with the Ulster Unionist party in the event of a hung parliament. In a television interview, Mr Brooke did not rule out the possibility of a deal and said it might even provide 'impetus' to his efforts to start roundtable talks on Northern Ireland's political future. He said the government might amend the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement - a central demand of Unionist leaders - if such a move could be agreed with the Irish government. His comments will add to speculation that the Tories would turn to Ulster Unionist MPs for support at Westminster rather than to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Paddy Ashdown has made it clear that the Liberal Democrats would push for electoral reform as the price for their support. There are nine Ulster Unionist MPs plus three from the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party - who might also support a Tory administration - compared with 22 Liberal Democrats. The Ulster Unionists and Tories have historical ties but, since the imposition of direct rule from Westminster of Northern Ireland in 1972, the two parties have drifted apart. In Ulster they will be standing against each other in the general election. Mr John Major has previously heightened speculation about a deal by rejecting Labour and Liberal Democrat calls for a tripartite understanding that the Anglo-Irish Agreement would not be renegotiated during the election campaign. No formal talks between the Ulster Unionists and Tories have taken place so far. Mr Brooke, speaking on LWT's Walden Programme, reiterated his determination to resume round-table talks if he remained as Northern Ireland secretary after the election. However, he said he might impose some form of local or regional government if negotiations failed to reach a conclusion within the lifetime of the next parliament. Mr Brooke said that the outcome of the general election might match that of February 1974, when no party won an overall majority and Mr Edward Heath, the Tory leader, considered a pact with the Ulster Unionists. Rather than insist that the Conservatives would win an overall majority, Mr Brooke added: 'I'm not going to predict what might happen on a future occasion.' He did not accept that the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party would refuse to take part in round-table talks if the Unionists and Tories struck a deal. One senior SDLP official warned that Mr Brooke was being 'naive' if he thought the party would simply shrug off a Tory-Unionist pact. He said: 'It would colour people's views very heavily.' Mr Brooke refused to pledge that changes to the Anglo-Irish Agreement would not be part of any negotiations with the Ulster Unionists. However, he emphasised that, because it was an international treaty, changes would have to be agreed with the Irish government.</p>

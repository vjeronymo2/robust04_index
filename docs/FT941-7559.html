			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Sunderland's torch of hope - or is it a flare of doom? - Case study, Nissan / When competition bites, Europeans can adjust their attitudes. Management at Nissan's UK car plant aims to outdo the Japanese For optimists seeking signs of revival in run-down north-east England, the Nissan motor company's car factory on the outskirts of Sunderland symbolises Britain's new manufacturing prowess. For rivals like Peugeot or Ford of Europe, the Nissan plant is an instrument of Japanese power, brought into the bastion of the European Union to undermine the continent's indigenous car companies. Whatever the ultimate verdict on Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, it potently illustrates the mood of change and challenge sweeping Europe. The precepts put into effect at Nissan demonstrate that, when competition bites, European managers and workers can radically adjust practices and attitudes. In an increasingly integrated world, foreign ownership is no bar to economic accomplishment. Nissan last year was Britain's biggest motor exporter, selling abroad 75 per cent of output. Clad in a bright blue production uniform, Mr Ian Gibson, 47, managing director of Nissan's UK operations, joined the company in 1984 after 16 years with Ford in Britain and Germany. Expounding how the UK must learn from Germany and Japan - 'the two great manufacturing nations' - he says the watchwords of the roughly 4,000-strong workforce are flexibility, perfectionism and determination. The plant came on stream in 1986. It was the right moment to benefit from labour market deregulation in Thatcherite Britain and the country's late-1980s economic boom. Japanese capital, technology and work methods, twinned with British pragmatism and a brand new greenfield site, proved a winning combination. 'We were a pilot enterprise,' says Mr Gibson. 'We had no existing bureaucracy or (corporate) culture to change.' Now, he says, productivity equals that of comparably-sized Japanese plants. Lean production, by definition, cannot provide jobs for tens of thousands. The company hires for its production teams - average age 23 or 24 - only those who show Nissan-style commitment. Furthermore, Nissan is now showing it is as vulnerable to the economic cycle as General Motors or Volkswagen. Nissan is cutting about 600 jobs through voluntary redundancies, introduced to adapt production to reduced 1993-94 European car demand. This year's output will be between 200,000 and 220,000 Primera and Micra cars, compared with 246,000 last year. Sunderland's unemployment rate, meanwhile, is 13 per cent. When Nissan launched its last recruitment drive, two years ago, 32,000 people applied for 1,600 jobs. Sunderland's dire employment picture adds point to Mr Gibson's view that there are no short cuts along the gritty road to success. He takes pride in the plant's efforts to exceed Japanese quality standards. 'Our biggest competitor is not Ford or Renault. It is Nissan Japan.' Pointing to Sunderland's links with European component suppliers, as well as engineers and designers at Nissan research facilities in the UK and on the European mainland, he plays down the influence of its Japanese parent. 'We have been given no magic gift, no secret passport. We have assembled a collection of best practices where the most important questions are not technical or mechanical, but broader management issues: how to organise people and things so that manufacturing runs well . . . People's approach and attitude are more important than technical skills.' In the crucial question of new car development, Mr Gibson even sees room for self-sufficiency. 'If our team of British and European engineers and suppliers was to leave the company tomorrow, we couldn't build a new car. If the Japanese left, it would take 18 months longer - but we could do it.' Brave words, posing a question than only the brave can answer: could north-east England's dark industrial fields one day raise a Japanese manufacturing culture, without the Japanese?</p>

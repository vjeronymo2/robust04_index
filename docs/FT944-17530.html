			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Receivers to Carden Park seek investors Receivers are looking for investors to inject fresh equity into Carden Park, the 1,200 acre hotel and leisure complex near Manchester owned by Mr John Broome. The Bank of Scotland, sole lender on the project, has appointed Grant Thornton as receivers under the Law of Property Act. 'We are looking at all the options. Either we find a buyer or some form of refinancing has to be agreed,' the receivers said. 'At the moment out priorities are reassuring our suppliers and confirming bookings which have already been made.' Battersea Leisure Group, the company set up by Mr Broome to build a leisure complex on the site of Battersea Power Station in London, was put into liquidation earlier this year. That site is now in the hands of Mr George Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang, Hong Kong property investors. Unlike Battersea, though, Carden Park is Mr Broome's personal project and he effectively operates as sole trader. 'I am going into business with my bankers until such time as we can attract the new equity required,' said Mr Broome yesterday. More than Pounds 20m has been spent over five years developing the ambitious Carden Park complex, which includes an 83 suite hotel and golf course. The development is aiming to attract corporate clients. Other attractions include clay pigeon shooting and archery. Planning consent has been granted for a number of woodland villas, a new golf club house and a larger swimming pool. Mr Broome estimated that another Pounds 5m would have to be spent to complete his dream. While there are plans for further development, the complex opened for business 10 months ago. Mr Broome said that hotel occupancy rates were currently running at about 60 per cent.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Culture with Clinton - As the new US president takes over, Karen Fricker looks at the implications for the arts 'BILL AND Hillary Clinton are going to trigger a cultural renaissance in this country from MTV (Music Television) to the most sophisticated arts,' said Ed Markey, Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, at a Washington cocktail party on Wednesday night. We will probably have to chalk up Markey's extravagant statement to inauguration-night ebullience, but there is an undeniable sense among those interested in America's cultural life that Clinton's presidency brings new hope for the arts in America. 'Bill Clinton has shown himself to be a person who's culturally aware and concerned, and I expect that his administration will bring new thinking about the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We've had many years of a suffocating environment for the arts, and I look forward to a change in attitude,' said Del Reisman, a screenwriter and President of the Writers Guild of America, West. The past 12 years of Republican leadership have been at best indifferent, and at worst openly hostile, to the arts. Since Reagan took office in 1981, NEA funding has dropped 36 per cent. The last three years have been particularly embattled ones for the NEA as controversies over the funding of politically outspoken and sexually explicit art by such artists as Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe and Karen Finley have provoked a national 'art war' about what constitutes obscenity and appropriateness. Little is known for sure about what Clinton's arts policy will be. The arts have not been at the top of his agenda during his campaign. Though Clinton advisors did work with the NEA during the transition, they did not issue a statement of arts policy. But Clinton's record on, and attitudes towards, the arts bode well for the country's cultural future. Clinton and Gore's campaign platform included a promising, if pithy, statement on the arts, defending artists' freedom of expression and advocating government support of the arts through the NEA. Though their campaign initially opposed content restrictions for NEA-funded art, Clinton has equivocated on this point. He said in the October 1992 Equity News that, 'While I believe that publicly funded projects should strive to reflect the values that most communities share, I strongly support and will defend freedom of speech and artistic expression.' Just what Clinton defines as community values remains to be seen. Speculations are flying about whom Clinton will appoint as NEA chairman. The position was particularly politicised last February when the Bush administration asked John Frohnmayer to step down from the chair and replaced him with staunch conservative Anne-Imelda Radice. Radice's use of her veto power on several gay-themed projects which had already received peer panel approval won her few friends in the arts community. She stepped down voluntarily this week with 'no regrets.' Longtime NEA bureaucrat Ana Steele will serve as acting chair until Clinton appoints someone to the position. Rumored to be under consideration are Yale School of Drama dean Lloyd Richards, chairperson of the Dayton Hudson Foundation Cynthia Mayeda, New York State Council for the Arts chair Kitty Carlisle Hart, actress Lauren Bacall, and FOB (Friend of Bill) Deborah Sale, who was a member of the transition arts team. The NEA's total budget - Dollars 174 million in 1993 - is in Federal terms insignificant. But NEA grants are crucial to the life of arts organisations, particularly small ones, and breed more money: corporate and private funders view a NEA grant as a quality stamp and are more likely to lend their support to arts institutions that are NEA funded. Clinton's record on the arts as Governor of Arkansas is fairly strong. Arkansas' state budget arts allotment is the seventh lowest in the country, but it has remained constant during the recession while other states have slashed arts budgets or eliminated them entirely. 'We're not the biggest agency in the state, but Governor Clinton kept in touch,' says Bill Puppione, Executive Director of the Arkansas Arts Council. 'There was a feeling among arts administrators that the Governor knew what was going on and that they had access to him,' Puppione says. In its 1987 education reform package, instituted by a board that included Hillary Clinton, Arkansas added an arts requirement for high school graduation, one of the first American states to do so. Education and the accessibility of the arts, prominently mentioned in Clinton and Gore's campaign platform, are likely to figure in their national arts policy. Beyond policy, the president has the opportunity to influence public opinion about the arts through his personal behaviour, and this is where Clinton is likely to make the largest impact. Cynics deride Clinton's sax-playing appearences on talk shows and at presidential galas as image-mongering, and those of higher brow consider his musical preferences - Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Fleetwood Mac - the aesthetic equivalent of McDonald's decaf. But Clinton's active interest in music has humanised him to the public. And though some call Clinton's choice of an African-American woman, Maya Angelou, to read her poetry at his inauguration pandering to political correctness, he was the first President since Kennedy to include a poet in the inaugural ceremonies. The Clintons led an active cultural life in Arkansas. They were subscribers and donors to Little Rock's Arkansas Repertory Theatre and hosted fundraisers for the theatre and other Arkansas arts organisations and Hillary Clinton was on the board of the state's largest ballet company. Cliff Baker, Artistic Director of Arkansas Rep, says that the Clintons were known to creep into the balcony of his theatre on a Sunday night 'just because they wanted to see the show, not because they wanted to be seen.'</p>

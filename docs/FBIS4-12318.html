			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an initial Palestinian reaction to the  attack in 'Afula: Nasri Yusuf, head of the Palestinian military  delegation to the Cairo talks, told our correspondent in Cairo  Arye Gus that the fact that acts of violence continue is very  saddening. He added that the Palestinians do not support such  acts, and make every effort to put end to violence in the  region. The remarks were made after the Palestinian military  delegation held a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that no one can  guarantee that the attack in 'Afula will be the last. At the  same time, every effort will be made to cut off the arms of the  murderers and harm the terror organization which aspires to  murder all that is good in the Middle East. Minister Peres  further said that grave incidents had been expected, but the  attack in 'Afula was graver than could be expected. He added  that the government will make security-related decisions, and  rejected the opposition parties' demand that a commission of  inquiry be set up to investigate the incident. Such murders  took place when the Likud was in power, and even before the  peace talks started, Peres said.    [In a live telephone interview on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in  Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 6 April, Foreign Minister Peres says: "I  do not believe that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] asks or  needs 'Arafat's permission to carry out such attacks. For the  time being, 'Arafat is not on the ground here. When he enters  the region, we will examine his conduct in the region under his  jurisdiction." Asked about the opposition demand to suspend the  negotiations with the PLO in the wake of the attack, he said:  "I see no connection between the two issues."]    Minister Yosi Sarid said that the circumstances of the  attack  in 'Afula will be thoroughly studied. He rejected the demands  that the peace talks be suspended claiming that the terrorists  should not be given a prize for their acts. At the same time,  he said, we must fight terrorism to the end.    Deputy Agriculture Minister Walid Sadiq condemned the grave  attack in 'Afula, and called for restraint. Deputy Health  Minister Nayif Musaliha said that the terrorists intend to  murder the peace process and the relations between Jews and  Arabs in Israel.    Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz, deputy chairman of the Labor  faction, said that the bloody attack proves that the government  must go on with the peace process, and not be deterred by  attempts by extremists to torpedo it.    Meretz faction Chairman Ran Kohen called on the prime  minister and the PLO head not to retreat, and to speed up the  exit of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] faction  Chairman Tawfiq Zayyad condemned the attack, saying that it  poisons the atmosphere and harms the political process.    The National Religious Party said that the 'Afula attack is  the outcome of the Rabin government's policy of groveling.    Moledet said that the 'Afula massacre is an indication of  what is to happen once the recipe for peace, prepared by the  government and the PLO, is implemented.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that MK Ravitz of the  United Torah Jewry demanded that the prime minister set up a  state commission of inquiry to examine the events that led to  the attack in 'Afula.    Likud MK 'Ovadya Eli, who used to be 'Afula mayor, demanded  that peace talks be stopped at once, and that their continuation  be made conditional on a Palestinian commitment to prevent  additional acts of terror from taking place.</p>

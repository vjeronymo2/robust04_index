			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sakher Abu Eloun] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 24 (AFP) --  The fruits of the first accord between the armed wings of Fatah  and Hamas were put on display Sunday [24 April] as the  fundamentalists invited their erstwhile rivals to a university  debate.    The Islamic Resistance Movement asked Fatah representatives  to the Islamic university, a fundamentalist stronghold in Gaza  City, to address 2,000 students on the forthcoming Palestinian  autonomy and the opposition.    "It really is the first time that Hamas has invited us, and  what is more to this university to speak to their students,"  said Diyab al-Lawh, a Fatah leader in Gaza.    "It's a good start to establish relations between the  national and Islamic movements," he said after the Hawks and  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam announced an official agreement Friday to  end internecine fighting and to cooperate for autonomy.    "However we do not want to talk about a honeymoon because  that's for marriages and occasionally matrimony ends in  divorce," he laughed.    'Ala' al-Nazli, a 22-year-old student linked to Hamas,  agreed. "It's the first joint meeting. It was excellent and  moving.    "It expresses the unity to which we aspire. We will hold  more similar meetings and will maintain our relations with  Fatah."    After warm applause for the arrival of three members of  Fatah's high committee the debate quickly focused on how the  9,000 Palestinian policemen will treat those like Hamas who have  opposed the autonomy deal and the whole peace process.    The opposition fears victimization, particularly by the  7,000  men of the Palestine Liberation Army who will form the backbone  of the force and are totally devoted to PLO chairman Yasir  'Arafat.    Political science lecturer 'Atif 'Udwan, who was deported to  southern Lebanon in 1992 as a Hamas member, questioned the  impartiality of a police force recruited by the PLO.    "Generally in democratic countries, the police does not  belong to any particular side. Will this be the case or will it  be an extension of the Israeli police?" he asked    Al-Lawh replied: "The Palestinian authority will be elected  by all Palestinians and the policemen who are due to arrive are  veteran soldiers who have given their lives to the Palestinian  cause and I do not think they will become the oppressors.    "The police will be clean and impartial."    The Israeli government has made no mention of the agreement,  after warning the PLO that if it reached an understanding with  the fundamentalists which allowed Hamas to continue its attacks  on Israelis then the autonomy deal would be off.</p>

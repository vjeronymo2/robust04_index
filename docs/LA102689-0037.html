			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICE FENCES OUT DOWNTOWN STREET PEOPLE  </P> <P> Problems with transients and the homeless have forced the downtown post office  to erect a tall, wrought-iron fence with sharp points curled outward in both  the front and rear of the building.  </P> <P> A local Postal Service spokesman said the $30,000 fence is being erected to  stop the vandalism against the vehicles parked in the rear and to deter people  from using the front and rear of the building "as a toilet."  </P> <P> "We thought a fence is the best way to go to protect our customers and  employees," said spokesman Ken Boyd. "We planted bushes in the front but that  didn't work. People were still sleeping in there and using the area to relieve  themselves."  </P> <P> A clerk at the downtown post office, on E Street across from the main library,  said customers frequently complained about transients sleeping in the bushes.  He noted that several local businesses, including the Salvation Army  headquarters at 7th Avenue and E Street, and the Great Western parking garage  across the street, have erected similar fences to keep transients out.  </P> <P> The gray fence, which is clearly designed to deter people from climbing over  it, lines a busy thoroughfare used by hundreds of commuters every day while  leaving downtown en route to California 94 and Interstate 5. The fence will  extend most of the block on E and F streets.  </P> <P> "We have to send a security officer down there every morning to make our  building accessible to our customers. There are a lot of people milling about  on the front steps," Boyd said.  </P> <P> A homeless person who wanted to be identified only as Jerome, acknowledged that  transients sleep among the bushes and also relieve themselves there.  </P> <P> "But I wouldn't think that people sleeping in the bushes would be the problem.  They're full of thorns and too low to the ground. But some people go to the  bathroom there. I mean, when there's no other place to go, what do they want  people to do?" said Jerome.  </P> <P> Another transient said that postal authorities were really trying to keep  "street people" away from the front of the building and from sitting on the  steps leading up to the two entrances.  </P> <P> "Their guards patrol around the building and are always hassling people," Joe  Holley said. "They don't want you sitting on the steps. They don't want you  standing on the steps. They've got no right telling us to move off the  sidewalks but they do. They treat homeless people like dirt."  </P> <P> Transients and homeless people congregate throughout the day at the two bus  benches in front of the building and by the newspaper racks. They also  frequently use the bathrooms in the main library when it is open.  </P> <P> The fence is being put up by a Riverside County company.  </P></p>

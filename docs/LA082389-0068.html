			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAINTED FOOD KILLS TWO AT NURSING HOME  </P> <P> Two elderly patients have died and dozens of others have taken ill during a  food poisoning outbreak at a Pomona nursing home, county officials disclosed  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said Denise Louetta, 89,  and Laurencia Spurlock, 78, died from eating contaminated food served at the  Towne Avenue Convalescent Hospital in Pomona on Aug. 11.  </P> <P> Health officials said 47 of 88 patients and seven of 89 staff members have  taken ill with symptoms of nausea and diarrhea. Two patients and two staffers  became sick on Monday or Tuesday of this week in an apparent recurrence of the  earlier attack.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Cited  </P> <P> Since the outbreak, health officials have cited the 94-bed nursing home for  deficient food preparation practices that included serving outdated mayonnaise  as well as milk that had been sitting too long without refrigeration. The  temperature gauge on the dishwasher was reported to be broken and food  preparation areas were not kept clean.  </P> <P> Health inspectors also cited the nursing home for failing to promptly report  the food-poisoning outbreak. The nursing home notified the health department  three days after the outbreak, rather than within the required 24 hours, said  Marvin Brandon, the county health official in charge of nursing home  inspections.  </P> <P> Glen Crume, administrator of the nursing home, said that he was not aware that  food poisoning had been found to have caused the deaths of the two patients. He  denied any problems with food handling -- either past or present.  </P> <P> But health officials in the county's San Gabriel Valley office said an  inspection of the nursing home last December had unearthed 21 deficiencies,  including a dirty kitchen floor, cupboards and windows. The partition in a  double sink was not sealed off, allowing dirty water to mix with clean water.  The nursing home was ordered to correct the deficiencies.  </P> <P> Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy for the county Health Services  Department's disease control program, said the bacterium responsible for the  illness has not been pinpointed. But she said she suspects the culprit is a  bacterium that incubates in unrefrigerated food left long enough at a certain  temperature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No "Shortcuts"  </P> <P> Of the outbreak, she said, "This can happen almost anyplace, which is why we  keep pounding at people about food handling. When feeding 50 people, you can't  afford to take any shortcuts."  </P> <P> Occasionally, Fannin said, food poisoning outbreaks have occurred in nursery  schools, day camps, hospitals or during picnics "where people aren't used to  preparing (large quantities) of food."  </P> <P> The important point to stress, she added, is that the organism is most likely  not a virulent one that ordinarily causes death, "but in a fragile (elderly)  population it can push them over the line."  </P> <P> Louetta and Spurlock died shortly after they were hospitalized Aug. 12. The  cause of death in both cases was initially listed as a swollen colon. But after  an autopsy, the county coroner determined that the women had died "due to  bacterial food poisoning due to ingestion of contaminated food."  </P> <P> Families of the victims could not be reached, and nursing home personnel  discouraged a reporter from interviewing patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patients Isolated  </P> <P> Crume said that afflicted patients had been isolated from the others and that  the nursing home was not accepting any new patients at this time.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jesse Katz contributed to this story.  </P></p>

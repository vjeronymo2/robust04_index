			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers to hold drug cost talks THE GOVERNMENT will meet pharmaceutical industry representatives to seek agreement on why the National Health Service drugs bill is rising so fast, MPs were told yesterday. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, told the House that his department's analysis of 'complex' reasons for the 39 per cent real terms increase from Pounds 1.2bn in 1982 to Pounds 2.9bn in England last year differed from the industry's. 'We must ensure that money spent on medicines is money well spent,' he said. Later Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the government was backing the pharmaceutical industry's belief that the London area was the most promising site for the European Medicines Evaluation Agency - if the body was located in the UK.</p>

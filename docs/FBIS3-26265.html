In 1993 the province approved the establishment of 2,188 new  foreign-funded enterprises, involving an agreed use of 1.9  billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. The figures represent  75.74 percent and 98.53 percent increases, respectively,  compared with 1992.    According to local officials, Hubei has so far approved the  establishment of 3,433 foreign-funded enterprises, which are  expected to bring in a total of 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in  foreign investment.    Local officials attributed the foreign investment boom in  the  province to the implementation of the national strategy for  opening and speeding up the development of areas along the Chang  Jiang river, overseas investment promotion events, the  increasingly improved investment environment and effective  measures made to simplify approval procedures.    Operational foreign-funded enterprises in the province are  reporting good production and operation achievements, and a  rapid growth of exports of their products.    The 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises in operation realized  3.23 billion yuan from sales of their products last year,  generating 197 million yuan in local revenue.    These enterprises have earned 188 million U.S. dollars from  exports in the past year, accounting for 11.2 percent of the  province's total export earnings, the officials said.</p>

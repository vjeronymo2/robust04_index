			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester holders challenge aspect of Bosch bid A LOBBY of shareholders in Worcester Group, the central heating boiler maker which has agreed to a Pounds 71.8m offer from Robert Bosch, the German conglomerate, has appealed to the Takeover Panel over an aspect of the bid. The full panel will meet next Monday to hear the appeal and a decision could be announced that day. The shareholders, thought to account for about 25 per cent of Worcester's equity, have appointed Cazenove, the stockbrokers, to represent them. They are concerned about the offer Bosch has made to the Worcester management which would give them a continuing equity interest in the business. Worcester's management would be bought out in 1996 at a price up to 384p, or as low as 100p, while other shareholders are being offered 225p in cash or loan notes. The panel executive had approved the arrangement, but the shareholders believe that it breaches the fundamental principle of the Takeover Code that all shareholders should be treated similarly in a bid. Mr Christopher Smith of Cazenove said the shareholders felt that it was a point of principle which they wanted to test. It is a relatively unusual case, as managements rarely have such a large stake as the 38.4 per cent held in Worcester's case. It is also rare for shareholders to appeal to the panel. There is some time pressure as the offer's first closing date is May 21. The bid can go unconditional with acceptances of more than 50 per cent, and Bosch already has commitments to accept from holders of 51.4 per cent of the shares, including the management's portion.</p>

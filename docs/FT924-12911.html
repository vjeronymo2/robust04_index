			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Family footsteps fade as Street faces changes - Peggy Hollinger on a new future for an old firm THE SMALL Somerset village of Street knew change was in the air when the Bear Hotel finally got its licence to sell alcohol five years ago. The Clark family, Quaker guardians of Britain's biggest shoe manufacturer C&amp;J Clark, had long been divided over the issue. The place had been dry since 1883 when William Clark, son of the Quaker founder, bought the pub facing the original factory and converted it into a coffee house. It was done, he said, in the interests of his employees' moral welfare. In the end, some of the current generation including William's great grandson, Mr John Clothier, won the licence through sheer persistence. The licence fight was only a small skirmish in a widening break with the past. Since then, a rapidly growing number of family members have become willing to change with the times, and to yield control of the company they have run in distinctive Quaker style for 167 years. The only problem is, family animosity is still running high and some members do not trust others to handle the transition to best advantage. Mr Clothier, managing director, is one of the new breed willing to back outsiders. A fast-talking, brusque man, he appears determined not to let emotion cloud business - unless someone criticises the quality of Clark shoes. He is also the first Clark running the business not to have come from the manufacturing division. Mr Clothier was weaned on retail, which Clark's entered for the first time seriously in the 1970s. Mr Clothier is not alone in his pragmatic approach. For the vast majority of Clarks, their sole links with the company are share certificates and the welcome dividend income. As times have become more difficult, many have been frustrated by their inability to cash in their shares. The matter has become more urgent with the prospect of a severe downturn. Many received a rude shock this summer when profits slumped. The board cut the payout and said it could no longer guarantee dividend growth. To some extent, the changes are being forced on the family by external factors: Clark's vast expansion in the 1950s and 60s; and the harsh environment which has crippled the UK shoe industry in recent years. Both call for ruthless business skills and vast amounts of cash. The company also found itself stretched financially following its buy-back of Pounds 40m of family shares two years ago. But many in Clark's and the community pin the changes on the family's alienation from its roots in Street. For the first time in Clark's history, the 11 board members live around the country. According to one employee: 'That is the difference from the generation which ran Clark's in the 1960s. The family is split geographically and emotionally.' The locals in Street find it difficult to come to terms with the current generation of Clarks. For years, Streetonians regarded the family as their own and factory work as their right. Now they never see the family and the jobs are no longer there. The recent closure of the company's last shoe factory in the town where it all began was felt by many to be unforgiveable. The once proudly-quoted phrase 'Clark's made Street and Street made Clark's' is now uttered with the bitterness of the betrayed. Local officials, meanwhile, fear the closure could foreshadow Clark's abandonment of Street. Their anxieties have been amplified by talk of a sale. The company is still one of the area's largest employers with 1,000 people working in its Street headquarters. The village was little more than a stagecoach stop, reknowned only for drunkenness, when Cyrus and James Clark began making slippers in 1825. Today it boasts 9,000 souls, several schools, two swimming pools, a theatre, a college and a library. Most of these have been funded by the Clark family. The present day management is still proud of its commitment to the community and its workers. Through a trust fund, Clark's contributes more than Pounds 1m a year to various projects and the subsidised canteen at the headquarters is open to pensioners in search of a warm, cheap meal. Such gestures are not likely to change under the current Clark's management, which puts a high value on the company's traditions. Whether they would survive a change of ownership is another question.</p>

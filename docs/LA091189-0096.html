			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TIES THAT BIND;  </P> <P> ARTS FESTIVAL TRIES TO HELP YOUNG LATINOS UNDERSTAND, APPRECIATE THEIR HERITAGE  </P> <P> Alfredo Calderon divides much of his time between refining the delicate art of  Mexican mask making and defining the history of Mexican folklore.  </P> <P> For the last 10 years, the 34-year-old teacher and artist from Pacoima has done  extensive work and research on both and concludes that, among those of Mexican  descent living in the United States, Mexican culture may be on a rapidly  deteriorating path.  </P> <P> "The youth in the new generation are going through a serious loss of cultural  identity -- they are becoming generic Americans," Calderon said. "They think  eating a few tacos and knowing a little of the language is what being Mexican  is all about. With that line of thought, how can traditions be passed on?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Building Support for Traditions  </P> <P> In an effort to build a better understanding of and increase support for these  traditions, the Mexican-American Arts Council has for eight years sponsored a  festival called "La Jamaica." Calderon was one of 27 Latino artists and  craftsmen showcasing their work at this year's event, held Sunday at the Bowers  Museum Courtyard in Santa Ana. Activities ranged from pinata making to detailed  Mexican baking. As of mid-afternoon, the festival had attracted about 300  people, organizers said.  </P> <P> "Events such this one do help in increasing the awareness of others," Calderon  said from his booth, which displayed many of the masks he has made. "Learning  can take place through so many different channels."  </P> <P> Calderon, who moved to California from Michoacan, Mexico, in 1964, said he  developed his interest in his native country's folklore and mask making at a  time when people were trying to deny their ethnic origins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Had to Assimilate'  </P> <P> "I arrived in (the United States) during the period where you had to assimilate  in order to survive," Calderon said. "There was no support for immigrants, so  it was very easy to forget or at least to try to forget where you came from."  </P> <P> After a short time in the United States, he developed what he calls a mental  renaissance that prompted him to study the history of Mexico before the 1600s.  </P> <P> "We tend to see ourselves and the country of Mexico as something that didn't  exist before we were colonized, before the Europeans . . . 'discovered us' and  said we existed. Our art, music and customs began long before that, and I try  to show that through my art," Calderon said.  </P> <P> It is a lesson he shares with students at the Junior Arts Center in Los  Angeles, where he teaches clay mask making. His masks represent various periods  in Mexican history, including the Mayan and Aztecan. Prices start at $75 and go  as high as $1,500.  </P> <P> "Making the mask doesn't take as much time as doing the actual research,"  Calderon said. "It takes going back and truly understanding the culture and  ideas of people at the time and of course learning from our forefathers."  </P> <P> Another participant at the festival, Ose Arugio, 55, of Santa Ana, said he did  learn valuable lessons from his ancestors. At age 11, in the same village of  Michoacan, his grandfather taught him the craft of of huarache sandal making  just as he had taught Arugio's father before him.  </P> <P> "Everyone in the family learned how to make the shoes," said Arugio, who has  lived in California for 30 years and owns a shoe store in Los Angeles. "It is a  way of life and I taught each of my sons and daughters the art of it, so it is  something that won't die for generations to come."  </P> <P> At Sunday's festival, Ricardo Cardenea of Santa Ana stood with his 1-year-old  daughter and 3-year-old son at the site of a pinata breaking, wishing they  could see an authentic pinata celebration back in his native state of  Zacatecas, Mexico.  </P> <P> "I think this is really nice and great for people like me who have kids and  want them to know about their history," Cardenea said. "Though some of the  things are not the same, they are trying to recognize our way of life and that  is what is important. I am glad I decided to stop."  </P></p>

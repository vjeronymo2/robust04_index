			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth of five installments of article by Alexandru I. </F> Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"]    [Text] Recent recommendations of the International  Monetary Fund [IMF] and the World Bank laid a special emphasis  on the reduction of the arrears. These are unpaid and overdue  debts over many months, sometimes even years. Besides hindering  production, the arrears cause great delays in the paying of  debts toward suppliers, banks, the state budget, and so on.    Over the past years, the overall amount of money blocked in  this way in our economy varied between 1 and 3 trillion lei.  This is a monetary mass parallel to the monetary issue proper.  The discount documents issued for money that has never been  cashed in are actually unproductively piled up money. This  artificially created monetary mass generates inflation because  the initially blocked companies, as well as those subsequently  blocked in a kind of a chain reaction resort to anti-economic  steps in order to overcome the situation: They reduce  production, personnel, and salaries, prefer to manufacture goods  solely for export, and hoard the hard currency they earn. All  this generates inflation.    Arrears are a breeding ground for inflation, because the  money they represent, regardless whether they are debts to be  paid or debts to be cashed, never returns to the monetary  circuit. This is money that is actually buried in a genuine  cemetery of dead money. The covering of arrears of any kind by  taking or granting further bank loans represents inflation  caused by inflation. It is tantamount to a genuine financial  disaster. We resolutely assert this so that the grave mistakes  made over the past years should not be made again. Because it  is not the money that makes the economic situation recover, but  rather the other way round, that is, a betterment can only be  achieved by economic measures, above all by restructuring and  re-equipping the economy.    Besides the state budget deficit and the arrears, the most  grave current aspect of Romania's finances is represented by the  huge volume of the so-called current bank loans, which cannot be  paid back. This is a source of catastrophic inflation.  Currently, the overall volume of bank loans amounts to 4  trillion lei, which greatly exceeds the maximum limit  established by the IMF, a limit which is considered by them as  one of the performance criteria they expect us to comply with.  That criteria was not imposed whimsically by those  international financial and banking bodies, but rather by force  of the objective fact that the loan bleeding also means  inflation, as such money never returns to the circuit of  production.    Out of the total amount of loans, worth 4 trillion lei, over  3.5 trillion, that is, about 90 percent, was granted to the  state-owned economic sector. Some of the public corporations  and the state-owned companies that perform badly, lose money,  produce for stockpiles, or work at low efficiency are unable to  repay the loans they were given. In despair they plunge further  into the red, because they take newer loans that are  increasingly expensive. This may be regarded as a genuine  cemetery of loans, which is continuously growing, and to which  also the due interest ought to be added, which currently amounts  to about 250 billion lei per month.    The growth of inflation, as well as the danger of being left  without capital made the BNR [Romanian National Bank] increase  the interest rate of loans granted in auctions to 120 percent  and the interest rate of the so-called overdraft loans to 250  percent. The other banks cannot reactivate the loans taken  previously and therefore they are compelled to take new loans  from the BNR at a 250 percent interest rate, which they cannot  possibly pay back. Under such circumstances, the latest  restrictive measures and the increase of the interest rates  block economic activity more and more severely.    Currently all ways to finance economy by means of loans are  quite discouraging, because the loans granted in auctions are  offered for merely a few weeks, while in case of the overdraft  loans obtained from the BNR, the commercial banks apply an  interest rate amounting to 260 percent. Under such  circumstances, merely a few hundred million lei's worth of loans  at a 260 percent interest rate were taken, which is very little  compared to the companies' desperate need for funds.    Worried by the rate of inflation, not only companies, but  also banks began to invest their own financial resources in  buildings, automobiles, and other highly valuable goods, which  further reduced their resources to be used to offer loans. The  banks' fear of losing their capital is a far graver phenomenon  than the paralyzing of the economy by prohibitive interest rates  and the cessation of new loans owing to the lack of capital.    Under the circumstances of the rampant increase of the  inflation rate, the excess amount of money existing on the  market cannot be absorbed by the issuing of state bonds or other  similar things, such as the shares of privately owned companies.  This is why the state failed when it issued bonds trying to  borrow money from the population and companies in an attempt to  cover the budget deficit to curb inflation. Each time they  tried, they failed because only a handful of persons were  willing to invest money in slips of paper the value of which was  continuously dropping and their refund date for which lies years  away.    Besides, why should the citizens and the companies trust the  correctness of the state's policy, after they got used to their  hard currency being confiscated, the leu's exchange rate being  arbitrarily established, and their salaries and pensions being  indexed in a proportion that by far does not cover the price  hikes and the increase in taxes, fees, and the suffocating  interest rates? Those who today own bonds issued in the  previous years by the state are currently struggling to regain  their money, as the amounts they invested have depreciated  gravely. The same lack of confidence of the citizens and  companies made the National Road Administration refrain from  issuing bonds so that it could pay back to the state the  14-billion-lei loan it had been given from the state budget for  the initial works on the Bucharest-Constanta freeway, although  Government Decision No. 472 of 29 August 1993 stipulates the  issuing of such bonds.    In order to make bonds more attractive, not only the  interest, but also the invested money should be periodically  indexed on the basis of the evolution of the lei-dollar exchange  rate. But who would venture to do such a thing over many years  in the name of the state, which is accustomed to always gaining  and never losing money in its economic relations with companies  and citizens?    The shares issued by certain privately owned companies also  have a limited scope, first because, in our country, there is  still no stock exchange market where one can trade one's shares  freely; second, because the stock companies do not offer  sufficient shares because they cannot offer annual dividends  that exceed the 100 percent interest rates paid by the BCR  [Romanian Commercial Bank] or the Agricultural Bank.    Generally speaking, bonds and shares, regardless of whether  they have been issued by the state, private companies, or banks,  cannot absorb the inflation.    The fact that bonds and shares, under the circumstances of  the decline of economy, are inefficient means to curb the  aggressive growth of inflation is also proved by the fate of the  so-called property vouchers, which were handed out to the almost  16 million adult citizens of Romania. Considering the value of  140,000 lei attributed by the state to each of those vouchers,  the whole amount exceeds 2.2 trillion lei. However, owing to  the fact that the vouchers cannot be used as shares of very  profitable companies, their actual value is much lower than the  one attributed to them by the state. This is proved by the fact  that in railway stations and markets people offer them for sale  for a few thousand lei. Let us not deceive ourselves: We have  always been and continue to be owners of mere slips of paper.  The ridiculous dividend amounting to 400 lei offered for each  share of the Cluj-based Ursus company -- the first company that  ever issued shares to the population -- clearly reveals the fate  of the property vouchers when they are turned into company  shares.</p>

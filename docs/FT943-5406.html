			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: Extraordinary life of the last great courtesan - No stones are left unturned here, and what stones] LIFE OF THE PARTY: THE BIOGRAPHY OF PAMELA DIGBY CHURCHILL HAYWARD HARRIMAN by Christopher Ogden Little, Brown Dollars 24.95, 504 pages It is necessary to start with a confession, at which book reviewers are often negligent. About two years ago I once had a date with Pamela Harriman. It was not that sort of assignation. Our first meeting was merely the result of a typical Washington dinner circumstance - ie my wife was still in London, my hosts needed an extra man to complement her presence and that was that. The discussion was mostly politics and Mrs Harriman made a forceful, articulate case for the merits of one Bill Clinton (she liked Al Gore, too). I had heard she would be charming company and she certainly was, to the extent that I recall floating home in the dazzle of her smile. A year or so later it came as no surprise when Clinton, now president, nominated her to be ambassador to France. After all, she had been, as much as anyone, responsible for the financial revitalisation of a demoralised Democratic Party in the 1980s and had then been the Clintons' entree to the rarified reaches of Washington power, social and political. In any case, embassies, big and small, are often offered to political supporters regardless of nominal qualifications. Over in London, the just departed Ray Seitz was the first career diplomat ever to represent the US at the Court of St James. She was confirmed by the Senate without demur and, by all accounts, is now doing a first class professional job in Paris. But her road from a stately home in Minterne Magna in Dorset, the daughter of an unremarkable, reserved conservative peer, to sole possession in her own right of the grand residence on the Faubourg St Honore is surely one of the most remarkable ever travelled by a single human of either sex this century. Christopher Ogden's book, even if written with less verve and style than its subject has always possessed, has the wonderful virtue of leaving virtually no stones unturned; and what stones. This was to have been a collaborative venture between Mrs Harriman and Mr Ogden. According to the author, she withdrew after a publishing house had made an advance offer of such magnitude than he told her that to justify it there could be no dissembling. She baulked, but he had 40 hours of frank interviews and lots of other material besides under his belt, over which she had no claim. Her lawyers tried to stop him but he persisted. The end product may not be kind to Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman, once described by her second husband as the 'last great courtesan of the century.' But it is very hard not to admire what she has accomplished and even, for those disinclined to make moral judgments, how she did it. Consider, first, the men in her life. She wed three of them - Randolph Churchill, only son of Winston; Leland Hayward, the Broadway impresario; and finally Averell Harriman, 30 years after a first torrid wartime affair with the US statesman while still nominally married to the lecherous, drunken Randolph. Then consider some of the men she bedded in a blitzed London where living for the moment, not the morrow, was often the rule of the game: Ed Murrow, the legendary US wartime broadcaster from London, who, in the end, would never leave his wife; probably Bill Paley of CBS; two flying commanders, 'Peter' Portal of the RAF and Fred Anderson of the US Air Force; and 'Jock' Whitney, also later to be US ambassador. For a dozen years after the war, in postwar Paris and on Mediterranean villas and yachts there was the Aly Kahn, Gianni Agnelli and Elie de Rothschild and, possibly, Stavros Niarchos. In the US, after Hayward's death, it looks as though there was, briefly, Frank Sinatra. Though opportunities presented themselves, there was never John Kennedy. She lived through and in extraordinary times. Her relationships with Harriman and Murrow made her, when barely out of her teens, a catalyst in the ever closer Anglo-American relationship before Pearl Harbour. At least this is the role that Beaverbrook and Harry Hopkins, FDR's right hand, encouraged her to play and one to which Churchill himself had no objection, since it suited his purposes, he was fond of her and knew only too well Randolph's awful shortcomings. She was in regular attendance at the prime minister's table. When she left for Paris last year, she read from a letter sent to her by Charles de Gaulle after one such occasion. At the other end of the scale of importance, she learned the hard way that years of skilful, attentive service to the likes of Agnelli's jet set could bring a luxurious lifestyle and baubles beyond number (and she acquired superb but expensive taste) but never emotional or financial security. She was, simply, too independent and, lack of formal education notwithstanding, too intelligent ever to be the sort of woman they would marry or desert a wife for. When Rothschild ditched her, she saw the limits of European glamour - she already had fallen out of love with her native England - and fled to the US. There is a lot about the nasty Pamela in this book. Mr Ogden tells in excruciating detail of her neglect of young Winston (The Child), her animosity to the Hayward children (already recounted in Brooke Hayward's 1977 memoir, Haywire), her determination to eliminate all evidence of Marie Harriman's long marriage to Averell, her manipulation of the old statesman in his dotage. No wonder she withdrew her cooperation. But her widow's years have been good to her bank account, to her looks and to her reputation, nothing more than the approval and affection of tough political cookies like Bob Strauss and, before his fall, Clark Clifford. She is now free to wheel, deal, think and exercise authority. Few of the great courtesans of history ever ended in such glory.</p>

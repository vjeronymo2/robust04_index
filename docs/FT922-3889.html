			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: No-frills investment banker stays ahead of the game - The new chief executive at Alex Brown, the Baltimore-based securities house LUNCH at the oldest investment bank in the US is a modest affair. There are no thick-carpeted dining rooms, nouvelle cuisine dishes or stunning Manhattan views when you break bread with the top brass at Alex Brown &amp; Sons. This is not surprising, considering the firm is based in Baltimore, not New York. Despite its venerable age and blue-blooded history (it was founded in 1800), Alex Brown does not put on Wall Street's airs and graces. Over a simple chicken salad in a basement boardroom, Mr Buzzy Krongard, the firm's ex-marine chief executive, dispenses maritime metaphors with abandon. 'The skill is in rigging our ship so that we are prepared to take maximum advantage when the wind picks up behind us,' he says. Mr Krongard is alluding to Alex Brown's strong performance in 1991 and so far this year, when the company exploited handsomely its position as one of the country's most experienced investment banks at taking new companies to the stock market. In the past year and a half, and especially in the last 12 months, US companies launched initial public offerings (IPOs) of their stock in unprecedented numbers. The rush was spurred by strong demand from investors for equities and record-breaking share prices, which persuaded capital-hungry companies the time was right to raise funds for refinancings and expansion. Many of the newcomers were from the young, fast-growing industries such as healthcare, biotechnology development and computers - of the type that Alex Brown had a decade of experience in bringing to the market. With so many companies in their specialist industries going public, Alex Brown reaped the benefits of the IPO avalanche. Of the Dollars 24.3bn raised in IPOs last year, Alex Brown accounted for Dollars 5.9bn in 38 separate issues, making it the leading IPO house in the nation (when deals are measured by full credit to lead manager). The strength of the IPO business lifted the company's profits to a record Dollars 52m in 1991. Its return on equity of 26.5 per cent was the second-best in the industry. In the first quarter of this year, however, Alex Brown's share of the IPO business shrank. In the opening three months it lead-managed just seven IPOs valued at Dollars 410.3m. The chief explanation for the drop-off is that the industries which the company specialises in had a difficult quarter. To counteract the ups and downs of the IPO world, the company relies on its retail broking, asset management and (to a lesser extent) mergers and acquisitions businesses. On the retail side, Alex Brown has just under 400 brokers, whose average annual production of Dollars 420,000 each in 1991 was the best in the industry. Alongside its retail broking operations, there is a growing asset management business. Last year, managed assets rose 19 per cent in 1991 to Dollars 47.6bn, and the company is currently adding new products and services (fixed-income and environmental funds, for example) to bolster that growth. Alex Brown is keen to build up its M&amp;A business, but it is sticking to its specialist industries. Mr Mayo Shattuck, the 37-year-old president, says the company hawks its industry, not its M&amp;A, expertise to prospective clients. Alex Brown has been fortunate that the decline in M&amp;A has been offset by a boom in financial restructurings, especially in the pre-packaged bankruptcy business. 'The beauty for us is that we weren't involved in screwing up those companies in the first place,' says Mr Shattuck. Part of Alex Brown's corporate restructuring business includes its new bond trading operation in New York. Unlike former days when the fixed-income desk acted like an island within the company, it will be a fully integrated part of the investment banking division, focusing on the high-yield end of the bond market. Another new area is US/Japanese cross-border transactions, especially joint ventures. Alex Brown has been able to pursue new ventures because of some welcome stability at the top. It is a relatively new phenomenon. In 1989, after running into financial difficulties, the management of Alex Brown shifted from chief executive Mr Hebb to a power-sharing committee of three - Mr Hebb, the chairman, Mr Griswold, and Mr Krongard. The experiment with the 'chief executive triumvirate' proved a disaster, and Mr Hebb eventually stepped down in late 1990. There followed a morale-sapping seven-month search for a new chief executive, undertaken against the background of an unsettling power-struggle between the old retail broking professionals and the young turks of investment banking and capital markets. It was not until Mr Krongard's appointment as sole chief executive in July last year that peace and stability was restored. Today, with earnings at record levels and the ship sailing along nicely, the chairman can joke about it all. 'Everyone at the time talked about an old guard and a new guard,' says Mr Griswold. 'Well, today there is only one guard, and that's Buzzy Krongard.'  ------------------------------------------------      INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF STOCK 1991          (Full credit to lead manager)  ------------------------------------------------ Manager                               dollarsm Alex Brown                               5,948 Merrill                                  3,682 Goldman                                  2,869 First Boston                             1,631 Prudential Securities                    1,512 Morgan Stanley                           1,174 Lehman Bros                              1,095 PaineWebber                                961 Piper, Jaffray                             552 Salomon Bros                               517 First quarter 1992 Merrill                                  2,032 Morgan Stanley                           1,556 Goldman                                  1,151 PaineWebber                                714 Salomon Bros                               672 Dean Witter Cap Mkts                       511 Lehman Bros                                480 Piper, Jaffray                             439 Alex Brown                                 410 Donaldson Lufkin                           332  ------------------------------------------------ Source: IDD Information Services  ------------------------------------------------</p>

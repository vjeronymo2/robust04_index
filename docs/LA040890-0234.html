			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS  </P> <P> EASY RIDER  </P> <P> In 1969, it transcended the biker genre with the extraordinary perspective it  brought to its depiction of a couple of hippie types (Peter Fonda and Dennis  Hopper) on a collision course with reactionary America. Dominating is Jack  Nicholson's alcoholic lawyer.  </P> <P> Sunday at 3 p.m. KCOP  </P> <P> ANOTHER WOMAN  </P> <P> One can regret a virtual total absence of humor in this 1988 Woody Allen film  and still be beguiled by it. At its center is Gena Rowlands as a successful  professional woman of 50, who is at last confronted with the truth that she has  distanced herself from her emotions all her life. Sandy Dennis is especially  memorable amid a huge, typically distinguished Allen cast.  </P> <P> Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Showtime  </P> <P> SUNDAY, BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> Written by Penelope Gilliat, this 1971 film remains among director John  Schlesinger's very best. It offers a witty, detached-yet-compassionate view of  a successful middle-aged London physician (Peter Finch) and Glenda Jackson as  his wry, younger, less affluent rival for the affections of handsome Murray  Head, who professes to love them both.  </P> <P> Saturday at 3:30 a.m. KABC Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

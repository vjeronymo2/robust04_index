			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Cautious start to 1994 London's financial markets got off to a cautious start yesterday in the first day of trading of 1994, writes Gillian Tett. With market operators now focused on the likely impact of the meeting of the Bundesbank council tomorrow and publication of the US non-farm payroll figures on Friday, dealers were hesitant about taking strong positions too early in the week. But though trading was fairly light yesterday, the strengthening of the dollar and sterling, and weakness of the yen and D-Mark, highlighted trends that seem set to underpin the currency markets in the first few weeks of the new year. Sterling yesterday rose against most major currencies after the publication of higher than expected M0 figures in Britain. Provisional, seasonally adjusted M0 grew by 5.8 per cent in the year to December, several points higher than the 5.2 per cent growth that had been expected by the market. The well publicised boom in retail sales over the Christmas period had already encouraged most money market dealers to discount some rise in M0. But the rise partly dampened speculation about the possibility of early UK rate cuts. Sterling rose  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.578, up from DM2.572 the day before. It also gained slightly against the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4815, up from a previous level of Dollars 1.4805. However, although dealers expect sterling to continue to strengthen against the D-Mark, opinions remain very mixed about the possibility of a British rate cut. In spite of the release of strong housing figures yesterday, the latest in a string of positive economic data, analysts point out that the effect of tax rises in the spring could undermine the economic recovery. Nevertheless, they point out that another factor that could trigger a rate cut would be the further strengthening of sterling in the coming months. 'The market's perception is that the Bank of England does not want to see a strong sterling. The feeling in the markets is that the Bank of England will knock sterling down if it breaks through the DM2.60 level,' said Mr Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan. The dollar yesterday continued to maintain its bullish tone in both European and US trading. Although profit-taking contributed to a slightly uneven rise, it made further gains against the yen and D-Mark. In early London trading the dollar hit a new high of DM1.7480, before ending at DM1.7400, up from the previous day's close of DM1.7370 in European trading. The dollar also continued to make inroads against the yen, closing at Y113.2, up from a previous Y112.4. But in New York it finished at DM1.7355 and Y112.65. With the outlook for the Japanese economy likely to remain gloomy, dealers yesterday said that the yen seemed set to remain weak against the dollar in the near future, not least because of the continuing political uncertainty in Japan. However, the dollar's gains in recent days have provoked differing predictions about the sustainability of the rise. Mr Julian Callow, currency economist with Kleinwort Benson, predicts that the dollar is now 'on its way up' against both the D-Mark and the yen, and believes it could hit DM1.80 and Y115 in the near term. Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, however, thinks that Monday's strong dollar push is unlikely to be sustained. 'How much more of a growth story can you build into the US?', she wonders, pointing out that the performance of the dollar could be sharply affected by the publication of the non-farm payroll figures on Friday. One point of consensus, though, across the market, is that the D-Mark will remain weak against most major currencies. The publication of West German industrial production figures showing a sharper than expected fall of 2.1 per cent in November pushed the D-Mark down yesterday, and fuelled speculation about the likelihood of another rate cut soon. Although dealers remain uncertain that this will occur when the Bundesbank council meets tomorrow, they point out that a rate reduction is widely expected by the end of this month. Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo bank, yesterday said: 'The market particularly feels that the Bundesbank will cut rates either on Thursday or on the 20th.' Meanwhile, a comment from the Swedish central bank governor indicating that further rate cuts were unlikely in Sweden helped to push the Swedish kronor up significantly against the D-Mark. It ended at DM0.2106, up from a previous day's close of DM0.2079. The Central Bank of Portugal yesterday followed the downward trend in European interest rates by shaving  1/8 percentage point off its money market intervention rate, offering eight-day certificates at 9.875 per cent to absorb liquidity and offering to inject eight-day funds at 10.875 per cent. Dealers pointed out that the move was widely expected, given the steady performance of the escudo in recent weeks. The Bulgarian lev slid at noon to a record low of 34.80 to the dollar on a nervy local forex market, dealers said. They could not explain whether the new turmoil was pure speculation or a result of real dollar demand, but several banks and financial houses bid for dollars without bargaining. However, it later partially recovered.  ------------------------------------- Jan 4           Close     Prev. close  ------------------------------------- Pounds spot     1.4860      1.4755 1 mth           1.4830      1.4726 3 mth           1.4787      1.4685 1 yr            1.4675      1.4573  -------------------------------------</p>

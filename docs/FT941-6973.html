			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Antarctica, beyond the comfort zone - Michael J. Woods watches seals, terns and whales in inhospitable waters With hardly a sound, the sea lapped on to the shore of granite, ground to a silky smoothness by ice and water - itself blanketed by a layer of snow. Portly crab-eater seals lay enveloped in the folds of this fluffed and plumped duvet or sprawled on bluish ice floes carved and drawn like glass into delicate graceful shapes by the sea. Distant cliffs of rock and ice loomed through a mist of floating flakes of a soft shower of snow. Antarctic terns cried and hovered over a shoal of fish, diving and then swooping upwards on confident wings. But from a distance came the sudden roar of a collapsing ice cliff which, with immense force, sent a surge of waves sweeping into the bay, a timely reminder that Antarctica is far from placid and, even in the austral summer, can be fierce and inhospitable. I had come here to fulfil a childhood dream born out of Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton, nurtured by Edmund Hillary and Vivien Fuchs and given a final push by David Attenborough's BBC series, Life In The Freezer. From Punta Arenas in southern Chile our cruise ship, World Explorer, had navigated the Beagle Channel, rounded the Horn and then braved the Drake Passage, a two-day gauntlet run by every visitor to the Antarctic Peninsula. The gods had been kind, and we stole into the shelter of the South Shetland Islands with half a day in hand. This gave us time to slip into the Weddell Sea, gliding delicately between tabular icebergs which had calved from the ice shelf and were drifting slowly away from the continent. These flat-topped monoliths, like blocks of flats badly cast in concrete, towered high above the seven decks of the ship. That a further eight ninths plunged into the depths below was almost beyond comprehension. Although there were some on board who had no intention of going ashore, and others who simply wanted to tick off their final continent, many of the passengers told me that they really weren't 'cruise people.' They were there because the only way that Antarctica is readily accessible to ordinary visitors is by cruise ship. These not only provide comfortable accommodation with minimal impact on the environment, but visits to the shore by inflatable Zodiac can be more easily controlled. I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial check by an observer from the National Science Foundation who had come along to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by its own controlling body, the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (Iaato). This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a tiny proportion of the continent, grows. Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of passengers are ashore. As a result, the expedition leader's advice to take an early Zodiac ashore and catch the last one back was worth heeding. On one of my trips ashore I watched a mass of chin-strap penguins in an odoriferous rookery high on a stony hillside. There were birds feeding chicks, stealing pebbles from their neighbours' nests, preening, displaying or making their ponderous and squelchy way over dirty snow to and from the sea. On the shore below, a steaming heap of elephant seals wobbled irritably as one animal tried to burrow further into the pile. Occasionally things proved too much and a pair reared up, snorting and lunging, until honour was satisfied and the two brown blancmanges settled down once more. As we climbed aboard the last Zodiac to leave our final landfall at Port Lockroy, one of the guides spotted the blow of a humpback whale a short distance away, and we set off over the choppy water for a closer look. The three great mammals were in no hurry and lazed along on the surface, breathing noisily before arching their backs with utmost grace and sliding into the depths, lifting their tails clear of the water - called fluking - before disappearing with hardly a ripple. The Zodiac, which for a few seconds had been dwarfed by cetacean tails, erupted with elated cries. We followed the circular upwellings of water created by thrusts of their flukes, and were there when they resurfaced after just 3 1/2 minutes. Again they lazed on the surface; again they fluked. But time was passing and we had to return to the World Discoverer. Back on board, the mother ship began to shadow the whales. The sun was falling in a clear, pale blue sky and our position between the Antarctic Peninsula and several large islands felt as if we were sailing on a vast lake surrounded by the soaring spires of mountains, unnamed and unexplored, with dark, snow-dusted peaks piercing the huge iceflows. These, the product of decades of snow, clawed down the mountain sides and crumpled over folds in the underlying rock before calving chunks into the dark blue Antarctic Ocean. The great cetaceans had the muscle to outpace us had they wished, yet they continued on their leisurely way, fluking and diving to delighted cheers from the bows. It would be hard to think of a natural spectacle more magnificent than watching these massive mammals in a primeval landscape of such grandeur, so outside the human dimension as to be at once both humbling and awe-inspiring. Most of those on the ship - some were extremely well-travelled - were unlikely to experience a scene of such power and splendour anywhere else. Michael Woods travelled to Antarctica c/o Clipper Voyages: Suite 301, Albany house, 324-326 Regent Street, London W1R 5AA. Reservations: 071-436-2931. The company runs adventure cruises during the austral summer (16 nights or more). All-inclusive prices, including airfares, transfers, hotels where necessary, full board on the ship and insurance, start from Pounds 4,606 (1994-1995 season) for the 16-night cruise that Woods experienced (two departures: Dec 4 1994 and Jan 2 1995). Clipper will be operating a further six voyages to the Antarctic, taking in, additionally, the Falklands and South Georgia. World Discoverer handles a maximum of 138 passengers. Clothing: Clipper provides a padded parka but other items are essential. Thermal underwear as a base layer, and good quality fleece garments such as those made by Mountain Equipment (tel: 061-366-5020) as an intermediate layer, should be covered with a windproof outer shell. The parka is fine but Woods found a Goretex outer over a down jacket more flexible. Waterproof trousers and wellingtons are essential in the Zodiacs and for wet landings. Photography: take plenty of film as well as spare batteries, which are exhausted more quickly in the cold. A tripod is useful at the penguin rookeries and for the seals. Carry polythene bags to protect your gear.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Revco hearing set to start A BANKRUPTCY court hearing to consider the stalemate situation at Revco, the Ohio-based drugstore chain, is to begin tomorrow. Over the weekend, none of the three rival reorganisation plans put forward for the bankrupt retailer won outright backing from creditors. The Revco-backed creditor plan had majority support from four of the seven groups of creditors - the bank and trade creditor classes, and two classes of bondholders. A proposal from Rite-Aid, which essentially involved the competing drug retailer in acquiring Revco, won support from two classes of creditors. A third plan from Jack Eckerd, another drugstore chain, had support from one class. Revco appeared hopeful that the weight of support in favour of the creditor plan would encourage the bankruptcy court judge to force this plan on other dissenting groups. However, there was no sign that Rite-Aid would back out of the contest and Revco conceded that it expected some objections to be voiced at the court hearing. Revco was taken private via a Dollars 1.25bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, but filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code in mid-1988. It runs around 1,140 drug stores.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIKE RIDERS IN THE SKY -- PLAN CALLED SAFE FOR ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Bicycle riders who risk life and limb to commute to UCLA may one day be able to  pedal above the madding crowd on a four-lane elevated bikeway.  </P> <P> After six years of study, an environmental impact report has concluded that the  envisioned two miles of bike freeway, called a veloway (from the Latin velox,  for quick), can be built without significant harm to the environment.  </P> <P> The report represents a significant step forward for what would be the first  bikeway of its kind in the world.  </P> <P> Boosters, who packed a public hearing last week, extolled the proposed bikeway  as a boon to the environment that will draw bike riders who are now daunted by  traffic on the roads leading into Westwood.  </P> <P> "By far the most dangerous thing I do is ride my bike to work," cyclist John  Wiley said to the standing-room-only crowd of more than 150 at the UCLA Faculty  Center on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The West L.A. Veloway is unusual also in that the concept and the 13-year  effort to make it a reality have come from the community, not a public agency.  </P> <P> The tentative route starts at UCLA and heads south through Westwood Village  along an alley parallel to Gayley Avenue. It crosses the Wilshire  Boulevard-Veteran Avenue intersection via an overpass, then continues south  along Veteran and turns west through Westwood Park, where it splits into two  segments.  </P> <P> One elevated segment goes down the middle of Sepulveda Boulevard to just south  of Santa Monica Boulevard. The other segment goes west, crossing Sepulveda  Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway on another overpass to the Veterans  Administration property. West of the freeway it splits again, with one branch  heading northwest to connect with San Vicente Boulevard, a traditional bike  lane to the beach. The other branch goes southwest to connect with Texas Avenue  near University High School.  </P> <P> Some portions, including the part in Westwood Village, will be at street level.  The highest point will be the freeway overpass, 24 feet above the traffic. The  rest of the above-ground segments are planned at 17 feet high and 16 feet wide.  </P> <P> The notion of cyclists zooming above the freeway has been viewed as a pipe  dream by some. As UCLA Law School Prof. Michael Asimow observed at the hearing:  "Everyone scoffed, including myself. 'Come on. This can never be built. This is  Los Angeles.' "  </P> <P> Even the originator of the idea, UCLA Prof. Emeritus Paul Boyer, said he had  concluded the project was too difficult to undertake.  </P> <P> But a group of dogged biking enthusiasts, headed by urban planner Ryan Snyder,  have stuck with the idea and now find themselves at last in a position to make  it happen.  </P> <P> But not tomorrow. The environmental impact report still has to circulate to the  public and the local, state and federal agencies involved. In an effort to keep  costs down, the bikeway has been routed through public land as much as  possible, but this means that permits have to be obtained from agencies ranging  from the Veterans Administration to the Fire Department.  </P> <P> Snyder said the estimated $7 million needed to build the veloway has not been  raised, but he said he is hopeful the Los Angeles County Transportation  Committee and the city of Los Angeles might fund the bikeway, as they have  other less ambitious cycling lanes.  </P> <P> Though little opposition was expressed at the hearing, some may surface,  especially concerning the aesthetics of a structure 17 feet in the air. Snyder  vows to make the elevated stretches of the veloway pleasing to the eye.  </P> <P> "I insist they are not going to be ugly," he said.  </P> <P> Community activist Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood and a UCLA  professor, explained that the bikeway is so near and dear to the community,  it's almost unpatriotic to criticize it.  </P> <P> "There is an enthusiasm about an alternative to automobiles," she said.  </P> <P> That enthusiasm was expressed repeatedly at the hearing, as cyclists touted  their avocation as a healthy alternative to pollution and traffic and a small  contribution toward slowing the greenhouse effect by cutting down on the use of  fossil fuels.  </P> <P> Westwood homeowner Alan Friedman took the aesthetic issue head on: "Is it more  aesthetic to have a beautiful veloway or another parking structure?" he asked.  "I don't think it's even a close test.'  </P> <P> The cost of parking lots was raised too. David Eisenberg, chairman of the West  L.A. Veloway committee, told the crowd that the cost of the veloway is  comparable to what UCLA recently spent for 133 parking places. If ridership  surveys are accurate, the proposed bikeway could draw 4,000 riders a day.  </P> <P> "Let's show Los Angeles can take its problems in its hands and make a bold,  innovative solution," Eisenberg said.  </P> <P> Though faced with a complex permit process, Snyder said, he is optimistic  because most of the agencies in question have been involved in the proposal  from the outset, and virtually all elected officials from Sen. Alan Cranston to  City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky have endorsed the veloway in concept.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley is the latest official to come on board. A letter from him  read at the hearing lauded the bikeway as visionary.  </P> <P> If any politician has been the bikeway's angel, it is County Supervisor Ed  Edelman, who helped secure about $100,000 from the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission for the environmental impact report. He also  guaranteed the commission its money back if the project does not reach  fruition.  </P> <P> An initial study of the project costing $67,500 was paid for out of Edelman's  road funds, UCLA and Caltrans, Snyder said.  </P> <P> From the mood of the partisans at the hearing, they are ready to move from the  drawing board to the road.  </P> <P> Asimow lauded the veloway as a "great triumph of citizen action."  </P> <P> "Let's build it," he said.  </P></p>

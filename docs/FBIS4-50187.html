			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has  accelerated the pace in upgrading its cultural facilities, while  its infrastructures such as highways, bridges and subways are  becoming the focus of attention both at home and abroad.    This year, the city will pour 1.4 billion yuan into several  important facilities, including the Shanghai Library, Shanghai  Museum and a television station in the Pudong New Area.    From 1991 to 1995, Shanghai plans to inject more than four  billion yuan into the field, compared with 536 million yuan in  the 1986-1990 period.    According to its ambitious plan, this biggest city in China  will boast a batch of advanced facilities involving theaters,  cinemas, music halls, book stores and gymnasiums before the end  of this century. The investment is estimated at about 10  billion yuan.    Despite the allocation from local government, most of it is  to be raised through various channels, like land leasing, stock  issuance and other flexible measures to absorb domestic and  foreign funds.    A top official of the municipality said that these  facilities  are important for improving the citizens' quality and building  Shanghai into a first-class international city.    At present, the city with a population of 13 million has  less  than 5,000 entertainment spots, 66 cinemas and 31 libraries, far  from enough to meet the inhabitants' urgent demands resulting  from rapid economic growth.</p>

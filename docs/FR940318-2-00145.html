			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> VIII. Application and Implementation Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under the FY 1994 targeted assistance program, States would apply for and receive grant awards on behalf of qualified counties in the State. A single allocation would be made to each State by ORR on the basis of an approved State application. The State agency would, in turn, receive, review, and determine the acceptability of individual county targeted assistance plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in FY 1994, TAP funds will be awarded through a more streamlined grant process similar to that used for the ORR social services formula grant program. An application and assurances will still be required of the States eligible to receive TAP funding. Guidance on application content will be provided later this year in the FY 1994 final targeted assistance notice. FY 1994 funds will be available for obligation by the State agency for a period of one year from the date of the grant award. There will be no carryover of unobligated funds into the FY 1995 grant award. Funds obligated by the States during this one-year period must be liquidated within 2 years from the date of obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although funding for educational services in Dade County, FL, and for medical services at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, FL, is part of the appropriation amount for targeted assistance, the scope of activities for these special projects will be administratively determined. Applications for those funds are therefore not subject to provisions contained in this notice but to other requirements which have been conveyed separately. Similarly, the requirements regarding the 10% portion of the targeted assistance appropriation that will be awarded separately will be addressed in the grant announcement for those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IX. Application Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The proposed State application requirements for grants for the FY 1994 targeted assistance formula allocation are as follows: States that are currently operating under approved management plans for their FY 1993 targeted assistance program and wish to continue to do so for their FY 1994 grants may provide the following in lieu of resubmitting the full currently approved plan: The State's application for FY 1994 funding shall provide: A. Assurance that the State's current management plan for the administration of the targeted assistance program, as approved by ORR, will continue to be in full force and effect for the FY 1994 targeted assistance program, subject to any additional assurances or revisions required by this notice which are not reflected in the current plan. Any proposed modifications to the approved plan will be identified in the application and are subject to ORR review and approval. Any proposed changes must address and reference all appropriate portions of the FY 1993 application content requirements to ensure complete incorporation in the State's management plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Assurance that, for each qualified local area, targeted assistance funds will be used primarily for, but not limited to, services to cash assistance recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Assurance that targeted assistance funds will be used primarily for the provision of services which directly enhance refugee employment potential, have specific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program. States must indicate what percentage of FY 1994 targeted assistance formula allocation funds will be used for employment services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Timetables for awarding funds to the local areas consistent with the conclusion of services under the FY 1993 program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Poll results -- A story in Sunday's Times Orange County Edition incorrectly  characterized the nine-point Times Orange County Poll lead that Republican  State Sen. Marian Bergeson holds in the race for lieutenant governor against  Democrat Leo T. McCarthy. The margin represents less than a 100,000-vote edge,  according to pollster Mark Baldassare.  </P></p>

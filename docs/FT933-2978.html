			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Tamworth studying tram feasibility TAMWORTH BOROUGH Council yesterday became the latest authority to commission studies of a tram system designed to link outlying park-and-ride stations to the town centres. The system - Parry People Movers - has been designed to run on narrow-gauge tracks and is powered by an innovative rechargeable flywheel rather than overhead wires or electrified rails. Council officials in Tamworth say the tram is less expensive than larger light transit railways and does not require major construction work. Plans to reintroduce trams have been taken up this week by a number of local authorities seeking a solution to increasing traffic congestion. Local authorities in Leicester and Ilkeston in Derbyshire are considering the system, which has been pioneered by JM Parry Associates, a design engineering company based in the West Midlands. The company said yesterday that a feasibility study had been commissioned by Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, which was considering trams among the options for a British Rail branch line. Interest in such systems has grown with the success of the tram network in Manchester and the decision by Nottingham, Sheffield and Birmingham to develop light transit railways. Mr Andrew Gordon, a director of JM Parry, said the company had prepared prototype models which had been demonstrated to local authority officials in the Midlands. The company is seeking Pounds 200,000 of equity capital to move from prototype manufacturing to full production. Mr Gordon said: 'We have had approaches from a number of backers and envisage beginning production now that the company has won government approval to be a light transit operator.' Studies of the tram system are expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

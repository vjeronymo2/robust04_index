			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Novell gains OS market foothold NOVELL, the US software company, and Zenith Data Systems, the personal computer subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, have reached an agreement which should give Novell a toe-hold in the market for personal computer operating software. The operating system (OS) is the software program that controls the basic functions of a computer. The OS market is dominated by Microsoft of the US, which charges manufacturers a licence fee for each computer sold with its MS/DOS system. Most of the world's 90m personal computers run MS/DOS. Apple personal computers are the major exception. In January, however, Zenith is set to launch a line of personal computers, called Personal Servers, pre-loaded with Novell's DOS software, a program that directly competes with Microsoft's MS-DOS. Analysts said the move would represent a significant breach of Microsoft's control over the PC operating system software market. A broader deal, being evaluated by Groupe Bull's Zenith as well as Packard-Bell, the US PC manufacturer in which Bull last year acquired a 19.9 per cent stake, could enable Novell to encroach still further into Microsoft's territory. ZDS is considering pre-loading Novell's latest version of DOS on its desktop PC products; PC buyers would be given a choice of using the Microsoft or Novell operating systems. No PC maker has yet pre-loaded its machines with Novell DOS. Computer companies say that is because they are already locked into contracts with Microsoft that require them to pay a royalty fee on every machine they ship. Microsoft, however, asserts that its licensing policies apply to particular PC models, rather than to the full range of a PC manufacturer's products. A spokesman also noted that computer makers can opt to license Microsoft software on a per copy basis, if they choose. With Novell apparently offering more favourable terms than Microsoft for DOS programs, other PC manufacturers are expected to watch Zenith's moves closely. Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell chief executive said: 'These manufacturers are in a low margin business. They want to get computers out the door and make a penny on every one of them. 'They cannot fool around with large dollar issues on the costs of what they ship. Paying Microsoft a royalty is a significant part of the total cost.' Zenith is understood to have spent months searching for a loophole in its Microsoft DOS licensing contract to ensure it would not owe royalties to Microsoft for its new Personal Servers. The contract stated that royalties would not be owed on machines that could not run Microsoft DOS. Zenith engineers made sure this would be the case for the new computers. While allowing computers on a local area network to run existing software, the Personal Server, which controls the network, will be driven by Novell DOS. PC users on the network need not know nor care which operating system is running on the Personal Server, experts say.</p>

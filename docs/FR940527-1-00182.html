			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The row demonstrating the largest benefit from this change is rural Puerto Rico, with an 18.0 percent increase. This stems from the calculation of separate payment rates for Puerto Rico's hospitals, which are equal to 75 percent of the Puerto Rico rate plus 25 percent of the discharge-weighted average of the urban and rural national prospective payment system rates. For FY 1994, for example, the Puerto Rico rate for other urban areas was 26.6 percent greater than the Puerto Rico rural rate. The increase in the national Puerto Rico amount is much smaller, however, so that the payment effect is less than the full increase in the rural Puerto Rico rate. Urban hospitals in Puerto Rico also receive an added increase in payments above those of other urban hospitals, due to the higher national portion. It is far below the rural Puerto Rico increase, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For urban hospitals nationally, the change in payments is slightly above the percentage change in the outlier offsets when moving to a single 5.1 percent offset. The FY 1994 urban outlier adjustment factor was 0.945960, which results in a 5.404 percent offset. To lower the offset to 5.1 percent, an adjustment factor of 0.949 is applied to the standardized amounts. The difference between these two factors is 0.3 percent. The increase in the labor share also has a generally favorable impact on urban hospitals due to their above average wage index values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eliminating the separate rural amount also has the effect of redistributing outlier payments, primarily due to the higher standardized amount paid to rural hospitals. The average rural outlier payment per case falls by 3.0 percent after eliminating the separate rural amount, and the average urban outlier payment per case rises by 0.4 percent. This occurs because fewer rural cases qualify for outlier payments due to the higher DRG payments per case; thus, the outlier thresholds must be revised to maintain the outlier pool at 5.1 percent of total DRG and outlier payments. This leads to additional outlier payments going to outlier cases in urban hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact that many of these cases are also in teaching hospitals and DSH hospitals leads to what we consider an anomalous impact on total payments. Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act, we set outlier payment policies so that estimated outlier payments are 5.1 percent of estimated total DRG payments. Under the statute, estimated outlier payments do not encompass IME and DSH payments made for outlier cases. The amounts of IME and DSH payments are affected by the level of outlier payments so a redistribution of outlier payments to teaching and DSH hospitals has the effect of generating a net increase in total payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> C. The Impact of the Proposed Changes to the DRG Weights (Column 2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In column 2 of Table I, we present the combined effects of the revised DRG classification system, and the subsequent recalibration of the DRG weights incorporating these revised DRGs, as discussed in section II of the preamble to this proposed rule. Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(i) of the Act requires us each year to make appropriate classification changes and to recalibrate the DRG weights in order to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change the relative use of hospital resources. The impact of reclassification and recalibration on aggregate payments is required by section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act to be budget neutral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first row of Table I shows that the overall effect of these proposed changes is budget neutral. That is, the percentage change when adding the proposed FY 1995 GROUPER (version 12.0) to the FY 1995 baseline is 0.0. Since the changes illustrated in the columns of Table I are cumulative, this column reflects the elimination of the separate rural amount in both simulations. Only the version of the GROUPER is different.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the minor changes we are proposing for the FY 1995 GROUPER, the redistributional impacts across hospital groups are very small (an increase of 0.1 for urban hospitals and a decrease of 0.1 for rural hospitals). Among other hospital categories, the net effects are slightly negative changes for small hospitals and slightly positive changes for larger hospitals. The largest single effect on any of the hospital categories examined is a 0.3 percent decrease in payments for rural DSH hospitals with fewer than 100 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

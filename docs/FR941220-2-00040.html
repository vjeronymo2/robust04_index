The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to: (1) amend its listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants, and (3) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Proposed Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CHX seeks to amend Article XXVIII, Rule 8 of the Exchange's rules to provide a higher standard for warrant issuers than currently exists. Specifically, future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150,000,000. Moreover, the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each warrant issue will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Article XXVIII, Rule 8 also will be amended to provide that, for stock index warrants where 25 percent or more of the value of the underlying index is represented by securities that are traded primarily in the U.S., the opening prices of the U.S. traded securities in the index will be used to determine the settlement value of the underlying index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article X, Rule 3 is being amended to apply the customer margin requirements used for broad based index and currency options to index warrants and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants similarly will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that the index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

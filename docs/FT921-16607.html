			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell ends year on top - A year-end round-up of the UK's top merchant bank advisers MORGAN GRENFELL finished 1991 as the UK's top merchant bank adviser, according to the most recent survey by the FT Mergers &amp; Acquisitions International magazine. Preliminary figures show that Morgan Grenfell, which had been leading the field for most of 1991, finished the year at the top of the table for the first time since 1987. The bank now looks to have recovered fully from the loss of command it suffered in the wake of the Guinness affair. Optimists searching for signs of recovery in the debt and recession-hit UK mergers and acquisitions market might take heart from the fact that Morgan Grenfell's final total was almost 50 per cent higher than that with which Baring Brothers filled the top slot a year ago. In terms of deal volume and value the final quarter was the busiest of the year. The top 10 banks in the table acted in 21 new qualifying bids, worth Pounds 6.4bn. This compares with 19 bids worth Pounds 1.13bn in the third quarter, 17 worth Pounds 1.3bn in the second quarter and 10 worth Pounds 2.1bn between January and March. Only bids for UK quoted companies which have been declared unconditional, lapsed or referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, qualify for inclusion. Morgan Grenfell clinched top spot in spite of not being involved in the year's biggest new deals. These were BTR's Pounds 1.55bn bid for Hawker Siddeley and Hanson's recommended offer for Beazer, which was worth about Pounds 1.5bn when the value of debt assumed is included. Baring Brothers, last year's number one UK adviser, dropped to sixth place. Its only major credit was for advising Northern Telecom of Canada in its purchase of STC. Lazard Brothers, which has had a poor year in this respect at least, dropped to 14th place at the year end, from third place in the 1990 rankings. Lazards had no new qualifying UK deals in the final quarter. Second-placed Goldman Sachs continues to be the strongest performing US investment bank in the UK and is breathing down Morgan Grenfell's neck. Goldman featured in only four bids for UK quoted companies in 1991, but the three in which it acted for the target - BTR/Hawker, NorTel/STC and Williams/Racal - totalled Pounds 3.65bn. Goldman is still the only US bank in the top 10 in this table, but there are a further three lurking just outside. SG Warburg leads the table which includes overseas acquisitions and disposals by UK companies. Goldman Sachs leads the international rankings for the fourth year in succession, although its total is a third down on 1988, when the international table first appeared. SG Warburg also performed strongly internationally, shooting up to second place, from ninth a year ago. US banks continue to dominate the table which covers cross-border activity with a European leg, a market which many bankers argue is where the future lies. Six of the top 10 are US banks, with Goldman Sachs almost inevitably in pole position.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL BIDS 1991  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser*                   Value Dollars m    Bids  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs (1)              23,112          40 SG Warburg (9)                 22,582          44 Lazard Group (-)               17,689          36 CS First Boston (5)            17,093          52 Schroder Wagg (3)              15,226          59 Morgan Stanley (2)             13,223          33 Merrill Lynch (4)              12,321          21 Lehman Bros Intl (8)            8,904          22 JP Morgan (6)                   7,025          40 Morgan Grenfell (12)            4,968          35  -------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes cross-border bids and domestic bids where a foreign bank has acted as an adviser.

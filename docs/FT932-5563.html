			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Business levy urged for rail projects A LEVY on London businesses could help finance transport investment in CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension to Docklands and other rail and Underground projects, says London First, the business-led initiative set up last year to promote strategic thinking about the capital. The proposal has been prepared by London First's 16-strong transport group, which is chaired by Mr Peter Foy, the senior partner of management consultants McKinsey. The Department of Transport last night described the proposal as 'interesting and deserving of further consideration'. London First estimates that more than Pounds 17bn will be needed over the next 10 years to fund the renewal of London's rail and Underground systems and to finance new projects. Current government investment plans will provide only 50 per cent of what is needed over the next five years. The group's proposal involves creating an organisation, called the London Transport Funding Trust, to top up government funds. It would draw its income from a levy on businesses - perhaps through an addition to the uniform business rate. The trust would raise capital for transport investment by issuing bonds, servicing the debt from the levy. Mr Foy said: 'A 1p increase in the business rate would raise over Pounds 100m, enough to support approximately Pounds 1bn in bonds. We feel that this is a big enough sum to make a difference to investment in London infrastructure and small enough not to scare off the private sector.' The trust would be majority-owned by the private sector, and run by a board to represent London businesses. Its borrowing would therefore be outside the public sector borrowing requirement, which the government is struggling to constrain. The new funds would provide the private sector with a leadership role in transport investment, according to Mr Foy. It would provide a catalyst for ensuring the timely implementation of priority investments, he said. Mr Foy believes that business would support such a levy if the government committed itself to a long-term agreed investment programme to upgrade the capital's infrastructure.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SATISFYING HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> As Orange County's population increases and housing prices soar ever upward,  developers are building on more and more hillsides in order to meet the huge  demand for housing.  </P> <P> Many residents are justifiably concerned about hillside development. They want  to protect the value of existing properties and preserve many remaining  hillsides as open space and visual relief in our increasingly congested region.  But the public also recognizes that Orange County is growing rapidly, and that  local residents -- now and in the future -- deserve a full range of housing  choices.  </P> <P> How can Orange County residents, city planners, public officials and developers  formulate hillside-growth plans that satisfy all these valid concerns? With  hillside projects in several communities now in various stages of planning, new  attention is being focused on the challenge of finding the best way to put  homes on hillsides without suffering the visual consequences that plagued past  projects.  </P> <P> To begin with, hillside development is not inherently bad. Some of California's  most charming places are characterized by hillside development, such as Laguna  Beach, Beachwood Canyon beneath the HOLLYWOOD sign, and Russian Hill and  Telegraph Hill in San Francisco. Beyond California, consider the Italian and  Greek hill towns, which are some of the most beautiful spots in the world.  </P> <P> What qualities make these high-density hillside communities so appealing? More  to the point, how can these communities provide lessons for hillside  development in today's Orange County?  </P> <P> First of all, many of these successful hillside communities have developed in a  sporadic manner over several decades, if not several centuries. Houses were  usually built one by one. Each building respected the existing site, and so the  combined visual effect did not significantly alter the overall hillside.  </P> <P> Also, houses were built in close proximity to each other to minimize the cost  of roads and connections to existing utilities. Therefore, development occurred  in random clusters, leaving difficult-to-access areas as open space. The result  is a pleasing combination of open space intermingled with developed areas.  </P> <P> Another factor is that roads were designed to adapt to the hillside terrain,  not the other way around. The effect of these narrow, twisting roads was  minimal impact to the natural hillside landforms. Today's road standards are  usually over-designed, making it difficult to follow the natural terrain.  </P> <P> And landscaping is essential for a hillside community. Some of the most  attractive locales have improved over time due to the growth of plantings that  soften the appearance of buildings and help blend development into the  environment. In many respects, a hillside community is like good wine: it  improves with age.  </P> <P> When these communities are viewed from a distance, homes appear to be scattered  in a random fashion, rather than arranged in rows. Street patterns are nearly  indistinguishable. Development follows the overall hillside landform and blends  with surrounding open spaces. The hillsides are preserved -- yet local  residents' housing needs are satisfied as well.  </P> <P> Of course, new Orange County hillside communities will not be developed house  by house over several decades, and excessively narrow and twisting roads are  often impractical. Yet, new communities can still offer the same aesthetic and  environmental pleasures as the older ones, if we create intelligent community  planning and housing design standards that are specifically tailored to the  unique hillside requirements.  </P> <P> Before Orange County residents and public officials can devise improved  planning standards for hillside communities, however, we must discard the  unreasonable zoning dictum -- "the higher the hillside, the lower the density"  -- and then review past disappointments that are the obvious focus of today's  hillside development opponents.  </P> <P> What went wrong in the planning and subsequent construction of these Orange  County communities that are so easily criticized?  </P> <P> The real estate developers and their planners disregarded the natural hillside  landforms by using flatland building techniques. In their eagerness to maximize  flat, buildable land, developers bulldozed hillsides into large, flat pads  terraced into the land in long, straight lines. As a result, the houses and  roads march up and down the hillsides, creating a regimented and unnatural  appearance.  </P> <P> But instead of citing flawed designs as reasons to prevent future hillside  development, let's use the lessons of Laguna Beach and Santa Barbara to  encourage sensitive growth in Orange County.  </P> <P> In planning new communities, developers must learn how to "sculpt" the land. In  other words, they should blend homes into the hillsides, leaving naturally  steep areas as open space and blending better into the existing native  vegetation. They should utilize "hillside adaptive architecture" -- homes that  follow the natural slope and complement existing natural colors. Importantly,  they should landscape the hillside development areas far more intensively than  they do the flatlands so that houses and roads will blend into the terrain.  </P> <P> Not only will these new hillside communities become desirable additions to  Orange County from an aesthetic and environmental perspective, they will also  offer other advantages: protection of existing hillsides, less disturbance of  native vegetation and development plans that will be accepted more quickly by  government agencies and increasingly vocal community residents.  </P> <P> Most important, well-planned hillside communities will create delightful living  environments that will mature over time and offer a greater range of housing  choices for everyone. Isn't that what most Orange County residents want?  </P></p>

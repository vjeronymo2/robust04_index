			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 11 SDG&amp;E WORKERS ARE QUESTIONED AFTER YEARLONG DRUG PROBE  </P> <P> Eleven employees of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric were questioned Wednesday by  company officials after a yearlong undercover investigation into the use and  sale of illegal drugs, SDG&amp;E announced.  </P> <P> Company officials said the investigation, carried out by a local security firm,  centered on four regular employees and seven temporary employees who work in  the customer information center on Ash Street.  </P> <P> Spokesman Dave Smith said the investigation was carried out with the knowledge  and backing of the San Diego Police Department, although no local police  participated. Smith said the employees under surveillance work primarily on the  telephone and don't come in contact with natural gas or "sensitive" equipment.  </P> <P> "They have little face-to-face contact with the public," Smith said. "If you're  moving, or leaving town, or terminating your service, they are some of the  people you might talk to on the phone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Firm's Probe  </P> <P> Smith said the 11 were investigated by Narcorp, a local security firm that  specializes in undercover surveillance for corporations that suspect employees  of drug use. Narcorp officials were unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Smith said that Narcorp gathered material for a year, "developing evidence that  could lead to the firing or even the arrest of one or more employees." The  company will evaluate its findings in tandem with local police to determine "a  course of action."  </P> <P> Officials would not specify what drugs were involved.  </P> <P> "What these people say on the phone can affect the health and well-being of  customers," Smith said. "Some of our customers are on life-support systems. You  wouldn't want somebody like that to have their service cut off by an employee  who might be high on drugs.  </P> <P> "If you're an employee -- say, a worker on the line -- and you know drug abuse  is tolerated by the company, that sends a message we don't want to send. It's a  tone as much as anything we'd like to establish: We will not tolerate drugs."  </P> <P> Smith said the company was "not on shaky legal ground" in investigating  employees undercover.  </P> <P> "Our attorneys are fully aware of everything's that happened," he said.  </P></p>

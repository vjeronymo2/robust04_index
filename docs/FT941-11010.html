			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel: Estimated time of arrival: two days late - Readers' distressing airline experiences We recently asked travellers to tell us their tales of obstructive airlines and how to overcome them. Readers told us of flights delayed for days and of messages to families that were never delivered. One complaining passenger was warned that the airline was big and he was not; if he took legal action, the company would appeal on every procedural point until the traveller ran out of money. The most startling story was of a passenger on a delayed aircraft in New York, who was forced by security guards to hand over film from his camera because he had taken pictures on board. A persistent theme of the letters we received was the airlines' attempts to fob passengers off with flimsy excuses and inadequate compensation. Mr David Darby, a London patent agent, wrote to Continental Airlines last August about a flight his wife and two children had been scheduled to make from Newark, New Jersey, to London. Because the flight was overbooked, they were put on an aircraft to Frankfurt, with three Dollars 200 vouchers as compensation. Mr Darby wrote to the airline to say his family were entitled to cash under European Community regulations. Continental wrote back to say they were not, as the journey began in the US and not the EC. Not true, Mr Darby wrote back. The regulations covered flights starting or ending in the EC. You are quite right, a Continental customer relations official replied. 'I must apologise that the previous correspondence was not factual,' she said. Mr Darby's perseverance paid off. Mr Chandrakant Rabheru, however, a director of a London import and export company, has been waiting 16 months for a written explanation of why his family in the UK was not informed that his British Airways flight from Bombay had been delayed. The flight, which was due to leave Bombay for London at 1.05am on October 11 1992, finally departed at 6.45 in the evening. Mr Rabheru says he gave BA four alternative telephone and fax numbers on which to contact his family. BA staff in Bombay told him his relations had been informed. They had not. Mr Rabheru, a regular BA customer, says the airline apologised on the telephone, but his requests for a written explanation were ignored. BA says it has since transferred all complaints to a new computer system to ensure a quicker response. However, Mr Rabheru's complaint predated the system and BA can no longer trace it. None of the stories we received, however, matched the drama of a Virgin Atlantic flight to London, scheduled to leave JFK airport in New York at 7.15pm on Friday, January 7. Mr Michael Walsh, group finance director of public relations consultants Dewe Rogerson, who was on the flight, says passengers boarded the aircraft but were told take-off would be delayed while de-icing took place. Then they were told a navigation instrument was faulty. Passengers asked for something to eat and drink, but were told they had to be ready to take off at any time. They were not given anything to eat until after midnight. At 2.30am the captain announced that the flight had been cancelled. They were taken to a hotel in New York and eventually told that their flight would be leaving at 7pm on Saturday. But there were further delays due to icy conditions. At 3am on Sunday, the aircraft took off. Shortly afterwards, passengers heard there was a further problem with it, and that they would be returning to JFK. They arrived back at their hotel at 5am on Sunday. Mr Walsh was then told he had been booked on a flight leaving JFK at 9pm on Sunday. He arrived home in London at 10.15am on Monday, two days later than planned. Mr Richard Hamersley, a London solicitor, was on the same flight. While waiting to take off on the Friday night, he decided to photograph a Virgin representative who was assuring passengers all would be well. Two Virgin security guards, one armed, asked him to step behind a curtain on the aircraft. 'The thoroughly unpleasant verbal assault that (then) took place was quite unjustified in the circumstances,' he wrote to Virgin on his return. He says he was taken to the front of the aircraft in full view of his fellow passengers and made to hand the film to the captain. (The captain later returned it to him by post.) He wrote to the company: 'Your security guards were unable to give me any authority for their proposition that my photograph was illegally taken.' Passengers were handed written apologies from Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. Mr Walsh has reached a compensation agreement with Virgin. The company says it is investigating Mr Hamersley's complaint. Of course, the letters we received represent a tiny proportion of flights taken by our readers. Most flights pass without incident. What is noticeable, however, is readers' long memories of those that go wrong. Mr Peter Tray, owner of a London export/import concern, recalls a flight he took in 1953 from Switzerland with British European Airways, one of BA's predecessors. Because of fog in London, passengers were put on a Swissair flight to Paris, where no one from BEA knew anything about them. Spotting a BEA aircraft on the tarmac, the nine passengers concerned found an airline representative and demanded to be flown home. Mr Tray recalls: 'He could only splutter: 'But you can't possibly expect me to authorise an aircraft for just nine passengers.' In the best pantomime tradition, we all chorused: 'Oh yes, we can.' ' If he didn't, they told him, they would debag him. They were flown home. Those were the days.</p>

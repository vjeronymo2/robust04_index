			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATOR SAYS SAT DESIGNED TO BE FAIR  </P> <P> Sam Marchiano's excellent article on young athletes affected by the NCAA's  Proposition 48 shows how important it is to help these students prepare for  college earlier, and to help them realize what adequate preparation entails.  </P> <P> Should Marchiano's article give readers the impression that the SAT is biased  against black and other minority students, let me state emphatically that this  is not the case.  </P> <P> Before a question appears on an SAT, it is scrupulously reviewed and analyzed  by a racially and ethnically diverse panel of experts, then pre-tested by  thousands of students under real-test conditions to detect the slightest sign  of "item bias." It is used in a real SAT only if it is fair for students of  similar ability of any race, ethnic background or gender.  </P> <P> DONALD M. STEWART, The College Board, President, New York  </P></p>

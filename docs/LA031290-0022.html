			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WIDOW LAW TO PREVENT THE TEARS  </P> <P> It's an old scam. A con artist approaches an elderly widow, persuades her to  borrow against her home to pay for a new roof, aluminum siding or similar  improvements. She agrees to what she thinks is a small loan with modest  payments. She actually signs for a huge loan, with a high interest rate and  exorbitant fees and commissions. Unless she can make the high payments, she is,  in effect, signing away her home.  </P> <P> As many as 1,000 elderly widows have lost their homes in South-Central Los  Angeles, according to lawyers familiar with these scams. The problem is equally  severe in East Los Angeles and other neighborhoods where runaway real-estate  appreciation has boosted by tenfold or more the value of houses purchased and  paid for decades ago.  </P> <P> In just one recent example, a Watts widow was scheduled to lose her house until  Legal Aid lawyers got involved. She wanted to replace her windows because of  drafts. She unknowingly agreed to a $40,000 loan at an interest rate higher  than 25% -- double the prevailing mortgage rate. She lacked the income to  qualify for the loan, but according to the lawyers, the middlemen claimed she  had income from rental property; she didn't. She was expected to make a loan  payment that was more than double her meager monthly income. The deal included  an $11,000 "finders fee" that was actually a commission; a $5,000  "title-cleansing" fee, and an additional $2,000 for points.  </P> <P> Legislation recently introduced by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) would  help discourage such rip-offs. The measure, SB 2641, would require the  salespeople who go after vulnerable widows to at least be bonded and licensed  by the state.  </P> <P> The measure would also hold finance companies and investors, many of whom are  wealthy, liable for any misrepresentations made by smooth-talking salespeople  or so-called financial consultants who go door-to-door in search of the deals.  By making the investors liable, according to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los  Angeles, the proposed law would make it easier for courts to rule in favor of  homeowners and prevent the loss of homes.  </P> <P> The Torres bill wouldn't protect every naive homeowner. Nor would it stop every  con artist. But it would provide additional protections for the vulnerable, and  put the greedy on notice.  </P></p>

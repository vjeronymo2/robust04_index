			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / BT cuts phone link charges BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday announced cuts in the cost of line connection for both business and domestic customers, Alan Cane writes. The changes bring the cost of installing the first telephone for a business with a single line down to Pounds 116.33, including value added tax, from Pounds 179.49. The corresponding reduction for home lines is from Pounds 163.75 to Pounds 116.33. The cuts will be effective from June 1 this year. The new prices are part of BT's compliance with its agreement with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to keep price changes on a range of services to 6.25 percentage points below the rate of inflation.</p>

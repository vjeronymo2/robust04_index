			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SWEETWATER WINS, 61-53, IN BATTLE FOR FIRST PLACE  </P> <P> Arms folded and eyes staring straight ahead, Southwest High School Coach Steve  Selland could only dream of a rematch.  </P> <P> "I wish we could play them again," Selland said Wednesday night after Southwest  lost to visiting Sweetwater, 61-53, in what may be remembered as the game of  the season in the Metro Conference.  </P> <P> Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra stopped short of wishing for a rematch, but said  the teams could meet again and again, with an eventual victor unlikely to  emerge.  </P> <P> "We could play 10 more times," Ybarra said, "and we'd probably split five and  five."  </P> <P> Both teams had much at stake. For fifth-ranked Sweetwater, it was the chance to  redeem itself from its only loss to Southwest, 61-57, on Jan. 6 at Sweetwater.  It would also give the Red Devils a chance to take over first place in the  conference standings. Sweetwater (22-2 overall, 11-1 in conference) is now a  half-game ahead of third-ranked Southwest (18-6, 10-1).  </P> <P> Sweetwater denied Southwest the victory with a third-quarter 20-11 run that was  highlighted by Cortez Rice's seven points and Ruben Hernandez's six points.  </P> <P> Add a basket by John Gilbert and the Red Devils had a 37-27 lead with 3:38  remaining in the quarter.  </P> <P> "Cortez Rice was the difference for them tonight," Selland said. "He'd take  those outside shots. My outside shooters just didn't do it." Rice finished with  19 points.  </P> <P> Southwest came back to within six at the end of the third quarter on a  controversial goaltending call that made Sweetwater's lead, 42-36.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Southwest tied the score, 45-45, with 5:41 remaining,  when Sweetwater called a timeout. The Red Devils came back with a 9-0 run that  left Southwest stunned.  </P> <P> Will Tate, who led the Raiders with a game-high 30 points, said Southwest just  wasn't playing like a team.  </P> <P> "We just couldn't get it together today," Tate said. "Our strength is good  chemistry, and today we weren't in sync."  </P> <P> Sweetwater held Adalberto Silva, the Raiders' leading scorer, to 12 points.  </P> <P> Said Ybarra: "They had a heck of a defensive game. Anytime they went inside, we  double-teamed them. They played disciplined."  </P> <P> Sweetwater, which made only 11 for 31 shots in the first half, trailed by 13-10  after the first period and 25-22 by the end of the second quarter, when  Southwest employed a spread defense to hold on to its slim lead.  </P> <P> "I told them to keep their composure," Ybarra said. "I told them that the shots  they were taking were good, they were just missing on a couple."  </P> <P> Carlos Campbell had 16 points for Sweetwater.  </P></p>

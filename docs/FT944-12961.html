			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Tax-free - for now An investment offering unlimited tax-free capital gains from UK shares might sound too good to be true. But a new issue from Fidelity promises investors precisely that. The equity index-linked loan stock attached to the new Fidelity Special Values investment trust is a low-cost instrument, with a capital value that will mirror exactly the ups and downs of the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Any capital gains are not taxable. The loan stock makes use of tax legislation which treats bonds issued by companies in the same way as government gilts, which are exempt from capital gains tax. The downside is that losses cannot be offset against gains elsewhere. Still, even index-linked gilts only keep pace with the retail price index, not with share prices which, over time, have tended to rise faster than inflation (although, of course, there is no guarantee of this). If, at the end of the Fidelity stock's 10-year life, the All-Share index has fallen below its present level, investors will get back less than they paid. The stock will also pay interest twice a year, set to reflect the yield on the All-Share index - now about 4 per cent. This income is taxable. About half a dozen investment trusts have issued equity index-linked loan stock, but Fidelity appears to be the first group to achieve this tax-exempt status. Loan stock issued by Fidelity European Values in 1991 and in January this year also has the same tax status. Stocks issued by other trusts have not met the exact criteria to be defined as both qualifying indexed securities and qualifying corporate bonds. Stock issued by Scottish American investment trust, for example, is classified as a deep-gain security; this means gains are taxed as income, making it unattractive to private investors. Broadgate's loan stock is classified as a qualifying indexed security, but does not have qualifying corporate bond status. This means investors' gains are taxed like equity gains: you can use your capital gains tax allowance and indexation, and losses are allowable against other capital gains. The position of the two issues of index-linked loan stock by Ivory &amp; Sime trusts - British Assets and Selective Assets - has not yet been clarified. Yet, even the issues which are liable for capital gains tax can be attractive to private investors (particularly smaller investors who do not use up their annual capital gains tax allowance) as they are straightforward, index-tracking instruments and are lower cost than index-tracker unit trusts, which charge an annual management fee. The new Fidelity issue is also the first to be accessible easily to private investors; previously, most issues of index-linked loan stock have been snapped up by large institutions which manage index-tracker funds. The minimum purchase of Fidelity's loan stock is Pounds 5,000. If there is strong demand for this issue, other fund managers are likely to come up with similar products - but an expanding market could attract less welcome attention. 'It is a loophole, whichever way you look at it,' said one industry insider. The worry is that such loopholes tend to be closed smartly by the Inland Revenue.</p>

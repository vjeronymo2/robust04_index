There are some optimistic views in the capitals of South  Korea, the United States and Japan that Pyongyang is approaching  a limit in its diplomatic hide-and-seek over the nuclear  problem, and may drop the nuclear card and instead try  flexibility by announcing an open policy, which the diplomats  said was "dangerous and utterly wishful thinking."    North Korea's acceptance in recent talks with the United  States of international nuclear inspections is simply a tactical  move to get the South Korea-U.S. "Team Spirit" military exercise  suspended and therefore cannot be regarded as a basic change in  attitude, they said.    Pyongyang is well aware that Washington will raise the  question of human rights after the nuclear issue is settled,  threatening a peaceful transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his  son, Kim Chong-il.    With that in mind, the Stalinist regime will not bare all of  its nuclear sites nor give up its nuclear program unless it is  sure not only that it is out of danger of economic sanctions  from the United States and the Team Spirit drill has been  stopped, but also that it is guaranteed diplomatic normalization  with Washington and Tokyo, recognition and support for its  communist regime, and economic aid, they said.    Pyongyang, which displayed sophisticated diplomatic  maneuvering with its surprise withdrawal from the nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty in March last year, is apparently well  aware of the fact that Washington is worried North Korea's  nuclear development might cause Seoul and Tokyo to go nuclear as  well. The communist country seems to have decided that the  United States may find it to be a hard work to apply military  threats against it, the diplomats speculated.    A senior South Korean diplomat, agreeing with these views,  said that North Korea will not give up its nuclear card unless  it wins diplomatic recognition from Washington and a safety  guarantee for its communist regime.    Beijing knows this, he said, and is limited in its ability  to  persuade Pyongyang.    If the prerequisites are not met, North Korea is unlikely to  change to an open policy as many expect and the current  situation shows that the leadership is in no hurry to resolve  the nuclear issue and prepare for openness, he said.    An eastern European diplomat said that a friend in Pyongyang  had told him that North Korea is weighing whether to pursue  peace or wage war over the nuclear problem, and that some  citizens and soldiers are prepared to fight the perceived enemy.</p>

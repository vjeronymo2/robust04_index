			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REDS BEAT PIRATES WITH WALK IN 10TH  </P> <P> Bill Landrum walked Bo Diaz with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of  the 10th inning this afternoon to hand the Cincinnati Reds a 5-4 victory over  the Pittsburgh Pirates.  </P> <P> Landrum, 0-1, allowed a two-out single to Paul O'Neill, then walked Todd  Benzinger and Rolando Roomes to bring up Diaz, hitting just .150 with one RBI.  </P> <P> Diaz took four straight balls from Landrum to force in O'Neill with the winning  run and give John Franco, 1-0, his first win since last Aug. 30.  </P> <P> Reds starter Jose Rijo, who had won four straight, allowed just two hits over  the first six innings and singled home the run that put the Reds up 4-3 in the  fourth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rijo Strikes Out 10  </P> <P> But he walked Sid Bream to lead off the seventh. Pinch-runner Gary Redus stole  second and scored on Benny Distefano's two-out pinch-hit single to tie it.  </P> <P> Rijo struck out a season-high 10 and allowed just three hits over seven  innings. The Reds have won all nine of his starts this season.  </P> <P> Roomes put the Reds ahead 2-0 with his first major-league homer in the second  off John Smiley. Diaz followed with a double and scored on Chris Sabo's single  to make it 3-0.  </P> <P> Cincinnati reliever Rob Dibble pitched out of a threat in the top of the ninth  by striking out pinch-hitter Glenn Wilson and getting Jose Lind to hit into a  force at second with the bases loaded.  </P></p>

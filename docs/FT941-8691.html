			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Trumpeter in winning form - Music in London / David Murray reviews the London Mozart Players and John Wallace's performance of Birtwistle's 'Endless Parade' Faced with the trumpeter John Wallace as their soloist on Wednesday, the London Mozart Players (now resident in Croydon) were put upon their mettle. In Harrison Birtwistle and in Leopold Mozart, Wallace was in such winning form that it was doubly impressive of the LMP to make their virtues register so well in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Their conductor Matthias Bamert had a lot to do with that. At the end of their programme, in Schubert's Symphony no. 6 - the 'little' C major - Bamert could still draw fresh, cheerful playing from them, athletic and candid: just what that earlyish work needs to make its best effects. At the start, accompanying Philippa Davies' imaginative flute in Bach's B minor Suite with strings, he was a creative partner; he found an unpedantic lilt for all the dance-rhythms, including an uncommonly sinuous Minuet, and conjured a darkly expressive backcloth for her Sarabande. For Miss Davies that was plainly the introspective heart of the Suite, but we relished no less her extrovert dash in the 'Double' of the Polonaise, and her feathery brilliance in the Badinerie. Birtwistle's Endless Parade (1987) has been called the best trumpet concerto since Haydn's. That may well be right. There have been good-ish concerti for the instrument, but usually there is a suspicion that their composers are writing down - either because they think the trumpet has narrow expressive limits, or because they feel expected to make the most of its strident gleam and its vocal sexiness when muted. Birtwistle's 20-minute piece is far more original. He rotates his basic material through many different angles, exploiting his multiply divided strings in swift, overlapping paragraphs. Though his trumpet remains a 'pure' trumpet, not a pretend-voice, it explores all the rich possibilities of trumpet diction - in range, dynamics, articulation - as it soars through and above the intricate string-inventions. After repeated hearings, Endless Parade continues to fascinate and compel. Naturally, nothing less than a superlative soloist will do. The original one was Hakan Hardenberger, cool and superbly polished. Here, Wallace suppressed his natural bent for vocal inflections in favour of open, shining tone, keeping his subtleties strictly to the diction alone. That was marvellous to hear: without swoops, shudders or smooches he stamped every passage with speaking character, apt for each new twist in Birtwistle's score. After that, the tidy little concerto by Mozart pere was a mere doddle. It has to be squeezed out of a tiny D-trumpet, but Wallace did that with straight-backed period elegance.

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Gardening: Breaking rules to baroque effect - Robin Lane Fox argues the case for a forest fit for giants alongside the dwarfs GARDENS are still on fast-forward. As we enter August, flowers are already shaping up for September. Acceleration exposes weakness. In my gardening, the weak spot is late summer height. Most nurserymen do not make the problem easier. They assume we all have smallish gardens and therefore we need smallish plants. Height is not dependent on length or width. An old rule in gardening-books says that it is and that the tallest plants in a border should be no more than twice the height of the bed's width. Like most old rules, it needs to be broken. The contrast between great height and surrounding flatness has a bold baroque quality which is all the better for breaking rules. Notoriously, modern breeders are even less help because they breed for dwarfs. I cannot think of a plant bred for height as a virtue: on trial grounds, the virtues of compactness and mounded shape are always emphasised. It has now become a struggle to find decent plants of the tall milk-blue Campanula lactiflora, which is such a mainstay at five feet in early July. Symptomatically, suppliers have replaced it with a shorter, dull variation and named it Pouffe. Anchusas have shrunk and delphiniums have been named after pygmies. There may or may not be fairies at the bottom of your garden, but at the back of it there are unlikely to be giants. Academic life requires me to find them. One of my jobs is the slow reshaping of two long borders in my Oxford college, where the soil is very dry against the old city wall. In August, its main season is over, but interest has to flicker on among the deadheads. A few answers are emerging, among several characteristic failures: the answers could apply to any garden, however small. The most successful is so obvious that we might forget it: in a tight corner, go for Hollyhocks, to a height of 10 feet. Breeders have reduced them, too, but nobody dares to eliminate the giants. They look particularly dramatic, if you limit their colours to dark maroon-purple and white by buying named plants in these colours during the spring. They look less dramatic if you make my mistake and leave the choice to the nurseryman who sells you indiscriminate pinks and reds. Hollyhocks refute old rules because their roots go strongly downwards and their lower stems do not require a great width of flower-bed. Most of their growers know better than to expect any fresh lower leaves on their plants, anyway. They recognise that Hollyhocks are victims to the unstoppable disease of rust. They flower well above its ravages and so I have devised a remedy. In borders, I recommend hiding their lower stems behind groups of tall Michaelmas daisies, which are growing healthily with dark-green leaves just as the Hollyhocks' legs are corroding. There is no point in planting the better-known forms of Michaelmas daisy, which are usually novi-belgii hybrids. Most are prone to awful mildew. The lesser-known novae-angliae forms resist disease and are a better buy. Height often entails coarse leaves, one reason why we have scrapped our big Buddleias and given up the thistly Echinops with its big heads, like a hedgehog's drumstick, in pale violet or white. For elegance, the old plume poppy, or Macleaya, is a much better bet. The grey leaves are like the ace of clubs: most of us buy microcarpa, although other forms are possibly better. The roots run quite widely, and, after two years, the plant is six feet high. I suppose I should not be surprised to find plants selling for Pounds 5 each in garden centres in London. On less familiar ground, I have high hopes of a pale yellow daisy called Helianthus Lemon Queen. It reaches six feet; it needs no staking; the flowers really are a pale yellow and a decent size and the plant can be multiplied easily from summer cuttings. We have packed it in the back row beside the white spikes of the excellent Veronicastrum, as botanists have renamed Veronica virginica. This slender plant reaches six feet above purplish foliage and the white form is charming. If the soil is not too dry, the options are much wider. In the half-shade of a town garden, my first choice for emphasis in August would be one of the Cimicifugas, those plants with tall stems and flowers like white bottle brushes. The best is a new one called ramosa Brunette, which has very dark leaves without being sombre. Brunette will cost you an arm and a leg until it has been more widely propagated, but it is worth the expense because the contrast of flower and leaf is so good. At even greater height, you might also try late-flowering clematis trained up tripods of tall bamboo canes. Grand gardens exploit this trick, but two or three wigwams would lift the sides of any small garden into a new class in late summer. The long canes need only be added above a lower frame in July. That method avoids a bare wigwam of tall stakes in May behind the lupins. My favourite giant is none of these good plants, and, if I could torture it for another foot in height, it would be ideal. So many new red crocosmias have been bred or revived that we have even forgotten the days when we knew them all as montbretias. Most of us have forgotten the older variety which nurserymen used to list as a curtonus. It grows five feet high and its fans of fresh green leaves send up sprays of vivid red flowers, which last for weeks. It is too good for botanists to leave it in peace: recently, they have renamed it Crocosmia paniculata, which will probably confuse everybody for another 10 years. Resist the confusion, because this old variety is spectacular near the back of any bed: it is a giant among the newer pygmies and it has not been tamed merely by changing its names.</p>

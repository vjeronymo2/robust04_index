In connection with the work to move some U.S. bases to  suburbs which was already agreed upon between the regional  autonomous bodies and U.S. bases, the Defense Ministry added  that cooperation will be carried out to the utmost from the  level of fulfilling the desire of the people in the region to  move the U.S. bases.    Judging that an enormous amount of budget will be required  in  moving the communications, electronics, oil pipeline, and  railways of the U.S. bases, the Defense Ministry viewed that if  North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved and there is change in  the security situation, there is a high possibility for the  additional reduction of U.S. forces stationed in the ROK as well  as the readjustment of stationing the bases.</p>

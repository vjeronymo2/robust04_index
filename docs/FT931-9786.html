			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: French insurers' profits plunge under pressure - How the fall in earnings might affect the prospects for privatisation FOR MONTHS France's large insurance groups have made no secret of being under pressure. But it was only on Tuesday when the usually optimistic Mr Claude Bebear, chairman of Axa, addressed analysts in Paris that it was clear just how heavy the pressure had been. Axa, the second largest French insurer, not only announced a sharp fall in net profits to about FFr1.5bn (Dollars 268m) in 1992 from FFr2.4bn the year before. It also said that it was raising FFr3.65bn in a convertible-bond issue to recapitalise Equitable Life, its US associate. Later that day, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's biggest single insurer, revealed its 1992 net profits had plummeted to about FFr1.15bn, from FFr3.8bn in 1991. Analysts are now steeled for more gloomy figures when Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and the GAN Group publish their 1992 results. French insurers are operating in intensely competitive conditions as the economic slowdown is making it more difficult for them to pump up profits with asset sales as they did in 1991, when all the 'big four' would otherwise have been in the red. These problems could scarcely have come at a worse time. France's insurance industry has hit the doldrums just as the three state-controlled companies - UAP, AGF and GAN - are preparing to be privatised by a future French government after next month's elections. Even the most optimistic French insurers are resigned to another set of lack-lustre results this year. The economy is unlikely to show any signs of recovery at least until the second half, assuming that the franc stabilises and interest rates come down. In the meantime, the industry faces the same problems that beset it last year. Competition remains intense both in terms of the number of players in the market and pressure on tariffs. The economic squeeze has produced a predictable increase in the number of claims, including suspected false claims, and continues to depress the value of the insurers' industrial portfolios. Moreover, the property market shows no sign of recovery. This affects the insurers in two ways. First, they face another year of high provisions. Second, their asset sales will again be too low to compensate for poor operating profits and hefty provisions. The Paris stock market is rife with rumours about the insurers selling properties to each other, allegedly at inflated prices. In the short term, this cushions them against the slump and helps prop up the market. But, in the long term, they will have to carry those properties on their books. The industry's future is more reassuring. The FFr240bn life market should be boosted by the forthcoming reform of French pensions, which is expected to supplement the state system with private pension plans. Meanwhile, competition appears to be easing in the FFr200m non-life sector as the growth of the mutuelles, which sell insurance to specialist groups of employees, peaks. There are also signs of tariffs rising in certain sectors, notably motor insurance. The general economic recovery should alleviate the pressure on the stock market and on residential property - although it is expected to take at least three years for the over-saturated commercial property market to recover. French insurers should also start to benefit from their international expansion in the early 1990s. Axa is expected to receive more substantial contributions from Equitable Life in the US. AGF now owns a substantial stake in AMB, the German insurer, after a complex transaction last year. UAP has invested in Germany via its holding in Nordstern, although it is smarting from its failure to buy a stake in Colonia from Victoire, the insurance subsidiary of the Suez industrial group. These developments should ensure that the large French insurers stabilise profits this year and secure moderate growth next year. 'We can't hope for much from any of the big French insurers in 1993,' said Mr Michael Huttner, European insurance analyst at BNP Securities in London. 'But we can expect to see a gradual recovery from 1994 onwards.' The critical question is whether this improvement will come in time to enable the next French government to sell all, or part, of its shares in UAP, AGF and GAN. All three are eager to enter the private sector, where they would be free to raise capital from the markets and would not be barred, as state-controlled companies, from investing in the US. The centre-right alliance, favoured to win next month's poll, plans to privatise them as quickly as possible. The consensus among analysts is that all three companies are saleable despite their present problems. 'The market loves a recovery story,' said one. 'The only problem for the French government is judging how the 1992 and 1993 figures will affect the price.'</p>

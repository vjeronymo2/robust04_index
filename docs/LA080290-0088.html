			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: A SOOTY MARK ON DEALER DIAGNOSIS  </P> <P> Question: I was wondering why my car has to have spark plugs put in every two  weeks? The plugs are coated with black soot and black soot also comes out of  the tailpipe. It uses a lot of gasoline for a four-cylinder car. The "check  engine" light comes on, but the diagnostic computer at the dealership says  there isn't anything wrong with the car. But I know there is. The car is a 1981  Chevrolet Chevette. -- T.L.  </P> <P> Answer: This is another case of people needing to be smarter than computers.  Unfortunately, too many mechanics are either incapable of knowing how to use  modern diagnostic equipment or they don't have the mechanical skills to  outsmart a computer when it is wrong.  </P> <P> The symptoms you describe point to a classic case of the engine getting too  much fuel. The sooty spark plugs are an indication of unburned or partially  burned fuel. The black soot coming out of the exhaust pipe is a telltale sign.  </P> <P> Your problem seems to be so severe that it has even degraded your fuel economy.  If the engine is getting too much fuel and not completely burning it, then you  obviously are going to lose fuel economy.  </P> <P> One of the easiest ways a motorist can monitor the health of a car's engine is  to frequently check the gasoline mileage rate. A dropoff will let you know  something has gone wrong.  </P> <P> There are plenty of causes of excess fuel being sent to the engine. If your car  has a carburetor, the float could be stuck or improperly set. The carburetor  could be otherwise fouled. The choke, which is supposed to give the engine more  fuel when it is cold, could be stuck and flooding the engine with fuel when it  is hot. The problem could be as simple as the air cleaner being dirty and  clogged.  </P> <P> If the engine's computer command system is triggering a "check engine" light on  the dashboard, it could be indicating the source of the fuel problem or some  other problem altogether. It could be that the fuel problem is causing a  secondary problem that is being picked up by the computer. For example, the  oxygen sensor could be coated with soot, which will trigger the check light.  </P> <P> Solving the problem should be relatively easy. The hard part may be finding a  good mechanic.  </P> <P> Q: Please tell me if anyone makes a waterproof car cover. If not, what is the  reason? C.C.R.  </P> <P> A: To my knowledge, a waterproof cover is not made. Most of the covers are  nylon, cotton or a synthetic blend that allow water to soak in but also to  evaporate through. The reason simply is that condensation would accumulate  under the car and foster rapid corrosion. The best types of covers have a soft  texture, but heavy body. They should be thick enough to block the sun's  ultraviolet rays.  </P></p>

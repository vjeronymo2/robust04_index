			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Management: Black to the future - US companies are finding that racial diversity among staff is a business imperative The guest list of companies at the top table could have been culled from Fortune magazine's top companies in the US. One by one they took turns at the podium to declare before the 3,500 dinner guests how much their company would be donating. The loudest cheer was reserved for the single biggest contribution - Dollars 168,000 (Pounds 102,500) - from Ford Motor. This was no run-of-the-mill fund-raising event or political gathering, in spite of an earlier video-taped greeting from Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary. For, like him, almost everyone at the San Francisco Hilton that evening in September was black, and this was the closing banquet at the National Black MBA Association's 16th annual congress. That evening's donations to the NBMBAA's scholarship fund was a clear sign of the way US corporations have started to embrace the issue of racial diversity among employees. Such moves began in earnest with the publication in 1987 of Workforce 2000, a report by the Hudson Institute, a think-tank based in Indianapolis. Chief among the projections was that by 2000, only 15 per cent of people entering the workforce would be American-born white males, compared with 47 per cent in 1987. The figures took corporate America by surprise, as many businesses realised they were ill-prepared for the labour market in the new millennium. While labour force researchers say some of the Workforce 2000 report's conclusions may have been exaggerated, attempts to recruit and promote minorities are gathering pace and growing more sophisticated. 'There is no corporation in this country today that can afford not to take the issue of diversity seriously. It is not only a moral issue or even a legal one. It has become a business imperative for the whole of the US,' says Bernard Milano, partner in charge of recruitment and personnel administration at KPMG Peat Marwick in the US. Milano speaks from experience. Two-and-a-half years ago 'a very important client, let's just say a Fortune 100 company, told us they were not happy when we sent four white males to a meeting with senior management'. He admits 'we'd had messages in the past, but this one really hit us'. With only seven black partners out of 1,500, KPMG has been forced to sub-contract work to minority practices where clients have indicated a strong preference for dealing with a racially diverse team. The firm has now instituted a Dollars 4m diversity programme. Attempts to recruit suitably qualified blacks have met with little success, so KPMG's strategy is to hire people it can train for careers in accountancy and the financial sector generally. Scholarships have been extended to students from minority organisations, which has encouraged traditionally black colleges to accredit themselves with recognised industry bodies. A PhD project has been established by KPMG to help blacks in business move into academia - the first group of potential recruits is to meet at a conference in Chicago in the middle of December - an initiative that KPMG believes should encourage black students to consider business and finance courses. Finally, a professional body has been created for African-American PhD students, designed to help them share experiences and avoid being isolated. Over the past few years professional groups have provided one of the main points of contact for US companies. Organisations similar to the NBMBA Association, which has a membership of around 3,000, have also been established for Hispanics and Asian minorities. 'What we are about is creating economic and intellectual wealth for the black community,' says Antoinette Malveaux, executive director of the NBMBA Association. Apart from serving as a networking forum, its main goals are getting African-Americans into the higher echelons of the US corporate sector and increasing the level of business education at all levels. Twenty eight per cent of NBMBA Association members earn between Dollars 50,000 and Dollars 75,000 a year; 18 per cent claim earnings of Dollars 75,000 to Dollars 99,000 a year and some 19 per cent earn more than Dollars 100,000 a year. This helps explain the presence of more than 150 corporate exhibitors at this year's conference in San Francisco, among them Coca-Cola, American Airlines, Ford, Bank of America, IBM and Eastman Kodak. 'We know that by being here we can pick up good qualified people who will suit our company and its aims,' says Janet Maderious, vice president and manager at Bank of America, which hosted a reception at the start of the conference. 'It's all about self interest', adds Keith Cooley, director of strategic planning and issues management at General Motors. 'These are the type of top customers we must get if we are to succeed.' Over the past 15 years, companies have discovered that targeting products and services to a particular racial group, using imagery and signals commonly used by that group, can make a significant contribution to profits. 'When we started marketing Pampers (disposable nappies) in the 1970s, little or no attention was paid to inner city areas where many black people lived,' says an executive at Procter &amp; Gamble. 'The thinking was that these people would not be able to afford them. Not having blacks in the relevant departments and levels who knew about the lifestyle of many blacks meant that for a long time P&amp;G missed out on big profits - few knew that although the product was expensive, many blacks had no washing machines at home. Thus they were an ideal market for such a product.' Stephen Lewis, national president of the NBMBAA and associate director of new business development at Ford, says: 'A person may look at a company like Ford and say: that company supports my community so I will support it with my dollars. Diversity is also about making sure your products sell in all the markets.'</p>

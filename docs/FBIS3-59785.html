These projects are being offered in response to the  increased costs and the difficulties in developing natural gas  due to environmental concerns, to the competition between  countries wanting natural gas that has occurred as a result of  countries no longer willing to finance natural gas development,  and lastly, to the increased demand for natural gas in Eastern  Asia.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  intends to raise the issue of natural gas development as one of  the key energy measures it will promote next year. To do that,  it plans to beef up the development of natural gas and the way  that oil corporations function at the liquefaction stage, and in  the future, promote funding of large-scale projects (Sakhalin,  Natuna, etc.) and develop mid-size projects (Papua New Guinea,  Borneo, Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, etc.), which are likely to pose  future problems in terms of development, and try to make inroads  at the executive levels of natural gas departments in oil  corporations.    Also, in the area of long-term projects lacking adequate  structures such as in Turkmenistan, the agency is planning to  have the oil corporations themselves develop master plans and do  the necessary feasibility studies by conducting research surveys  on natural gas development and business conditions.    Meanwhile, a study will also be done on receiving and  distribution systems for natural gas in Japan. Specifically, it  is considering the idea of relieving some of the growing  congestion on the Pacific coast by building a base for unloading  natural gas on the Japan Sea coast. MITI is also thinking about  using offgas fields on the Japan Sea coast as underground  storage bases to deal with peak periods and energy security  needs.    In addition to these activities, the agency also plans to  conduct a feasibility study on a domestic LPG supply system  (medium-range project) that would be built around a pipeline  laid between a supply base on the Japan Sea coast and demand  bases in the Tokai and Kanto areas. It also plans to introduce  new policies to promote economic cooperation on energy with  other Asian-Pacific countries.

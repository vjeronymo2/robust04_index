			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Poll battle to focus on taxes A BUDGET designed to wrongfoot the Labour party put income tax at the centre of the most closely fought election since the early 1970s as the opposition pledged to reverse the tax cuts announced by Mr Norman Lamont. After initial uncertainty in the aftermath of Mr Lamont's Commons statement, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour would oppose the 20p lower rate band at the core of the package. His comments came as a survey taken before the Budget confirmed that Labour would start the election campaign with a small opinion poll lead. Senior ministers voiced confidence that the package - a careful political balancing act designed to steal Labour's most attractive clothes while deflecting charges of bribery - would enable the Conservatives to regain the political initiative. 'It is a simple choice . . . do the voters want a Pounds 140-a-year cut in their tax bill or do they want Labour's high taxes,' one member of the cabinet said. Mr Lamont sought to reinforce the message with a pledge that a re-elected Conservative government would eventually cut the basic rate of income tax to 20p. Amid disquiet on the right of the Conservative party about a prospective increase in public borrowing to Pounds 28bn next year, MPs were uncertain whether the Budget would break the political stalemate of the last six months. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister, refused to comment on the Budget but her political allies said she was 'concerned' about the sharp increase in borrowing. As the chancellor deflected questions from political journalists at Westminster about interest rate cuts, there were hopes among Conservative MPs that the Budget would be quickly followed by a small cut in rates. Mr Lamont announced an array of other measures - ranging from help for small businesses and for the motor industry to increased help for low-income pensioners - designed to win over key groups of voters. The changes to the uniform business rate are aimed at boosting Conservative support among small businessmen in southern marginals. The halving of car tax should benefit the motor industry in the electoral battlegrounds of the Midlands. Inheritance tax changes are designed to win votes from farmers and small businessmen. As Mr Neil Kinnock charged that tax cuts paid for by public borrowing represented a 'panic-stricken, pre-election political sweetener', there was private acknowledgment in the shadow cabinet that the Conservative challenge over tax cuts for the lower paid had left Labour with awkward choices. The opposition has long advocated the introduction of a reduced-rate tax band. But if Labour accepts it now it will be unable to sustain its claim of Conservative electoral bribery with borrowed money. Mr Smith, who will announce early next week his alternative Budget, said his priority was to pull the economy out of recession. Mr Kinnock sought to reinforce the contrast between a long-term commitment to economic revival and a short-term Conservative 'fix'. Mr Lamont, however, said that the voters would be presented with a clear choice between a government committed to cutting taxes, particularly for the lower paid, while maintaining good public services, and an opposition committed to pushing up everyone's tax bill. The Conservatives, fractionally behind in the opinion polls, are relying on the Budget to push them into the lead by the start of formal campaigning early next week. An ICM opinion poll for today's Guardian newspaper puts Labour at 42 per cent against the Conservatives' 39 per cent and 15 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. The prime minister plans to ask the Queen later today to dissolve parliament from next Monday. Senior ministers said they expected a formal announcement today, though Downing Street cautioned that there was still a slight chance it could be delayed until tomorrow.</p>

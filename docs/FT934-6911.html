			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brown hints at change of course on subsidies Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday said he was 'concerned' that the US position in the Uruguay Round in favour of curbing government subsidies could undermine the president's high-priority technology programme. In a shift from Reagan-Bush ideology, Mr Brown is planning a number of government industry schemes, which would help fund technological research and development. Yesterday the secretary announced the formation of an environmental technologies export programme, with Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) available for industry in government matching research and development grants this year rising to Dollars 1.4bn in 1997. The current Gatt negotiating text would limit basic research subsidies to 50 per cent, but applied research grants would have to be cut to 25 per cent. Commerce Department officials have been aware for months of the contradiction of President Clinton railing against Airbus subsidies while proposing new aid for US industry. According to Mr Brown, it is finally 'getting some attention' from US trade negotiators, who have sufficient time to change US course in the current Uruguay Round talks.</p>

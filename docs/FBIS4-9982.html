			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R.M. do Prado] </F>   [Excerpt] Brazilian financial relations with the  multilateral credit organizations -- the World Bank (IRDB) and  the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) -- have deteriorated  in the last two years. In 1993, the country transferred a net of  $1.744 billion to the two institutions, of which $1.467 billion  was to the IRDB alone.    These transfers represent what the country had to pay in  interest and servicing of the debt in exchange for what it  received in disbursements by the two organizations. In the case  of the IRDB, the situation is worse because its yearly  disbursement to Brazil decreased from the already low level of  $800 million at the end of the 1980's to about $500 million the  IRDB has been disbursing annually since 1992. In 1993, the IRDB  disbursed only $471 million to Brazil and received $1.318  billion in debt service and $620 million in interest.    The value of the new loans also is decreasing. From the  $1.344 billion the IRDB granted Brazil in 1992, the amount  dropped almost 50 percent in 1993 and totaled only $636 million.  As for the IDB, the loans decreased from $1.117 billion to $514  million.    All sorts of problems help explain the deterioration of our  relations with these organizations. Brazil has no resources to  offer as compensation for these loans, the projects' management  is ineffective, there is a lack of continuity in the projects'  domestic administration, and there are bureaucratic difficulties  that delay the flow of resources.

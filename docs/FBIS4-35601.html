			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah and 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im] </F>   [Excerpts] Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the  Nasirite Arab Democratic Party and People's Assembly member, on  Sunday presented an urgent enquiry to the prime minister and the  interior minister on the recent incidents in the Lawyers  Association and the circumstances surrounding the mysterious  death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. [passage omitted]    The incidents at the Lawyers Association continue to draw  political reactions. Within the attempts of the Muslim  Brotherhood to avoid a clash with the government--a clash that  appeared increasingly likely in the past weeks--Muslim  Brotherhood General Guide Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr has denied  any responsibility for his group in stirring up and leading the  demonstration that was staged by the lawyers a few weeks ago to  protest the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani hours after  his arrest late last month.    In statements to AL-'ARABI, Abu-al-Nasr said the Muslim  Brotherhood was falsely blamed for the Lawyers Association  incidents. He said the Muslim Brotherhood "has nothing to do  with the associations and does not interfere in their affairs!"  He explained the attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood in the  government media as a continuation of statements President  Mubarak made to the German magazine DER SPIEGEL, in which he  accused the banned Muslim Brotherhood of supporting terrorism.  Following those statements by the president, Abu-al-Nasr said,  the official media "rushed to launch a strong attack against us,  and even blamed us for the Lawyers Association incidents!"    Security forces yesterday arrested five Muslim Brotherhood  members. They were referred to the prosecution, which decided  to remand them for two weeks for interrogation.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Clinton basks in warm praise: Real enthusiasm for the inauguration, the speech, poetry and even the sax THERE WAS only one unanswered question early on Wednesday evening. Would Bill Clinton play his sax at an inaugural ball? Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC's Today programme, half hoped he would not, but he was pretty much alone. The 42nd President of the United States disappointed only Mr Gumbel. He played it at the Arkansas Ball, at the MTV rock n'roll ball, and perhaps at others because he went to 11 of them and got to bed well after two in the morning. He played Yo' Mama Don't Dance and other classics and if he was once a bit off-key, he mostly made his horn wail like there was no tomorrow. But it was not only for his music that Mr Clinton got good reviews yesterday. After a difficult last two weeks of the transition into office he was able to bask in some pretty warm compliments about his own performance on his inauguration day and the clear messages he had imparted about the direction of his presidency. Mr Hendrik Hertzberg, editor of the New Yorker magazine, commented that he seemed 'at ease' as president. Mr William Safire, the acerbic and generally conservative New York Times columnist, gave his address a B-plus grade, with good marks for its theme, its use of the seasons as a metaphor, its historical resonance and its brevity. From its right-wing editorial pulpit the Wall Street Journal was impressed that Mr Clinton had made so much of the importance of both civic and personal responsibility. The more liberal Washington Post concurred. Even the New York Times, withering in its condemnation of some of Mr Clinton's cabinet choices and still yesterday suspicious of his self-righteousness, headlined its first leader A Dawn Of Promise, and strongly approved his condemnation of Washington as 'a place of intrigue and calculation.' The fact that Mr Clinton spoke for only 14 minutes, shorter than all inaugural addresses except Washington's and Lincoln's, indicated, in the opinion of just about every pundit, a welcome discipline in a man previously inclined to rattle on forever. The deans of television commentary mostly liked it. Mr John Chancellor, the soon-to-retire NBC veteran, called it 'a fine address and blessedly short', while Mr David Brinkley of ABC thought it was 'effective'. Mr Dan Rather, the often agitated CBS anchorman, huffed that 'it didn't have a lot of poetry'. There were conflicting views as to its best line, though the one most often advanced was the sentence: 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.' Mr Mark Shields, a Democratic consultant and commentator, noted with satisfaction that Mr Clinton had eschewed bureaucratese in his speech. There was no mention of 'entrepreneurial capitalism' or 'infrastructure', terms with normally spill out of Mr Clinton's mouth with abandon. Mr David Gergen, the notionally conservative foil to Mr Shields on one of the TV news programmes, was struck by the consistency between Mr Clinton's address and his campaign themes. Admittedly, Mr Clinton did not talk much of 'sacrifice' last year, as he did on Wednesday, but he was otherwise true to the arguments that helped make him president. Typical of this was his call to the young to engage in community service, a Kennedyesque theme if ever there was one. Mr David Broder, of the Washington Post, agreed that it was time that 'the biggest and in some respects the most coddled generation in American history' take control. There was also an inclination to forgive the apparent slowness in forming a new administration. Mr R W Apple wrote in the New York Times that such problems 'may prove to be transitory, the product of inexperience'. The Washington Post generously re-ran some of its old stories at similar stages in the Carter, Reagan and Bush administrations, all critical of their dilatoriness. There is, of course, a secular bipartisanship to every inauguration day which allows temporary suspension of many critical faculties. This did not quite extend to the poetic community, which was divided on the merits of Maya Angelou's poem, On The Pulse Of Morning, composed at Mr Clinton's request for the occasion. However, this was a nearly novel occasion for poets, unaccustomed to the inaugural limelight since JFK similarly commissioned Robert Frost 32 years ago. But even the most hardened cynic could not deny that the inauguration was greeted with much spontaneous enthusiasm by huge crowds and that Mr Clinton himself seemed right for the occasion. That extended to his being the first president to blow the sax on his great day.</p>

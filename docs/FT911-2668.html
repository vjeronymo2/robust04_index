			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Council tax may increase PSBR by Pounds 5bn a year, report says THE introduction of the new council tax may lead to a Pounds 5bn-a-year increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement, requiring increased issues of gilts or a delay in tax cuts, a report published by Midland Montagu Research warns today. The report, which appears in Midland Montagu's Greenwell Gilt Weekly, says that the government's attempts to minimise the local tax burden on individuals through subsidies to local authorities or transitional relief schemes may increase public-sector borrowing in the next three years. Councils have borrowed much more than forecast in recent years. In 1990-91, councils borrowed a record Pounds 3.5bn, more than the total borrowing in the four years before. High wage settlements and greater demands on local services may push up council spending even further in the coming year. Borrowing might increase still more in the short term, as the report fears that the rate of collection of the poll tax may fall. 'Now that the government line is to abolish the tax - as it is 'uncollectable' - it is unlikely that the collection rate will pick up in the coming year,' the report says. 'It would not be surprising if the commitment of some authorities to tax collection also wavered.' In the medium term, higher subsidies from central government may be required to keep poll tax bills down in the year 1992-93, especially if the collection rate has fallen the previous year. Because of the political sensitivity of the issue, no government could allow bills to grow too big. In the long term, the introduction of the new tax in 1993-94 may lead to higher spending - as happened when the poll tax was introduced. That is because the reorganisation might again 'muddy the waters of responsibility and accountability'. Local authorities might increase spending on services, and blame that on central government cuts. After the poll tax embarrassment, the government might feel compelled to raise grants to authorities to spare the taxpayer. For 1991-92, the report forecasts the contribution of local government overspending to the public-sector borrowing requirement might be almost Pounds 2bn. In later years the cost of introducing the new tax might increase the PSBR by Pounds 5bn or more. The report claims the council tax will be more workable than the poll tax, and says that ultimately it could have a positive effect on public finances, by bringing greater stability, and making it more difficult for local authorities to go on 'spending sprees'.</p>

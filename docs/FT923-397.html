			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Confusion grows over plans for rescue of UK insurer RESCUE TALKS between Municipal Mutual Insurance and a French insurer appeared to be in trouble yesterday, casting further doubt over the future of the stricken British company. As Britain's ninth largest insurance group struggled for survival, the Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the insurance industry, came under fire for allowing the company to continue trading. MMI insures nine out of 10 of Britain's local authorities. Groupe GMF, the Paris-based holding company that controls the Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires insurance group, said it had decided not to investigate further the possible purchase of MMI's business. But Mr Brian Wright, chairman of MMI, insisted that discussions were continuing. He added: 'Municipal Mutual and its subsidiaries are continuing to write new business and pay out claims in full.' In a fresh twist last night, GMF said other member companies of the Eurosafe alliance - a loose network of European companies which insure local authorities and civil servants - would continue talks with MMI. MMI's future has been in doubt since its auditor issued a severe warning with the latest set of accounts for the 12 months to December 31. It showed the company was below the statutory minimum 'solvency margin'. Last week, a report commissioned by the leading local authority associations from accountants Touche Ross recommended that those using MMI should seek alternative cover when policies came up for renewal. Touche stresses there is a strong possibility MMI will cease trading in the very soon. The DTI, criticised by Labour MPs over its handling of the case, said: 'We are keeping in close touch with the company. We have been in constant touch and we understand that discussions are continuing.' MMI runs for cover, Page 8</p>

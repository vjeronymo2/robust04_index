			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL SHOPPERS SPLIT OVER SEARS' EFFORT AT LOW-PRICE CONSISTENCY  </P> <P> About 300 customers had clustered at the entrances to South Coast Plaza's Sears  store Wednesday afternoon, awaiting that magic moment when doors would burst  open and prices would fall.  </P> <P> Once inside the store, serious shoppers found Sears new everyday low-price  strategy to be a mixed bag.  </P> <P> Carol Schwarzenbach of Tustin, for one, said the reductions unveiled Wednesday  fell far short of making her pulse race. As Schwarzenbach sorted through the  racks, she lamented that the more fashionable offerings in the girl's  department were only a dollar less than the department store's old prices.  </P> <P> Dan Keller, on the other hand, said the new prices were great.  </P> <P> "I've done really well," said the Fountain Valley man, who had already loaded  up on "personal items" from the men's department.  </P> <P> Schwarzenbach and Keller were among shoppers across the United States who  flocked to Sears, the nation's largest retailer, after the chain reduced prices  on more than 50,000 items in its 824 stores. The stores were closed from 6 p.m.  Monday to noon Wednesday to give employees a chance to change price tags and  signs and prepare for the introduction of the "everyday low prices" approach.  </P> <P> The move came in response to competition from discounters as well as complaints  from consumers that frequent price changes have made it difficult for shoppers  to recognize a fair deal. As part of the new strategy, Sears says it will offer  fewer special sales and instead will provide dependable prices.  </P> <P> While most Southern California shoppers interviewed Wednesday said Sears' new  discount prices were generally lower than before, many weren't convinced that  they were the best deals in town.  </P> <P> "Prices don't look that low to me," said Phil Bernard, a computer programmer  from Topanga, as he looked over some blue jeans. "These are $19.95. I've seen  them for $14 or $15 at other places."  </P> <P> The prices on blue jeans seemed more reasonable to James J. Pittman, a  bartender from Beverly Hills who grabbed two pairs. And Teresa Lee, after  spotting a video camera at the Sears Santa Monica store whose price, she said,  was more than $100 less than what she paid at another store, was even more  impressed.  </P> <P> "I was skeptical about these discount prices," said Lee, a 22-year-old legal  secretary. "I usually wait for a sale. But I'm amazed at the low prices today.  And it's good knowing I can come back again some other day and get the item for  the same price."  </P> <P> Jim Harbeson, 42, of Corona del Mar, said the prices were lower on a lot of the  tools he had seen but not on the router he needed. Though he wasn't able to  take advantage of the new low prices, "it seems to be an improvement," he said.  </P> <P> The new emphasis on discount pricing was accomplished at Sears stores without  the "warehouse look" some retailers favor. Although Sears employees were  dressed in festive hats and aprons, the stores were little changed.  </P> <P> Sears officials generally said late Wednesday afternoon that it was too early  to tell whether the new strategy was getting off to a successful start.  </P> <P> But Jim Berry, manager of the Sears store at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza,  said he was pleased.  </P> <P> "I would say that the response, at least in terms of shoppers in the store, was  overwhelming. When we opened, we had crowds of people at all the entrances. I  don't think anybody went away disappointed."  </P></p>

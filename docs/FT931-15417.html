			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: Myth of inefficient use of accountancy information Sir, In his accountancy column (January 7), Andrew Jack refers to the responsibility of financial journalists when commenting on financial reports and accounting issues. One way in which this responsibility could be correctly exercised is in recognising that the stock exchange is in fact rather good at discounting accounting information correctly and is not misled by simplistic devices. Nevertheless, Mr Jack refers to the way in which company share prices 'seem' to drop after purely presentational accounting changes: and it may be true that this is the appearance. But in fact it is difficult to make money out of the marketmakers, assuming the announcement of the results was not in itself confusing. The article also refers to the attention paid by analysts and investors to short-term returns and bottom-line earnings, where all the evidence - overwhelmingly - is that the market takes the long view and takes account of a wider information set. But it is true that the short-term picture is often the best new evidence about the long-term picture. The constant repetition of these myths about the inefficiency with which accounting information is used is exceptionally dangerous and this is not a secondary question. There are two serious consequences. The first is that the setting of accounting standards and their implementation is affected by a misapprehension of how the information is discounted in share prices - a point which is relevant to your Lex column of January 7. Second, and more seriously, if a company management believes these myths, the directors may take action in the real economy which will be detrimental to the national interest. Thus, for example, management may make short-term investment decisions because they believe that that is what the market is looking for, whereas in fact they could take long-term investment decisions for which, if those decisions were correctly made and accounted for, the market would give the company full credit.

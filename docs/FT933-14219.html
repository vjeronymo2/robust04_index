			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK inflation If Tuesday's industrial production and yesterday's inflation figures had not arrived on government notepaper, the casual observer might have thought they related to Japan. The UK does seem to have survived the first wave of price pressure from devaluation, due to low wage inflation and a yawning gap in the productive potential of the UK economy. Manufacturers are even managing to restore margins despite subdued price rises. One area where this may not be true is food retailing, where costs are rising but retail prices are under pressure. Those fat margins built up in recession may soon start to slim.</p>

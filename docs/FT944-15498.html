			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VSEL advances to Pounds 30.2m - BAe shares rise 28p on market speculation about bid from GEC VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker and target of an agreed bid from British Aerospace, yesterday announced a 5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 30.2m for the six months to September 30. The results were hurried out to coincide with the publication of BAe's offer document. BAe's bid offers 2.747 of its shares for each VSEL share with a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40. At BAe's closing price, up 28p to 498p, the bid values each VSEL share at Pounds 13.68 and the company at Pounds 518m. BAe shares had risen on market speculation that GEC might bid for it. VSEL shares did not follow, however, and closed down 2p at Pounds 13.23. GEC has declared that it is a possible bidder for VSEL. The offer document includes details of VSEL's results. In its last full-year statement the company predicted that its 1994-95 profits would be similar to last year and trading profits for the first half were Pounds 24.4m compared with Pounds 24.7m. Turnover declined from Pounds 233.2m to Pounds 194.7m. Interest income on the company's cash pile has increased from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 5.8m, lifting the pre-tax result. The interim dividend is increased from 10.5p to 12p, payable from earnings of 52.5p (49.3p) per share. The document says that trading continues to be in line with the board's previous forecast. The document also confirms that Lord Chalfont, VSEL's chairman, will become an adviser to BAe until next July if the recommended offer goes ahead. Mr Noel Davies, the chief executive, will also be a consultant to BAe during the handover period. Information made available to BAe in the course of discussions is expected to be made available to GEC in the next day or so. Any GEC bid would be for cash, and it would take the company some days to assess information provided by Morgan Grenfell, VSEL's bankers. BAe is to hold an extraordinary meeting on November 2 to approve the takeover bid. Proxy votes must be registered by October 31. BAe forecasts that its total dividend for 1994 will be not less than 10p, an increase of 20 per cent on the previous year. The offer document also discloses that VSEL is in a legal dispute with British Shipbuilders, from which it was privatised in 1986. VSEL would be obliged to pay British Shipbuilders (a government-owned company) an additional amount if its profits rose above a certain level after privatisation. The dispute could cost VSEL up to Pounds 40m, but the company is fighting the claim.</p>

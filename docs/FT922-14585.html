			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Atys and Amadis in New York To have one Lully opera playing in a city is something of rarity: in New York, both Atys and Amadis have been playing. Atys is the great Arts Florissants production, on a return visit to the Brooklyn Academy. Its glories have been sung in these columns often enough to need no comment beyond that the execution, lovingly directed by William Christie, still becomes (after 70 performances, 36 of them at the Opera-Comique, eight in Brooklyn) ever more precise, more moving, more bewitching. It's a revelation of what Baroque opera can be and mean. Amadis is put on by the Moving Breaths Theatre Company, which plays in the Gene Frankel Theatre, a Greenwich Village space. There are eight soloists, a chorus of four, no dancers, and a slogging modern string sextet around a loud electric harpsichord. The production was announced (wrongly) as the first Amadis since 1771, and we were promised 'a testimonial to a nation inactive on its own ground and over-active on the territories of others ..a primer on how to romanticize your past in order to enrich your barren present ..a rip-roaring romp through the Old West for the sake of our crumbling America.' It was no such thing. I liked Moving Breaths' sharp staging last year of Monteverdi's Madrigals Amorous and Martial, whose military metaphors were given Gulf War representation. But the Amadis was coarse, clumsy, and ill-executed. An electric harpsichord and string sextet slogged through the score. In a theatre where a whisper would tell, the singers tended to bellow. Lully reverted to being the pre-Rameau bore we used to think him before the Arts Florissants Atys lit our understanding and played upon our most responsive emotional nerves. At Mannes College, Donizetti's comedy I pazzi per progetto had its American premiere. He's another composer misunderstood - one of the most lovable, honest, and generous of men, in tragedy or in comedy communicative about human beings as they live, laugh, and suffer in our strange old world. Too often we see the real, rounded characters of Don Pasquale and L'elisir busied and bustled into farce. And the Mannes Pazzi was overproduced and overdesigned - albeit deftly and inventively. Far too much went on. Amy Kaiser was a lively conductor, but the show would have been twice as enjoyable had it been half as strenuous and half as loud. Judith Weir's King Harald's Saga - a three-act, nine-soloists-and-chorus, epic grand opera, compassed in about 12 minutes by one unaccompanied solo soprano (it was created by Jane Manning) - has caught on in America as a concert tour-de-force. I'd not seen it staged until the American Chamber Opera mounted it, cunningly produced by Roger Sullivan, in decor by Queen Margarethe of Denmark, and with Margaret Astrup as a protean, effortlessly able soloist. It opened a triple bill in the Marymount Manhattan Theatre - an East-side mini - Bayreuth. There followed Dominick Argento's songcycle The Andree Expedition, for baritone and piano (Hakan Hagegard introduced it here a few years ago), also dramatized, by Andrew Joffe. With skill and subtlety, Brent Porter played the three Swedes who rashly set out in a balloon, in 1897, to reach the North Pole, perished, but left behind letters, diaries, and film that was found and developed when their bodies were discovered some 30 years later. Argento is a cunning, imaginative chooser and compiler of texts and a stirred, able composer. The Andree Expedition was moving. Rimsky-Korsakov's two-men-plus-orchestra opera Mozart and Salieri closed the bill. Mozart was played by a tenor called William Walton, but the performance was otherwise unmemorable. The Met's annual Lenten and Easter revival of Parsifal assembled what I suppose could be considered the world's leading cast: Siegfried Jerusalem, Waltraud Meier, and Kurt Moll, conducted by James Levine. But only Moll was wholly, consistently satisfactory. Meier - one hears that she now has heroic-soprano ambitions and is contemplating Isolde - had lost her low notes, was uneasy on the peaks, and only in the middle register remained her usual eloquent self. Jerusalem, apparently undirected, was embarrassingly skittish at times. But all three gave seasoned, sure performances. Levine's conducting was slow; he has said 'When I'm in the middle of a Parsifal performance, my idea of heaven is that it will never get over'. He holds the world record for duration, and gets nearer to his heaven each year. Yet the Met orchestra played with such beauty of tone that one didn't mind. Otto Schenk's production is as flat and featureless as his Met Ring. Schneider-Siemssen's decor is decorative, large-scale tinselly. But most of the right things happen. After the Robert Wilson Parsifal in Houston, in which many striking Wilson things but few Wagner things happened, it was good to get back to something like the work that Wagner composed.</p>

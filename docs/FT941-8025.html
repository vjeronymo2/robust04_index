			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Tory peers reject clause on police The government yesterday suffered a further embarrassing setback in the House of Lords at the hands of Conservative backbench critics of the police and magistrates courts bill. Peers voted 107 to 100 to reject plans to speed up police disciplinary procedures after Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister of state, ignored Tory calls to back down. The defeat is the first since the bill entered its committee stage last week. However, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has also backed down twice to avoid a vote. Peers from all parties supported the amendment, moved by Lord Bethell, a Conservative adviser to the Police Federation, who said there was 'deep concern' among police officers about the bill. The bill would have removed from the statute book provisions guaranteeing legal representation to police officers accused of disciplinary offences. Backbench peers said the proposals would place police officers in danger of double jeopardy - being tried twice for the same offence. The government faces further trouble today when the Lords debates provisions intended to streamline the judicial system by improving the administration of magistrates courts. Conservative backbenchers have tabled a series of amendments opposing government plans to reform the duties of magistrates' clerks and to introduce fixed-term contracts. The proposals were strongly opposed by Tory peers during the second-reading debate. However, in spite of growing backbench unrest, the government has pressed ahead.</p>

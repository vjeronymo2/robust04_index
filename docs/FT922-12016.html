			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / EOC is criticised on value for money THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is failing to provide value for money, according to a Civil Service investigation. The draft findings of the inquiry into the commission are likely to be submitted at the end of the month to the Department of Employment. After the general election the department took responsibility from the Home Office for overseeing the commission's work. The early conclusions of the investigation are that the commission is overstaffed and that some employees are too highly graded. In 1990-91 the commission spent Pounds 2.6m on staffing costs associated with its 160 employees out of a Pounds 4.7m income. Departments were reorganised in late 1989 with further changes in 1990 aimed at integrating legal strategies and other activities. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary - who also has responsibility for women's issues - could be embarrassed by the report. There may be attempts to tone it down before it is presented to the commission. Mrs Shephard is unlikely to want a confrontation with the commission at a time when she is coming to grips with equal-opportunities issues, and expectations from women's groups are high. There is added tension because some EOC commissioners have made clear that they opposed the transfer of responsibility for the commission. The commission argued that it needed to be overseen by a central policy department and that its activities were far wider than employment.</p>

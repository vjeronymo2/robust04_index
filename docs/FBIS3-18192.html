			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Negotiations to bring  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European Union [EU]  were suspended on Saturday [26 February] night with little  progress made in the principal sticking points, EU officials  said.    Norway refused to accept EU proposals over fishing and  Austria rejected a proposal to relax strict curbs on polluting  truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, the officials said.    The negotiations were due to resume on Sunday. The Greek  president of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos,  said they faced a make-or-break deadline of Monday midnight.    Failure to meet this deadline means that the political  target  to bring the four candidates into the Union officially next  January 1 will probably be missed.</p>

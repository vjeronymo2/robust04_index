			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Desert kingdom's flight of fancy: Saudi Arabia's Dollars 6bn aircraft order might be the last flourish of a bygone era The timing of Saudi Arabia's announcement that it is to spend Dollars 6bn on purchasing a fleet of passenger aircraft for its domestic carrier could hardly have been less auspicious. For while President Bill Clinton sought to reap domestic political benefit from this latest success of the US aircraft industry, Saudi Arabians were watching the price of crude oil plunge below Dollars 13 a barrel for the first time in five years. It will not be surprising if the financing details and delivery dates for the deal take some time to work out. US and western interest in Saudi Arabia for the past year has focused primarily on the government's worsening economic plight, caused by the 20 per cent decline in oil prices. The main question waiting to be answered was where the spending axe would fall, not where the next large contracts would be placed. Although the US appears now to have tied up the kingdom's aerospace market for the next decade or more, the Dollars 6bn order may yet be remembered as the last flourish of a bygone era, rather than a reliable guide to the future. Saudi Arabia is, of course, no stranger to wild fluctuations in annual oil revenues. It chose for one year in the early 1980s to accept a Dollars 100bn fall in income. But it appears to have no strategy for reversing the present slide in prices, and has only very modest financial reserves to cushion the impact. One senior banker in Riyadh is already forecasting a 5 per cent contraction in the economy this year. If the economic trend is clear, the political response to it remains in some doubt. At the beginning of the year the government announced that it was slashing budget expenditure by 20 per cent, while in Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador, negotiated a slowdown in payments to several of America's biggest defence contractors. For the first time in its modern history, the government is also having to consider measures that will nibble at the unwritten pact between the ruling family and the rest of the population: no representation equals no taxation. Changes to the political side of the equation have already been made, albeit with the caution inherent in deeply conservative regimes. In January, after a gestation period of three decades, King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz finally gave birth to the idea of creating a 60-man majlis al-shura, or consultative council, whose task is to advise him and the government on selected policy issues. From a western perspective it scarcely heralds the dawn of Saudi democracy, but within the local context it was widely viewed as an important step towards popular participation in government. The council can only advise, and then solely on issues selected by the king. But with two-thirds of the members holding advanced degrees from western universities, they could inject a fresh approach and perhaps a hint of urgency into the way Saudi Arabia faces up to the longer-term consequences of its descent from sudden, enormous wealth to that of a middle-income country with a per capita gross national product less than half that of the UK. President Saddam Hussein can claim responsibility for having stripped away the financial safety net with which Saudi Arabia protected itself from previous sharp falls in oil revenues. The estimated Dollars 55bn-Dollars 60bn which it cost the kingdom to fund the international military effort required to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait forced Saudi Arabia into borrowing Dollars 4.5bn, its first international loan. Reserves immediately available to the government now stand at little more than Dollars 6bn. Net official foreign reserves are closer to Dollars 70bn, but more than 80 per cent of that accounts for statutory cover for the currency, amounts held against letters of credit, liabilities to the commercial banks, and loans which will never be repaid. The loss of reserves lends greater weight to the arguments of those calling for more emphatic official action to reduce the substantial budgetary and current account deficits. A report nine months ago by the International Monetary Fund warned: 'The medium-term outlook is for growing budgetary and external current account deficits because current expenditure growth, even if modest, is not expected to be matched by an increase in oil receipts. Such developments would be unsustainable and could cause damage to the economy.' Since then the forecasts on which the IMF based its assessments have worsened significantly, mainly because of the fall in the oil price, but also because the government is unlikely to have stayed within the spending limits it set itself for 1993. In 1992 it had set out with the intention of lopping some 28 per cent off spending, but in the event expenditure of about Dollars 55bn was some Dollars 11bn over target. The overall budget deficit expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product was about 10 per cent, some three times greater than forecast, and more than double that of the US. Further efforts last year to trim spending are likely to have been more than offset by the decline in oil revenues, leaving the deficit/GDP ratio still stuck obstinately in double figures. Against this background it was no longer credible for the government to announce, once again, that it was merely planning to cut expenditure. It was already obvious that government spending would have to decline in line with oil revenues, just to avoid the deficit worsening. On present oil price trends, and assuming a continuing Saudi output of 8m barrels a day, revenues this year might not top Dollars 30bn. This would suggest total budget receipts of about Dollars 38bn, compared with the Dollars 53.6bn forecast by the IMF in its last report. This possible shortfall of Dollars 15bn is partially acknowledged in the scant details released of the 1994 budget, which has set spending at Dollars 42.7bn, a claimed reduction of some 20 per cent. Saudi Arabia is thus left in the uncomfortable position of having to cut deeply, but without any assurance that it can reduce the domestic borrowings needed to fund the budget deficit. The IMF has already warned that even if the authorities kept to their targets, in 1993 total debt would rise from 56 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent, and unless further stringent measures were adopted would rise to 80 per cent in 1997. The budgetary implications of a mounting debt-servicing requirement are clear, but what is also of concern to the private sector is the extent to which increased government borrowing will squeeze funds available for non-official projects. The repatriation of funds since the end of the Gulf war has been sufficient to ensure plentiful banking liquidity, even after government borrowing, but bankers admit that it is not a trend that is guaranteed. Those flows and the slowdown in fulfilling arms contracts should also help ease the country's balance of payments problems, which have mirrored those of the budget. The Dollars 19.4bn current account deficit in 1992 was more than Dollars 8bn over forecast, and the 12 per cent fall in the value of imports during the first half of last year is likely to have been more than offset by the subsequent decline in oil revenues. Further international borrowing, although probably not directly by the government, therefore seems inevitable. The good news for Saudi Arabians, except for the princely few pocketing hefty commissions, is that cutting some of the fat from the budget is not a very onerous task. After the start of the Gulf war, the government went on a Dollars 30bn arms spending spree, in part to thank its allies for their help. But some military advisers in Riyadh claim that little of the new equipment is required to ensure the defence of the kingdom against present known threats, especially as the US personnel can swiftly make operational the equipment left behind after the war in Kuwait. The first modest attempt to address the situation has been the rescheduling of Dollars 6bn out the Dollars 9bn in payments due to US companies over the next two years for the purchase of F-15 fighter aircraft. That may have provided some official justification for the decision to go ahead with the civil aircraft order. Other delays in payments, agreed with defence contractors, are likely to follow, with the possibility of outright cancellations held in reserve. A similarly modest start has also begun on reducing planned increases in domestic capital spending, with Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, scaling down or cancelling projects, including a new Dollars 100m head office, and the heaviest spending ministries reviewing their plans for the year. The astonishing Dollars 2.1bn spent on subsidising wheat production in 1992  -making the desert kingdom the world's sixth largest exporter - was due to have been cut last year by Dollars 700m. The crop also absorbs an estimated 90 per cent of the nation's annual water consumption, a commodity that on present rates of extraction has a lower life expectancy than oil, which would seem to make the argument for further sharp subsidy cuts not just financially sensible but imperative for the nation's long-term viability. But the ripest target of all is still not discussed publicly in the kingdom. As the IMF team was told by officials last year: 'Political and social considerations preclude a reduction in subsidies or an increase in fees or charges.' In other words, hands off one of the world's most comprehensive welfare states, which guarantees its citizens a virtually tax-free environment and provides many basic services at no, or little, cost. It is that issue which, for the senior members of the House of Saud, appears to lie at the heart of maintaining unchallenged political power. But it is equally an issue that will not go away, with the indigenous population having officially topped 12m and growing at about 3.5 per cent annually, one of the highest rates in the world. The burden of recurrent and infrastructure spending on items such as education, healthcare and housing is certain to mount for the rest of the decade and beyond. Unless the balance of world oil supply and demand confounds most present predictions, which includes the assumption that at some point Iraq will resume exports, the government will have to supplement budget spending cuts with revenue-raising measures and find more ways of channelling individual wealth into the national exchequer. One of the long-held tenets among professional Saudi watchers is that the greatest threat to the stability of the regime would come from a serious breakdown in the cohesion of the extended royal family. If social equity was to play any part in the government's future revenue-raising plans, it is precisely that group of people who would be expected to contribute most. This is possibly where the newly formed consultative council will eventually find its niche: as the cautious proponent of ideas which are commonplace among nations with similar income levels, but still politically incorrect in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the government will continue to count its blessings, foremost among them 25 per cent of the world's known oil reserves and the possibility of being able to continue producing 8m barrels a day for at least the next 100 years. Saudi Arabia can also derive some satisfaction that its two greatest potential external threats, Iraq and Iran, are mired in their own domestic problems, while continuing peace efforts are defusing the threat of further Arab-Israeli conflicts. The decision to press ahead with the Dollars 6bn aircraft order serves in part to underline those strengths. It also reinforces the government's desire not to rock the domestic boat more than absolutely necessary, which is, as ever, likely to prove the best guide to future Saudi policy. Even so, there is little prospect this year of much cheering news to offset the country's more sombre economic long-term prospects. More than a passing thought should be spared for the responsibility resting on the shoulders of the national soccer team on June 20, when they take the field for their first World Cup match, against Holland, in Washington. A win, even a goal, might be worth more politically to the House of Saud than a dollar on the price of oil.</p>

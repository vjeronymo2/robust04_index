			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Staking his reputation THE British prime minister cannot be accused of failing to give a lead. He has certainly done so this week. In two important speeches, the first on the future of the European Community and the second on the exchange rate, Mr John Major has attempted to explain the government's strategy to a wider public. In so doing he has not prevaricated, nor has he sought to distance his personal position from that of the government as a whole, as other prime ministers have been known to do. On the contrary, he has put his own reputation and maybe his political future on the line. On Monday Mr Major rehearsed the government's case for supporting the Maastricht treaty on European union. In essence, it is that it is always in Britain's interest to be a willing participant in plans for the evolution of European unity, not least because only those who take part can influence such plans. Britain did exert influence at Maastricht, in the direction of a looser political structure than Euro-federalists would like. The result was a compromise. Yet the issues that the continent faces - economic development, enlargement of the community, responses to international crises  -would not disappear if the treaty were to remain unratified. In defiance of the alarums from his own backbenches, Mr Major expressed an unmistakable wish that the treaty be ratified. If 'Maastricht' is engraved on the prime minister's heart, political prudence is still, on this matter, in control of his head. In his speech he reaffirmed that if the French vote No tomorrow week Maastricht will be dead. If the Danes cannot be honourably accommodated, there will be no treaty. Assuming that France and Denmark are back on board, the British government's policy is to face a parliamentary battle, however bruising, in order to ensure the passage of the ratification bill. Since all three national political parties are in favour of the deal (leaving aside dissidents within each of their ranks), it is reasonable to assume that eventual passage is assured. No referendum Mr Major did, however, leave one hostage to fortune in this speech. He emphatically ruled out a British referendum. A close Yes vote would increase the pressure for such a consultation. The prime minister is presumably relying on the Labour party's apparent unwillingness to push for a national vote. This is in part due to a belief that it would be wrong, in part to an inglorious fear of exposing the splits within Labour's own ranks. If, however, the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, summons up his courage, he may seize the opportunity to call for a people's verdict. That would put the government on the spot. This is as nothing to what would happen if Britain is eventually forced to devalue sterling, either outright or as part of a general realignment of currencies inside the exchange rate mechanism. On this matter political calculation and a whip's natural prudence have been cast aside. Mr Major's address to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow on Thursday night leaves no room for doubt about his commitment. 'There is going to be no devaluation, no realignment,' he insisted. Cynics may argue that any prime minister would have to say as much, given the state of the currency markets this week. That may be so, but no prime minister is bound to assert, with such uncharacteristic passion as that used by Mr Major on Thursday, that 'the soft option, the devaluer's option, the inflationary option would be a betrayal of our future' and to add, with especial emphasis, 'and it is not the government's policy'. Motivating force With these words the prime minister has staked his political authority on an exchange rate over which he can have only a limited degree of control. The public now knows that the ambition to strive for zero inflation and stick there is not Mr Norman Lamont's, or not the chancellor's alone. It is the prime minister's motivating force. For him it is a matter of principle. If there were now to be a devaluation he would lose credibility. A general ERM realignment, which would not be a miracle cure for the economy, might be complicated enough to allow for a technical escape, but probably not at the bar of public opinion. Mr Major's plain speaking, his obvious sincerity and his widely perceived honesty, constitute his principal sources of political strength. A sneaky devaluation, leaving open the question of why we were all lashed to the mast for two stormy years, would put all that at risk. The consequence is that there will either be a wreck, if the turbulence in the markets increases in force, or following a further prolonged period of economic pain the gains will begin to be regarded as worthwhile. With the continuation of the recession, the government cannot finance public expenditure at the levels currently contemplated; cuts that affect millions of people are likely to be imposed. They must hope that Mr Major's economics are right. These years of hard slog must be justified by results. On such scales, a reputation is but a feather.</p>

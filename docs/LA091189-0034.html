			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JASPER JOHNS -- THE MAN AND HIS ART ON 'MASTERS'  </P> <P> Jasper Johns had his first show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, a Manhattan  showcase most artists would kill for, and he immediately sold three paintings  to the Museum of Modern Art. It was an auspicious beginning for an artist often  said to be the best in the country and who commands higher auction prices than  any other living artist.  </P> <P> "I look at Johns' career as pretty much a downhill slide from a not very high  point to begin with," critic Hilton Kramer says, but no one shares his view in  "Jasper Johns: Ideas in Paint," airing on "American Masters" at 9 tonight on  Channels 28 and 15.  </P> <P> Artists Frank Stella and Richard Serra, critics Barbara Rose and Paul Richard,  dealer Castelli, choreographer Merce Cunningham and experimental musician John  Cage are full of praise as they explain that Johns' work is, well, you know,  unexplainable.  </P> <P> This leisurely hourlong film, produced and directed by Rick Tejada-Flores,  takes time for Cage's music, Cunningham's dance, a sequence on printmaking and  the seldom-heard-from artist's long pauses. Collage-like in structure, "Ideas  in Paint" proceeds chronologically but also doubles back on itself, picking up  snippets from commentators and returning to Christie's Nov. 9, 1988, auction,  where Johns' "White Flag" set a record of $7 million -- topped the following  night by Sotheby's $17-million sale of "False Start."  </P> <P> "I don't think I fully understand the process," Johns says. "When it begins,  you're pleased that you can make something and sell it. It allows you to devote  yourself to the work you want to do. As it expands and the value increases, you  see that society takes over in the value and the meaning of the work."  </P> <P> With Johns, the meaning is the tricky part. What to make of his targets, flags,  maps and ale cans? The reticent artist offers some insights: His work reflects  the fragmentation of life, neutral subject matter allows him to concentrate on  painting, he doesn't want his work to expose his feelings, he prefers real  things to illusions.  </P> <P> If he appears uncomfortable, looking rather like a furtive rabbit, it's  probably because he wants to get on with his job. If the film is disjointed, it  nonetheless reflects the complex texture of Johns' inscrutable art. SUZANNE  MUCHNIC  </P></p>

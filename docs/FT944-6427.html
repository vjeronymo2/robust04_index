			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (16): New areas where traditionalists fear to tread - Sub-custodians / Who bears the risk? Norma Cohen considers the options There are probably as many ways to spread the risk in dealing with sub-custodians as there are sub-custodians to share it, says Alistair Reid, of Barclays Global Securities Services. The question of who bears the risk and how much it should cost is provoking increasing interest among clients, particularly as they move their investments into new markets where traditional custodians fear to tread. 'In the area of risk, the question of sub-custodian risk has taxed the market for some time,' said Valentine Feerick, head of global trust and custody at Mellon Trust Europe. 'There isn't another business in the world where you hire someone to do a job who isn't responsible for the work of a sub-contractor.' For the UK's Prudential, which has excited the global custody industry by deciding to outsource its Pounds 40bn portfolio of UK and international securities, there was only one answer to the question. 'Sub-custodian risk is something we want nothing to do with,' said David Hanson, a director of Prudential Portfolio Managers, the fund management arm of the UK life insurer. In coming up with a short-list of 10 international banks to compete for the contract, Mr Hanson said it was made clear that a condition of winning the contract would be that the bidder assume the risk of any failure to perform on the part of sub-custodians. Any bank which was not prepared to go some way towards that goal was removed from the short-list, he said. Of course, the Pru, with one of the world's largest global custody contracts to award, is in a secure position to demand exacting conditions of any bank. However, not all customers are in such an enviable position, nor are all of them sufficiently well-informed about the issue to make such a demand. At Barclays, Mr Reid said, the bank stood behind its sub-custodial network, indemnifying clients against losses. Typically, Barclays uses its own branch network where possible, so that the number of sub-custodians is limited. The most dangerous markets for investors are the emerging markets, where local banks which could act as sub-custodians may not be subject to sufficient regulation, or may not have the administrative capability to handle client custody. Mr Reid noted that banks viewed some new markets as simply too risky to operate in successfully. They feel that clients wishing to invest in those markets may do so but at their own peril, and must be responsible for selecting the sub-custodian, and live with any losses. Where a Barclays branch is used, the bank offers clients the opportunity to check their assets in the relevant country, he said. Where a sub-custodian is used, Barclays asks that bank's auditors to provide a 'comfort letter' assuring Barclays that it is fulfilling its contractual obligations. At Mellon, the bank will assume all the sub-custodian risk with the exception of events falling under the force majeure clause. 'That means things like military coups,' Mr Feerick explained. However, he notes, there is a price for assuming that risk. 'You might quote a slightly lower price for the service if the client assumes the risk.' Bank of New York, one of the world's largest global custodians, stands behind the sub-custodian for all operational errors, said Richard Crampton, managing director at BONY. 'We will see our customer harmless and sort it out with the sub-custodian.' One of the big concerns about sub-custodians is the local jurisprudence  - the extent to which local law governing assets held in trust is likely to be upheld by the courts. 'Once a year we get a lawyer to opine on the predictability of the courts in any country in which we operate,' Mr Crampton said Mr Crampton notes that the only law which forces custodians to monitor their sub-custodians is Rule 17-S-5 of the US Mutual Fund Act. This stipulates a minimum capital requirement for sub-custodians, and insists that they operate in environments where trust law is comparable with that in the US. As a result, Mr Crampton said, 'there are some central African countries where US mutual funds cannot invest', because they cannot find appropriate sub-custodial arrangements. However, he said, it would be unreasonable to expect BONY to guarantee the solvency of any sub-custodial bank. In any event, he added, most countries recognised the legal distinction between proprietary assets and those held in trust for others. Trust assets might not be claimed by a bank's creditors or regulators in most jurisdictions. The only danger to clients comes through their cash balances, which may be held at a bank which suddenly becomes insolvent, Mr Crampton says. However, he offers the comforting thought that 'in most of the really diabolical markets of this world, you wouldn't have much cash on deposit anyway.' Moreover, he says, in the newer emerging markets - and indeed, even in several mature markets - clients are at far greater risk from the clearing and settlement of securities transactions than they are from their local custodian. The dangerous period is while a securities transaction is still waiting to settle, rather than afterwards. At Morgan Stanley, the issue of sub-custodial risk is a significant one, because the investment bank has almost no custody branches outside the US and the UK. 'We will indemnify clients against fraud, negligence and wilful misconduct,' said Ross Whitehill, head of global custody. 'If you don't do that, you miss out on most of the larger mandates.' Morgan Stanley says that, short of that, it will do everything it can to sort out operational errors, some of which are the result of the client failing to instruct the sub-custodian on time. 'We try to help,' Mr Whitehill explained. However, the extent to which Morgan Stanley is prepared to bear its clients' sub-custodian losses is often a function of the value of the total account. 'It gets down to how good the relationship is,' he explained. For a client who had been squeezing the fees and routing other business elsewhere, Morgan Stanley would be less willing to cushion the loss.</p>

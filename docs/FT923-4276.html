			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Business Law: Legal maze of Maastricht From a legal point of view, the Maastricht Treaty on European is rather a mixed bag. Provisions on economic and monetary union in the treaty are of immediate concern to governments and the money markets, but at this stage they say little to lawyers or businessmen. This is also largely true of provisions on foreign policy and home affairs. One significant legal change is the entrenchment of 'subsidiarity' in the text of the treaty. Changes to the rules on capital movements include power to act collectively on inward investment into the Community. Of the remaining legal provisions, three examples will serve to show what a maze the treaty really is: a new legislative method, new Community objectives, exclusion of the UK from the social agreement. Only the first helps business in any way; the second and third will add little or nothing to the coherence of Community law in principle or in practice. Legislative method is important for business because the parliament is the most accessible channel for lobbying. The convoluted new procedure under article 189b, giving the parliament the right ultimately to reject a measure, is therefore a positive development. A welcome improvement connected with this is the identification of the correct legislative method for most of the treaty powers. Litigation challenging the adoption of directives and regulations for having followed the wrong path became an unnecessary burden on the Court after 1986 when the Single European Act enhanced the parliament's role. If the ministers adopted unanimous decisions when they could have voted by majority, they relegated the parliament to its old role of bare consultation: its opinion had to be sought but no notice had to be taken of what it said. The Court put this right by insisting that the correct procedure be followed, though the effect of an invalidated measure can be preserved pending proper adoption. Examples of measures that will have to use the new procedure are 'single market measures' under article 100a, rules on the free movement of workers, the freedom to establish a business, and consumer protection. Examples for the present co-operation procedure (which allows the Council of Ministers to override the parliament's amendments only by unanimous vote) are rules on health and safety at work, transport and the environment. The Community's objectives under the new Article 3 have a hint of political compromise about them. They are central to Community law because the European Court refers to them when spelling out the meaning of more specific rules. Moreover, they embody the goals for the EC countries' domestic lawmaking and may influence the Court when deciding whether a national rule is contrary to Community law. The Maastricht treaty adds a number of new interests - immigration and freedom of movement of non-EC nationals, the competitiveness of European industry, trans-European networks, education and training, the 'flowering' of national cultures, energy, civil protection and tourism. Economic and social cohesion, research and development, the environment, health, consumer protection and the fisheries policy are given full-blown status as objectives. These are added to familiar items such as competition and the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. The different interests are accorded relative importance by a wide variety of qualifying words. For example, cohesion and industry's competitiveness are to be 'strengthened', R&amp;D is to be 'promoted', and the establishment and development of networks are to be 'encouraged'. The negotiators seem to have been nervous about health and consumer interests: the treaty will aim for 'contributions' to 'the attainment of a high level of health protection' and 'the strengthening of consumer protection'. For non-EC nationals and for energy, civil protection and tourism, it will aim for 'measures'. The environment is to be given a 'policy' in place of a requirement for Community action. The European Court will be called upon to give practical meaning to these expressions. Some of them are little more than statements of good intent and others simply empower the Community to act in a particular field. For example, no indication of the type of action to be taken could be implied from the Community's duty to take 'measures in the sphere of energy'; nothing more seems to be said about energy in the treaty. Interests that call for measures or a policy generally call also for action by the Council of Ministers. The Court can give some effect to these, provided a positive purpose can be identified, even if the ministers prove unable to agree on what to do. How the Court would treat the need to make a 'contribution' remains to be seen. An obviously troublesome item is industrial competitiveness. Admittedly, the follow-up provision states that it may not be used as the basis for any measure which could lead to a distortion of competition, so the Commission will be able to continue its competition-based approach to mergers and competition law generally. It augurs badly in relation to issues where no clear-cut distortion of competition is threatened. It could also weaken the hand of those commissioners who take a sternly free-market view in arguments over industrial subsidies. Although it might be possible to say that a competitive company is one which has been made muscular by vigorous competition on its home market, conventional wisdom would say that, to compete internationally with US and Asian megaliths, a European enterprise needs size and domestic market power. Other ambiguities could arise. For example, could not a higher-than-normal health precaution in one EC country be said to 'contribute to the attainment of a high level of health protection'? Could the more protective country justify its standards on, say, the labelling of pharmaceutical products, even though other countries considered such precautions unnecessary? Again, does 'culture' include national cuisine? If so, could the name of a dish be culturally protected despite the present rules confining protection quite strictly to geographical origin? These riddles may prove simple compared with those resulting from the partial implementation of the treaty. The UK's refusal to sign the the agreement on employment law will dilute the uniform, mandatory nature of Community law and confuse UK businesses that are active in other EC countries. The present articles 117-122 of the Treaty remain almost unchanged. Article 118a allows directives to be issued on the health and safety of workers, and article 119 directly requires equal pay for equal work by men and women. These overlap some of the issues covered by the social agreement between the other 11 countries (for example, equality of the sexes in treatment at work). The agreement also restates article 119, but with an addition allowing advantages to be granted in favour of women to compensate for disadvantages in their careers. This safeguard against wayward claims of discrimination by men will not be available to UK employers. On their own, the legal divergences between EC countries caused by this schism might be manageable. They have, however, to be combined with whatever compromise is reached with Denmark, which rejected the Maastricht treaty but is still a full member of the Community, and with the extension of Community law to the Efta countries up to the date of signature of the EEA Agreement (May 2 1992). Dealings in other European countries will not be made any easier by having to refer to several different Community laws. The business traveller's overnight bag will more than ever need to include a lawyer. The author is executive editor of Financial Times Business Law Brief.</p>

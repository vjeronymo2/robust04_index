			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Fiscal reform triggers recovery in Athens - But the market has performed less spectacularly than in 1990 Greek stockbrokers have been making good use of their time since last summer when the Athens Stock Exchange went into a steady decline, ending 1991 underperforming Europe by some 23 per cent. Many of the 50 brokerage houses set up research departments with the result that, for the first time, a steady stream of information is available on the 150 listed companies. 'Investors were taking decisions on the basis of little more than hearsay. Now we can offer them real analysis, even technical analysis,' says Mr John Markopoulos of Sigma Securities, one of several brokerages which issue a weekly report for investors on economic and financial developments. Whether they are studying fundamentals or not, Greek investors have certainly grown more cautious. When the market finally turned upwards last month, the rise was much less spectacular than it had been in previous recoveries. The Athens General index started the year at 801.9, near to its lowest level in 1991 when it declined by almost 30 per cent, reflecting a fall in confidence as the government's economic stabilisation programme began to be felt. Prices climbed steadily to reach 1,009.4 early in February, before receding: the general index closed at 942.27 yesterday. Turnover has risen since the start of the year from Dr30m (Dollars 5.1m) daily to more than Dr3bn. In one hectic day's trading, just over Dr5bn changed hands, briefly recalling the heady days of 1990 when the general index rose by some 300 per cent before losing more than half of that gain. However, turnover has now fallen back, touching Dr1.5bn earlier this week. The recovery was triggered by the government's announcement of a fiscal reform package that would reduce corporation tax from 42 to 35 per cent, as well as cutting the tax on share dividends from 45 to 32 per cent. Greek companies are also being required to revalue fixed assets this year and to capitalise their reserves, but this measure will be tax-exempt. As a result, a number of companies are expected to make scrip issues later this year. In spite of the gloomy overall picture in 1991, affected by economic weakness and predictions that the recession would continue well into the following year, banks, leasing companies and food processors all performed strongly. These sectors are expected to ride out the recession more easily than most companies, say analysts. Interest rates on three and six-month treasury bills, the government's preferred instrument for financing the public sector deficit, are forecast to come down this year as inflation gradually slows: it stood at 18.1 per cent in January and is forecast to fall to 13.5 per cent by the end of the year. However, it will take more than expectations of tax cuts and declining interest rates to keep the market buoyant. Mr Markopoulos says: 'Every time there is a dip, the institutional investors start moving in. It is still very much a buyer's market.' Although interest rates still hover around 26 per cent, few companies are coming to the market for funds. Last year, there were 14 new listings and 28 rights issues, together raising a total of Dr157bn. So far this year not a single prospectus has been issued. Instead of tapping the bourse for fresh capital, Delta Dairies, a leading milk and fruit juice producer, recently decided to raise Dr2.2bn through a five-year corporate bond. The issue was taken up entirely by banks and institutional investors. Nevertheless, exchange officials are predicting more activity when automated trading is launched, probably by the summer. The open outcry system now in use will be phased out over the summer after screens are introduced on the trading floor and in stockbrokers' offices. Mr Nikitas Niarchos, the bourse chairman, says: 'Computerised trading will boost confidence by improving transparency. At the moment, people complain because they do not know what price they are buying at.'</p>

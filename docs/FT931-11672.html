			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Krajina fighting worsens amid fear for UN zones CLASHES between Serbs and Croats yesterday appeared to intensify in Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, amid fears that the fighting could spread to other UN zones. Serb military leaders in Krajina claimed as many as 20,000 Croat troops were massing in UN Sector West in central Croatia, which has so far been peaceful. UN officials said they were aware of the reports, but warned that peacekeepers were prepared to defend the year-long ceasefire line. The fighting in Croatia came as diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in neighbouring Bosnia moved from Geneva to UN headquarters in New York. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, peace talks co-chairmen, met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in New York last night. In Brussels, EC foreign ministers yesterday gave their 'full and unequivocal support' to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, and called on the UN security council to back up what they called a 'coherent and comprehensive settlement'. Officials admitted, however, that there had been no substantive discussion on how to implement and enforce the plan. There was also strong support for convening a tribunal to judge war crimes committed in former Yugoslavia, spurred by discussion yesterday of the report by Dame Anne Warburton on the use of rape - particularly against Bosnian Moslem women - as a weapon. Ministers and officials brushed aside suggestions that the Vance-Owen plan might be seen to endorse land-grabs by Serbia which could set precedents in other disputes in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union. In Krajina, Serb military leaders said Croatia had launched a 'general offensive' along a 25km arc stretching from Obrovac in the north to Skradin in the south, 11 days after Croat forces pushed across UN lines. UN officials confirmed reports of tank and artillery duels in the area around the Serb-held town of Benkovac, in UN Sector South, one of four UN protected areas comprising Serb enclaves. Tension was also growing in Sector East, which includes Vukovar, the town devasted by the Yugoslav army during the seven-month war over Croatian independence. The upsurge in fighting came as the fate of the Bosnian peace talks yesterday hung in the balance. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, said he would boycott the talks, proposed for New York.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 5: Silver lining amid the storm clouds - Spain / Domestic retailers are opening up for trading at a giddy pace THE Spanish economy has slowed down and could slow further before it accelerates again. Business which boomed in the late 1980s is feeling the pinch and where once there were record profits figures there are now indicators of increasing bad debts. It is not surprising, given such an environment, that the Spanish property market should be facing a pressure that is altogether novel to it. There was a rush to build office space when the economic take-off, three to four years ago, revealed a woeful lack of available facilities and the result is that now, when annual GDP growth of under 2.5 per cent is less than half what it was a short while back, the supply curve has easily outstripped the curve for demand. If there is a silver lining among the Spanish storm clouds it is to be found in the commercial property niche. There is a lag between real growth and consumption growth, especially in a traditionally non-saving society such as Spain's, and large retail centres which are tuned to the domestic big spenders continue to attract investors. In Madrid the demand for office space in 1988, according to Richard Ellis, stood at 240.000 sq m while the supply was 195,000 sq m. The imbalance was rectified the following year: in 1989, demand had grown to 375.000 sq m but supply was, at 385.000 sq m, marginally above that figure. The picture was one of a sustained business bullishness and of constructers rushing to meet the demand. This became clear in 1990 when demand for office space grew once more to stand at 475.000 sq m and again outstripped the supply which had grown to 416,000 sq m. Last year the picture altered. Richard Ellis estimated that in 1991 demand in Madrid had dropped to 400,000 sq m. This was the first annual drop in the demand for office space in the Spanish capital since 1985. Supply, however, egged on by the previous year's imbalance, had surged ahead and represented the truly big figure of 550,000 sq m. The gap between supply and demand therefore stood last year at 150,000 sq m which was nearly double the 1985 gap - the previous largest overshoot of supply over demand - when demand stood at 117,000 sq m and supply stood at 194,000 sq m. The situation, looked at sympathetically, was neither more nor less than what can be expected when an economy changes suddenly down from high to second gear. Richard Ellis notes how real estate companies, in view of the increased available space, are turning increasingly to joint ventures and to swaps. Asking rents remain stable and leases for larger amounts of space are subject to lengthy negotiations. Margins are shorter and the difficulties greater on the outskirts of the Spanish capital where the completion of one ring road and the onset of a second have prompted a rush to build suburban business parks. Healey and Baker opened its first Spain office in Madrid in the boom times of 1988 and has since added a second in Barcelona. It continues to back Spain because it perceived a high level of activity over the past six months both from pace-setting domestic retailers and from international retailers anxious either to establish themselves or to expand their existing outlets. Non-Spaniards view Spain as the largest underdeveloped market for the retail trade. Spanish multiple retailers, who have shown great expertise in tapping the teenage and youth market - 35 per cent of the Spanish population is under the age of 25 - have known this for some time. The domestic retailers are accordingly opening up for trading at a giddy pace on the high streets of the main Spanish towns. The larger provincial cities have been the focus of many retailer expansion plans and Healey and Baker sees in them the best prospect for rental growth. Until the spendthrift Spaniards catch up with the realities of the economic slowdown, this particular niche of the property market will continue to be buoyant.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 10 per cent of first of a building               year's rent                             Legal fees: 0.5 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: 10 per cent of average annual of a building               rent                             Legal fees: 0.5 per cemt  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Agents fees: 2 per cent-3 per cent or owner/occupier           Legal fees: 2 per cent of total sale cost  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Agents fees: 2 per cent-3 per cent or owner/occupier           Legal fees 1 per cent                             Transfer tax + stamp duty: 6 per cent of                             sale price + 12 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

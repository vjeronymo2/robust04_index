			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] Marcelino dos Santos, Mozambique's Assembly  president, said during a news conference that there is an  historic demand for Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] to win  the elections and there is no possibility that its main  opposition, Renamo [Mazambique National Resistance], could wage  a war as UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] did in Angola after the elections.    Dos Santos also said the conditions under which his country  will celebrate its national holiday on 25 June. Dos Santos  stressed that he was in Cuba to learn firsthand the situation  there and the manner in which the people are ready to resist and  triumph.    [Begin Dos Santos recording, in Portuguese] I would like to  express our complete solidarity with the Republic of Cuba. We  must fight this international illegality, the economic blockade  against Cuba, which is an international bastion.    Let us not forget that the peoples of the world need Cuba to  remain firm, and that it is important for the progress of all  peoples. Furthermore, I would say the victory of the Cuban  people is necessary for all the peoples of the world. [end  recording]</p>

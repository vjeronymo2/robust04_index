			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: There is no doubt that any Arab meeting  in which Syria participates must, by all criteria, be considered  a source of strength for the Arabs in light of the current  circumstances and challenges. By reaffirming the importance of  Arab coordination and the need for consultations among the Arabs  and by sticking to the constant Arab rights, Syria asserts that  it will not be anything other than the conscience of the Arabs,  the holder of the pan-Arab banner, and the defender of our  nation's just causes. Nor will it allow the enemies of the Arab  nation to impose their conditions and diktats or to harm the  Arab will to protect and regain their rights.    Hence, the pressure being brought to bear on Syria will  certainly be doomed to failure because Syria is sincere and  serious in its endeavors to achieve a just and comprehensive  peace. Syria also has no doubt that its battle to make true  peace will be strenuous and difficult, particularly since the  Israeli Government is trying to block and abort peace process  and force it from its true path.    The summit meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and  President Ilyas al-Hirawi came to show that any attempts to  distance Lebanon from Syria will inevitably be doomed to  complete failure. This has been proven by the facts and the  deep-rooted, strong relations between Lebanon and Syria. It has  also been proven by brotherly relations and constructive and  positive cooperation maintained by both countries in the  interest of the one people in Syria and Lebanon.    The challenges to which the two countries, Syria and  Lebanon,  are being exposed are the same in light of current events,  developments, and interaction. Here, there is no doubt that the  joint vision, the unified position, and the strong will between  the two countries will enable them to deal with the current  issues in a comprehensive manner and, consequently, to confront  the resulting challenges and missions.    The peace process was a key issue in the summit talks  between  President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi in  Damascus, particularly since the outcome of this process  requires, as both presidents asserted, continued cooperation and  coordination between the two countries and efforts to achieve a  just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the approved  bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    All evidence shows that the strong relationship between  Syria  and Lebanon stems from their true brotherhood. The Brotherhood  and Cooperation Treaty between the two countries came to explain  to every one trying to penetrate this relationship that ties  between Syria and Lebanon are stronger and bigger than all  attempts and that these ties will remain impregnable to all  plots of treachery and any carrot and stick policy. Even if  Israel recruits all it means, policies, and tools, it will not  be able to harm Syria's support for Lebanon in its battle to  liberate its land and implement Resolution No. 425, which  stipulates the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from  southern Lebanon immediately and unconditionally.    Syria, while stressing its full support for Lebanon to  regain  its territories, will never accept less than the return of the  entire of the Golan Heights to the motherland, Syria. These  Syrian Arab assertions stem from its strong desire to make the  peace process successful and achieve its goals, as defined by  the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    Israel is completely mistaken if it believes it can peddle  its designs and pretexts. Syria had the last word when it  declared that there would be no peace with occupation and that  true peace is based on total withdrawal in return for  comprehensive peace.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Tu, member of the Communist Party of </F> Vietnam Central Committee and president of the Confederation of  Vietnamese Workers]    [Text] In the movement to renovate socialist construction,  along with the formation of a multifaceted economy and the  reorganization of production, the Vietnamese working class is  undergoing many important structural, ideological, and  psychological changes and changes in labor style.    Above all, because of the changes in occupational patterns,  along with the ranks of workers who have a long tradition of  revolutionary struggle, ranks of workers have appeared in new  occupations that use modern technology, that have foreign  investment, and that are expanding rapidly. This includes the  oil and gas, information, electronics, posts and  telecommunications, and service sectors. A number of these  sectors are quickly moving to the forefront: the shipping,  aviation, electric power, and light industrial production  sectors. These changes have in turn led to changes in the value  rankings of the sectors. Because of the growth of the world  economic structure and because of their technological  backwardness, many sectors that were once viewed as "key"  sectors no longer enjoy that status.    Along with this process has been the appearance of more and  more young and healthy workers who have high educational  standards, who can assimilate modern technology quickly, and who  are working in electronic control and microcomputer offices,  shuttle-less textile mills, and varied labor services networks.    The changes in the structure of the economic elements has  been devastating to those production and commercial  installations that have clung to the state subsidies mechanism.  During that period, many enterprises and production and  commercial installations in the state sector operated at a loss  and production was stagnant. The workers were not very  interested in productivity, the quality of the products, or the  economic results. Tens of billions of dong in commodities  stagnated and could not be sold because of poor quality and high  production costs. In the wake of the reorganization of  production and commerce, at present only about half of the state  enterprises are regarded as stable and have been issued permits  to resume operations. About 19 percent of the enterprises have  been disbanded.    Along with this situation is the decline in the ranks of  state workers and the movement of state-sector production chains  to other economic elements (about 700,000 people). At the same  time, the ranks of workers in the nonstate sector have expanded  rapidly, with the number of such workers increasing to 2.2  million people by the middle of 1993. The labor pattern is quite  varied, with self-employed, cooperative, private enterprise, and  joint enterprise workers. The point worth noting here is that,  at many factories, enterprises, and production units, the  ownership rights and dignity of the workers are not respected.  This has limited the labor zeal and creative abilities of the  workers and reduced their ability to struggle to defend the  truth. This is one of the reasons why workers at a number of  enterprises and factories have left their jobs and gone on  strike in the past. For example, since 1989, in the state sector  there have been 27 strikes, and in the private sector there have  been 17 strikes with economic demands, demands for democracy,  and so on. On the other hand, the market mechanism has led to  another phenomenon among some workers and laborers and that is a  psychology of using personal interests as the motive force for  action. Unless this psychology is kept in check, it will lead to  pragmatism, the class concept of some workers will become  corrupted, and they will not be proud of being members of the  working class. They will become indifferent to the present  situation and to the domestic and international political  situation, their moral quality will decline, and their spirit of  comradeship and class attachments will fade and be replaced by  "group" and local relationships.    One of the basic causes of the above situation is the state  subsidies mechanism and the protracted lack of social fairness.  This has weakened labor zeal, given rise to a concept of  dependence on others and passivity, corrupted a number of  workers, and done great damage to the ranks of workers with  respect to thinking, organization, ethics, way of life, skills,  and labor style.    Many of the positions and policies on workers and production  and commercial installations have not yet been standardized to  form a synchronized, unified, and organized operating mechanism  that can be implemented resolutely. The new management mechanism  and the economic elements have gone into operation, but the  necessary laws to go along with this have not yet been  promulgated. Such laws include a worker and laborer health  protection law, an unemployment law, and a labor law.    On the other hand, because of reorganizing production, of  the  more than 700,000 workers who have left the production chain,  only about 20 percent have managed to find a job. As for work  conditions, because the machinery and equipment are old and  outmoded, because the labor environment is dangerous, and  because protecting the laborers has not been given the proper  amount of attention, particularly in private enterprises,  serious accidents occur frequently and work-related illnesses  are on the rise. Labor intensity is high (averaging 9-10 hours a  day in the private sector). Incomes are low, and the wages and  bonuses paid to the laborers are enough for them to satisfy only  their minimum needs. In the private and joint enterprise  sectors, the workers and laborers must accept the low incomes if  they want to have a job and maintain their lives. Because of  this, the problem here is to provide the workers with an  adequate standard of living based on their basic wage and  principal occupation. Skilled industrial workers have been  allowed to earn a living by crop cultivation, animal husbandry,  and even trading, and that is why their thinking, psychology,  and labor style have become more and more remote from a working  class nature. This will weaken the social class basis of the  party.    However, in the new revolutionary stage, the working class  has always agreed with the renovation line of the party. It has  broken away from the old management mechanism, implemented a  multifaceted economy, and acted in accord with a market  mechanism controlled by the state. This unanimity shows that the  working class and its vanguard units have remained united and  that the party's lines are in accord with the wishes and  interests of the working class, all strata of laborers, and all  the people. This is an important factor in ensuring that the  renovation movement moves in the right direction and is  successful.    As broad political-social organizations of Vietnamese  workers  and laborers, the trade union organizations face new challenges  and new conditions. The trade unions must undergo a major  renovation with respect to organization and activities so that  they really become schools of socialism and solidarity and  protect the interests of Vietnamese workers and laborers in the  renovation movement.    The "wealthy people, strong country, civilized society"  target put forth at the seventh party congress is a struggle  target of the working class and Vietnamese trade unions. The  trade unions must really become the representative of the  workers in fulfilling the obligations of masters of society and  masters of the country in the renovation movement to have a  wealthy people, strong country, and civilized society and to  build and defend the fatherland. They must give attention to  protecting the interests of the laborers and participate in  managing the state. They must be broad organizations for  mobilizing and educating the laborers.    The renovation guidelines concerning trade union  organization  and activities must be directed toward the following  requirements:    Attracting large numbers of workers and laborers in the  economic elements to voluntarily join a trade union and having  them strive for national stability, democracy, social  renovation, and the interests of the workers and laborers.    Varying the forms of activities and launching a  revolutionary  action movement composed of large numbers of workers and  laborers in order to contribute to hitting the targets and  carrying out the tasks in the renovation movement.    Building a rank of talented trade union cadres with  organizational capabilities who can carry out the functions of  the trade unions, who have a close relationship with the masses,  and who are close to the primary level.    Forming an organizational system that is in accord with a  multifaceted economy that operates based on market mechanisms  while still maintaining the principle of democratic centralism  and improving the effectiveness and operating results of the  trade union organizations at the enterprises and production  installations.    In recent years, the entire trade union system has been in  turmoil. It has looked for ways to further clarify the  renovation viewpoints of the party, ensure that trade union  activities are in accord with the new mechanism, satisfy the  requirements and tasks of building and defending the fatherland,  satisfy the needs and hopes of the workers and laborers, give  attention to and protect their legitimate and legal rights and  interests, and at the same time give attention to participating  in controlling the workers and laborers and educating them about  their obligations.    Trade unions at the central echelon and primary level have  concentrated on spreading propaganda and mobilizing the workers  and laborers to ensure that they thoroughly understand the  renovation line of the party and agree with the production  reorganization policy. Revolving around the target of "jobs,  living standards, democracy, and social fairness," the various  echelons have looked for ways to provide jobs and improve the  work conditions and standard of living of the workers. In the  difficult conditions of changing mechanisms, the labor movement  to create and exploit innovations has been maintained. At the  same time, new emulation movements have been launched with the  targets being productivity, quality, and results in a market  mechanism.    At many production installations, the trade unions have  established mutual aid funds to give loans to poor laborers and  expand the family economy. Many localities have established job  promotion centers, and a number of places have established legal  consultation offices. The Secretariat of the Labor Confederation  has participated in drafting the Constitution, trade union law,  and many draft laws, regulations, and decrees related to the  rights and obligations of laborers.    In places where labor disputes and conflicts between  laborers  and owners have arisen, the trade unions have promptly  coordinated things with the local authorities to provide direct  guidance, resolve things on the spot, ensure the legitimate and  legal interests of the laborers, and quickly stabilize the  situation.    Educating and mobilizing the workers has been renovated, and  active and self-sufficient nature of the primary level has been  exploited. The quality of the mass means of information has been  improved. Summarizing practices and studying theory have been  promoted in order to ensure that trade union activities are in  line with the party's lines, to improve commercial production  results, and to contribute to stabilizing the economic,  political, and social situation.    Emphasis has been given to finding and expanding the  effective activities of the trade unions in the nonstate sector.  This is a new and difficult task about which experience must be  gained while carrying it out. At present, more than 180  primary-level trade unions, 42 labor unions, and 300 labor  associations that have attracted approximately 110,000 laborers  at cooperatives and private and joint enterprises have been  organized and put into operation. These are initial bases that  must be studied to see what the best forms are so that they can  be greatly expanded in the coming period.    Giving attention to building primary-level trade unions and  to learning the experiences at the bases where trade union  activities are strong, many typical examples such as the Ba Song  Factory, the Cam My Rubber State Farm, the Hai Duong Porcelain  Plant, the Deo Nai Coal Mine, and so on have been reported and  copied throughout the country.    However, because of operating for so long within a state  subsidies mechanism, when switching to the new mechanism, the  various-echelon trade unions have exhibited confusion and  passivity. In guiding and implementing things, not all of the  complex changes of the market mechanism can be gauged. There is  a lack of concrete measures, and the trade unions have been slow  to get involved in social activities. In the market mechanism,  now that a labor market has been formed, the issues of  ownership, hired labor, salaries, wages, labor protection, and  improvement of labor conditions are very difficult and pressing  issues. But the trade unions have been slow to study these  issues. Also, the trade unions have not done a good job of  educating the workers or getting them to respond to the action  movements. In the nonstate sector, they have persuaded only 5  percent of the laborers and 10 percent of the production  installations to join a trade union.    In the coming period, the various-echelon trade unions will  face even greater tasks. The trade unions must concentrate on  mobilizing the working class. Regardless of which economic  element they are working at, they must maintain labor discipline  and good solidarity, exploit the creative potential, improve  techniques, increase productivity, improve product quality,  reduce production costs, contribute to expanding the  multifaceted commodity economy and bringing the country out of  poverty and backwardness, and strive to hit the "wealthy people,  strong country, and civilized society" target. Above all, the  trade unions must take steps to strengthen the state sector,  manifest results, and play a guiding role in the economy.  Together with the state, the trade unions must create the  conditions and an environment in which the nonstate economic  elements can grow. They must actively contribute to expanding  agriculture, building the new rural areas, and solidifying the  worker-peasant-intellectual alliance in renovating building and  defending the fatherland.    The trade unions must give attention to protecting the  interests of the workers and laborers and participate in  formulating laws and policies related to laborers. They must  actively participate, together with the state, in creating jobs  and improving work conditions. The primary-level trade unions  must, as the representative of the workers, sign collective  labor agreements with the owners of the enterprises in accord  with the laws and monitor the implementation of those  agreements. They must discover and resolve the conflicts that  arise between owners and laborers.    The trade unions must launch the workers and laborers in a  struggle against corruption and smuggling and actively  contribute to building a strong party and administration.    They must renovate propaganda and training, contribute to  building a strong working class, and take the lead in renovating  the country. They must promptly enter into a dialogue with and  grasp the thoughts and attitudes of the workers and laborers and  grasp the conflicts that have arisen because of the mechanisms  and policies so that they can submit timely proposals to the  party and state to resolve the conflicts. They must safeguard  the interests of the country and laborers and contribute to  maintaining political stability and social order.    They must continue to renovate organization and improve the  abilities and capabilities of the ranks of trade union cadres.  They must adhere to the principle of democratic centralism in  trade union organization and activities. They must vary the  forms used to assemble the workers and laborers in the economic  elements. Emphasis must be given to guiding and renovating  primary-level trade union activities. Attention must be given to  summarizing the practices and conducting theoretical studies on  trade union activities in the new mechanism.    Economic activities must be promoted, and additional  financial sources must be created for trade union activities.  Cooperation with foreign trade unions and international  organizations must be strengthened and expanded.    In the face of the many changes in the domestic and  international situation, the Vietnamese working class has  undergone profound changes. This shows that the Vietnamese  working class is always sensitive to what is new and can adapt  quickly to the new. But this class is still the most progressive  production force. It adheres to the key material bases and  controls the activities of all of society. Because of this, it  still has the mission, and ability, to take the lead in the  development of society.    Thus, building a strong Vietnamese working class is a  decisive matter for the renovation of the country. This is not  an issue just for the trade unions. It is also a task for the  entire political system and the responsibility of each cadre and  party member.</p>

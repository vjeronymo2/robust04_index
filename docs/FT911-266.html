			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Tosca - Covent Garden At regular intervals, for the sake of operatic health and decency, it is proper to recall Joseph Kerman's stern dictum: 'Tosca, that shabby little shocker, is no doubt admired nowadays mostly in the gallery.' When the melodramatic grip fails, what we discover is a showman carefully tormenting clockwork mice. Saturday's revival at the Royal Opera stayed more or less afloat on waves of generous response from the stalls, rather than the gallery. For this was a performance in the annual Midland Bank Proms week - probably the best thing to have happened to Covent Garden since the Second World War - and un-jaded enthusiasm is always on tap. This was what used to be the Zeffirelli production, now staged by John Cox in the handsome old designs of Mongiardino and Escoffier (with sponsorship by Bankers Trust Company). Rather less strikingly lit than before, if memory serves, and certainly less persuasively enacted, but no one person is to blame. What we have is a curdled international brew. No Italians, but ultra-professional American tenor and bass who have to hold their own against an admired German soprano and a distinguished French conductor, neither of them born to do anything at all with Puccini. To the luckless Cavaradossi, Neil Shicoff brings his customary high definition and reckless energy, firing top notes into the house like laser beams. There were places where he and the conductor Michel Plasson were not on the same wave-length (even in 'E lucevan le stelle'). Samuel Ramey's Scarpia, in gleaming black voice, preens and looms - utterly faithful to the words, which come up in the English surtitles with scarifying grossness. Not for the first time, I thought that Ramey was over-painting the sleek menace which his physiognomy and stature already guarantee; even Scarpia needs some down-to-earth, human touches. There is a good, hunted Angelotti from Stephen Gadd, and Eric Garrett repeats his bouncing, twinkling Sacristan. (It is a horrid role; a bit of Verdi's Fra Melitone and some echoes of Wagner's David, in aid of nothing but making a crude contrast with the desperation of the young rebels.) For the unseen Shepherd Boy, Daniel Ison's treble has a nice, natural plangency. That leaves Hildegard Behrens, whose great virtues in the German repertoire are well recognised. As Tosca, her Italian is almost completely unintelligible (except the spoken lines, which she emits in a weird, slow-motion growl); so is her phrasing, which betrays not a trace of feeling for Puccini's elegantly drooping curves. In the slow romantic passages - and in much music which should not be slow at all - Plasson was downright sluggish (the beginning of Act 3 seemed interminable), cruelly exposing the threadbare timbre of the Behrens middle register. It was a blessing that she remained bright and secure at the top; but 'Vissi d'arte', done as a tear-wracked effusion, was a fearsome exercise in non-style. Her dramatic outbursts were generally safer, with a strong suit in sheer physical revulsion against Scarpia's blandishments. Whether with Scarpia or with Cavaradossi, however, she seemed curiously insulated; nobody really played to anybody else. We were being treated to independent solo turns - which do not add up to an effective Tosca. Expert pacing of the score would have been a help, and many an expert hack could have supplied it. Plasson is no hack, and his civilised hand is so sure in the French repertoire it was astonishing to hear this opera limping cautiously along, bland and fuzzy in attack. In the first act only the frank scherzo-music had any spark; the playful and mischievous moments which need to enliven Tosca's scene with her lover came out like squeezed toothpaste. By contrast, the climaxes were often raw and overblown. And for the ironically twisted execution-march Plasson chose a funereal tempo which left it dead.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said  Japan, with its economic strength and technical expertise, could  further help Indochinese countries and Burma move towards  free-market economies.    "The idea of Former Prime Minister (Kiichi) Miyazawa to hold  a forum for the comprehensive development of Indochina last  year, the preparatory meeting last December, and the expected  ministerial meeting in the near future, would facilitate these  countries' reintegration into the mainstream of Southeast Asia's  dynamic economic development," he said.    Thailand and Japan believe that economic prosperity is the  key to enduring peace and stability in Southeast Asia, Prasong  said in his opening speech at the international conference on  Japanese International Responsibility and Contribution to Peace  and Prosperity in the Asia Pacific.    Prasong said there was a concensus that prosperity required  a  certain amount of peace and stability and that the two  conditions reinforced each other.    The two-day conference was organized by Thammasat  University's Institute of East Asian Studies and sponsored by  the Japan Foundation.    The seminar was attended by Thai academics, representatives  of the embassies of Japan, China, and South Korea, and of  international development agencies and Thailand's Department of  Technical and Economic Cooperation.    The director of the university's East Asian Study Center,  Professor Surachai Sirikrai, said this kind of seminar, though  academic-oriented, could help explore ways to shape and  reinforce Japan's role in the region.</p>

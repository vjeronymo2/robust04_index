			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both exemption procedures (power reactor and materials licensee) contained in &sect;171.11 allow the requester to inform the Commission of ``[a]ny *&blank;*&blank;* relevant matter that the licensee believes'' should impact on the exemption decision. This allows the Commission flexibility to consider each situation on its own merits. Were the Commission to attempt to establish specific criteria for each type of materials licensee, itself a daunting task, it might then be prevented from considering factors which did not fall precisely within those enumerated. And if the Commission retained the open-ended provision quoted above, it would have expended considerable time and resources to little purpose, as licensees could make the same claims under new criteria that they can at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners also complained that the NRC had established a high threshold for granting materials exemption requests. In this regard, the Commission explained in the first 100 percent fee recovery rule, in FY 1991, that because it was statutorily required to collect 100 percent, it could not easily exempt licensees from fees. If one licensee or class of licensees is exempted, those fees must then be placed on other licensees, increasing their fee burden. It is for that reason that the Commission only grants exemptions in exceptional circumstances. (See 56 FR 31472, 31485; July 10, 1991.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners' third request, that the Commission establish a sliding scale of minimum fees based on the size of the licensee, which ``reflects the unique constraints on physicians'', also is denied. In its FY 1991 fee rule, the Commission explained in great detail why it devised its fee schedules in the manner it did, basing fees on classes of licensees rather than licensee-by-licensee. (See FY 1991 Final Rule, 56 FR 31472, and Appendix A to the Final Rule; July 10, 1991.) There is no information contained in either the petition or comments on the petition which would lead the Commission to reconsider this approach, and therefore the Commission must deny this aspect of the petition as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Commission intends to re-examine the size standards it uses to define small entities within the context of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Commission will conduct this review within the context of revision of the small business size standards proposed by the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') (58 FR 46573; September 2, 1993). The Commission will not complete this review until the SBA promulgates its final rule on this matter. These activities may result in a revised definition of ``small entity'' more favorable to petitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission denies petitioners' request that licensees be provided more power over the development of NRC regulations, and that a new backfit rule incorporating cost-benefit analysis be instituted to evaluate the agency's regulatory programs. The Commission denied similar requests in its FY 1991 fee rule, explaining that the NRC is not exempt ``from the normal Government review and budgetmaking process.'' The Commission at that time pointed out that ``the Government is not subject to audit by outside parties,'' and that ``[a]udits are performed by the General Accounting Office or the agency's Inspector General, as appropriate.'' (56 FR 31472, 31482; July 10, 1991.) Additionally, the NRC complies with Federal regulations such as the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that require agency analysis of the economic effects of new regulations on licensees. The NRC Staff also prepares detailed cost-benefit analyses to justify any new regulatory requirements; these analyses are carefully reviewed by the Commission. The Commission has seen nothing either in the petition or comments on the petition that would lead it to change its approach in this area. The Commission would like to emphasize, however, that licensees are always welcome and expected to comment on proposed rulemakings, including the accompanying cost-benefit analyses, and that such comments, along with petitions such as the present one, workshops, meetings of the Advisory Committee on the Medical Use of Isotopes, and the day-to-day interaction between licensees and the agency, in the Commission's view provide an adequate and successful method of keeping each group apprised of the other's concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

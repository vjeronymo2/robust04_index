			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: New equity products GUARANTEED equity products which offer stock market growth or your money back - continue to pour onto the market. Birmingham Midshires Building Society is offering an account which rises by 75 per cent of the increase in the FT-SE 100 index over five years (for a basic rate taxpayer) or by a net 15 per cent, whichever is the higher. As with many other guaranteed products, investors benefit only from the capital growth of the Footsie, and not the dividend yield. At 4 per cent a year for five years, the dividend yield can make a significant difference to investment returns. Furthermore, in line with the recent trend, the Footsie figure used for the calculation is based on the average of the last six months. This protects the investor from a last minute fall in the index, but means he gets 4.75 years growth and not five. How good a deal is it? Although Birmingham Midshires, advertises a gross return of 100 per cent of the FT-SE, other companies have offered 100 per cent net. Investors are thus giving up potential gain for a better minimum guarantee - a net 15 per cent gain versus the normal money back offer. There is scope for early access. After 2.5 years, you can get your money back plus the greater of 56.25 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE or 3.75 per cent. Newcastle Building Society's Nova Equity Bond offers a net 120 per cent of the rise in the Footsie over five years, or your money back. But this rise is based on the average of the Footsie over the last year of the bond, so in fact you are getting 4.5 years market growth. Again, you get no credit for the dividend yield on the market. There is also no scope for early encashment (except on death). However, the 120 per cent rate is pretty good and means that the account will come close to the total return on the market, even allowing for dividend yield. For basic rate taxpayers, this may make it as good as an indexed unit trust, with the guarantee thrown in. Higher rate taxpayers, however, would face an extra tax charge and would probably be better off with a low charging indexed unit trust, such as Gartmore's. The minimum investment in Nova Equity Bond is Pounds 2,000.</p>

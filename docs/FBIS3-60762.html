[see  SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in front of Terrorism Report for TV  footage]    Valentin Lubuma, a leading member of the Unified Lumumbist  Party [PALU] and adviser at the Audit Office, was driving a car  when three uniformed men riding in a "Korando" jeep blocked his  path and, according to witnesses, asked him for money and other  objects he had on him. To prevent him from possibly resisting,  the three armed men each shot at the political leader and fled  in his vehicle.    The assassination of this former permanent secretary of Mr.  Antoine Gizenga, president of the Republic of Eastern Congo in  Kisangani in 1964, occurred a few hours after a peaceful  demonstration that was organized in Kinshasa by PALU members.</p>

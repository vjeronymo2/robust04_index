For a common bond which will constitute a majority of the federal credit union's field of membership, the requirements for occupational and associational fields of membership apply. Any other group constituting an occupational or associational common bond to be included within the federal credit union's field of membership must be within what will be the credit union's operational area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed federal credit union's operational area is the area which, as determined by NCUA in its sole discretion, may reasonably be served by the service facilities that will be accessible by the groups to be included in the field of membership when the credit union begins operation. A credit union's service facility is a place where, also as determined by NCUA in its sole discretion: (1) Shares are accepted for members' accounts; (2) loan applications are accepted or loans are disbursed; (3) a member can deal directly with a credit union representative; and (4) the service provided is clearly associated with that particular credit union. An automated teller machine or similar device is not a federal credit union service facility. Similarly, a branch or service center shared by a number of credit unions is not a service facility for purposes of this Chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any members of a group who will have access to one of a proposed federal credit union's service facilities may be included in the field of membership. In addition, the group as a whole will be considered to be within a proposed credit union's operational area when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A majority of the group's members live, work, or gather regularly within the operational area; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The group's headquarters is located within the operational area; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The group's ``paid from'' or ``supervised from'' location is within the operational area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following special additional requirements pertaining to multiple group applications must be satisfied before NCUA will grant such a charter: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Each group to be included in the proposed field of membership of the federal credit union must have its own occupational or associational common bond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Except for employee groups in the same industrial park, shopping center or similar facility, each group must individually request inclusion in the proposed federal credit union's charter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed federal credit union's business plan must show that the credit union will possess the financial resources and management capability to provide quality credit union service to each group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed federal credit union must show that, when it begins operations, each group to be added will be within the operational area of a service facility to which the group will have access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> II.D.2_Sample Multiple Group Field of Membership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An example of a multiple group field of membership is: ``The field of membership of this federal credit union shall be limited to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

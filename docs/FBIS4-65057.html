			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FR: "Flemish Bloc's European Program </F> Largely Anti-European"]    [Excerpts] The Flemish Bloc (VB) prides itself on being the  only Flemish party with a properly developed European program.  But it became clear yesterday when the Bloc's program was  presented that the content is largely anti-European: Party  leader Dillen and his colleagues support cooperation between  peoples, but within limits. Above all, Europe must not meddle in  too many matters, and especially not education or culture,  because that compromises "individuality." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Civilization </H5>   Above all, the VB wants to brush aside anything which is  foreign, and that in the broadest sense of the word. Europe  must not become an "open door zone for the Third World." The VB  also rejects a European Union which would affect the "cultural  identity of different peoples." Gerolf Annemans does not  believe in "utopias" such as, in his opinion, the notion of a  multicultural society. But the VB wants to see a varied Europe  with its "common civilization." Which does not prevent the VB  from believing that it is not utopian to clearly define "own"  cultures and peoples within this larger Europe. The VB also  rejects the idea of European citizenship as "a lifeless and  rootless concept."    The VB naturally opposes the national member states, and  Belgium above all, but is equally unenthusiastic about the  Europe of Regions. "The Committee of the Regions is a dummy,"  says Annemans, "as Flemings we want nothing to do with the  regions. We want a Europe of independent people's states." The  VB made repeated references yesterday to the Czech-Slovak model  (a photo of Vaclav Havel even adorned the Bloc's brochure). The  split has been achieved "peacefully" there, the VB says. With  this, Annemans sought to dispel suspicions that the VB has in  mind regions and peoples such as we find in the former  Yugoslavia. "Europe has no precise definition of what the  regions are supposed to represent. As far as the peoples are  concerned, we believe that they must each sort out their own  problems and keep their own house in order."    How this "spring cleaning" by the people fits in with  cooperation within "the real Europe," as Karel Dillen describes  it, is not clear. And whether or not the VB had a precise  definition of its people's states was also unclear, except that  it is "of course not going to come about overnight." The VB  wants to see a confederal rather than a federal Europe.</p>

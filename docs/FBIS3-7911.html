			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A rapid development of political events can  presently be seen both at home and abroad, in our close  vicinity, said Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of Social Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR], during a news conference held today.    We salute the first free multiparty elections held [on 27  February] in the Republic of Moldova, which, according to  observers, were organized under optimal circumstances, despite  certain minor incidents. We hope that the new framework will  allow for the assertion, without any obstructions, of the  democratic principles, and that also includes telling the truth  about the history of the [Moldova] territory and native  population.    During the news conference Solcanu also referred to the  talks  held by PDSR with PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party] and  PD-FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]. During the  talks held with PUNR the two parties found that in the current  political context the protocol signed [on 1 February] remains  valid, although it cannot be implemented literally, but merely  in its spirit. Talking about the consultations with PD-FSN,  Solcanu assessed that a step forward has been made, as they  reviewed the goals pursued by the two political parties in the  current dialogue. That is important because PDSR is involved in  talks with other parties as well, including parties belonging to  the Democratic Convention of Romania and those of the current  parliamentary coalition. Solcanu stressed that they discussed  aspects of a possible moratorium between PDSR and PD-FSN, which  could contribute to the continuation of the dialogue between the  two parties, ease the current strain in the political life, and  offer elements needed for a possible future cooperation in  parliament.    All political parties have to act with responsibility and  make efforts to find the convergent points to surmount the  current situation, concluded Solcanu.</p>

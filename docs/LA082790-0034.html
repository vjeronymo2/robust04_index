			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEBOERS GOES OUT ON TOP IN GRAND PRIX;  </P> <P> MOTOCROSS: RETIRING WORLD CHAMPION WINS FIRST EVENT AT SAN BERNARDINO'S GLEN  HELEN PARK.  </P> <P> World motocross champion Roger DeCoster tried for years to win a United States  motocross Grand Prix at Carlsbad when he was a rider, but he could never pull  it off. Sunday, in his first USGP as a promoter, he came out a winner.  </P> <P> The Motul U.S. 500cc Grand Prix at Glen Helen Park had little at stake except  the prestige of the sport, but its results pleased just about everyone.  </P> <P> Eric Geboers, the world champion from Belgium, went home the overall winner to  close out a Grand Prix career that saw him win five world championships overall  and 11 of 24 individual motos this season. He had announced his retirement when  the clinched the 1990 crown.  </P> <P> Rick Johnson, from El Cajon, won the second 40-minute moto to prove to all that  he has recovered from a severe wrist injury that had curtailed his career since  March 1989.  </P> <P> DeCoster was all smiles as he surveyed the crowd that swarmed over the brown  hills of Glen Helen. It was reminiscent of the golden days of motocross at  Carlsbad Raceway a decade ago.  </P> <P> "I am very happy," said DeCoster, who was the man most instrumental in  popularizing the sport in the United States in the early 1970s when he was the  No. 1 rider in the world. "I was pleased to see all the people, but I was more  pleased that they saw some great racing."  </P> <P> DeCoster estimated the crowd at 15,000, but many observers felt it was a  cautiously low figure.  </P> <P> "It was the best USGP I have ever seen," Geboers said. "I say, 'Well done,  Roger.' "  </P> <P> Geboers' first moto victory, a 40-minute fender-to-fender duel between his  Honda and Johnny O'Mara's Kawasaki was one of the most competitive in USGP  history. O'Mara got off the line first, closely followed by Geboers, but it  only took three loops of the 1.3-mile course before Geboers slipped past O'Mara  on a tight corner at the bottom of the Yamaha Dropoff, a 65-foot jump on the  east end of the course.  </P> <P> From then to the finish of the 21-lap race, O'Mara would close to a bike length  of Geboers over the lower half of the course, which was laid out like stadium  Supercross. But once the riders left the start-finish line and started up the  sweeping high-speed portion that was more European-like in its style, Geboers  would pull slightly ahead.  </P> <P> The pace never slackened as Geboers and O'Mara seemed to go faster and faster  with each lap. It ended with O'Mara tucked in behind Geboers' tailpipe.  </P> <P> "I gave it the best I had," Geboers said. "I was riding over my limit. I was so  exhausted that I became sick between the motos. It was the hardest moto I rode  all year."  </P> <P> Far back, Johnson finished third, Jeff Matiasevich fourth and England's Kurt  Nicoll fifth.  </P> <P> If anyone left unhappy, it had to be the Kawasaki contingent. After O'Mara lost  a heartbreaker in the first heat, Matiasevich, from La Habra Heights, saw his  moment of glory disappear in the second.  </P> <P> Matiasevich, riding in his first 500cc race, took the lead from Australia's  Jeff Leisk before the first lap was completed and built up a substantial margin  over the first half of the 40-minute moto.  </P> <P> Geboers, knowing he had to finish at least third to win overall if Matiasevich  held on, was fourth, just ahead of Johnson. Nicoll and Leisk were second and  third. When Nicoll fell and was bumped by Geboers, Johnson used the confusion  to pass all three riders and move into second behind Matiasevich.  </P> <P> It took Johnson, riding with a brace on his tender wrist, four laps to catch  Matiasevich, and once he tasted the lead there was no challenging Johnson. The  only question then was if Matiasevich could hold off Geboers.  </P> <P> Geboers, fighting off nausea and exhaustion, would not be denied. With three  minutes remaining, he caught Matiasevich where the course dipped into a canyon  gully.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Baltics wonder what will be price of independence THE SOVIET UNION'S three Baltic republics are determined to restore their pre-1940 independence even if this means facing considerable economic hardship. The likely high cost of secession is one of the few clear things to have emerged from last week's joint declaration by President Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader. On the face of it, the declaration was at least a step towards allowing the six rebel republics their independence, but Moscow seems ready to exact a high price. The declaration gave them the right not to sign a union treaty binding them to Moscow; they could settle the matter 'independently', but most favoured nation status would be granted to those which chose to sign. This is taken to mean that non-signatories will have to pay hard currency for energy and other supplies at world prices, thus challenging their ability to survive outside the Soviet economic system. The Baltics - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - are prepared to press their claim for secession. Armenia and Moldavia might yet sign the treaty, and nobody seems to know what Georgia, the sixth of the rebels, will decide, although it has chosen a confrontational approach to press its claim for independence from Moscow. The precise meaning of the declaration is still unclear. Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, noted with typical dry humour: 'You can find whatever you want in this document . . . only concrete actions will tell us what it means.' Hours after the document was published last Tuesday, Soviet troops seized a bank building in a suburb of Vilnius, despite Kremlin promises to solve its disputes with Lithuania by political means. Mr Landsbergis and his colleagues in neighbouring Latvia and Estonia say the switch to world prices will mean considerable economic hardship, but that this could be manageable if Baltic republics' western borders are open to trade with the outside world. 'Otherwise, this will amount to an economic blockade,' points out Mr Yuri Kahn, Estonia's representative in Moscow. Illustrating what the switch could mean, Lithuania's trade minister, Mr Vitas Navitskas, says that oil would cost Rbs3,500 (Pounds 1,147) a tonne, up from Rbs70 a tonne. The declaration's ambiguity - crucial to achieving a blatantly political compromise between Mr Gorbachev and the nine republican leaders who signed it - means that what happens next will depend on how their agreement is implemented. This, in turn, will be determined by political developments and economic realities. In economic terms, the Kremlin and parties to the union treaty, due to be finalised this summer, will have to think long and hard about switching to pure market relations with those republics which refuse to sign the treaty. The centrally planned Soviet economy is still so integrated that both sides would suffer from an abrupt economic divorce - as shown by the collapse of Soviet trade with eastern Europe, as a result of a similar switch to hard currency trading. Plants in the 15 republics depend on each other for supplies in a situation where one enterprise is often the sole producer of a particular industrial input. The manufactured goods they produce are not competitive in international markets, which means that republics would be best served by continuing to barter with each other. Economic sense dictates that all republics opt for some kind of economic union, even if only nine of them are joined in a political federation. Indeed, this may be what Mr Yeltsin and other progressive republican leaders, such as Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakhstan president, had in mind when they signed the declaration - even though it may not yet be the right time to say so. Finnish State Railways (VR) is refusing to handle most Soviet rail transit traffic because of problems over payments, a senior official told Reuter in Helsinki. The independent Soviet concern Soyzvneshtrans, which carries some 60 per cent of transit traffic, owes VR 'tens of millions' of markka, said Mr Henri Kuitunen, cargo division director. The ban on handling its wagons began early yesterday. Mr Kuitunen could not say how long it would last. Cargo of other companies, including Soviet organisations, is being handled normally. The cargo, mostly liquids but also dry bulk, travels mainly to the Finnish ports of Kotka and Hamina.</p>

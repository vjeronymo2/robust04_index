			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wolv &amp; Dudley ahead 4% at Pounds 36m Helped by an extra Pounds 1m contribution from a 53-week reporting period, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent, from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 36.5m. Mr David Thompson, managing director, said that strong consumer resistance to beer prices had been a feature of the company's markets. 'There is evidence of improved consumer confidence but this has yet to turn into a sustained increase in spending. We remain cautious for the year ahead.' Trading profit for the 53 weeks to October 3 increased from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 40.7m on turnover up 6.6 per cent to Pounds 223.5m. Margins declined slightly from 18.7 per cent to 18.2 per cent, reflecting continuing intense competition in the free trade. Beer volumes fell 2.5 per cent against market declines of about 4 per cent in the Midlands and north-west England. Banks's increased market share in the take-home trade while Camerons performed ahead of expectations, expanding distribution and volume of its brands in north-east England. The company has launched its own premium lager, Zamek, brewed in the Czech Republic. Managed pubs raised food sales 72 per cent. Beer volumes fell but gaming machine income rose 3.5 per cent in the second half after a 10 per cent first half decline. Milestone restaurants lifted sales of meals by 11.5 per cent and maintained expenditure per head; Milestone taverns achieved a similar increase in sales with a 14 per cent increase in customer spending. Food, however, still accounts for only 8 per cent of total turnover. Tenanted pubs traded reasonably, said Mr Thompson. But he added: 'Low economic activity in the manual trades - particularly the building industry  -affects many of our pubs on housing estates and in older residential areas.' Property profits of Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 628,000) included provisions against 18 pubs being sold for alternative use. Earnings rose to 38.6p. A final dividend of 7.9p makes a total of 12.6p (11p).</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls to new five-year low Tokyo THE Nikkei average fell to a new five-year low yesterday as selling by corporations and financial institutions continued to depress share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average shed 153.32 to 19,764.31, while the Topix index of all first section stocks registered a decline of 26.09 to 1,407.78, falling for the 13th consecutive day, its longest losing streak since 1953. After opening at the day's high of 19,878.14, the Nikkei fell to the session's low of 19,490.53 on broad-based selling by institutional and individual investors, and on arbitrage unwinding. Volume expanded to 400m shares from 350m, as life insurance companies were seen cross-trading to realise profits ahead of the March book-closing. Declining issues overwhelmed those advancing by 840 to 165, while 124 stocks were unchanged. A total of 454 shares, or 37 per cent of all the shares listed on the first section, fell to new lows since the start of last year. An announcement that the government had scheduled talks on measures to stimulate the economy failed to lift the market's negative sentiment. Market participants are now looking for shares to bottom out. More optimistic analysts believe the next support for the Nikkei lies around 19,600, its one-year moving average. Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg Securities said that while some market participants did not see any support until the 18,000 level, investors were looking to buy shares around 19,000. Foreign pension funds were seen purchasing low-priced blue chips related to the automobile industry. The slight recovery in automobile demand in the US encouraged investors. Honda Motor moved up Y30 to Y1,490 and Nissan Motor firmed Y1 to Y570. In contrast, large-capital steels, which investors see as 'benchmark stocks', lost more ground. Nippon Steel slipped Y6 to Y296, falling below Y300 for the first time since July 1986. NKK lost Y15 to Y266 and Kawasaki Steel retreated Y11 to Y292. Issues previously active on the Aids and environment themes weakened on meeting profit-taking. Okamoto, the leading condom maker, fell Y70 to Y1,130 and Japan Storage Battery Y40 to Y1,070. Financial shares were lower as companies continued to liquidate holdings. Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y210 to Y2,310 and Mitsubishi Bank fell Y110 to Y2,200. Brokerage issues declined on earnings concern. After the market closed, leading houses announced downward earnings revisions for the current year. Nomura Securities receded Y10 to Y1,120 and Yamaichi Securities dipped Y5 to Y730. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 423.50 lower at 20,914.37 following a record volume of 614.7m shares. Roundup THE CONTINUED weakness of Tokyo weighed on bourses on the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG recovered after falling more than 100 points to an intraday low of 4,938 as investors switched out of HSBC following Tuesday's announcement that it was to buy Midland Bank, of the UK. HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 3.00 or 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 42.25, while the Hang Seng index finished a net 9.32 down at 5,036.07 in turnover of HKDollars 3.4bn, against HKDollars 2.2bn. Bargain hunting drove the market up after the early falls and other blue chips gained. Hang Seng Bank put on 75 cents or 1.7 per cent to HKDollars 44.00 and Bank of East Asia moved forward 90 cents to HKDollars 22.00. Property group Cheung Kong, forecast to report a strong increase in 1991 profits next week, advanced 50 cents or 2.2 per cent to HKDollars 23.10. TAIWAN fell as failure by the ruling National Party to resolve an internal dispute over democratic reform continued to depress sentiment. The weighted index lost 38.37 to 4,851.95 in turnover of TDollars 24.4bn, after TDollars 29.3bn. MANILA recovered lost ground as Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) and Philippine National Bank (PNB) were in better form after two consecutive days of falls. The composite index rallied 18.26 to 1,101.27 in turnover of 118m pesos. PNB rose 11 pesos to 260 pesos and PLDT gained 20 pesos to 870 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR ended the day above the 600 level, the first time since March 2. The composite index put on 5.91 to 600.40 in volume of 34m shares, against 27.1m. Tanjong, the gaming group, gained 90 cents to MDollars 10.80 amid rumours that it may extend its local operations. Telekom Malaysia rose 30 cents to MDollars 11.60 on 1.7m shares. SEOUL dipped slightly in the afternoon session, with buying from the Market Stabilisation Fund preventing a steeper decline. The composite stock index ended 0.83 off at 614.36 in turnover of Won300.34bn. BANGKOK was lifted by demand for property and finance stocks and the SET index closed 12.73 up at 808.49 in turnover of Bt6.75bn.

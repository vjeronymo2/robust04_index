			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Death threats are made as Cambodia goes to the polls ON FOOT, by bicycle, motorcycle or boat, Cambodians go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new government, in what will be the culmination of a troubled Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.24bn) United Nations operation to bring peace and democracy to a country that has known neither for more than two decades. After years of dictatorship and communism, the 4.8m voters registered by the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) are unfamiliar with the way democracy works and have only recently learnt from UN officials about the secret ballot. Khmer Rouge guerrillas have reneged on the 1991 peace agreement which brought Untac to Cambodia and are still waging war against the government in Phnom Penh. They have threatened to kill Cambodians who cast their votes, while government soldiers have threatened to kill those who fail to vote for the government. Some voters will have to travel 20km to reach a polling station; others in Khmer Rouge areas will not be able to vote at all. When they reach the polling stations - reduced from 2,200 to 1,500 or less because of the danger of Khmer Rouge attack - Cambodians will have their index fingers dipped in invisible fluorescent ink. It can be detected under ultra-violet light so nobody votes twice. Voting continues until next Friday. If all goes well, Cambodians will elect a 120-member constituent assembly. It will draft a new constitution within three months and become a legislative assembly, which will form the new government. Once this stage is reached Untac can supposedly leave the country. The favourites in the election are the Cambodian People's party, which is the communist party of the existing Phnom Penh administration, and Funcinpec, the royalist party. Veteran journalists of the Indochina wars have descended on gathered in Phnom Penh to watch the event, recall old times and smoke marijuana, which is available in local vegetable markets as a flavouring for soup.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Joe Jost's, 2803 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday  through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. (213) 439-5446.  </P> <P> In the early 1920s it was a barbershop, serving root beer and sandwiches to  waiting customers. When Prohibition ended, the health department said either  serve food and beer or cut hair. The beer still comes in frosted 20-ounce  schooners, the eggs are pickled on the premises, there's pool and snooker in  the back room, and freshly roasted peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar.

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Drug row flares as calls for tighter guidelines grow Japan's ministry of health and welfare is facing mounting public criticism for considering approval of an anti-cancer drug which has led to the deaths of 20 among 477 patients during clinical tests. The disclosure follows a case where 14 people died after taking a shingles drug since it was launched last September. It may heighten calls for tighter approval guidelines by the Japanese government, which is trying to increase the international competitiveness of the country's drug industry by encouraging companies to become more innovative. Irinotecan hydrochloride, jointly developed by Yakult Honsha and Daiichi Pharmaceutical, is believed to be effective in curing lung, uterine and ovarian cancer. However, in clinical tests, 27 people died within a month of taking the drug, of which 20 deaths were caused by the drug's side-effects. A majority of the patients who underwent test treatment showed side-effects; some 80 per cent showed a decrease in the number of white blood corpuscles, and more than half suffered from diarrhoea or nausea. Treatment using anti-cancer drugs is known to cause severe side-effects, and Daiichi officials deny suggestions that the number of deaths and patients suffering from side-effects are higher relative to other cancer drugs. The drug was approved last week by the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council and the ministry is due to decide next month whether it can be put on the market. In the case of deaths following sorivudine, the shingles drug, the health ministry blamed doctors for not reading warnings against the combined use of the drug with an anti-cancer treatment, while doctors have criticised the ministry and Nippon Shoji, the drug company, for not placing stricter warnings on the drug.</p>

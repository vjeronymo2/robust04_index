Vietnam veterans hailed the return of the  remains to the United States in July as the result of the first joint  U.S.-Laotian search for Americans missing in action. Capt. Keith A. Brandt of  Bellingham, Wash., and Lt. Alan B. Boffman of Norfolk, Va., crashed March 18,  1971, while attempting to save 88 South Vietnamese infantrymen stranded in a  thrust into Laos.  </P></p>

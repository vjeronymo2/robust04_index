			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Holst's victorious Mideast role boosts Labour MR Johan Joergen Holst, Norway's foreign minister and chief mediator in secret Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, has boosted the Labour party's standing ahead of already certain victory in today's general election. Heralded as a national hero for his contribution to the Middle East peace agreement, Mr Holst yesterday campaigned before an enthusiastic crowd under blue skies in Hoenefoss, a small town north-west of Oslo. He was accompanied by his four-year-old son Edvard, who has also become a mini-hero in the eyes of Norwegians who have listened as the father and son duo broadcast across international airwaves almost continually in recent days as the story of Oslo's role in the Middle East peace process unfolded. Between signing autographs, Mr Holst called on the electorate to vote Labour so the 'steady course' of his party's policies could be continued. 'This is not the time for Norway to be subjected to the experimental policies of other parties,' he warned. According to a poll published yesterday, support for Labour is holding steady at 34.8 per cent, while the main opposition Conservative party weakened to 18.1 per cent from 22.2 in the 1989 general election. Analysts say the importance of the Conservative party's strong defence platform has dimmed in the eyes of an electorate no longer preoccupied with defence and security issues. The anti-EC agrarian Centre party, set to become the other victor in today's election, polled 16.1 per cent against a 6.5 per cent vote in 1989, indicating support from an electorate ever-resistant to EC membership. One of the most striking features of yesterday's poll is the plunge in support to 6.6 per cent for the populist right-wing Progress party, from 13 per cent in 1989. However, on Saturday in Oslo's main streets, Mr Carl Hagen, the leader of Progress, drew a large crowd from the public who had turned out to hear the last-minute pleas for support from the numerous parties. Standing on a wobbly folding table, an ever-confident Mr Hagen warned the crowd that endorsing Labour's 'steady course' meant continued health queues, record unemployment, and persistent rises in the budget deficit which would have to be paid for by their children.</p>

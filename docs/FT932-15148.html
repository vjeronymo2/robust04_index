			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / European Bank of Reconstruction and Development loans to be investigated TWO cross-party Commons committees are likely to investigate the spending and loans of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and whether the UK government exercised sufficient care in preventing its Pounds 40m grant to the bank being misspent. Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the public accounts committee, described the bank's expenditure as 'quite astonishing'. He is planning to ask the comptroller and auditor-general, Sir John Bourn, whether the spending of the UK's Pounds 40m grant - given to the bank as an incentive to locate in London - was suitable for investigation. He said examination of the Common Agricultural Policy provided a precedent for examining whether the government had taken appropriate steps to ensure that a contribution to a European institution had been spent wisely. Meanwhile, Mr Giles Radice, a Labour member of the Treasury and Civil Service committee, said the committee had agreed yesterday that it would 'look at how effectively the bank is lending money in Eastern Europe'. To date the bank has disbursed just Pounds 101m.</p>

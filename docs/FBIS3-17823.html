Russian Blue  Helmets Off to the Balkans"]    [Text] A send-off ceremony for a peacekeeping contingent  of the Russian Armed Forces leaving for Yugoslavia was held at a  military airfield in Ryazan. One-hundred strong, young  volunteer servicemen comprising a staff company are to reinforce  the 629th infantry battalion. Among them are men of 10  nationalities and religious faiths.    The volunteer airborne troops servicemen, according to the  edict of the president and government of Russia, will be  carrying out a peacekeeping mission in a world hotspot.    As Major General Nikolay Staskov, deputy commander of the MP  [expansion unknown] of the airborne troops noted, the staff  company includes a platoon of Muslim servicemen. This is being  done at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry in order to  increase trust in our mission. In April, 200 more Russian  peacekeepers will be sent to the East sector. Thus, the  strength of our peacekeeping forces will be brought to 1,000 men.    As the airborne troops commanders have stated, Russian  peacekeeping servicemen are paid $800 to $1,000 as before. The  government of Russia will soon make a decision on raising the  allowance. First of all it envisions the payment of a second  allowance in rubles in Russia and a number of other benefits,  especially in social protection. For example, one year of  service in Yugoslavia or in hotspots around the CIS will go on  record as three years.</p>

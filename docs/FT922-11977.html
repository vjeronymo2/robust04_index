			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Declining prices hit Union Carbide UNION Carbide, the US chemicals company, yesterday reported an 8 per cent fall in first-quarter profits after tax to Dollars 72m. Revenues totalled Dollars 1.187bn, against a restated Dollars 1.323bn in the first three months of 1991. The company blamed the fall on declining prices. It added that the first-quarter slip was smaller than anticipated, given the 14 per cent drop in chemicals and selling prices year-on-year. The company's chairman, Mr Robert Kennedy, noted that weak selling prices and further downward pressures on margins were expected to affect the second quarter. The first-quarter figures include profits of Dollars 33m from Union Carbide Industrial Gases, up 22 per cent on the previous year. This division, which was reported as a discontinued business, is due to be spun off to Union Carbide shareholders by the end of the second quarter. The profits figure came from sales of Dollars 653m. Union Carbide shares rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 3/8 yesterday. Warner-Lambert and Schering-Plough, two large US drugs companies, reported strong earnings gains in the first three months of 1992. Warner posted a 17 per cent improvement in after-tax profits, at Dollars 164m. Total sales increased by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn. Schering-Plough reported first-quarter profits after tax of Dollars 193.3m. This compared with Dollars 173.2m for the same period a year earlier. Sales were up from Dollars 949.3m to Dollars 1.02bn.</p>

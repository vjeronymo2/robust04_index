			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1's new comedy series All Night Long, set in a bakery, depends for its laughs very largely upon character, so when you describe the plot it all sounds rather slight and banal. In today's episode a local villain turns up and demands a birthday cake for his mother, but Romanian cake expert Vanda refuses to make a Black Forest gateau for political reasons .. (8.30). In today's episode of Frank Stubbs the wide boy promoter who combines the social graces of Arthur Daley with the subtlety of Max Clifford, finds himself landed with a dull Tory MP as a client, a man whose most notable moment came when he was a student, and involved women's underwear (9.00 ITV). In Panorama John Penycate investigates the changing role of police informers. The claim is that instead of just passing on information about crimes already committed or planned, informers are now being used by the police to set up crimes which are then 'solved', thus improving the police success rate (9.30 BBC1). Best of the day will be Episode 2 of The Singing Detective, repeated in tribute to the late Dennis Potter (10.10 BBC1).</p>

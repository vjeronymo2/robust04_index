			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / US Taipei trip may irk China Mr Federico Pena, US secretary of transportation, will visit Taipei early next week to address a bilateral forum and meet top Taiwan officials in a move which risks incurring the wrath of Beijing. Mr Pena's trip will be the highest-level visit to the island by a US official since a 1992 trip by Ms Carla Hills, who was then the US trade representative. He was invited to attend an annual meeting of the US-Taiwan Economic Council, a private, non-profit organisation of US and Taiwan business interests. Former US president George Bush will also attend. The nominally private American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as the de facto US Embassy, said the visit reflected the growing importance of Washington's commercial relationship with Taiwan, the US's sixth largest trading partner. There are also expectations that the newly elected Republican Congress in the US will be more sympathetic to Taiwan, which on Saturday will hold the most important elections since democratisation began in the mid-1980s. Mr Pena is likely to promote bids by US companies for big infrastructure projects under Taiwan's national development plan. These include a nuclear power plant, a high-speed railway, freeways and urban mass transit systems. His visit closely follows a stern warning from China to President Bill Clinton against treating Taiwan as a separate government. Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president, delivered the warning during the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum earlier this month in Bogor, Indonesia. The US severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to suppress the Kuomintang-led government's efforts to scramble on to the world stage. Just 29 mostly small states maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei and visits by cabinet officials from industrialised countries are rare. High-level bilateral exchanges were formally banned in deference to Beijing until the Clinton administration subtly upgraded relations in September, the first changes in US policy toward the island in 15 years.</p>

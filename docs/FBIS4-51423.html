			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- A North American trade  mission is visiting Taiwan to seek potential investors in the  North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) area.    The mission, composed of trade officials from San Diego,  California and business leaders from Tijuana, Mexico, is led by  San Diego Mayor Susan Golding.    During a seminar Friday [27 May] morning, mission members  said San Diego and Tijuana offer all the privileges any investor  could hope for including convenient transportation, tax  exemptions, and the huge United States, Canadian and Mexican  markets.    NAFTA, with the potential to create US$6 trillion in  business  and become the biggest trade block in the world, has already  attracted some 600 companies to the free trade zones, said  Daniel O. Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic Development  Council.    Among the 600 manufacturers, some 100 are Asian companies,  including Sony and Samsung, Pegg said.    Mayor Golding said she is confident that San Diego will turn  itself into a "Hong Kong in North America" in the 21st century  with its excellent investment climate and a large area of land.</p>

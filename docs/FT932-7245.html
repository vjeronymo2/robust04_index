			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: Moscow comes to Brighton - Summer festival time has arrived in earnest Moscow Chamber Opera's British debut this weekend has been a highlight of the Brighton Festival, its first two programmes confirming the company's reputation as a lively and versatile music-theatre group. Formed 21 years ago by the veteran producer Boris Pokrovsky, Moscow Chamber Opera has spent much of its working life in a suburban basement theatre, and its repertory, which includes works frowned on by the former authorities, has enhanced its 'underground' status. It was neatly appropriate that the visit should have opened with a work full of old Russian religious symbolism, The Rostov Mysteries. A Nativity play framed by an allegorical episode and epilogue presenting the conflicting forces of Good and Evil, it was first performed in a Rostov seminary in 1702, and revived about 10 years ago. Friday's performance in St Martin's Church was given on a rough wooden platform stretching down the nave, which brought the vivid spectacle close to the audience. Moscow Chamber Opera's singing-actors were wonderfully communicative in their varied roles, maintaining a well-blended ensemble without conductor or accompaniment. Among the many characterful performances Yvegeny Boluchevsky's Astrologer, Marina Zhukova's Rachel and Alexey Mokhalov's chilling, blood-red Death were outstanding. More conventional, though hardly familiar, territory was reached in Sunday's triple bill at the Roedean Theatre, which began with Shostakovich's torso-version of The Gamblers. This Gogol setting occupied the composer during 1942, but its anti-heroic story of a card-sharper was perhaps too flippant for wartime Russia, and he abandoned it; what remains of it lay unstaged until taken up by Pokrovsky in 1989. The company revealed its thoroughly Russian approach to drama. This was satire by overstatement, with emphasis less on singing or highly-produced staging than on expressive interaction between performers. Notable among these were Boris Tarkov in the central role of the gambler Ikharyov, passionate in his aria addressed to a pack of marked cards; Nikolay Kurpe, who as Krugel disclosed a line in silly walks and twitches; and as the servant Gavryushka Valery Belykh, whose gravelly bass was heard in a balaika-accompanied folk song. The score is brittle; Anatoly Levin, in the pit for the evening, conducted it capably. Next came the first British performance of Shostakovich's Antiformalistic Gallery, a private, anti-Soviet joke conceived at the time of the notorious 1948 Zhdanov decree on music - its existence was revealed by the composer's widow only in 1989. In a gibe at the Composers' Union, which declared that music should be optimistic and entertaining, a motley crowd of 'musical functionaries' are addressed in banal tones by caricatured luminaries. Stalin, resplendent in a tatty vest and angels' wings, was hilariously mocked by Vladimir Khrulev, and the poker-faced 'KGB' danced in time to a figure (Eduard Akimov) representing Khrennikov, the much-decorated, much-hated Soviet Kapellmeister. Westerners can only scratch the surface of the piece, but its zestful performance made merely watching it seem an act of sneaky subversion. Mikhail Kislyarov's production of Stravinsky's Renard was anti-climactic, illuminating little a piece most commonly heard in concert performance. Biting satire appears to be Moscow Chamber Opera's strength: there is a chance to sample more of it in the company's acclaimed staging of Shostakovich's The Nose this week.

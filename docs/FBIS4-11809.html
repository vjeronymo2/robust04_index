			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu Dhabi Denies Qaddumi Made </F> Visit"]    [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi have  denied that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi paid an  official visit to Abu Dhabi and held talks with officials there  on the situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian issue.  The sources said they had no knowledge of such a visit.    Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Qaddumi  stopped  over on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning at Dubai international  airport en route from Cairo to the Far East to visit a number of  states there.    They added that Qaddumi, who stopped over at Dubai airport  for about an hour, made some telephone calls to some Palestinian  embassy officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The sources expect  Qaddumi to stop over at Dubai airport when he returns from east  Asia. The sources stressed they had no knowledge of the  possibility of his making an official visit to the United Arab  Emirates [UAE] soon.    Qaddumi's stopover at Dubai airport does not carry any  political indications, as President Yasir 'Arafat too stopped  over at Abu Dhabi international airport last year while en route  from Jakarta and Turkey.    Observers point out that official contacts between Abu Dhabi  and the PLO were limited to the contacts with PLO Executive  Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), who visited it on  two occasions, the more recent of which was after the signing of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement in Washington on 13 September.  During this visit he met with senior UAE officials, first and  foremost Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the head of state.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / ICI helped by cutbacks and sterling's fall IMPERIAL Chemical Industries increased pre-tax profits by 10 per cent to Pounds 233m in the first quarter of the year, the last time the chemicals and bioscience group will produce results on its pre-demerger basis. The group's shares rose 31p to 1278p despite the market's fall. Except for the fall in sterling and cost cutting measures ICI has undertaken, group profits would have fallen. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said recovery from recession remained patchy. Mr Colin Short, finance director, said sterling's fall benefited pre-tax profits by about Pounds 50m while savings from the cost-cutting programme instituted in 1991 were running at around Pounds 100m a quarter. At the trading profit level, the group achieved a 10.3 per cent advance to Pounds 279m, excluding exceptional items. But Zeneca, the bio-science business to be floated in June - if ICI shareholders approve the demerger at next month's special meeting - raised trading profits 13.3 per cent to Pounds 204m, while the ICI side increased profits 2.7 per cent to Pounds 75m. Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 3.33bn. Zeneca's sales were up 13 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn, but exchange rates alone accounted for a 14 per cent rise, price increases added 1 per cent but disposals took off 2 per cent. The ICI side increased sales by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn. Zeneca's pharmaceutical division increased trading profits from Pounds 121m to Pounds 154m, helped by a 57 per cent sales rise from four leading drugs, but partly offset by a 10 per cent drop in sales worldwide, and a 21 per cent fall in volume, of Tenormin, Zeneca's biggest selling drug, whose patent recently expired in the US. Agrochemical profits fell from Pounds 51m to Pounds 37m as uncertainty over the European agricultural policy continued. But specialties profits rose from Pounds 14m to Pounds 20m. Within the ICI business paints profits fell from Pounds 22m to Pounds 18m, but there were strong advances from industrial chemicals and regional businesses, notably Australia. Materials, which includes fibres, recovered from a loss of Pounds 49m in the second half of 1992, to a profit of Pounds 1m, although down from Pounds 12m in the first quarter of 1992. The group interest charge rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 61m. A rise in the tax rate left earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, up 5.6 per cent to 20.9p.

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / US carmakers win patent: Breakthrough for pooled research effort GENERAL Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the three US carmakers, have been awarded their first joint patent in a breakthrough for the industry's pooled research and development effort launched in 1988. The three companies have embarked on several joint R&amp;D programmes, which only a few years ago would have been illegal under antitrust laws, in an attempt to gain a competitive edge over Japanese rivals. The patent has been awarded for a new process for producing vehicle components from liquid-moulded composites, which could replace the use of steel in the interior body structure of some vehicles. Mr Don Walkowicz, executive director of the US Council for Automotive Research (Uscar), said the patent was a milestone for the industry's R&amp;D effort. 'It clearly demonstrates that domestic auto manufacturers can work together effectively to develop basic technology that will lead to better, more efficient products and enhance the competitiveness of the US industry.' Uscar was formed last year to co-ordinate the carmakers' co-operative R&amp;D programmes. The council now has 10 separate R&amp;D consortia covering areas such as vehicle composites, advanced battery research, occupant safety, low emissions technologies, vehicle recycling, and computer-aided design and manufacturing. The patent awarded yesterday was granted to Uscar's automotive composites consortium. Mr John Fillion, chairman of the consortium and manager of organic material engineering at Chrysler, said the patented process would help reduce the overall weight of composite components and could improve fuel economy.</p>

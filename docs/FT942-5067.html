			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Beckett seems likely to stand: Leadership contest The Labour party's leadership election is likely to be a three-horse race between Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's leader. Mrs Beckett is not certain to stand yet, in spite of strong pressure to put her name forward from feminist and traditionalist Labour MPs. But friends say she is increasingly likely to run for the leadership and the deputy leadership. Mrs Beckett, who is said by many MPs to have performed creditably as party leader since John Smith died last month, has told friends that she wants to do the job permanently. She believes that her position may help her to overhaul Mr Tony Blair, the runaway favourite, over the six-week campaign that will start on Friday. Her supporters think her prospects of winning would be boosted significantly by endorsement from outside her base on the left. The key target is Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, which sponsors Mrs Beckett. Supporters are also seeking endorsement from Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, which has invited the potential candidates to address an informal gathering of its annual conference on Monday. Mrs Beckett's emergence as a serious candidate for the leadership complicates the options for Mr Prescott, whose support is also mainly on the left of the party. Mr Prescott is thought unlikely to stand for both the leadership and deputy leadership because of the fear that his leadership bid would be regarded as less than serious. Most Labour MPs think Mrs Beckett's role as the continuity candidate makes her certain to be re-elected deputy leader - even if she contests the leadership as well. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is still gauging his support, but is thought unlikely to stand. Observer, Page 19</p>

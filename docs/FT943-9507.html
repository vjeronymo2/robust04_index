			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Fall in Russian output forecast A 35-38 per cent decline this year in Russia's industrial production was predicted in a central bank report this week. However, because industry accounts for a decreasing portion of the economy, gross national product was expected to fall by only 10 per cent. The report, the bank's annual public declaration of its goals, sets a target of reducing inflation to 8 per cent a month by the end of the year. Earlier this year the Russian central bank, whose chairman was once an enthusiastic provider of soft credits to the country's industry and agriculture, has since tightened its monetary policy considerably. This has had moderate success in reining in runaway inflation, but the economy now faces a new inflationary threat. Unable to easily obtain credits from the government, Russian enterprises have extended loans to one another, creating a growing mountain of debt which threatens to paralyse the financial system. In this week's report the central bank suggests that commercial banks should be asked to participate in the increasingly urgent efforts of the Russian government to find a solution to the issue of inter-enterprise debt.</p>

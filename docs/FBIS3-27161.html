			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed here today that it is most  important to take advantage of the peaceful conditions in  Sarajevo and extend the cease-fire to other parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It was also necessary to maintain other UN protected areas  --  referring to Mostar and Tuzla, the Russian minister, who arrived  here today for a two-day visit, told a news conference after  meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky.    He added, however, that the final aim of the Russian  government was the normalization of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Moscow expected to achieve it with  cooperation from the United States, the European Union and  Germany.    Geza said the restoration of peace in Sarajevo was not only  in the interests of Hungary and Russia, but also in the  interests of the whole region and the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO).    There existed opportunities to extend the scope of the  cease-fire, which would finally result in a political settlement  of the conflict in the region, he noted.    Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz and Prime Minister Peter Boros to discuss bilateral  relations and the NATO threat of air strikes against Bosinan  Serb positions around Sarajevo.    A NATO ultimatum for Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons  from around Sarajevo or face air strikes expired at 00:00 GMT  Monday [21 February] but the NATO did not take immediate action.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal producers braced for another tough year - Most analysts believe there will be no substantial rebound in prices in 1993 METALS PRODUCERS are bracing themselves for another punishing year. Among the metals traded on the London Metal Exchange only copper is priced at a level that gives efficient producers a reasonable return. For the rest, prices are not high enough for producers to survive in the long term. They are cutting investment, stopping exploration and postponing projects in a way that is storing up trouble for the future. But, as the table alongside proclaims, most analysts believe there will be no substantial rebound in 1993. 'Prices will remain soggy unless there is a significant upturn in the world economy,' suggests Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining company. He does not believe base metal prices will fall much further but 'they won't improve until well into 1993'. He adds: 'In important areas such as construction and automobile production and many capital goods sectors, activity will remain below the peaks of the late 1980s even as we go into 1994'. More production cuts by aluminium, nickel, lead and zinc producers are needed if prices are to show a short-term recovery, he says. Mr Crowson is not alone in this belief. LME prices have been on a rising trend in the last weeks of 1992 and the first days of the new year but this is not good news for the industry, according to Mr Neil Buxton at the Metal Bulletin Research consultancy organisation. 'It means the industry will delay the production cuts needed to reduce stocks and raise prices,' he points out. Stocks of aluminium, lead, nickel and zinc in LME warehouses are at record levels and those of copper and tin are uncomfortably high. Demand for metals will not increase enough to cut stocks appreciably, Mr Buxton suggests, and it is also unlikely that the flood of metal from the Commonwealth of Independent States which is creating havoc in western metals markets, will ease in 1993. These comments are echoed by Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist for Germany's Metallgesellschaft mining and metals group. 'The underlying situation of the non-ferrous metals markets hardly changed at all in the course of 1992 and in all probability will not do so in 1993 either,' he suggests. 'Production and consumption in the western world are stagnating or growing at an equal rate. However, the imbalance caused by east-west trade persists and at this moment there are no prospects of improvement in this respect.' Most metals market forecasters subscribe to the view held by the 24-nation Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, which is forecasting only a very weak recovery in 1993. The OECD's central projection is that economic growth in 1993 will be about 1.9 per cent, a substantially lower figure than the 3 per cent it was forecasting six months ago. Growth last year is estimated to have been a lowly 1.5 per cent. When growth is as low as this in the OECD countries, there is a strong chance that growth in manufacturing output will be lower still. As the Economist Intelligence Unit comments in its latest World Commodity Forecasts: 'Even allowing for a higher rate of growth among the less developed countries, world manufacturing output may well rise slowly enough to make any increase in world consumption of metals very doubtful'. The only good news in the OECD forecast is that the US economy - the most important in the world for metals consumption - is picking up at a slightly more rapid pace than previously expected. But this is being offset by the bigger-than-forecast fall in Germany and the slowing of growth in Japan. 'Together these are even more important metal consumers than the US,' Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, points out. Using World Bureau of Metal Statistics figures, he calculates, for example, that in 1991 the US accounted for 27.7 per cent of western world aluminium consumption compared with 25.4 per cent for Germany and Japan combined; 22,9 per cent of copper consumption against 29.1 per cent; 28.8 per cent of lead consumption against 19.2 per cent; 18.7 per cent of nickel consumption against 38 per cent; 20.5 per cent of tin consumption against 29.9 per cent; and 17.1 per cent of zinc consumption against 25.4 per cent. Most metal prices forecasters assume there will be no easing of the pressures arising from the sudden swing in east-west metals trade seen since 1990. Import demand for lead, tin and zinc in the former eastern bloc countries dried up while the region's exports of aluminium, copper and nickel to the west grew at a frightening rate. Much of the extra exported metal ended up in highly-visible LME stocks and were the main factor in the collapse of base metals prices since 1991. Metal consumption in the former eastern bloc is unlikely to pick up substantially this year but there is still the possibility that in some of the CIS countries chaotic conditions, lack of raw materials and/or energy and transport disruptions - as well as a deeply-entrenched bureaucracy - will severely curtail metal exports. There are still some analysts who believe the gloom is being overdone. Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says, for example: 'Sure, the average metal prices for 1993 will be little different than those for 1992. But prices will start from a low base and rise steadily to close this year significantly higher. I expect that, against a backdrop of a steadily improving economic environment, prices will improve in each successive quarter.' RTZ's Mr Crowson also points out that LME prices might also confound the fundamentally poor outlook by rising because of special factors such as 'heavy Chinese buying, investment funds returning to the LME if the US economy shows a stronger-than-expected recovery, or simple aggressive price speculation'. Zinc and tin were the only LME-traded metals to end last year with a higher average prices than for 1991, the former mainly because it was buoyed up by an options-related squeeze for much of 1992. Also last year some heavyweight financial institutions started to invest in commodities for the first time for ten to 15 years to diversify their portfolios and, as Mr Crowson points out 'given the (relatively small) size of the metals markets, only a small shift in fund investment pushes prices substantially'.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: US tightening trips up certain FRN investors  -Risk and reward Floating-rate notes are generally perceived to be low-risk investments, because their interest rates are adjusted in line with market rates at regular intervals. Over the years, though, several exotic variations, such as perpetual floating-rate notes in the 1980s, have proved more dangerous. The perpetual FRN market collapsed in 1986. More recently, two other structures which caught investors' fancy have gone under water. Although collared floating-rate notes and range floating-rate notes seemed like a good idea at the time, investors in both products misjudged the speed and the extent of the tightening in US interest rates. Both collared and range FRNs are structured using embedded derivatives to allow investors to express a view on interest-rate movements. Unfortunately, both have gone badly astray, leaving investors holding illiquid paper which has depreciated, in some cases, by more than 10 per cent. When the first collared FRNs were launched in 1992, the offer of dollar-denominated paper paying a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, at a time when Libor was a mere 3 1/4 per cent, appeared extremely attractive. The drawback was that in exchange for accepting a minimum coupon, or floor, of 5 per cent, investors also took a maximum coupon, or cap, of 10 per cent on early deals. Later, as investor appetite for the product grew, the cap was squeezed as low as 8 per cent on some deals. Advocates of the market point out that prices have adjusted to reflect fair value in a different interest-rate environment, as the value of the floor declined, and that in the meantime investors have benefitted from a high coupon. However, the problem is that investors' perceptions change when the market swings sharply. The bulk of the Dollars 23bn market in collared FRNs consists of bank paper, and much of it is subordinated. It also still has a long time to run, since much was launched with 10- or even 12-year maturities. 'At the time, investors didn't really take note of the subordination. It's only now that people are starting to worry,' said one syndicate manager. With three-month Libor at 4 1/4 per cent, deals are still paying a margin over Libor - the floor of 5 per cent. However, some were priced to pay  1/4 point below Libor, and may still have 10 years to run. For 10-year subordinated bank paper, that no longer seems a good deal. Prices on collared paper, launched at around par, have fallen to about 95 for the best names, and to about 85 for long-dated subordinated bank paper with lower caps. Further, while many of the banks which arranged these deals say they are still making markets, other traders say the market has become illiquid. Range FRNs have, if anything, fared worse. They have one advantage - most are short-dated, with one- to three-year maturities. Also, there were fewer of them - around Dollars 3bn since the start of the year. The notes were structured to pay an attractive rate of interest when Libor was in an initial range of, say, 3-4 per cent. The problem is that, very quickly, Libor fell outside that range, as US rates rose. 'Effectively, they have become zero coupon bonds and they just don't trade any more,' said one syndicate manager. 'A lot of borrowers have bought back paper, for as as little as 90 (from an issue price of par), because investors just don't want to hold on to it.' Among the largest investors who bought them as a play on short-term interest rates were UK building societies, according to one dealer. While they may be feeling disgruntled, investors in collared and range FRNs should know by now that high coupons up-front are bound to entail greater risk.</p>

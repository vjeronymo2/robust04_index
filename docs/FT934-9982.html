			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Renault/Volvo Despite the breezy confidence of Volvo's chairman, there is a real risk that the company's proposed merger with Renault may be blocked by dissident shareholders. A failure to consummate the deal would come as a severe blow to both companies. Renault would be mortified and devoid of obvious options. Volvo's managers could perhaps stitch together an alternative alliance - a partnership with Mitsubishi springs most obviously to mind. But, for both, it would represent a huge loss of face and would delay essential rationalisation. The weight of necessity must make it probable that the merger will still be effected, even if the terms have to be modified to appease the discontented. An asset swap leaving Volvo with both truck businesses and Renault with all the car operations represents one wild card option. But the industrial logic of a full merger remains compelling: the geographical spread and product ranges are highly complementary. Though Volvo's shareholders may quibble about the valuation, the real issue boils down to whether they can trust the French government. Mr Gyllenhammar, member of the Legion d'Honneur, clearly has fewer doubts than many of his compatriots. But the recent ructions at Air France add weight to shareholders' concerns. At the very least, the French government will have to set a timetable for privatising the merged company. That may be enough to win over Volvo's big institutional shareholders, who could see an exit route. But the French government's retention of a golden share seems to be non-negotiable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 8 May (MENA)--The PLO Executive Committee met  today chaired by Yasir 'Arafat to continue discussing the  formation of the National Authority Council, the body that will  assume the responsibility of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho  following Israeli withdrawal.    PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah said that  Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi, Jamal al-Surani,  Sulayman al-Najjab, and he himself declined to participate in  the Council.    Ghawshah disclosed that he is seeking clarification from  'Arafat concerning the Council's mode of operation, 'Arafat's  leadership style, and the relation between the PLO Executive  Committee and the Council, before he decides whether to  participate in the council.    Ghawshah pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Muhammad  Zuhdi al-Nashashibi have both asked for some time to think about  participating in the Council. Yasir 'Amr and Juwayd al-Ghusayn  have agreed to participate in the Council. Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the Palestinian negotiating  delegation, and Mahir al-Misri, a prominent figure in Nabulus,  have both refused to take part in the Council.    There is a consensus among Palestinian officials inside and  outside the homeland not to take part in the Council until they  are offered clarification about the Council's operating  procedure and guarantees that 'Arafat will not be the sole  decision-maker. These officials also call for a clear definition  of the relation between the PLO Executive Committee and the  Council. They believe that the PLO Executive Committee should  control the Council that it will form and retain the authority  to shape Palestinian policy, Ghawshah declared.    A committee formed of Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-Mazin and Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh will get in touch with Palestinian figures at home  and abroad to explore the conditions under which they would be  willing to participate in the National Authority Council and  ascertain their opinion concerning the Council's mode of  operation.</p>

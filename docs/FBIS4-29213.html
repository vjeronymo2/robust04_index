			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on 29 May interview with Deputy Prime Minister Tran </F> Duc Luong by SAIGON GIAI PHONG correspondent Oanh Van; place not  given]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong returned to  Hanoi on the afternoon of 29 May after his visit to the United  States from 18-28 May. During his 10-day visit to the United  States, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong met and had  contacts with many high-ranking U.S. officials as well as  representatives of the U.S. business circle. On his return  home, the deputy prime minister gave an interview to the  newspaper SAIGON GIAI PHONG. He said:    - I led the Vietnamese delegation to visit the United States  at the invitation of the "International Conference on Economic  Development." We attended three seminars held in Washington,  New York, and San Francisco. U.S. business circles showed great  interest in these seminars. The number of participants in these  seminars consistently exceeded the figure of people invited. At  the Washington seminar, only 200 people were invited but there  were as many as 250 people attending. At the New York seminar,  there were 200 people participating compared with only 150  people invited. Most of the questions raised by U.S. business  concerns were very realistic, substantial, and practical. U.S.  business concerns believe that the time is ripe for them to  enter Vietnam.    We also met U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, a number of  U.S. congressmen, and the U.S. [Senate] Foreign Relations  Committee. Through these meetings, the U.S. side agreed with  the Vietnamese side that it is now time to end the post-war  period of tension and to start the process of gradually building  normal relations and advance toward building fine foreign  relations between the United States and Vietnam. This is in the  interests of the United States, Vietnam, and the trend toward  peace, stability, and cooperation in the region.    While in the United States, I also visited the president of  the World Bank, the director-general of the International  Monetary Fund, and the chairman of the UN Development Program.  All of the heads of these organizations affirmed that they  would provide positive assistance to various cooperative  projects with Vietnam.    [Correspondent] Did the U.S. business concerns mention any  obstacles encountered while investing in Vietnam    [Tran Duc Luong] Apart from highly appreciating the  opportunities for doing business in Vietnam, U.S. businessmen  also pointed out three main obstacles encountered by them when  engaged in doing business in Vietnam. They are: 1. The  Vietnamese legal system is not perfect; 2. Vietnam's  infrastructure is still weak; and 3. Vietnam's administrative  procedures are cumbersome and complex.    [Correspondent] Did we sound out the prospects for exporting  Vietnamese goods to the United States?    [Tran Duc Luong] During various contacts, both the U.S.  political circles and U.S. businessmen admitted that to promote  increased trade investment between the United States and  Vietnam, we need the efforts of both sides. It is precisely  because of this that they [U.S. businessmen] also were concerned  about how to help Vietnam export its goods to the United States.  Vietnam's exports, including rice and beer, to the United  States have been made in small quantities. While in the United  States, I was told by the U.S. business concerns that it welcome  the return of Vietnamese goods to the U.S. market after many  years of absence. I met with groups of U.S. businessmen and we  initially agreed on the signing of certain contracts for the  export of goods to the United States. Of course, the export of  goods to the United States can develop satisfactorily only when  the United States grants Vietnam the most-favored nation status.    [Correspondent] As you have already met Secretary of State  Christopher, could you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, speak of the  substance of the meeting?    [Tran Duc Luong] The meeting was focused on the relations  between the two countries and other regional issues.    [Correspondent] Did the two sides deal with the follow-up  "road map" of U.S.-Vietnamese relations?    [Tran Duc Luong] At various meetings and seminars where they  spoke, U.S. officials never dealt with any "timetables." They  only said that the bilateral relations would achieve rapid  development if residual issues are satisfactorily resolved.    [Correspondent] Will the Assistant U.S. Secretary of State  Winston Lord arrive in Vietnam in late June for visit?    [Tran Duc Luong] I met Mr. Winston Lord after I had met Mr.  Warren Christopher. At that meeting, Mr. Winston Lord handed me  a note from the U.S. State Department on its consent to a  decision to officially make public the news about the  establishment of liaison offices in the capitals of the two  countries.    [Correspondent] Is there any reaction from the U.S.  public? When will the liaison offices be opened in the two  countries' capitals?    [Tran Duc Luong] This news met with a warm welcome from the  U.S. public, particularly from U.S. business circles. Many  people in business in the U.S. even asked the U.S. Government to  move further toward promptly granting Vietnam the most-favored  nation status.    The liaison offices will function like Consulates General.  Mr. James Habi who has been nominated by the U.S. Government to  head the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi said in a seminar that at  the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi, there would be economic  specialists whose duty is to provide assistance to U.S.  businessmen. At present, the two countries are finalizing  various procedures about administration and staffing so the two  offices can soon be put into operations. The U.S. side also took  me on a visit to the building where the Vietnamese Liaison  Office in the United States will be headquartered. The building  is located within the foreign embassies' quarter in Washington.  This building, formerly belonging to Vietnam, has been well  maintained by the U.S. side.    [Correspondent] During his meeting with you, did Secretary  of  State Warren Christopher say that increased U.S.-Vietnamese  relations would have an impact on regional peace and stability?    [Tran Duc Luong] Both the United States and Vietnam hold  that the Asia-Pacific region in general and the Southeast Asian  region in particular is a dynamically developing region with  fine economic prospects. This trend requires countries in the  region to take responsibility for maintaining peace and  stability so the region can develop favorably. The United  States realizes Vietnam's important role in Southeast Asia and  wants Vietnam to shoulder [ganhs vacs] the common duty of  maintaining regional peace and stability. For its part, Vietnam  believes that the United States has an important say and role in  maintaining regional peace and stability and hopes that the  United States will fulfill this mandate. Increased  U.S.-Vietnamese relations will certainly have a positive impact  on the region.    [Correspondent] Will the two countries' embassies in their  respective capitals be opened in the not-too-distant future?    [Tran Duc Luong] No one can give a specific timing. The  only thing I know is that if the two governments continue to  resolve their residual issues as they are doing now, the process  of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations will achieve rapid  progress.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

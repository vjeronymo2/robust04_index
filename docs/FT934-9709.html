			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (1): New hopes on the horizon - The capture of the 2000 Olympics Games is helping to keep Australians smiling during a bout of painful restructuring BY A curious quirk of fate, Australia secured the 2000 Olympic Games exactly 10 years after Alan Bond, the Perth-based businessman, won the America's Cup. Was this, local commentators wondered, a favourable omen? For many Australians, the America's Cup triumph is still a glorious memory. Not only did a nation prone to viewing itself as an appendage on the edge of the world take on the best and win, but the yachting victory against the Yanks seemed to usher in an era when Australian businessmen strode the world stage and prosperity rained down. True, this golden age ended - less than a decade later - in overstretched balance sheets and a rash of bankruptcies. But already there is speculation that Australia's latest sporting prize could mark a similar uprush of confidence and herald a second economic renaissance. In reality, this seems too optimistic. Many changes are being wrought in Australia at present, both on the cultural and economic fronts, but they are of a far more fundamental nature than a lot of easy bank lending. As a result, they are also more complex and contentious. A very different nation may emerge at the end of the day - probably more competitive, and certainly more diverse. But there is no sign that the transformation process is about to become easy. Australia's trade relations are a case in point. Australia started to throw its lot in with the Asia-Pacific region almost two decades ago, but the strategy has accelerated in recent years, first under Bob Hawke's Labor government, and then under his successor, Paul Keating. Today, the pro-Asia policy cuts across party political lines and, given the growth potential of that region, is generally judged astute. But the pace and manner in which the 'new order' is blended with the older, Euro-centric ties still prompts debate. Australia's decision to 'opt into Asia' was always a hard-headed one, driven more by economic necessity than philosophical ruminations. When established trading partners - Britain, in particular - started to concentrate on their internal European market, and the US began moving towards a North American 'free trade' block, Australia was forced to think long and hard about its own position. As Mr Keating has pointed out, his country was fortunate to find the Asian doors still open. 'Twenty years ago, Australia had a White Australia policy (discriminating against Asian immigrants),' he has noted. 'In the event, we were very lucky not to be marginalised in the Asia-Pacific region.' Today, politicians and trade mission leaders like to recall that 60 per cent of Australia's trade is conducted in Asia-Pacific, compared with about one-quarter 30 years ago, and that eight of the country's top dozen export markets lie in this area. This is true, although it is should be added that Japan still dominates the picture. In the year to end-June, the Japanese took a hefty 25 per cent of Australia's total exports, almost double that of the Asean nations (Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Brunei and Indonesia). Australia's salesmen have to work harder to dispel the notion that their country acts as the region's 'farm and quarry', supplying raw agricultural and commodity products which neighbours with cheaper labour then convert into manufactured items. In reality, about 61 per cent of the ADollars 60bn annual exports take the form of manufactured goods. Of this, perhaps one-third are 'higher-valued added' items. That is a marked improvement on the 11.5 per cent share taken by more sophisticated manufactures back in 1986-87, although no one seems keen to predict how much further the trend may go. 'People are loath to nail a number to the mast,' says Steve Prytz, at the Australian Manufacturing Council. But glance at the nation's investment inflows, and a very different picture emerges. Here, Australia's 'old partners' - the US and the UK - still dominate, supplying over 60 per cent of new foreign capital ploughed into Australia in the 12 months to end-June. Japan, until it fell on hard times, was also prominent. Asean countries, by contrast, accounted for less than two per cent of total foreign investment in Australia at mid-1993. So, when it comes to pleading for investment dollars, state government agencies suddenly remember their former heritage - and sing the virtues of Australia's clement environment, Western-style facilities, trained labour force, and so on. The worry, then, for some Australians is that emphasis on Asian links could risk demoting older ties, which still have a good deal to offer. 'East Asia is extremely important, but so also are Europe and North America,' remarked Professor Robert O'Neill, the Australian-born director of London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, in a recent public lecture. HE said: 'The economic prospects offered by East Asia are indeed impressive, but it remains a politically weak area. Even in terms of economic relations, Australia may find that it is increasingly on a playing field which slopes uphill.' If foreign relations are a delicate balancing act, moves to loosen the historically-protected Australian economy have produced more acute tensions. Steady privatisation of government-owned enterprises and the use of competition to promote efficiency have been keystones in recent government policy. In a country where one person in four still works for the public sector, this, too, is broadly applauded. But dogma has sometimes ridden roughshod over common sense and the limitations of a small population base. Attempts to deregulate Australia's domestic airline industry, for example, prompted only one new carrier to take to the skies. It subsequently collapsed, twice, within three years. In the media sector, an auction system which was supposed to distribute licences to operate satellite pay-TV led to high but speculative bids from a couple of start-up companies. They were duly declared winners - only for the authorities to discover that cash, at the promised levels, was not forthcoming. More seriously, the quest for efficiency has created social hurdles. On the one hand, recession and the need to restore balance sheets has prompted many companies to streamline activities by asset disposals, plant closures and the like. There is nothing uniquely Australian about this; a similar response has occurred in most Western economies in the face of sluggish demand. And, as in the US, there is every sign that corporate profitability is beginning to benefit from the catharsis. But Australia is also committed to a big reduction in its tariff barriers by the year 2000, which is essential if the country is to join the Asian party. This, in turn, has prompted some multinationals to rethink the economics of manufacturing locally. Last July, for example, Isuzu Motors announced that it would stop making trucks in Australia in about three years. By that stage, the tariff on trucks should have dropped to five per cent, compared with 12 per cent at present. For the working population, the combined effect of these two trends has been devastating. The unemployment rate remains stuck in double-digit figures and, as the structural upheavals continue, few economists are willing to predict any significant reduction in the foreseeable future. That, in turn, has done nothing to ease relations between the government and the labour movement. These have already been strained as Australia tries to develop a devolved, enterprise-based wage-bargaining system - essential to freeing up a labour market which has been among the most heavily-regulated in the OECD. Culturally, some of the challenges are just as tough. 1993 was named the year of the indigenous people and Aboriginal music is selling in high street record stores. But the fight over land rights remains heated, and the High Court's 1992 'Mabo' ruling - which overthrew the notion that Australia was uninhabited before European settlement and declared that native title could exist where Aborigines had retained a close association with the land - has yet to be translated into a viable system for deciding native title claims. On this score, a political compromise, which wins a modicum of backing from many of the interested parties, is finally on the table, although the all-important details have yet to be fleshed out. Even then, it is unlikely that the Aboriginal community will see this as a final settlement of past wrongs: 'a native title bill is just a first step,' comments one moderate representative. 'We're going to have to do this piecemeal.' Mr Keating has indicated that the discordant strains could be better harmonised under a 'Republican' flag. To some observers, this is cheap politicking - an attempt to divert people from real underlying issues, with a largely symbolic rallying cry. But that, perhaps, misses the point. When a country goes through a fundamental and painful adjustment, a little attention to the symbols may be no bad thing.</p>

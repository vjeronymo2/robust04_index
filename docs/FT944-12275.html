			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The Bank's view of prices As Mr Eddie George pointed out last week, practitioners of monetary policy have no crystal ball to tell them when to act. What the governor of the Bank of England has instead is a medium-term target for inflation, a wide range of economic forecasts, and a judgment on how to reconcile the two. To gauge by the Bank's latest inflation report, his institution's current opinion is that September's interest rate rise has reduced the gap between target and forecast. If interest rates were to remain unchanged, the report says that the single most likely outcome for inflation in the first half of 1996 is 2 1/2 per cent. This is at the top of the government's 1-2 1/2 target range, and somewhat lower than the 3 per cent forecast in August. But there is a better than even chance of its being exceeded, at least without further increases in interest rates. As the Bank is keen to stress, the scope for error is wide. Its own forecasting record shows that already. It has been caught out, once again, by the slow pace of inflation in the three months since its last report. Instead of rising slightly in the third quarter, as predicted, the government's target measure fell further in September, to a new low of 2 per cent. The Bank lists five risks to the government's target for the end of the parliament. One, the growth rate of narrow money, has picked up since the last report. It grew at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent in October, compared to 6.5 per cent in August, and is still well above its 0-4 per cent monitoring range. This is cause for concern, but the slow pace of the broader credit measures presents little evidence for a take-off in consumer spending. Of greater interest are the other potential inflation risks cited by the Bank. As the report rightly notes, rising demand - especially overseas - appears to be putting upward pressure on producer prices. Thus far, lower unit labour costs have helped companies absorb much of the increase. Furthermore, tough competition at the retail level has largely spared consumers a rise in final prices. This means that the growth rate in producer prices, which has picked up in recent months, continues to exceed that of retail prices. But neither of the factors currently restraining the latter will necessarily last indefinitely. The same caution applies to the likely course of events in the labour market, the last - and most important - of the Bank's potential risks for future inflation. Underlying nominal wage growth has been moderate and rather stable in the recovery thus far. As with the increased competition among retailers, this could represent a positive structural change in the economy. But similar 'miracles' have been declared in the past. The Chancellor may be convinced that things have changed. But the Bank would rather not take any chances. There is a danger that it will turn out to be crying wolf. Given past experience, that must be more sensible than assuming the wolf is slain.</p>

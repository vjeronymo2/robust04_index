			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (12): Sprinting to the tape - China does it differently INDIA'S economic reforms, though impressive, have not yet taken the country to a higher plane of growth. China, by contrast, averaged 9 per cent annual growth in the 1980s after its reforms got under way at the end of the previous decade. Can India too transform itself into a high-growth economy? On the surface there are a number of similarities between India and China. Most obviously, both are very large, rurally-based economies with low per capita incomes. Both have a big capacity for growth and large, available, hard-working labour forces. Secondly, both have huge, very inefficient public sectors and massive bureaucracies. This means that there is tremendous scope for greater productivity - but this would involve social, political and management upheavals which have so far prevented much improvement in either country. In both countries, corruption is a well-entrenched fact of public life. Thirdly, both currently have governments which understand what reforms are required to achieve their goals and appear ready to make the necessary changes over time. The parallels cannot be taken too far. Political structures are entirely different. The Chinese government does not have to answer to an electorate but instead is subject to repeated internal power struggles which result in periodic changes of direction. Mr Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reforms, realised however that market-led economic growth was essential for the Communist Party's retention of power, and this tenet underlies all government policy. China's reforms, though designed to end the heavy top-down management of the economy, have themselves been carefully structured and strongly led by the government. They are backed by the party's powerful propaganda machine. When the Chinese government puts its weight behind reforms, they tend to be carried out - sometimes too enthusiastically so that economic growth has then to be contained. Substantial re-structuring of of the financial system, the public sector, taxation and trade can be expected in the coming years provided there is not a crippling political power battle. India's governments operate in a boiling cauldron of democracy in which economic policies often seem somewhat irrelevant to their retention or loss of office. It is significant that reforms were introduced two years ago when financial crisis ruled out most other courses of action. Mr Manmohan Singh, who launched them as finance minister, is not by career a politician but a financial expert and administrator. He has proved himself to be a canny politician, but relies on the support of a prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, whose own tenure has sometimes looked shaky. When Mr Singh announces reforms, he cannot be certain that they will be put into action because they tend to involve a diminution of patronage for bureaucrats at both central and state government level. Attempts to open up sectors of the economy, such as airlines, telecommunications, and television, have run into obstacles or become embroiled in corruption. Political constraints have so far prevented Mr Singh from putting privatisation and substantial labour reform on the agenda. This is unfortunate because one of India's big advantages is that it already has a large and vibrant private sector which should be a powerful engine for growth of the economy and of exports once it has adjusted to the ending of the need for close ties with the government and of the protection afforded by high tariff barriers. Management skills which China is having to learn from scratch already abound in India. India also has a better developed financial system able to channel resources to the development of businesses. Though its inadequacies were shown up by the stock market scandal of 1992, it is still streets ahead of China where the financial system has essentially existed to bankroll state direction of the economy. The biggest difference evident to the foreigner, however, is in attitudes to foreign investment. China patently welcomes investment, even though foreign companies must work hard to develop contacts and to ensure that contracts are carried out as they envisage. The would-be foreign investor in India, though entering a developed private sector with many familiar and appealing aspects, must still wade through official processes of the pre-reform era which can take inordinate time and effort. Mr Rao, Mr Singh and other key ministers and officials have the vision and the will to change the economic face of India, but they have yet to inspire the same determination among sufficient numbers of their colleagues. Until the political will becomes more widespread, it is difficult to see India moving up to join the high-growth economies further east.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Producer scheme fuels coffee rally - Week in the Markets IT WAS all systems go again on the coffee market during the first half of this week as news that African producers had agreed to join their Latin American counterparts' scheme to curb exports lent fresh buoyancy to prices. The November position on the London Commodity Exchange climbed Dollars 98 from last Friday's close to peak on Wednesday at Dollars 1,220 a tonne, up Dollars 253 from a month earlier. The market had become overbought in the process and profit-taking trimmed the price to Dollars 1,201 at yesterday's close; but sentiment remained bullish and traders said there was scope for a further substantial retracement without breaking the uptrend. The co-operation of the 25 members of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation means that the scheme to withhold 20 per cent of production from the export market, which is due to come into operation on October 1, should, if faithfully adhered to, result in about 10m bags (60kg each) being retained in producing countries during the 1993-94 crop year. Based on estimates by London trade house ED &amp; F. Man that would be equivalent to nearly 14 per cent of annual world demand and about half the present level of consumer stocks. The producers' scheme is designed to fill the gap left by the collapse in 1989 of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system, following which world coffee prices plunged by about 60 per cent. After repeated failures, attempts to revive the ICO pact, in which consuming countries were involved as well as producers, were abandoned in March and producers decided that self-help was their only remaining option. The retention scheme was greeted initially with considerable scepticism, but international traders have gradually come to believe in the producers' determination to make it work. Whether determination will prove to be enough is another matter, however. Financing the holding of such large stocks will impose a heavy burden on cash-strapped African governments; and policing the scheme is bound to present problems. One delegate at this week's IACO meeting in Kampala commented: 'Commodity pacts have had a high failure rate in the past. . . The retention scheme is a temporary solution, with problems of sustainability'. The London cocoa market also put in a strong performance this week, though the real scale of the rise was partially obscured by sterling's rise against the US dollar. The December futures contract at the LCE reached a 20-month peak of Pounds 792 a tonne before closing yesterday at Pounds 779 a tonne, up Pounds 18 on the week, but the rise might have been Pounds 26 larger had it not been for the currency factor. Manufacturer buying interest was noted in the London market on Monday, but the main power behind the rise came from the New York market, where speculators succeeded on Wednesday in breaking through determined resistance at Dollars 1,017 a tonne for December futures. At the London Metal Exchange signs of an easing in the nearby supply tightness that has been distorting the copper market allowed the three months position to test support around the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne mark. The support held, but only just; every day the three months position traded below that level (the lowest being Dollars 1,890 on Thursday) but only Wednesday saw a sub-Dollars 1,900 closing price. Yesterday three months metal closed at Dollars 1,904.50 a tonne, up Dollars 1.50 on the week, while its discount against cash metal (a reflection of the technical tightness) had narrowed since last Friday from Pounds 40 to Dollars 33 a tonne. Nickel fared less well. Continued trade hedging of Russian material pushed the three months price to a fresh 6-year low of Dollars 4,620 a tonne in mid-week before short-covering reversed the trend. The 'correction' carried the price to Dollars 4,825 yesterday morning before it subsided to close at Dollars 4,742.50 a tonne, down Dollars 85 on the week. The long-rumoured announcement of a cut in aluminium output by Reynolds Metals, the second-biggest US producer, finally arrived this week, but it did little for market sentiment. Reynolds said it would close temporarily another 88,000 tonnes of annual capacity because of the worldwide supply/demand imbalance that has been weighing on the market. A slight price rally ensued, but that had as much to do with fears that a train drivers strike might force the closure of Romania's 263,000-tonnes-a-year Alro smelter. The market's resumption of its downward course was hastened, however, by the revelation that Alro was only operating at a rate of 110,000 tonnes a year. The price continued to sink until determined defence emerged at the Dollars 1,170-a-tonne mark to counter selling by speculators who were reported to be trying to trigger US investment fund liquidation by breaching that key chart level. The defenders succeeded in repelling the onslaught and the three months price ended the week at Dollars 1,173.50 a tonne, down Dollars 33.75 on balance. Gold moved towards the upper end of its recent narrow trading range this week, but never seriously threatened to break into higher ground. The re-emergence of US investment fund buying lifted the London bullion market price by Dollars 5 to Dollars 373.75 a troy ounce on Monday and at yesterday's close it stood at Dollars 373.25 an ounce.  -------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------- Aluminium     -925  to  2,021,450 Copper     +11,050  to    497,450 Lead        +3,400  to    279,575 Nickel        +606  to    105,030 Zinc        +7,750  to    745,800 Tin            +65  to     21,355  --------------------------------</p>

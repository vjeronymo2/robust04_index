			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Galleries off the beaten track - Stagnation in the property market has provided up-and-coming artists with alternative premises AS THE recession bit deeper in 1990-91, the pace of gallery closures accelerated. It became evident that galleries which had been prepared to take risks with young unknowns, and very likely sell their work to newly-rich punters in the heady years of the 1980s, could no longer afford to do so. The galleries that were left played safe with exhibitions of artists of proven selling power and tended to turn away those who were not. Young artists graduating in the 1980s had become accustomed to selling well for high prices at their degree shows. By the turn of the decade it was no longer so, and the spirit of self-help came to the rescue. The crash in the property market left a wealth of untenanted accommodation - disused warehouses, empty shop spaces - which were frequently let to artists on a short lease as an exhibition venue. Some of these exhibitions were spectacularly successful, with reputations made overnight, or at any rate over the course of a few weeks. A more enduring enterprise is the Delfina Studios Trust, an organisation set up by philanthropist and patron Delfina Entrecanales at Maryland Works, Stratford, E15 (Tel 081 519-8841). The purpose of the Trust is to give working space to selected young artists for a period of one or two years just when they are at their most vulnerable: they have left college, they are without a studio and they have no visible means of support, moral or practical. Some 18 artists are accommodated at one time and their work is exhibited in a purpose-built gallery twice a year, and the studios may be visited by appointment. The non-commercial gallery scene in the East End is jumping. Matt's Gallery, 42-44 Copperfield Road, E3 (Tel 081-983-1771), has been in business since 1979. Run by Robin Klassnik, himself an artist, each exhibition is a co-operative enterprise between him and the exhibiting artist. In many cases he has been the first to give a solo exhibition to artists now familiar to a wide public, such as Tony Bevan, who showed in May/June this year at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. Although the gallery is supported by public funds it does from time to time sell work, perhaps most notably Richard Wilson's oil sump installation, '20:50', now in the Saatchi Collection. Klassnik commissions four or five new pieces every year and, with two spaces each measuring 1,600 square feet, there is always one piece on show in one space whilst another is in preparation in the other. In 14 years Matt's Gallery has grown from a very private event into a gallery of international repute, attracting curators and collectors from all over the world. Chisenhale Gallery, 64-84 Chisenhale Road, E3 (Tel 081 981-4518) specialises in innovative contemporary art which is site-specific, created by UK-based artists and artists from abroad. During the last year or so several of the exhibitions have achieved a high profile. The gallery commissioned Rose Finn-Kelcey's steam installation, which is now in the Saatchi Collection; Grenville Davey's exhibition last November coincided with his winning the Turner Prize, and Christine Borland and Vong Phaophanit were both in the Aperto at the Venice Biennale. The matter has been selected as one of the four contestants for this year's Turner Prize. An exhibition of collaborative works by Richard Deacon and Bill Woodrow, exhibited in May/June this year, was supported by the 1992 Prudential Visual Arts Award Programme. South of the river, just behind the Design Museum, is the Clove Building, 4 Maguire Street, SE1 (Tel 071 701-5861). Kapil Jariwala founded his gallery in 1986 in Camberwell, but has now moved to the Clove Building to larger and more accessible premises. He shows an eclectic range of artists, both abstract and figurative, and is committed to the notion of the gallery as forum for new ideas. The paintings and sculptures exhibited are nevertheless clearly rooted in tradition. The Cafe Gallery in leafy Southwark Park (Tel 071 232-2170) is an artist-run gallery founded in 1984. Exhibitions of both established and less well-known artists are democratically selected, with an emphasis on installation work. The gallery has had an exchange programme with artists from East Berlin, as well as integrating the local community into their exhibition plans. One of the most dramatic installations was Darrell Viner's Wheel. A few intrepid spirits use their own homes as their gallery. One such is Maureen Paley, an American who has chosen to live in London. Ms Paley founded Interim Art, 21 Beck Road, E8 (Tel 071 254-9607) in 1984, and in two relatively small rooms of her house she has mounted some ground-breaking exhibitions. Two of her artists, Julie Roberts and Angela Bulloch, were shown in the Aperto this year. In West London another home is given over entirely to art. Dr John Gruzelier, Reader in Psychology at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, founded his gallery, Gruzelier Modern and Contemporary Art, three years ago at 16 Maclise Road, W14 (Tel 071 603-4540) and now has 10 exhibitions a year of new work. In contrast to the spare hang of a white-walled gallery, the work is everywhere, as it would be in a domestic setting. Early on Gruzelier's bias was toward contemporary Scottish painters such as Ian Howard and David Cook, but he has now broadened the base to include ceramics and installation work by artists from the UK and abroad. One such installation is Norwegian artist Kjetil Berge's 'The Prince's Bedroom' which involves suspending transparent sheets of plastic printed with gnomic images in three of the rooms (August 2-13). Off the beaten track these galleries may be, but they have the huge advantage of being open at weekends when it is easy to get about and easy to park. The discovery of a hitherto-unknown (to you) artist in a hitherto unvisited gallery is both pleasurable and fun.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: First global decline in sales of computers WORLD COMPUTER sales revenues declined last year for the first time, according to a market research study of the industry. Sales revenues in the personal computer, minicomputer and mainframe segments of the market dropped sharply, while workstation and supercomputer sales grew. Dataquest of the US revealed that total computer revenues were down 7.8 per cent in 1991, compared with the previous year. 'The computer systems industry ran into two very high hurdles in 1991: the negative state of the worldwide economy and the mammoth organisational structures many vendors were supporting,' said Ms Nancy Stewart, senior industry analyst. The industry's largest companies, such as International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Unisys, are restructuring their operations to cut costs. 'In the face of this maturing market, we can expect to see further cost-cutting measures and restructuring from vendors in 1992,' said Ms Stewart. Total industry revenues, measured in terms of factory revenues (the prices charged by manufacturers before third party distributors add their margins), were Dollars 109.7bn in 1991, down from Dollars 119bn. Sales of personal computers were down more than 8 per cent, from Dollars 49.9bn in 1990 to Dollars 45.7bn last year. IBM lost market share, while Apple Computer, NEC, Compaq Computer and Olivetti gained market share. Mainframe computer revenues fell to Dollars 26.9bn from Dollars 30.6bn in 1990. Sales of midrange computers, including minicomputers also declined, from Dollars 29bn in 1990 to Dollars 26.5bn last year. There was, however, growth in the workstation segment, albeit at a much lower rate than in previous years. Revenues for 1991 were Dollars 8.8bn, up from Dollars 7.6bn the previous year.</p>

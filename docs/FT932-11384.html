			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / G7 set to release billions for Russia in two to three months THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries is prepared to start putting billions of dollars into the Russian economy in the next two to three months to shore up the economic reform movement, according to senior G7 officials. However, the Russian government must show it is prepared to tackle the crisis with painful decisions, including allowing unemployment to rise to several millions as credits are stopped to state enterprises. The G7 is assuring the Russian government that funds will be released if it is clear that 'appropriate' policies have been adopted - not, as last year, that they must first fulfil a series of targets on inflation and on the budget deficit which have proved impossible to meet. The barrier of 'conditionality' imposed by the International Monetary Fund has thus been substantially lowered by a political decision of the G7 to support President Boris Yeltsin. A senior G7 official said aid could start flowing as early as the end of this month if the momentum of reform were accelerated. 'If Mr Yeltsin is prepared to be bold now then there is no reason why the aid should not flow by the end of May,' he said. But the continuing political struggle within and around the Russian government makes it unclear if even less strict criteria can be met. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, senior foreign adviser to the Russian government, said: 'It is a valid question as to whether actions will follow the referendum. 'The government does have to demonstrate that it has control, especially since without a strong central bank it is hard to have confidence. I believe they will but it is a legitimate worry,' he said. Professor Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an adviser to the World Bank said: 'It is important for the west to be seen to be helping in a major way. It is important that it put pressure on the IMF. But at some point, the west may have to say that there has been no progress and stop the money,' Professor Fischer said. The direction of economic reform continues to hang in the balance. Reformers have been buoyed by signs that Mr Yeltsin last week committed himself to pursue reform, to promote reformers and sack conservatives. But they have also been disappointed by lack of movement to date and by the appointment of Mr Oleg Soskovets, a former industrial manager and minister without a track record for reform, as a first deputy prime minister. Western officials listed four key conditions which should be met before funds can be released. The conditions are: strict credit limits; a rise in interest rates; significant reductions in all subsidies; a viable budget programme that is consistent with low inflation. The funds at issue are mainly from the International Monetary Fund, which sends a team of senior officials to Moscow today to begin negotiations on disbursement. The first half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) 'systemic transformation facility' to be used to support the budget is likely to be agreed soon after the IMF officials report back to Washington. A larger sum, the Dollars 4.1bn standby fund which has been available for over a year, could begin to be disbursed by the summer, according to the senior G7 official. 'If the Russians really want it, they can have a standby agreement in July,' he said.</p>

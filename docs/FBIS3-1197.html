"I have decided to take the  initiative, to assume my responsibilities," he tells us. "The  peace accord must be applied. There has been too much delay.  This time, everybody has his back to the wall...."    After reading his statement, the president of the principal  opposition party, the Rwandan Democratic Movement, promptly  returned home. Like all the country's politicians, he fears  assassination. This weekend Rwanda was torn between hope and  fear: Hope of finally seeing the country break the political  deadlock and acquire a responsible government and fear of  renewed violence that would once again block the transition.    This time the countdown will be short: The prime  minister-designate has requested the president of the Republic  to set, by 21 March, the date on which he will swear in the new  government, which will consist of five ministers from the  Patriotic Front. If he does not receive a positive reply by  this deadline, Twagiramungu will act to strictly apply the  Arusha accords, by the terms of which, if the head of state  fails to fulfill his obligations, the prime minister can himself  swear in the government with the assistance of the president of  the Constitutional Court and the agreement of the outgoing prime  minister.    Despite the danger of open and violent confrontation with  those who are trying to delay the transition indefinitely, a  number of reasons have encouraged Twagiramungu to assume his  responsibilities: "I cannot relinquish my rights to found a  government in favor of a president of the Republic who  interferes in the internal affairs of the parties and seeks to  impose those parties which are favorable to him. Also, I have  reached an agreement with the parties which were preventing the  new government from taking office, the Rwandan Democratic  Movement and the Liberal Party."    Twagiramungu has in fact made room for an opposition leader  within his own party, namely the former Prime Minister Dismas  Nsengiyarenye, and has also acted to settle divisions which were  tearing apart the Liberal Party, entrusting the Justice Ministry  to a "third man." Aloys Nyuhita belongs neither to the "Hutu"  faction, which has close links with the president's party, nor  to the "Tutsi" faction, which is accused of being an "objective  ally" of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The question of whether  or not the Justice Ministry should be entrusted to a  representative of the radical opposition or a member of the  Liberal Party linked to the president's party is a crucial one:  It is the justice minister who must decide who is responsible  for the wave of violence, attacks, and assassinations that have  shaken Rwanda over recent years.    After lengthy negotiations, the prime minister-designate  thus  believes that, for his part, "everything is ready: I have  reached an agreement with the different parties, allocated posts  in accordance with the representativeness of all the parties,  and none of them may claim to have been excluded. The ball is  no longer in my court."  <H5>  Repeated Pressure </H5>   Mr. Twagiramungu has spoken out after a week of intense  negotiations conducted with all the political parties, including  the Patriotic Front, by the Tanzanian foreign minister, who  returned home without result but who did exert pressure on the  prime minister-designate to move away from entrenchment. "I  have the support of the whole international community,"  Twagiramungu said, "of the Tanzanian facilitator, of the UN  representative, who has constantly repeated that by 5 April the  Security Council will reconsider the mandate of the blue  helmets, and of Western observers. If my list is not accepted  by the head of state, it will be clear for all to see who is  really responsible for the deadlock."    Will President Habyarimana finally agree to swear in a  transitional government in which he has no blocking minority, or  will renewed violence, orchestrated by the political militia,  once again break out during the next few days? Rwanda has  genuinely reached a crossroads: It will either disintegrate  into self- destructive violence, as has neighboring Burundi, or  it will adhere to the Arusha accords and commit itself to  power-sharing between the Hutu majority and the Patriotic Front.  "This democratic process, which is facing incredible  resistance, is, for Rwanda, a revolution more important than in  1959, because at the end of the road, what we ultimately  envisage is national reconciliation, and the creation of a state  founded on the rule of law," concluded Twagiramungu, before  crossing a capital where, as soon as night falls, the only  vehicles on the roads are the jeeps of the Belgian blue helmets.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: Fashionable PCs put on the spot - Worth Watching The latest for the fashion-conscious computer owner is a computer system with a spotty case. Pro City Computers, which sells its wares on London's Tottenham Court Road, has designed new cases for its PCs and stack computers which incorporate a large coloured spot - red, pink, purple, blue, white or black - in the centre of the case. The company reports interest from corporate clients who select the spot to match their logo. Pro City Computers: UK, 071 637 0736.</p>

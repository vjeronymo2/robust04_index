			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Suchocka warns over vote of no confidence MS Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister, yesterday warned that the country's economic reforms would be delayed if her government is toppled in a vote of no confidence this morning. She was speaking in parliament on a Solidarity-proposed no-confidence motion which, if passed, could lead to new elections. Ms Suchocka said: 'It is a paradox that this debate comes as our economic recovery is becoming ever more apparent.' Industrial output rose 7.6 per cent in the first four months of this year. Solidarity, which normally supports the coalition, called the no-confidence vote in protest at the government's refusal to award pay rises to striking health workers and teachers. Mr Aloyzy Pietrzyk, a Solidarity official, said: 'This coalition government has for the past 11 months implemented policies which represent capitalism with an inhuman face.' The coalition may scrape by with a thin majority after the small PL farmer's group decided yesterday to abstain.</p>

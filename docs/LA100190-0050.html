			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> CURBSIDE RECYCLING INCREASES TRASH FEE  </P> <P> Trash collection bills will go up about $1 per household once curbside  recycling starts in 1,000 test homes this month, city officials estimate.  </P> <P> The actual increase will be 10.7% for each household and business to cover the  estimated $147,210 cost for testing curbside recycling for one year, said  Assistant City Manager George Scarborough.  </P> <P> At the end of one year, the actual costs will be audited and reassessed by the  City Council.  </P> <P> The council recently voted to spread the cost throughout the entire city rather  than limit it to just the tested households.  </P> <P> "I think it's a far better approach that the entire city accept the burden, not  just a small group of people," Councilman Kenneth E. Friess said. "Ultimately,  the whole city will have to accept the burden anyway."  </P> <P> Along with San Juan Capistrano, curbside recycling is being tested in homes in  two other South County cities -- Dana Point and San Clemente -- which all use  the same trash collector, Solag Disposal Inc. Recyclable materials including  newspaper, cans, glass and plastic will be collected in three bins on the  regular trash collection days. LEN HALL  </P></p>

There were only small leaks about yesterday's  confrontations due to the Israeli military censorship. REUTER  said the Israeli Army killed a Palestinian woman, who was five  months pregnant, while she was watching the clashes from the  window of her house--clashes which resulted in the injury of at  least five Palestinians.    In a telephone interview with our radio, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh,  head of the PLO Information Department, confirmed the death of  the woman and said about 30 Palestinians were wounded, and  another three killed during the day. He added that the Israeli  Army carried out a large-scale offensive in the city of Hebron,  occupied the children's hospital and Queen 'Alya' Hospital, and  fired rockets at houses on the pretext of searching for wanted  persons. Therefore, added 'Abd-Rabbuh, today's Cairo meeting  between the PLO and Israel will not be held.    This Cairo meeting was expected to be held after the failure  of the Israeli and Palestinian sides in Tunis to agree to the  resumption of peace talks. The meeting was scheduled to  concentrate on the issue of protecting Palestinians in the  occupied territories.</p>

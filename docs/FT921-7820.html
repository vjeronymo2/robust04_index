			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Japanese earn highest motor industry pay JAPAN, the world's biggest vehicle producer, emerged for the first time last year with the highest gross hourly wage rates in the world motor industry, says the German motor industry federation (VDA). Motor industry wage costs were significantly higher in Sweden and in Germany, however, thanks to their much heavier social payroll costs, such as payroll tax or national insurance. By contrast France became the country with the lowest total hourly wage costs in the developed world's motor industry for the first time, narrowly ahead of the UK. In the five years from 1986 to 1990 the UK had the lowest motor industry wage costs (gross wages plus social costs such as payroll tax) in the developed world, but the VDA study shows that it was matched last year by France. Japan and the US, the world's largest vehicle producing countries, ranked mid-way between the European producers for total motor industry wage costs at DM33.87 and DM35.05 per hour respectively. Japan, which was second only to Spain at the beginning of the 1980s as a low wage cost country among auto producers, has suffered an erosion of its position in the last decade. According to the VDA Japan had the highest gross hourly wages last year in the whole of the world motor industry at DM26.05 per hour narrowly ahead of Germany at DM25.87. Japan's total wage cost competitiveness is helped, however, by much lower social costs which at DM7.82 per hour are close to the UK level of DM7.18 per hour, which was the lowest in the ten-country comparison. The VDA study shows that gross hourly motor industry wages are higher in the UK than in several other European countries, namely the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France and Spain. The UK vies with France for the lowest total wage costs, however, thanks to the very modest level of additional payroll levies. Spain, which consistently had the lowest motor industry wage costs among the industrial countries in the first half of the 1980s, has progressively lost its competitive edge to the UK and France since the mid-1980s. Spain was the main recipient in Europe of big inward investment projects by world car makers at the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s, but its role was taken over by the UK in the late 1980s with a wave of investments by Japanese car makers. The biggest recent investments in new capacity in Europe (by Volkswagen, General Motors and VW/Ford in a joint venture) have gone to former east Germany and to Portugal. German car makers are expressing grave concern about domestic wage cost levels. Mrs Erika Emmerich, president of the VDA, warned recently that the German motor industry's strengths in quality and technology were no longer sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages of producing in Germany. 'However we look at it, our production costs are too high. The wage costs of the German auto industry are almost a third higher than the Japanese, they are two-thirds higher than the British and the French and 50 per cent higher than the Spanish. 'High wage costs and - by international comparison - short working hours significantly reduce the competitiveness of the German industry.' Mrs Emmerich warned that some German companies, particularly components suppliers, had already faced the stark choice of either moving production abroad to lower-cost countries or of going out of business.</p>

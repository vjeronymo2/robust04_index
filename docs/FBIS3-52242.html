			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader of the revolution Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to </F> the masses of al 'Assah region; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Hello. First, it is good that you have arranged  this meeting in this tent, this family-like atmosphere, instead  of having to make speeches in public squares. This is much  better, a family-like, brotherly meeting.    First, I am happy with your high morale and readiness for  confrontation. This is not unusual for you as your kinfolk and  your forefathers were the heroes of the battle of Sidi 'Abd al  Samad, Al Dhlila, Sidi Said, Sidi 'Ali, Al Gdaline [against the  Italian invading army in 1911]. History is a witness to the  courage of your kinfolk, and their confrontation with foreign  invasion, particularly after the fall of Zouara, and the enemy's  attempt to advance toward Al 'Ujaylat, the mountains, and  Fazzan. [passage omitted]    Now there is another confrontation, in another era, with  different methods. So far, the battle has not reached the level  it had attained with the Italians, with rifles, bullets, and  machine-guns. So far, the battle continues with the enemy, but  with other weapons and other methods. We want to be very  careful this time. We do not want the enemy to laugh at us. The  enemy fears us. It says: This land has an armed and trained  people, prepared for confrontation. It will bring us other  methods. We must be careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans:  "Hang them in the public square," "O leader, do not show mercy  to any traitor"]    Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact  that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed  resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it  enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant  to this.    This is what we should be aware of as a people who want to  be  victorious in this battle, and this confrontation, and allow  this period to pass without the enemy achieving victory over us.    Our forefathers fought the Italians for years and years. The  Italians had a super power state in those days in comparison to  the Libyans. [passage omitted]    We are now in better shape. We are a trained and armed  people and more numerous in number. Our population is larger  now than in the past. We have industry, agriculture, water, and  potential. We can fight and continue the battle for a longer  period. Your kinsfolk and forefathers here were the area's  lions and protectors. They confronted the Italians and offered  their lives in sacrifice to prevent them advancing to 'Ujaylat,  Jabal Nafusa, and Fazzan.    What is required of you in this place, which is called Al  'Assah, is that you be the guards...[crowd shouts slogans] What  is required of you is that you will be protectors of the area  once again as your fathers and forefathers had been.    Defense is a patriotic duty to protect the economy, the  national product, and the Libyan dinar. We are not going to  sell our homeland for our stomach. We do not protect our  borders by a police force, by helicopters, or desert vehicles.  We protect them by our conscience and our patriotism. We are  committed, not to do these things [encroach on borders] and we  will prevent anyone from doing them. That is protection.  [crowd chants]    Our ancestors neither lived by smuggling nor did they rely  on  Italian goods. How could they have fought against Italy if they  had been importing everything from it? We are now in a  situation as if we were fighting against America, so we are not  importing American goods. We are doing without them. We are as  if we were fighting against France and Britain, and we are not  importing goods from Paris and London. Our independence,  sovereignty, and honor are above goods. [passage omitted]    Those who stretched their hands and dealt in francs sold us  out. They enabled the Italians to reach Fazzan [in southern  Libya] and enabled them to trample over the bodies of our  martyrs.    The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to  public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family  and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who  can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede  into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn  and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying  out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much  you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a  deluge. [crowd chants]    There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that  those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the  court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are  determined to strom the house and property of a traitor, and to  burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable.  In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation  should come to this, but those are the masses.    Traitors used to be referred to the law and the court and  that was sufficient for us. However, the masses are above the  law, above courts and above everything. [passage omitted]    The masses can storm any place without mercy or pity where  treachery is concerned. This has occurred before my eyes.  Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied  evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family  were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said:  Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will  storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of  treachery.    Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers  are treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous;  al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous;  the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have  foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in  smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer  goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If  we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of  awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what  weapons are required for the battle.    If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do  not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver,  aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that  corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face  with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel  weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One  should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must  know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and  the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is  shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then  that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver  cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who  would defeat you.    Let us live like our forefathers used to live, a clean life,  a life accepted by our own conscience, a life that allows us to  be free with our heads held high, relying on our land, our  animals, our farming, our trees, palm trees, olive trees,  relying on ourselves, our own production. But if we keep  looking across the sea at their consumer goods and then  challenge them, we would not be able to do so. I have already  told you: If our forefathers were relying on Italian canned  food, or if they were dealing in Italian lire, then we would not  have been able to fight Italy. How could we have fought Italy  while eating, drinking, and dressing with its products? [passage  omitted]    Great, that is it, exactly. Great. In reality you people in  Al 'Assah area do not need a speech from me. You do not need a  long speech. You understand what I have been saying. [passage  omitted]</p>

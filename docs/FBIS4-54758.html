			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by </F> Jana Francikova; place and date not given: "The Slovak Republic  Is Prepared To Abolish the Surcharge"]    [Text] On the occasion of the signing of a supplementary  protocol to the Central European Free Trade Agreement by the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary [in Budapest on 29  April], Peter Magvasi, minister of economy of the Slovak  Republic, declared that "Slovakia has an extraordinary interest  in the speedy liberalization of trade." HOSPODARSKE NOVINY  asked him in this context:    [Francikova] How does your statement tally with some of the  nonliberal measures that Slovakia recently introduced against  the Czech Republic?    [Magvasi] As far as the import surcharge is concerned, we  introduced it because our economic situation at the beginning of  the year made it necessary. We realize that it is not a liberal  measure. The development [of the trade balance] has markedly  improved, however, and, if this trend continues, we are ready to  abolish the import surcharge by 26 June of this year. At that  time, we will be conducting talks on it in the GATT Secretariat  in Brussels.    [Francikova] Do you consider fair, in this context, the  introduction of certificates for imports of food from the Czech  Republic? Slovak customs officials have been demanding these  certificates as of 1 May.    [Magvasi] I insist that the certificates are not an economic  measure. We are concerned about the protection of consumers  and, at the same time, about improving trade between our two  republics. We did not violate the GATT rules, which demand that  measures of this kind be announced some time before their  introduction. We announced our intention at the beginning of  the year, in the law on the state budget.    [Francikova] Is it realistic to expect that a treaty on the  mutual recognition of certificates between the Czech Republic  and the Slovak Republic will eventually be signed?    [Magvasi] We have succeeded in concluding a treaty on the  mutual recognition of attestations issued by Czech and Slovak  testing laboratories. According to the European norm,  certificates are issued by national bodies of accreditation  [akreditacni organy]. At the last meeting of the Customs Union  Council, it was noted that the mutual recognition of  certificates is conditional on changes to some laws. In a  situation in which certificates are confirmed by bodies of  accreditation, it is pointless to change any laws.    [Francikova] In other words, you no longer envision the  signing of a treaty on the complete recognition of certificates.    [Magvasi] Time will tell.</p>

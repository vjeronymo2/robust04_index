			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: BSkyB view of current financial profile Sir, It is hardly surprising that Mr Christopher Bland takes such a jaundiced view of BSkyB's financial position (Letters, July 3) as the loss of the Premier League contract must have come as a considerable blow to his company. However, some of his points should not pass unchallenged. In March 1992, BSkyB announced that it had reached operating profitability and that it would achieve cash flow break-even in May 1992. This forecast has proved to be accurate, and the Pounds 33m of remaining shareholder financing is now unlikely to be required. The debt in the company is all either owing to shareholders or guaranteed by shareholders. The interest payable out of operating cash flow is less than Pounds 12m per annum. The rest accrues and will be paid to shareholders when they so decide. The 'negative net worth of Pounds 1.3bn' therefore represents the shareholders' initial investment in the company, which is in the form of a debt instrument rather than an equity instrument. The future programme rights contracted (but not provid-ed for in the accounts) of Pounds 950m are in respect of BSkyB's output deals with Hollywood studios. These contracts give the company exclusive rights to pay-television in the UK, and will be largely responsible for the company's growth to become the largest broadcaster in the UK. More informed comment on the company's financial position and prospects has come from a number of stockbroking research companies, including Warburgs, which was ranked (July 2) number one in the league table of research companies. The two most recent analyst reports, from BZW and Morgan Stanley, have both valued BSkyB in excess of Pounds 3bn.

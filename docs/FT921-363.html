			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Sewerage scheme in Cornwall Companies within the TRAFALGAR HOUSE group have won the design and construct Penzance and St Ives sewerage and sewage treatment works scheme. Valued in the region of Pounds 60m the contract has been placed by South West Water Services as part of its 'Clean Sweep' programme and involves the installation of a treatment process which is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK. The work will be handled by a consortium of Trafalgar House Construction (Major Projects) and John Brown Engineering. Acer Consultants are the consulting engineers responsible for the civil, structural, hydraulic and marine design work. The contract is for the design, supply, construction and commissioning of the scheme which involves diverting outfalls in the Penzance area and redirecting the sewage to improved facilities at Hayle sewage treatment works, prior to discharge through a new outfall as treated effluent. This calls for the installation of 25km of pipelines ranging in diameter from 150mm to 2,100mm; together with up to seven pumping stations of varying capacity depending on the catchment area. Proposals include a long sea outfall of 2.7km and a storm overflow outfall of 1.6km. The existing sewers in the Penzance area will be intercepted and the resulting flows will be pumped via pumping stations at Penlee Beach, Wherrytown, Battery Rocks, Chyandour, Marazion Bridge, Sailing Club, and Crowlas to the Hayle sewage treatment works. After treatment the effluent will be discharged through the 2.7km long outfall near Gwithian. Work will start shortly on the 154-week project.</p>

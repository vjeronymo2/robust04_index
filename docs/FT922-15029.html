			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas falls 25% but current year starts well TILBURY DOUGLAS, the construction and property company formed last October with the acquisition by Tilbury Group of Robert M Douglas Holdings, yesterday announced a fall in profits, but said it started 1992 with work in hand 12 per cent higher than a year ago. Pre-tax profits fell 25 per cent to Pounds 15m (Pounds 20m) in the year to December 31, helped by a two-month contribution, worth Pounds 2.4m, from Douglas. The fall was due to weaker margins in construction and continuing recession in housebuilding. Mr Michael Bottjer, group managing director, said Tilbury Douglas' range of businesses insulated it from some of the downturn. Scottish housebuilding, which has been more resilient than in England, had another 'excellent year'. Turnover increased 22 per cent to Pounds 239.6m, due to a sharp increase in construction-related sales, which rose 26 per cent to Pounds 191.6m. Construction business for the privatised water and electricity industries remained buoyant, but pre-tax profits for the construction side fell slightly to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m). Pre-tax property profits were cut in half to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 8.6m). House sales in Scotland increased to 446 (415) and prices were maintained at Pounds 58,000. But Mr Bottjer said there were still no signs of any upturn in the English housing market, where sales declined to 52 (85) and average prices fell to Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 74,000). The company expects to increase sales in Scotland and England to 740 units this year, predicting a slight improvement in England towards the end of the year. Interest earnings increased to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.6m) and the company held net cash of Pounds 13.7m at year end. Earnings fell to 46.9p (70p). The directors recommend maintaining a 22.5p final dividend, to make an unchanged total of 33p. Dividend cover fell sharply to 1.1 times, reflecting the increased number of shares in issue following the Douglas acquisition. The maintained dividend and an upbeat presentation lifted the shares 3p to 538p. COMMENT Tilbury Douglas is an under-researched company, but City houses may now be tempted to put the shares on their watch list. Despite difficult trading conditions, margins in the construction division were held close to a healthy 6 per cent and the slump in property profits is presumably relatively easy to reverse once the English market improves. Investors have the added attractions of the company's property developments, with the Spanish industrial development due for completion this year, and the first sizeable sales from the Phoenix development in Glasgow due next year. Forecast 1992 profits of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 27m put the shares on less than 10 times with a dividend yield of 7.9. The only problem for enthusiasts is getting hold of the shares, which are very closely held by German interests and UK institutions.</p>

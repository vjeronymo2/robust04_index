			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE/RHR: "Rwandan Crisis: `Action of Belgian </F> Paratroopers Initially Limited to Kigali'"]    [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- Late Monday afternoon  [11 April] Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Van de Weghe  stated that the 400 Belgian paratroops currently ready for  action in Kigali will initially be limited to carrying out  operations in the Rwandan capital before intervening elsewhere  in the country.    At a press briefing in Brussels, he stated: "We do not  currently envisage taking any action outside of Kigali. At the  moment, it is not possible given the problems of mobility that  we are running into in Kigali itself."    The head of the National Defense Information Service  moreover  said that the slowness with which Belgian Forces are acting is  due to the coordination problems encountered: "It has taken a  long time to coordinate the paratroops, the Belgian UN forces in  the country, the Belgian Embassy, and French units."    Colonel Van de Weghe further indicated that some French  units  are to remain in Rwanda until all Belgian nationals have been  evacuated. One contingent, nonetheless, will be withdrawn,  France having already evacuated all of its nationals (some 600  people).    "An uneasy calm settled on Kigali on Monday afternoon," he  said. Only a little sporadic gunfire could be heard, but "we are  unable to say who is firing on who," Colonel Van de Weghe added.    The Rwandan capital's airport is "safe at the moment," and  aircraft "are landing and taking off normally."    Colonel Van de Weghe said that in Gisenyi (in the northwest  of the country, near the border with Zaire), the situation  "seems to have calmed after initial problems." He denied  reports that the seven Belgian military volunteers had been  surrounded.    "The commander has confirmed to us that the military  volunteers are moving around normally and are helping to  assemble civilians for transfer to Goma (BELGA editor's note:  The closest Zaire border town)," he stressed. In the colonel's  opinion, some 20 Belgians are still in Gisenyi awaiting transfer  to Goma.    The other Belgian nationals outside Kigali are assembled in  Ruhengeri (in the northwest) and Butare (in the south).</p>

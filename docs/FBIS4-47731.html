			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, April 29 (AFP) -- Separatist  Somaliland's former president called here Friday [29 April] for  the country to rejoin its southern neighbour Somalia, from which  it seceded unilaterally in May 1991.    Abdulrahman Ahmed Ali, the first head of state after  secession, told journalists in the Ethiopian capital: "It is  time our people understood clearly that the international  community does not intend to recognise Somaliland." He added  that Somalis in the north and south "should sit down together to  sort out their problems."    Ahmed Ali, who was joined at a press conference by warlord  General Mohamed Farah Aidid, heads the Somali National Movement  (SNM), instrumental in overthrowing Somali president Mohamed  Siad Barre in January 1991. Ahmed Ali and Aidid are key players  in ongoing efforts to secure a stable political future for the  factionally-riven Horn of Africa nation following the withdrawal  last month of the US contingent and other western troops from  the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia.    Ahmed Ali said the SNM, which is reportedly riven by  internal  strife, would attend a meeting of the main Somali factions  scheduled for May 10 in Nairobi. The UN-brokered meeting has  been called to pave the way for a national reconciliation  conference.    Aidid, who has been absent from Mogadishu for five months,  welcomed Ahmed Ali's declaration on Somaliland.    But the current president of Somaliland, Mohamed Egal, said  Ahmed Ali's remarks amounted to "treason."    He told AFP by telephone from Hargeysa: "Mr Ahmed Ali only  speaks for himself. He is an individual and does not represent  Somaliland." Somaliland's self-declared independence was  "irrevocable," he added.</p>

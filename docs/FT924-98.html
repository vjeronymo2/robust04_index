			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / France faces more economic misery FRANCE'S unpopular Socialist government yesterday faced a stream of gloomy economic news as surveys appeared showing an increase in unemployment last month and further falls in confidence among both industrialists and consumers. The number of people out of work in France rose 1 per cent in November to 2.97m, according to figures from Insee, the state statistics institute. This raised the annualised rate of unemployment to 10.5 per cent from 10.4 per cent in October. The news of November's job losses comes at a critical time for the French government, only three months away from a general election in late March. It is also a setback to the government's hopes of presenting a positive picture of France's economic prospects to the financial markets during a period of fierce pressure on the French franc. Unemployment is one of the main drags on the French economy as fears of joblessness have depressed consumer confidence. A new BVA study for Paris-Match magazine suggests confidence is still deteriorating with 71 per cent of the French claiming to be 'pessimistic' about France's prospects in 1993, compared with 64 per cent this time last year. This pessimism is mirrored in the corporate sector. The level of confidence among French industrialists has also declined in recent weeks, according to the latest Insee monthly study of 3,300 senior executives. Industrialists expressed concern about the sluggish domestic market and rising stocks. They also reported continuing pressure on exports, which have been affected by the strength of the French franc since this autumn's currency crisis. The government has ruled out abandoning its rigid fiscal policy in favour of reflating the economy before the French go to the polls.</p>

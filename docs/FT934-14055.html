			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Bottom line on Buthelezi It will soon be time to call Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's bluff. I refer to the Zulu prince who heads both the KwaZulu government and the Inkatha Freedom party. The great black hope of conservative whites in Natal and elsewhere has battled hard for his chance to rule his bit of a South Africa that seems likely to be governed by the African National Congress, perhaps in alliance with President F W de Klerk's National party. He is the leading figure in the 'Freedom Alliance', which brings together leaders of three black 'homelands' and two potential rulers of a white redoubt. All want their own dunghills over which to crow, but their unifying objective, the preservation of minority rights, is not unworthy. Chief Buthelezi's methods, are, however, becoming dangerous. His recalcitrance is one of the principal obstacles to agreement on South Africa's future. An outcome not impossible to imagine might be an Angolan-style civil war. Underlying Britain's caution over matters South African is the fear of such a catastrophe. Southern Africa would disintegrate. There are perhaps 1m British passport-holders in the republic, and untold billions of capital invested in its future. The maintenance of stability is a prerequisite for all else. Not everything Mr Buthelezi says is wrong. His call for a federal-style solution has merit. His political behaviour, which is characterised by walk-outs and threats, is, however, becoming unsustainable. Both President de Klerk and his fellow Nobel laureate, Mr Nelson Mandela, are trying direct negotiation, in parallel with the multi-party process. They should offer a future Zulu-governed province (call it a state) maximum autonomy. In the nature of things, that would have to fall short of the quasi-independence Inkatha and its allies appear to want. Having declared their bottom line, the putative majority rulers of a unified South Africa should stick. If Chief Buthelezi then continues to use wrecking tactics, he should be disregarded. The negotiators at the republic's constitutional talks must meet the reasoned arguments put by Inkatha, but the Zulu prince may have to be faced down. You cannot placate the implacable. We are talking here about a very diff-icult man. He is honoured in the 1994 edi-tion of the Guinness Book of Records for delivering the longest known speech ever made. This achieve-ment was recorded at his legislative assembly in KwaZulu between 12 and 29 March this year. He was not on his feet for every moment. He actually spoke on 11 of the days of debate, averaging 2 1/2 hours a day. That makes Fidel Castro's 4 1/2 hours at the United Nations in September 1960 seem like a masterpiece of brevity. It makes even our own Mr William Cash, the anti-Maastricht rebel Tory MP, sound succinct. I have some personal experience of the chief's ability to expand on his thoughts. I visited him in Ulundi, the capital of the Zulu 'homeland', a few years ago. The two of us sat in his cabinet room alone, save for the photographs of Himself meeting Thatcher, Reagan and the like. (Lady Thatcher was always a particular admirer of his.) He spent some 45 minutes, which felt like twice as long, reading from a statement prepared to mark my visit. This was subsequently given to the news agencies. That task completed, we took lunch with the KwaZulu cabinet, which was as servile as that of the Lady then in office back in London. I was sent home with a bound typescript, 147 single-spaced pages of it. It was Mr Buthelezi's recent policy speech to his assembly. When I have told this story to others who have met him, the response has been 'so what else is new?' Yet verbosity does not mean that his case is all bad. Putting my own gloss on the element of it that should be heard out, it is this: the ANC, which maintains its alliance with the South African Communist party, cannot be trusted to rule South Africa in a democratic fashion. If it wins the first non-racial election, it may share power, as promised, with the previously white supremacist National party, but the two of them will together impose autocratic rule, suppressing most freedoms. Eventually the traditional African dictatorship will prevail, with the ANC crocodile swallowing the Nats who ride on its back. To my mind one touchstone might be: will there be a need for a Helen Suzman in the new South Africa? Would such a person be permitted to preach justice and freedom with the unswerving bravery of Mrs Suzman? Her memoirs, In No Uncertain Terms (Sinclair-Stephenson, Pounds 17.99), eschew the catchpenny vitriolics of another famous lady's tome published this week, but they tell a story of greater nobility. Mrs Suzman stood alone and vilified, the sole progressive MP in the apartheid assemblies of Cape Town, from 1961-74. She had no power, save that of her clarity of vision, yet she represented democracy in an undemocratic country for 36 years. We must all salute her. South Africa will only be truly democratic when there is no need to ask the Suzman question. Yet the 'Freedom Alliance', none of whose five leading protagonists appears to be a true democrat, can go only so far with protestations about future minority rights. Who would be a Suzman or an opposition supporter in a quasi-independent KwaZulu, Ciskei, Bophutatswana or Boer Free State? Outsiders should do what little they can. The Commonwealth, whose heads of government meet in Cyprus tomorrow, has not completed its South African mission. It should nudge the ANC/government alliance towards further constitutional safeguards and the 'Freedom Alliance' towards acceptance. Together with the EC, and the UN it will have much to say on post-election economic assistance for the new republic. Britain is, inevitably, a leading player in this delicate game. Its post-colonial responsibility to Southern Africa cannot be shucked off. It has too much to lose. So far, it has maintained its credentials with both sides. Mr Mandela called in last week; Mr Buthelezi some time before that. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has treated the latter with infinite patience - so far. He has listened at length and resisted the temptation to lecture in return. This cannot go on. Even in Mr Hurd's world of finely balanced diplomatic niceties there has to be a bottom line somewhere.</p>

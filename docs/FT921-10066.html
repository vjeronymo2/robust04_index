			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Major pledges more scrutiny of councils MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will today reinforce the government's commitment to legislation which will subject councils to more independent scrutiny. He will also underline the extension of private ownership, individual freedom and choice in a speech to the Young Conservatives' conference in Eastbourne. The prime minister will use his speech to set out more details of his party's manifesto and to try to frustrate Labour's hopes of exploiting voters' dissatisfaction with council services. Councils are setting poll tax levels and households may start to receive bills early in April - close to one of the dates thought likely for the general election. Tory efforts so far have focused on blaming Labour councils for setting high bills. Mr Major's speech will set out plans for publishing league tables of councils' performance. There would also be more contracting out of council services if the Tories won the election. Details of how more independent scrutiny could be introduced have yet to be worked out, but could involve an enhanced role for the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog. Mr Major's speech will build on the principles behind the Citizen's Charter which he unveiled last year. He will say that the re-election of a Tory government will mean 'no more municipal cover-ups and no hiding place for incompetent and uncaring councils'. Besides seeking to increase Tory appeal to young voters, Mr Major will outline four principles of his Conservative philosophy: ownership, responsibility, choice and individual freedom. Part of his speech will be aimed at encouraging the growth of a 'property-owning democracy', in spite of the flat housing market. He will also launch a fresh attack on Labour's economic policies, saying that the Opposition party has no proposals for strengthening the economic recovery when it comes, but many which would lead to a perpetual recession. Tories want to use the conference to counter claims that it has run out of ideas. Mr Major is particularly keen to emphasise that the Citizen's Charter involves a long programme of legislation for another four or five-year government. However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats continue to focus largely on the economy - particularly the job cuts announced yesterday by Ford, the carmaker. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, last night said Britain had suffered 'the worst problems of boom and bust, exaggerated by mismanagement'.</p>

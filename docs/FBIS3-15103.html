The Russian  diplomat had a meeting with chairman of the Tajik parliament  Imamali Rakhmanov. Problems, discussed by them, included the  speeding up of a dialogue with political opposition.    Adamishin praised the efforts of the Tajik leaders, aimed at  establishing peace in Tajikistan. He said that Dushanbe had  displayed goodwill, and now it is the turn of the opposition  forces to take reciprocal steps. According to Adamishin, the  Russian Federation agrees to organise a meeting, probably in  Moscow, between representatives of the political opposition and  the Tajik leadership under the aegis of the U.N.    "Now it is the turn of the opposition to reciprocate, and it  should show by its deeds what it really wants," Adamishin  stressed.    ITAR-TASS learned, however, that Khodzhiakbar  Turadzhon-Zoda,  former spiritual leader of Tajik Moslems and now deputy chairman  of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan, who is now in emigration,  said in an interview with the Tehran-based newspaper KAYHAN that  he does not recognise the present government of Tajikistan and  will never stop fighting it. At the same time, the former  spiritual leader of Tajikistan does not reject a possibility of  a political dialogue with the republican leaders, but he  believes the meeting should be held in Tehran. in his opinion,  Iran and Afghanistan should be intermediaries. Khodzhiakbar  Turadzhon-Zoda is one of influential leaders of the  irreconcilable opposition.</p>

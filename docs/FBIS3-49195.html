			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Semso Tucakovic] </F>   [Text] Parallel to the talks of our Prime Minister  Silajdzic with Croatian Foreign Minister Granic on establishing  better relations between the two countries and resolving the  problems that had been created by chauvinists like Mate Boban,  Jadranko Prlic, Ante Roso, and others, the Croatian Army  continues to amass its troops on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory.    Namely, according to reliable information, the republic [of  Croatia] has been concentrating major forces in Livno and Ploce  these days in order to accomplish Tudjman's platform of a  greater Croatia at the expense of our country. According to  verified reports, the Croatian Army brigades from Imotski,  Split, Vinkovci, Sibenik, and the notorious Vukovar Brigade are  already positioned in Herzegovina and around Gornji Vakuf. We  must point out that the sending of fresh Croatian troops to  Bosnia coincides with the publicly made threats to our country  by numerous individuals from the Croatian state leadership.    First Tudjman threatened that he would send the Army to save  the Croats in central Bosnia. Then the aforementioned Granic did  the same.    However, the essence of the saber rattling on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina borders and the sending of troops to Bosnian  gorges has been best explained by Croatian Defense Minister  Susak and Croatian Ambassador to the United States Mario Nobilo.  For these two, the war of the Croatian Army in Bosnia means  defending Croatian ethnic territory and the Croatian state.  Drago Krpina, commander of the political section of the  Croatian Army, has recently also announced the increased  engagement of his formations in central Bosnia. That this is  not a mere propaganda trick is proven by the mass mobilization  that is already underway in Croatia, with the intention of  boosting the troops that are carrying out the aggression against  our state.    The movement of the Ustasha formations and their incursion  into Bosnia are being carefully monitored by our army, too.  Necessary precautions are, of course, being taken that will  thwart the realization of the plans of Tudjman and his generals.  Our fighters have already acquired abundant experience and  inflicted a sufficient number of defeats upon the Ustasha  formations to know what to do. They are also a guarantee that  the plan of the greater Croatian chauvinists will not be  realized and that the forthcoming offensive of the Croatian Army  in Bosnia will merely rapidly increase the number of deceased  Croatian soldiers who will give their lives for a futile cause.    The international community will not observe Croatia's  aggression against a sovereign and internationally recognized  state with their arms crossed either. It is perfectly certain  that Croatian may soon face economic sanctions, which would mean  the situation in which Serbia is right now. The policies of  these two neighboring countries have two common traits. They  share similar political leaderships and unrealistic desire to  submit and divide Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Within this context, one must also view Ganic's waving of an  olive branch in Vienna today and yesterday. An olive branch  will only make sense if the convoys of Croatian tanks stop  tumbling down Bosnian roads.</p>

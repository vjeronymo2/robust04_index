			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Budnitskiy, sector director of the RF </F> Economics Ministry's Council on Productive Forces: "Russia, Do  You Know This Itch?: What We Have, We Don't Hold on To"]    [Text] More and more oil, natural gas, copper, and  nickel are being exported to the West from Russia for next to  nothing. The income is coming to rest in foreign banks. Who is  going to put a halt to this economic self-exhaustion? And how?  According to the author of this article, we must restore  legislatively the state monopoly on the mineral trade--if only  for 10 years or so.    Reform of the Russian economy started out to the slogan  about the need for structural perestroyka. What is its  intermediate result? In 1993, the raw materials component of  Russian exports to the far abroad rose to 86 percent, whereas in  1990 the proportion of raw materials in exports was a little  more than 60 percent. This means that structural perestroyka  still has a strongly expressed negative significance.    The increase in the export of raw materials from Russia is  proceeding at the expense of domestic consumption. Domestic  consumption of oil over the last three years has declined by 40  percent, and of natural gas by 22 percent; nonetheless, official  export (not counting contraband export) of these products for  this period increased by 4 and 20 percent, respectively. An  analogous situation is taking shape with metals, cellulose,  ammonia, mineral fertilizers, and so on.    Export from Russia is going to grow. The increased cost of  imports will tend to limit the number of solvent purchasers and,  consequently, to cut the volume of imports themselves. If these  processes are not halted, the physical volumes of raw materials  exports will grow--to the point of completely exhausting our  reserves of the types of raw materials, semi-manufactured items,  and metals being exported.    In addition, we are seeing a relative increase in the cost  of  capital stock in devalued hard currency and a decline in the  price for manpower. The foundations for any possible industrial  development will be undermined in that part and the private  sector.    Russia has been in a similar situation before, during the  NEP  (New Economic Policy), when private entrepreneurship was choked  out precisely due to a lack of raw materials. In those years, up  to 80 percent of the raw material resources were exported from  Russia. Liberalization of foreign economic activity led to the  majority of enterprises in the mining complex, independently or  through the SP [joint enterprises], MP [small enterprises], and  so on, entering the foreign market.    The foreign economic turnover of these enterprises is  subject  to virtually no accounting. According to various data, export of  hard currency received primarily from the sale of nonrenewable  resources and primary output from them totaled $40-45 billion  over the last two years.    The scale of sanctioned and contraband export of raw  materials resources is leading to a sharp decline in prices for  many types of raw materials resources. Prices for copper,  nickel, and aluminum on the London metals market have fallen in  1993 in comparison with 1990 by 22, 42, and 31 percent,  respectively.    Most worrisome, however, is this: the normal work of the oil  and gas, metallurgical, fuel and energy complexes, and chemical  and lumber processing industry--the main suppliers of hard  currency to the Russian Federation (RF)--depend to a significant  extent on imported equipment and spare parts for that equipment.  Due to the "price scissors" (low prices for raw materials and  high prices for equipment), the quantity of raw materials being  exported is growing steadily. The increase in the cost of  imported equipment is simply frightening. If in the years  1976-80 equipment worth $12 billion was bought for the Russian  raw materials complex, and in the years 1981-85 about $20  billion, then in the last 5-7 years, according to specialists'  calculations, about $100 billion was needed.    Actually, the export of raw materials from Russia was  also practiced immediately after the conclusion of the civil  war. In the years 1933-34 (at the end of the Depression in the  West), this process reached maximum proportions. Only in 1936  did a decisive decline in raw materials export begin. For  approximately 10-12 years after the end of World War II, raw  materials were virtually not exported abroad from the USSR at  all. This specifically may have been one of the reasons for the  complete restoration of the USSR's industrial potential by 1954,  something the majority of Western analysts thought would take  Russia at least 30 years.    An equally alarming situation is taking shape in what is for  Russia a new economic process--the sale of the rights to  prospect for and work mineral deposits, or simply--the sale of  our depths. At the present time, it is in the raw materials  sector of the Russian economy that elevated investor activity  has been noted. However, Russian interests are virtually not  considered at all in raw materials plans, which envisage taking  abroad the raw materials and the profit received from their  sale. Reinvestment of the profit into Russia's economy is not  being considered at all in these plans.    The absence of an elaborated mechanism for holding  competitions for the right to prospect and work Russian mineral  deposits leads to incompetent, frequently only recently  organized companies that are interested not in exploiting the  deposit but in the resale of the licenses to work them receiving  licenses.    The loss of state control over utilization of the mineral  and  raw materials base and over reliable resource provision for the  country is becoming very real. This could lead to the total  collapse of Russia's economy and, as a consequence, to the loss  of the state's economic and political independence.    Russian legislation on regulating mineral use is limited  essentially to the RF Law "On Mineral Wealth" and a series of  resolutions by the Supreme Soviet. In the United States, on the  other hand, a country with developed market relations, the  number of laws actually reinforcing the state's priorities in  the use of the national raw materials base is almost 10. I will  list only a few of them: the law on national policy in the  sphere of materials and minerals; the Mining Code; the law on  strategic resources. . . . The Bureau of Mines, which is part of  the Department of the Interior, takes care of the planning  ("marketers," who shudder at the mention of this word, should  forgive me) for prospecting and for opening up national mineral  and raw materials resources in the United States.    Within the framework of forming and implementing RF raw  materials policy, the state must be secured by law the priority  right to dispose of mineral wealth. In all joint and wholly  foreign plans for opening up Russian mineral wealth, the portion  of the raw materials and profit that is going to be taken out of  Russia must be carefully discussed in order to allow us to  determine the volumes of funds for reinvestment into Russia's  economy.    In prerevolutionary Russia, foreign entrepreneurs were  allowed to take out a little more than 12 percent of the raw  materials they mined or the profit received from their sale.  Naturally, no one could take the remainder of the profit away  from them: legislation proposed that they use this capital for  the development of the Russian economy. And they agreed to this.  Many even took Russian citizenship.    In order to avoid mistakes in taking decisions on  large-scale  raw materials projects, it is essential, first of all, to  determine how the exploitation of a given natural deposit  corresponds to Russia's long-term financial, social, raw  materials, and other interests. This has to be done on the basis  of a study of the current state of affairs in the market, taking  into consideration the Russia's changing requirements for a  given type of raw material and their reserves. Secondly, to  assess the geopolitical aspect, taking into account the  influence of the working of a specific deposit on the world  production of any resource now and in the future.    When these issues are decided, a group of deposits will be  determined whose exploitation will not substantially affect  Russia's domestic and geopolitical interests. This group can be  put up for auction. But in such a way that Russia set its own  conditions, and the companies compete in offering the conditions  most advantageous to us.    The most decisive step must be taken in the sphere of  foreign  trade. The state monopoly on foreign trade in mineral raw  materials must be restored legislatively for a minimum of 10  yeas. The need for this step can be explained by the fact that  in the current situation only a state monopoly will permit the  halting of what is essentially the contraband export of capital  from the country on a scale that is at the very least  humiliating for a great country.    I think that our raw materials giants have to realize  the complexity of the situation and reconcile themselves to the  necessity for a state monopoly on foreign trade in raw  materials. Otherwise, in the event of Russia's loss of economic  and political independence, these joint-stock companies,  concerns, and so on will be transformed, in the best case, into  branches of Shell, BHP, and others of that ilk.    One of the main lines of use for this money, undoubtedly, is  conversion. Not "landslide" conversion, like now, but sensible  conversion. A gradual decrease in the volume of equipment  imported for the raw materials complex, to be compensated for by  the production of it in enterprises of the military-industrial  complex, will make it possible to decrease the share of  mineral-raw material and fuel-energy components in the structure  of Russian exports.    The prerequisites for the development of a progressive  structure for the RF economy will appear. State raw materials  policy must become (and one would like to believe necessarily  will become) the basis for real structural perestroyka.</p>

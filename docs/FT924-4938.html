			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / InterCity's passenger's Charter fails to meet required levels BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity sector is set to end the first year of the Passenger's Charter with all seven of its 'routes' (groups of lines) failing to meet the required levels of punctuality, reliability or both. Three of its routes - Anglia, West Coast and Cross Country - are falling so far short of their punctuality targets that they look likely to trigger 5 per cent discounts for passengers renewing season tickets. Two more routes - Midland Main Line and Gatwick Express - are performing so poorly on reliability that these, too, look likely to trigger 5 per cent discounts. The Great Western and East Coast routes are also failing to meet one or both targets. In neither case, however, does the margin reach the level necessary to trigger discounts. InterCity says the targets it has been set are unrealistic because they require all routes to perform to the standards of punctuality and reliability regardless of whether they have been modernised. It wants separate targets for each route. The government has rejected the idea because the result would be a softening of targets for most lines, and ministers are not prepared to concede a relaxation of the Passenger's Charter.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    HOW THE TRAINS ARE RUNNING      Passenger's Charter performance in the 44 weeks to November 6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    RELIABILITY         PUNCTUALITY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Target     Actual   Target     Actual                                      %          %        %          %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERCITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglia                              99       99.2      90       86.7 Cross Country                       99       99.5      90       82.3 East Coast                          99       99.1      90       88.5 Gatwick Express                     99       96        90       93.3 Great Western                       99       98.9      90       88.6 Midland Main Line                   99       97.8      90       87.8 West Coast                          99       99.3      90       83.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NETWORK SOUTHEAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Northern                      99       99        90       92.6 Northampton                         99       99.3      90       92.5 Thameslink                          99       98.7      89       87.7 Chiltern                            99       99        88       93.8 South Western                       98       99.5      88       91.2 Kent Link                           98       98.2      88       86.1 South London                        97       97.7      88       87.5 West Anglia                         98       98.8      88       91.6 Great Eastern                       99       99        86       89.9 Solent &amp; Wessex                     98       99.6      86       89 North London                        97       97.1      85       92 Sussex Coast                        99       99.5      83       85.9 Kent Coast                          98       99.4      82       78.5 Thames                              98       98.2      80       84.2 London Tilbury and Southend         97       97.6      80       90.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Procter cuts disposable nappy prices Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies. The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should have a positive effect on profits. Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market. Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has 26 per cent, Kimberly-Clark's Huggies 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private label products.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: MIM Holdings boosts profits 31% to ADollars 67m MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday reported a 31 per cent increase in net profits before abnormal items to ADollars 67.4m (Dollars 48.35m) for the 40 weeks to April 4. Sales were up 11 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. MIM said it had benefited from a more favourable exchange rate for the Australian dollar, increased gold production at the Porgera and Tick Hill gold mines, and reduced costs at Mount Isa, its Queensland base. The group said copper production at Mount Isa reached record levels in the third quarter, partly because of changes to more flexible work practices which allow mining seven days a week. However, operating profit fell by ADollars 11m to ADollars 81m after taking account of an abnormal profit of ADollars 13.4m, compared with a similar profit of ADollars 45.7m in the comparable period of the previous year. For the third quarter, MIM reported a net operating profit of ADollars 16.3m, compared with ADollars 30.1m in the comparable period of the previous year. The group said the fall was caused by a higher tax charge and lower lead and zinc prices. The group reported a bottom line loss of ADollars 500,000 for the quarter after accounting for net abnormal losses of ADollars 12.3m, net foreign exchange losses of ADollars 3.3m, and minorities of ADollars 1.2m. It made a profit of ADollars 22.5m in the comparable period of the previous year.</p>

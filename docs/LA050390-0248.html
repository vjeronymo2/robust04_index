			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A GLITZY PREMIERE FOR TROUBLED COMPANY  </P> <P> On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey  Ballet.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began  with some old neoclassical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the faded  glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by the  official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino.  </P> <P> Few in the dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may  have known it, but the show went on while the company confronted chronic,  possibly fatal, turmoil behind the scenes.  </P> <P> Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were  engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized.  </P> <P> Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and  counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as  artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate  survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved  it.  </P> <P> Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the  negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983,  is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is  filtered through cloying rosy lights and propelled by speedy steps and athletic  contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in the pit.  </P> <P> At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The  Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' "  </P> <P> Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless  production number. Also a massive bore.  </P> <P> It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus,  however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to  mention a point of view.  </P> <P> It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as  sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but  there may be some life in it yet.  </P> <P> For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening  involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere."  In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle  were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim  Sagani.  </P> <P> Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false  sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring.  </P> <P> Full review runs in Friday's Calendar section.  </P> <P> (Story on Arpino's resignation, B1.)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Kravchuk Proposes Formation of </F> Constitutional Court To Rescind Illegal Decisions by Crimean  Authorities"]    [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has proposed  the formation of a republic Constitutional Court in the near  future, which would rescind all decisions by the Crimean organs  of power which, in Kiev's opinion, are illegal.    "Under the Constitution the Ukrainian Supreme Council can  only suspend decisions of the Crimean Supreme Council, not  rescind them," he stated in the Ukrainian parliament Wednesday.    As the president noted, "Crimea must be placed within the  framework of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine." In his  opinion, "a party has come to power in Crimea which has  proclaimed the strategic course of seceding from Ukraine and  restoring Crimea to Russia."    Kiev took a sharply negative view of a recent decision by  the  Crimean Supreme Council on restoring the 6 May 1992 version of  the Constitution of the autonomous republic. This makes  provision, in particular, for the legal-treaty status of  relations between Kiev and Simferopol and the possibility for  Crimeans to obtain dual citizenship.    L. Kravchuk proposed that the Supreme Council make  amendments  to the law on delimitation of powers between Kiev and  Simferopol, "making provision for an expansion of the powers of  the Crimean organs of power." At the same time the president  deems it necessary to amend the laws on the security service and  the militia. The power structures throughout Ukraine should be  under central jurisdiction alone, he noted.    In L. Kravchuk's opinion a subcommission should be set up in  the Ukrainian parliament "to deal only with Crimean problems."  At the same time he expressed agreement with the proposal to  introduce in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers the post of vice  premier for territorial questions.    L. Kravchuk also pointed to the need speedily to resolve the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet, including "the question of  dispersing the Ukrainian and Russian fleets to their bases and  clearly defining the status of the Black Sea Fleet on Ukraine's  territory." "This will have a considerable positive effect on  the situation in Crimea," he said.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS TIME FLOATS BY ;  </P> <P> VENICE REMAINS HAUNTED BY THE BEAUTY AND ROMANCE OF ITS PAST, DESPITE TOURISTS,  POLLUTANTS AND RISING TIDES  </P> <P> When a letter arrived the other day from a friend in Venice, I was reminded of  Ernest Hemingway and Harry Pickering and Giuseppe Cipriani, individual threads  in the tapestry of that waterlogged city that miraculously survives the  vicissitudes of flood tides, hordes of summer tourists and pollutants swept in  by tides and winds.  </P> <P> One particular summer several years ago I stopped by Harry's Bar, which was  Hemingway's favorite watering hole, and having just listened to the hum of  vaporettos plying the Grand Canal and the notes of a violin rising from Piazza  San Marco, it occurred to me what a tragedy it is to be alone in this  enchanting city.  </P> <P> This seemed especially true on a summer night when ancient buildings along the  Grand Canal are bathed in moonlight and gondoliers sing their arias to couples  caught up by the wonders of Venice: The dome of Santa Maria Della Saute, the  15th-Century clock tower on St. Mark's Square, the handsome Gothic Campanile,  the Doges Palace and the Basilica San Marco.  </P> <P> No matter that frequently during the high season it is impossible to secure a  room, even in a humble pension, Venice continues to play to an audience lured  by its Byzantine beauty and romance. Gondolas sail beneath the "Bridge of  Sighs" where couples kiss in a ritual that Venetians insist seals love forever.  </P> <P> And so, indeed, this labyrinth of bridges and canals, palaces and piazzas  should be shared, particularly Piazza San Marco, where couples sip Campari and  soda while musicians grind out love songs and the clock tower sounds the hour.  </P> <P> My late friend John Squire met a woman one afternoon near the Rialto, and the  magic of the city overcame the two of them. During the next several days they  spent a lifetime together: Marveling at the sunlight on the Grand Canal,  feeding the pigeons in St. Mark's Square and sipping Champagne on the terrace  of the Gritti Palace. Venice had cast its spell.  </P> <P> One evening Squire hired a gondola and later, after a pit stop at Harry's, he  sang opera in St. Mark's Square to this woman who had come into his life so  unexpectedly. The moment was precious but, well, every episode has its ending;  personal commitments dictated that they part. And so one afternoon the woman  returned to Munich and Squire returned to New York City. Although they never  saw one another again, the memory remained with Squire to the very end.  </P> <P> The magic that is Venice is not easily forgotten.  </P> <P> And so one should not go alone to Venice. Queen Elizabeth arrived with Prince  Philip; Cary Grant was seen with an exotic beauty and there were the  Hemingways, Ernest and Mary.  </P> <P> While Hemingway enjoyed Piazza San Marco, he loved Harry's Bar. It was only  natural that he would, of course, for Harry's pours the best drink in Venice  and turns out wonderful meals. So Hemingway made it his unofficial headquarters  whenever he was in Venice.  </P> <P> It is not by accident that Harry's is known to legions of visitors. Cipriani  struggled to make it special to all who dine and drink there. In the late '20s,  when Cipriani was a bartender at the old Hotel Europa, there was an American,  Harry Pickering, who enjoyed the drinks that Cipriani poured.  </P> <P> As a result, Pickering was pickled an enormous share of the time. Later, when  Pickering's aunt left him in Venice, Cipriani took pity on Pickering and lent  him money. Pickering went on a binge and then one day he disappeared,  resurfacing several months later to repay Cipriani.  </P> <P> As an additional gesture of gratitude, Pickering lent Cipriani the cash with  which to buy his own bar. In return, Cipriani named the bar after Harry  Pickering.  </P> <P> It has been Harry's ever since.  </P> <P> With his debt repaid, Pickering disappeared a final time. Later, when Cipriani  died, Cipriani's son, Arrigo, took over the popular watering hole.  </P> <P> Harry's creates its own pastas and breads and desserts and homemade ice cream  and the most delicious chocolate cake in Italy. Harry's also pours one of the  world's driest martinis (10 parts gin or vodka to one part vermouth).  </P> <P> There was a time when Cipriani served royalty regularly. Even today, a duke or  a princess or perhaps a deposed king will drop by on occasion.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Harry's bartenders mix hundreds of drinks each day, the favorite  being the house drink, the Bellini, a combination of fresh peach juice and  Champagne.  </P> <P> Legions of travelers have made Harry's their hangout since 1931. It has  attracted hordes of hungry, thirsty vacationers and Venetians, as well as such  celebrities as Rex Harrison, John Steinbeck, Noel Coward, Prince Rainier,  Charlie Chaplin and Somerset Maugham.  </P> <P> The list is long.  </P> <P> Harry's holds forth in its original location on the Grand Canal, just steps  from a vaporetto stop.  </P> <P> Guests line up at the bar, and meals are served upstairs as well as on the  ground level. For sentimental reasons, a caricature of Harry Pickering hangs  near the entrance on Calle Vallaresso, a tribute to the man who bankrolled  Cipriani. On the same wall is a photo of Cipriani with Ernest Hemingway.  </P> <P> Hemingway and the late Cipriani struck up a lasting friendship that brought  still more fame to Harry's, what with Hemingway spending many hours at the bar  and the tourists begging for his autograph, or competing for the opportunity to  occupy Papa's favorite stool.  </P> <P> On other occasions, Hemingway and Cipriani traveled together to Torcello, an  island that's reached by speedboat from St. Mark's Square.  </P> <P> Cipriani went to Torcello in 1936 to establish a restaurant with guest rooms  upstairs. It was on Torcello, at Cipriani's inn, that Hemingway worked on  "Across the River and Into the Trees."  </P> <P> The population of Torcello was small, fewer than 100 people. So Hemingway was  at peace at Locanda Cipriani, this inn where he drank and wrote and played  cards, a peaceful plot surrounded by grape arbors and a garden ablaze with  flowers.  </P> <P> The dining room at Locanda Cipriani receives raves from visitors who travel to  Torcello merely to dine, returning later to Venice. Others take tables at a  rival restaurant, Ostaria al Ponte del Diavolo, whose casual atmosphere is  appealing.  </P> <P> Hemingway took up residency on Torcello more than 40 years ago, during the  winter of '48, and the desk where he wrote remains in the same room that he  occupied at Cipriani's.  </P> <P> Because of its peacefulness, Hemingway remained on Torcello for weeks. During  this period he established a ritual: In the morning he would write and in the  afternoon he would hunt with the inn's gardener, Emilio, or visit with the  parish priest, Don Francesco Taglipietra.  </P> <P> Besides Harry's and Locanda Cipriani, Hemingway enjoyed the Gritti Palace, the  famed hotel on Venice's Grand Canal.  </P> <P> The 15th-Century Gritti Palace has attracted dozens of celebrities: Charles de  Gaulle, Elizabeth Taylor, the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor, Princess Grace,  Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, Claire Boothe Luce, Sinclair Lewis, Ava  Gardner, Clark Gable, Laurance Rockefeller and Greta Garbo.  </P> <P> Maugham, who loved Venice and the Gritti, wrote: "At the Gritti, you are not  merely a number as you are in those vast caravansaries that appear all over the  world; you are a friend who has been welcomed as you step out of the motorboat,  and when you sit down to dinner at the very same table you sat at the year  before and the year before that, when you see that your bottle of Soave is in  the same ice pail waiting for you, as it has been year after year, you cannot  but feel very much at home."  </P> <P> For those searching for less expensive shelter, my vote goes to the cheerful  little Hotel Patria Tre Rose, on Calle dei Fabbri, as well as another close to  St. Mark's, the Casanova.  </P> <P> Leaving the Patria Tre Rose one evening, I struck out for a small family  restaurant I'd enjoyed earlier and became lost in a crowd that had gathered for  a fireworks display on the Grand Canal.  </P> <P> Exploding skyrockets were reflected in the canal like a watery rainbow. Sparks  showered down while the crowd applauded, and other fireworks roared off into  the night from handsome yachts facing the Danieli Hotel.  </P> <P> Later I found the restaurant I was searching for, and in a courtyard nearby a  young woman with braids was playing Venetian love songs on a mandolin to the  crowd that was leaving the fireworks show. A lad with a fine tenor voice joined  her and together they sang until the moon had disappeared and the clock tower  in St. Mark's Square sounded midnight.  </P> <P> While Venice is inviting, it can be trying at times. On a summer day as many as  30,000 visitors arrive. At the height of the winter carnival in February, more  than 200,000 -- or twice the number of permanent residents -- jam the city,  which inspired one Venetian to grumble that Venice will sink one day, not due  to flooding but under the weight of these invaders. They crowd the vaporettos  and gondolas and swarm over the Rialto and the Bridge of Sighs.  </P> <P> Poor Venice.  </P> <P> Residents complain that vibrations from rock concerts in Piazza San Marco are  damaging delicate mosaics in the piazza's magnificent cathedral. And still,  said a spokesman for the Italian Government Travel Office, they've not been  outlawed.  </P> <P> If Venice is seduced by tourists during summer, in winter it is ravaged by  floods. Only inches above sea level, the city is often inundated by tides  several feet high. And so for years, responsible citizens have struggled to  preserve the palaces and other buildings on Venice's 100-odd islands.  </P> <P> Artisans spent 15 years and billions of lire refurbishing the Ca' d'Oro, one of  those lovely palaces on the Grand Canal.  </P> <P> Dating from 1420, the building is considered as much a treasure as the  treasures it contains: Priceless paintings, mosaics, ancient bronze figures and  tapestries. Additional billions of lire have been spent restoring bell towers,  churches and museums.  </P> <P> In the high season, Venetians live under constant pressure. Often when they get  stressed out they escape north to Cortina d'Ampezzo, the little Alpine village  in the Dolomites.  </P> <P> Set in one of Italy's loveliest valleys, Cortina lies beneath peaks lost in the  folds of great billowing clouds, its mountains separating Italy from Austria.  For Venetians who live surrounded by water, Cortina, with its wildflowers and  grassy meadows, offers relief.  </P> <P> Waterfalls spill, swelling rivers and lakes, and in the golden time of summer  the high meadows are yellow with buttercups and blue with forget-me-nots and  columbine.  </P> <P> With the arrival of fall, cattle are returned to the village from the high  slopes, the signal for another of Cortina's festivals that attract great crowds  of Venetians.  </P> <P> Environmentalists as well as Venetians applaud Cortina's campaign to discourage  developers.  </P> <P> Unlike the Venetians, the residents of Cortina were aware of threats to the  environment long before others voiced fears over polluted air and water and  overcrowded land. It is sobering for Venetians, the contrast between the  pristine valley of Cortina and the polluted canals of home.  </P> <P> Still, while Cortina is fine for a holiday, legions of travelers -- I among  them -- prefer the treasures of Venice. Yes, even with the decaying buildings,  murky canals and oppressive summer heat.  </P> <P> Besides, on a muggy day the beaches of Lido Isle are only minutes away. Those  who can afford the heavy ransom take shelter on the island of Giudecca at Hotel  Cipriani, which is blessed with a swimming pool and breezes that sweep away the  humid air.  </P> <P> The next time I return to Venice, take a table again at Harry's and listen to  the vaporettos and the music that rises from St. Mark's Square, I shall again  raise my glass to the ghosts of Hemingway and Maugham and my late friend John  Squire -- and the other departed souls who shall never again know the serenity  of a sunset along the Grand Canal.  </P></p>

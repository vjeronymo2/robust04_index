			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] The leftist coalition has proposed to  President-elect Armando Calderon Sol of ARENA [Nationalist  Republican Alliance] a six-point agenda that includes the need  for a broad, concerted effort that will allow ARENA to govern  the country and consolidate peace.    Former left-wing presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora has  said the opposition is willing to work with the ruling party to  seek mechanisms that will lead to complete democracy.    The deployment of the PNC [National Civilian Police], the  concurrent demobilization of the National Police, and the  transference of lands are points in the peace agreement that are  still pending and should be resolved through a broad, national,  concerted effort, Ruben Zamora has said during an interview for  the "Up-to-Date" newscast. The former coalition candidate has  said it is essential for the Calderon Sol administration to seek  a concerted effort.    [Begin Zamora recording] We are proposing a six-point agenda  through which to achieve a concerted effort. I believe we must  reach an agreement on the peace agreements or, rather, on the  mechanisms to implement the peace agreements. [end recording]    The politician has said other points in the agenda presented  to the ARENA president-elect, are: constitutional amendments to  the judicial system; electoral reform; alternatives for  environmental protection; consumer protection; and a social pact  that will ensure governability.    [Begin Zamora recording] In order to succeed, the country  needs a concerted effort, the most tangible proof of which is  that the only way we could end the war was through a concerted  effort. [end recording]    Zamora has said the parties in the coalition will develop an  opposition that will seek a concerted effort based on three  points.    [Begin Zamora recording] Supervision first; proposals and  alternatives second; and a concerted effort fourth. This will  be difficult, because these three roles are not homogeneous and  can even be contradictory, but it must be done. [end recording]    The former presidential candidate has said that as of this  week all the political parties will begin their postelection  reorganizations. According to Zamora, power struggles will  develop within ARENA as well as in the left-wing parties,  although he expressed assurance it is not a matter of engaging  in political cannibalism.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 1.3m at Hopkinsons PRE-TAX profits of Hopkinsons Group, the industrial valve and hydraulic equipment maker, showed a marked decline, from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.34m, in the six months to end-July. The shares closed 7p lower at 32p. The pre-tax figure was struck after an interest charge of Pounds 608,000, against income of Pounds 1.29m, and an exceptional provision of Pounds 600,000 for redundancy costs in the gas division. Mr Ralph Goodall, chairman, said last year's interest income had been eliminated on the purchase of Carbo in October last year. Borrowing had increased, he added, but gearing, at 41 per cent, remained within acceptable limits. Turnover jumped to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 18.7m) reflecting a full six months' contribution from Carbo. Group operating profits improved by 48 per cent to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m). Mr Goodall said there was currently no sign of an upturn in the group's main markets and the timing and extent of any recovery remained uncertain, with no expectation of significant improvement within the next 12 months. The interim dividend is reduced to 0.9p (1.2p), payable from earnings of 1.4p (3.18p) per share.</p>

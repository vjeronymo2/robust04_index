			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Investment advice Where I can get impartial advice about my investments? The majority are investments for growth and produce a low income. But I am in my late 60s (with no dependants) and find I am in need of more income. I have not been satisfied with previous advice from my bank. It is a little difficult to advise you as we do not know the amount of your investments. But investment advice can be had from solicitors authorised by the Law Society and accountants authorised by the Institute of Accountants. It could also be worth getting quotes and suggestions from two or three independent financial advisers so that you have a choice of approach and advice. Publications such as Planned Savings and Money Management, obtainable from newsagents, contain details of most of the major players in this market. (Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

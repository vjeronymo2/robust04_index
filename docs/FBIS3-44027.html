Residents of the Lesotho capital say it is not  clear where the fighting is taking place. The two opposing  military factions are apparently firing on each other from  hillocks outside the city. The clashes broke out about a week  ago after the government refused to grant a demand for a 100  percent salary increase by one of the military groups.</p>

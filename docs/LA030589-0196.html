			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR REBELS URGE 'LAST CHANCE' TALKS  </P> <P> El Salvador's rebels Saturday proposed "a last opportunity" meeting with the  government Tuesday and Wednesday to negotiate a peace settlement and called on  the United States to end its opposition to postponing a presidential election  to Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Noting that the government had never responded to a previous guerrilla offer to  meet this weekend, Radio Venceremos, the clandestine radio of the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front, said that "finding ourselves at the end of  opportune time we propose negotiations no later than March 7 and 8 in El  Salvador."  </P> <P> If the talks aren't held and the voting is not delayed, said Salvador Samayoa,  a senior FMLN spokesman in a separate interview, "there is no possibility of a  negotiated solution for five years" -- the period until the next presidential  election.  </P> <P> President Jose Napoleon Duarte last Sunday had accepted the idea of a meeting  with the FMLN, as the guerrillas are commonly called, for last Tuesday, in  Guatemala, a plan rejected by the rebels, who said that the talks should be  held here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limited Subject  </P> <P> Even if a meeting is held, the guerrillas' demand that the subject be limited  to the postponement of the voting from March 19 to Sept. 15 is not acceptable  to Duarte, the Salvadoran armed forces and the Nationalist Republican Alliance,  the far-rightist party that is the likely winner of the presidential voting and  has unswervingly opposed any delay in the elections.  </P> <P> Duarte, who cannot succeed himself and whose Christian Democratic Party is  trailing badly in opinion polls, has said the election could be set back to  April 30, but neither Arena, as the right-wing party is called, nor the FMLN  accepted that proposal.  </P> <P> The latest guerrilla initiative is in line with a continuing effort to avoid  being labeled as the party that wrecked an opportunity to end the fighting that  has claimed at least 45,000 lives in nine years.  </P> <P> A European diplomat said that a senior rebel leader had told him that the  rebels were engaging in a "stunt" from the beginning. And, in fact, the FMLN's  motives have been viewed with cynicism since they opened the current "peace  process" Jan. 23 with a proposal to participate in and accept the outcome of  the election, if the balloting was put off until Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the FMLN has refused to let the initiative die with the  government's having the last word.  </P> <P> The diplomat said that contacts have already been made between Arena and the  FMLN to hold talks after the election and that Arena has considered offering  government positions to political allies of the rebels, either to improve the  atmosphere or divide the left.  </P> <P> Saturday's rebel proposal for another meeting date was made against the  backdrop of ambiguous statements by rebel spokesman Samayoa in Mexico City, who  said that he had given up all but the slightest hope for a postponement.  </P> <P> He said that even if the voting goes ahead March 19 as now scheduled, the  rebels will not violently disrupt it unless there are "very exceptional  conditions." Such "conditions" presumably would include a government effort to  impede the campaign of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of leftist  parties allied with the FMLN that is running in the election.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Radio Venceremos urged its listeners to boycott the voting  or cast invalid ballots because "the election of March 19 will only aggravate  hunger and misery, as it holds out no hope of a real solution."  </P> <P> Samayoa accused the United States of manipulating President Duarte and the  Arena party to try to make the FMLN appear to be the villain despite what he  said were determined FMLN efforts to be conciliatory. "We have reduced to  almost zero the rhetoric and public confrontation with the United States," he  said. "We understood this as a clear signal that we were looking for an  understanding."  </P> <P> That was an apparent reference to the distribution of key rebel proposals to  officials and politicians in Washington for comment before they were publicly  disclosed.  </P> <P> "The United States was worried because the FMLN had too much political  initiative in El Salvador and internationally," Samayoa said. "They are trying  to neutralize this support and political initiative."  </P> <P> He rejected the notion that talks could be restarted after the election. "What  would talks continue for? So that we accept the government and hand over our  arms? That is not going to happen."  </P> <P> However, he acknowledged that during the Feb. 21 discussions in Mexico, "Arena  began talking about dialogue" after the election.  </P> <P> Kenneth Freed reported from San Salvador and Marjorie Miller from Mexico City.  </P></p>

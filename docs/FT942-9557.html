			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: A child of the sixties celebrates a birthday - Lucia van der Post on Habitat, 30 years old this week In 1964, when Habitat was born, I was a young mother in London, wheeling a great high-sprung pram up and down the King's Road from World's End, where we lived, to Peter Jones, Sloane Square, where I went in search of a carpet or a lampshade or a chair that I liked and could afford. I was almost always disappointed. I had four floors of a terraced house to furnish and little money or experience. Finding few things that I could bear to bring across the threshold, I began to think I had very peculiar tastes. Certainly that was how many shopkeepers of the day treated me, implying that anyone who stocked the kind of things they imagined I wanted would soon be out of business. My husband was completely nonplussed at how extraordinarily picky his young wife had turned out to be. The trickiest scenes took place in the linoleum department where the prevailing tastes of the day ran to bright renditions of shells, stones or ancient Greek mosaics. Then Habitat opened, on May 11, 1964. Oh, the relief. It was perfectly all right not to like fringed velvet three-piece suites, to want no truck with lampshades perched upon porcelain dolls, to prefer sturdy pale pine to Formica, to find visual repose in a simple white Japanese paper lantern, to prefer one's salad tossed in a hand-turned wooden bowl rather than a plastic one. It is almost impossible to convey to the post-Habitat generation just what the birth of that first shop meant to the young marrieds of the 1960s. The clarity and simplicity of the vision was stunning. Sir Terence Conran's avowed mission was to prove that 'functional can be beautiful, and beautiful must be affordable'. One design journalist was so carried away she felt 'as if she had died and gone to heaven'. It was much more than a shop - it offered the promise of a warmer, more sun-filled way of life. This week, Habitat was 30 years old and celebrated its birthday by offering a small selection of goods stocked by the original shop at the original prices - Japanese rush bugs at 18p, director's chairs at Pounds 5 each, six Paris glasses for 75p, bentwood chairs for Pounds 6.50. All these things are marvellous illustrations of the longevity of what we have come to call good design. The director's chair, the bentwood chair, the paper lanterns, the plain linen, the rush or willow ware, the simple wooden products - all have much the same timeless air as, say, an 18th century piece of Wedgwood creamware, a piece of Shaker furniture, French bistro pottery, 17th century English silverware. All of them should go on looking good for years to come. Tasteful, attractive, functional things, Habitat proved, did not have to come with fancy price tags. We still have at home, doing sterling service, some of the items we bought all those years ago - a couple of red Magistretti rush-seated chairs, white painted bentwood chairs, a black-stained ash desk top on trestles, storage units and countless earthenware casseroles, white porcelain pots a la creme, white souffle dishes. I am as pleased with them now as I was then. If you look at Habitat today, it is good to see that Vittorio Radice, the managing director, has kept to his avowed intention of taking Habitat back to where it all began. 'Sir Terence Conran,' he told me a couple of years ago, 'had a wonderful concept and as long as he kept to it the stores flourished. They were all in beautiful buildings that were special to their towns. It was only when he took his eye off the ball and they took Habitat into huge sheds in edge of town sites that the merchandise deteriorated and the image became seriously damaged.' The 1980s Shabitat jokes began. Look through a current catalogue - or better still, visit one of the stores  -and you will see the original concept is alive and strong. The stores today are light, bright airy places, just as I remember that first store in the Fulham Road. It has grown up a bit, in that the sofas look plumper, softer, more welcoming. The textiles reflect our modern preoccupation with the earthy and the natural. There is some lovely appliqued bed linen and plenty of the attractive rushware that brought in the original customers - look for rattan dining chairs, for storage chests, for tumbler covers, for picnic baskets and a wonderful reclining chaise-longue for just Pounds 149. There is, as always, a touch of the ethnic - galvanised iron baskets and lanterns, an Edo paper lantern, a Dakari tray table from India. Having run out of new cuisines to introduce us to (remember the tagine, the wok, the pasta-maker?) kitchenware has reverted primarily to the simple and the classic with the occasional exuberant burst of hand-painted Italian ceramics. In the Habitat of today you can find most of the basic ingredients a young household needs. It has once again become a place that the design world feels it needs to watch. David Davies, the designer responsible for some of the most interesting retailing projects around, firmly believes that today it is one of the best home furnishing stores in the world. He says: 'I travel a lot and I do not know of one to beat it for the mix of products, the incredible style and the very affordable prices. The textiles, the cushions, the throws, the fabrics are exceptionally well-priced and so is the furniture. Where else can you buy a really good chair for Pounds 49? My office is full of them.' The 1980s' jokes are drying up.</p>

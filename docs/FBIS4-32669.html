			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>   [Excerpt] In Velika Kladusa, Fikret Abdic's paramilitary  continues terrorizing people and carrying out mass arrests. The  latest news says: Three imams and some 10 hajjis have been  arrested or taken to camps. Currently, altogether there are  approximately 1,700 opponents to the forcefully proclaimed  autonomy who are being held in Abdic's prisons and camps. There  are even children as young as seven in the camps. We learned  this in Zagreb today from a former prisoner who was detained in  the (?Drnovi) camp.    Abdic's supporters are also arresting the deputies of the  Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly from the Bihac district and the  members of their families. Deputy Hazim Muric and his father  are imprisoned, and so is Ejup Alagic, president of the Velika  Kladusa communal assembly, and his entire family -- a wife and  two children. A father and a sister of Murija (?Mirkovic),  deputy in the Chamber of Citizens of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly, have also been detained. Deputy (?Ivkovic) has  confirmed this himself. There is a reign of terror and mass  arrests in Kladusa. The people are being imprisoned in one of  the following four camps -- Drmeljevo, (?Bavionica), [word  indistinct], and (?Vrnograd).

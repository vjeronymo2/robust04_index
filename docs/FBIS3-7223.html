			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshiaki Ito; from MAINICHI SHIMBUN 24 March Evening </F> Edition]    [Text] Geneva, 23 Mar -- At a regular meeting of the GATT  board of directors on 23 March, Japan expressed grave concern  over the reinstatement of the Super 301 provision of the U.S.  Trade and Competitiveness Act (which imposes sanctions on  nations engaging in unfair trade practices). Other  participants, including the European Union (EU), supported  Japan's stance.    At the end of the meeting, the Japanese representative  expressed serious concern over the 3 March U.S. decision to  revive the Super 301 provision, saying: "The U.S. Government's  retaliatory measures against Japan run counter to agreements  under GATT's new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay  Round)."    In response, the U.S. representative stated: "This measure  is not based on protectionism but is perfectly compatible with  GATT articles." However, South Korea urged the United States to  immediately abolish the Super 301 provision. Moreover, the EU,  Argentina, Australia, and Hong Kong expressed their support for  Japan's stance, and urged the U.S. Government to reconsider its  decision. It can be said the U.S. Government was subjected to  much criticism.</p>

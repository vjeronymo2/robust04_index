			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Old-style chief to shape new Ukraine: A PM groomed in the engine of Stalin's industry FOR FIVE years Mr Leonid Kuchma has grappled with the mammoth task of converting the world's largest missile factory to civilian production. This week, he accepted an even more daunting challenge. As Ukraine's new prime minister, the energetic, 54-year-old engineer now has the job of converting the faltering, state-dominated economy of Ukraine, the second largest republic of the former Soviet Union, to the market. In his 32-year career at Pivdennyi Mashynobudivnyi Zavod, birthplace of the infamous SS strategic missile, Mr Kuchma proved an excellent manager of an old-style Soviet factory. But the very skill which allowed him to churn out the 'Black Joe' missiles which raised goose bumps in the Pentagon may prove a liability in his task of integrating a country the size of France into the world economy. With his own experience at the receiving end of government largesse, Mr Kuchma is expected to be sympathetic to the demands of Ukrainian factory managers, even if the cost is more inflation and a further expansion of the budget deficit. Located in the south-eastern Donbass region, the engine of Stalin's rapid industrialisation and Leonid Brezhnev's birthplace, Pivdenmash was the gleaming, marble pride of the Soviet military industrial complex with privileged access to raw materials for its assembly line and luxury goods for its workers. But Ukraine's declaration of independence last December and pledge to renounce nuclear weapons left the factory facing an awful dilemma. Unlike most former Soviet factories, Pivdenmash makes a world class product, but it has no buyer: Ukraine does not need missiles and the west is reluctant to admit newcomers into the lucrative aerospace market. The factory has made a half-hearted stab at conversion, transforming the heat chambers for rocket boosters into mobile, high-speed rose petal dryers and the rocket towers into grain silos. But it survives thanks to the generous subsidies paid by a government determined to preserve the Ukrainian space industry as a point of national pride. This personal experience was echoed in Mr Kuchma's brief policy statement in which he called for 'evolutionary reforms', a special 'Ukrainian model' of change and continued government control over the economy. All indications are that the resignation last month of Mr Vitold Fokin, independent Ukraine's first prime minister, and Mr Kuchma's subsequent appointment represent, as one Ukrainian reformer put it, the triumph of the industrial elite over the Communist party functionaries. Although on paper the Ukrainian government is committed to a muddled privatisation plan and a balanced budget, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president, has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine will not apply 'shock therapy'. In practice this has meant the rejection of calls from the Ukrainian central bank for the sort of tight monetary policy pioneered in Poland and foot dragging over privatisation. Instead, Ukraine's ex-communist functionaries have sought to keep the 96 per cent state-owned economic machine chugging along through the frantic addition of lubricating government credit. Between January and August industrial production declined by 10 per cent compared with the same months last year. But the cabinet predicts that the decline will slow to 8 per cent by the end of the year and forecasts actual economic growth of 0.5 per cent in July compared with the previous year. At the same time, average consumer prices have jumped by 720 per cent compared with December 1991 and wages by 430 per cent. Professor Oleksander Savchenko, a leading Ukrainian economist and former deputy head of the central bank, estimates that inflation is running at between 30-40 per cent a month and warns of hyper-inflation by the end of the year. The culprit, in Prof Savchenko's view is a ballooning budget deficit which he estimates at 20 per cent of gross national product. These problems are largely the result of the government's habit of solving economic grievances through enormous, one-off subsidies. For example, when farmers' criticisms of the government reached a fever pitch in June, Kiev appeased them by doubling overnight the savings accounts of Ukraine's collective farms. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde last week, Mr Kravchuk insisted there was no crisis. The man who has won a place in Ukrainian history books and in the hearts of Ukrainian nationalists by winning independence after more than three centuries of Russian domination took solace in what is becoming Ukraine's favourite consolation. 'Believe me, today things are going badly everywhere and Russia is no exception. Even in Moscow the former head of the executive of the city government told me that some people are beginning to die of hunger. That is not happening here.'</p>

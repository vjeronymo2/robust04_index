Austria's membership, says EUMETSAT in a 22 March  communique,  assures it of access to all data from the Meteosat satellites  and offers it new opportunities for international cooperation in  its national scientific programs.    Austria, which since 1987 has participated as an observer in  meetings of the EUMETSAT council (founded in 1986), has a  National Space Studies Center, research institutes, and many  companies active in the space domain.</p>

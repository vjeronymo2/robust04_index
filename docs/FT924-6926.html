			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Sapin wants to broaden EMS links THE European Community should increase its monetary co-operation with neighbouring countries which have applied to join it in order to promote stability and growth, Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Sapin, who remarked that President Francois Mitterrand had shifted in favour of EC enlargement in reaction to Denmark's vote last June against Maastricht, gave no details of what kind of monetary co-operation he envisaged with the possible new Community members - Austria, Sweden, Finland,Switzerland and Norway. But he said: 'There is a whole range of possibilities between being totally out (of the EMS) and totally in.' Some countries such as Sweden have wanted to go beyond pegging their currencies to the Ecu and negotiating bilateral credit swaps with individual EC central banks, and have asked for formal associate status in the European Monetary System. But they were told this was not possible for non-EC members. Mr Sapin said creating closer monetary co-operation with EC applicant countries would 'just involve doing now what we would have to do later anyway'. In contrast to the opening of formal enlargement negotiations, such monetary co-operation would not depend on ratification of the Maastricht treaty, because the EMS is 'only an arrangement between central banks'. The minister also said that while he saw no need for any fundamental reform of the EMS, the fact that foreign exchange markets lacked the sort of rules which existed in bond, equity and futures trading should be examined at a wider, international level. France has asked the Group of 10 countries to study the issue. Mr Sapin also rejected suggestions that France had stifled discussion of possible realignments of EMS parities, and in particular that Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French Tresor director who is chairman of the EC Monetary Committee, had failed to pass on to the British a German suggestion that the pound might be devalued. He said Mr Trichet had loyally served both French and EC institutions, adding: 'The British and Germans should not try to settle their differences on the back of a third party.' 'In fact,' Mr Sapin claimed, 'I had warned my (EC) colleagues in the weeks preceding the French referendum on Maastricht that the result would be very tight, and that they should take care their monetary policies were correct, because we don't want a big spectacular bust-up.' In general, he said he continued to regard the EMS as a system of fixed but adjustable rates. The lesson of the September crisis was that monetary authorities should take stock, more regularly and more candidly, of possible divergences between their currencies. Mr Sapin now considered the French franc to be in 'a fixed system', particularly with regard to the D-Mark, given that France had a lower deficit and inflation than Germany. This had helped France win the 'battle of the franc' in September, as had also the 'very good co-operation' of the Bundesbank. The EMS would withstand the unlikely event of the Maastricht treaty not being fully ratified, Mr Sapin said. But he stressed that he did not want to go ahead with a smaller monetary union with Germany and the Benelux countries. 'It is in all our interests that the zone of monetary stability is as wide as possible.'</p>

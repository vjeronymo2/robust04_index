			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: ISS may seek New York listing ISS, the Danish cleaning and building maintenance group, may seek a Wall Street listing following its Dollars 93.5m acquisition of National Cleaning of the US. Mr Poul Andreassen, chief executive, said the acquisition would turn ISS into one of the biggest foreign employers in the US, with some 50,000 on the payroll out of ISS' worldwide total of almost 140,000. ISS is buying National Cleaning from the Nu-Swift group of the UK. It will merge the group with its existing North American business. The acquisition will increase group sales in the current year by 15 to 20 per and pre-tax profits by some 10 per cent. Group sales last year totalled DKr11.35bn (Dollars 1.85bn) and profit was DKr377m. The purchase is being financed with bank borrowings, which Mr Andreassen described as 'not expensive' in the US, where bank interest rates stand at 4 per cent. The reason for considering a New York Stock Exchange listing was to give the group an American presence in the equity market, Mr Andreassen said. He added that ISS had no immediate plans to raise new funds on Wall Street. The group's shares are currently listed in Copenhagen and London. National Cleaning Group has about 20,000 employees in the US and sales of about Dollars 490m. The deal, which will take ISS's North American sales to Dollars 950m, would give the group a leading position in the US cleaning market and the market for the maintenance of technical installations in buildings, ISS said.</p>

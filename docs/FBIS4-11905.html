			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister of Health Dr. Umid Midhat Mubarak returned  to Baghdad today after attending meetings of the Arab health  ministers' council, which convened in Cairo on 30 March.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said  that the Iraqi delegation was held in high esteem by most  conferees, who demanded that the unfair embargo clamped on the  lofty Iraqi people be lifted, particularly since this embargo  has claimed the lives of thousands of children, women, and  elderly due to acute food and medicine shortages.    The minister noted that he held a private meeting with Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. During the  meeting, the actual reasons for maintaining the unfair anti-Iraq  embargo were addressed. The minister explained that the Arab  League secretary general demonstrated special concern for this  issue, and urged all Arab League offices in the world to clarify  the relevant facts to the world public to aid efforts to lift  the unfair embargo clamped on the Iraqi people.    The minister also indicated that he held other meetings with  the heads of most delegations attending the meetings. He noted  that he discussed with them bilateral ties and means of  promoting them, especially in the area of health. The minister  also met with Regional WHO Director Dr. Husayn al-Jaza'iri.    The conferees attending the Cairo meeting discussed the  enhancement of health cooperation among the Arab health  agencies, as well as other issues to promote the Arab health  endeavor.</p>

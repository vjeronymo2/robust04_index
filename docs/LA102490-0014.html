			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DEFENDANT'S PLEA FREES JURORS WHO WERE ROUNDED UP OFF THE STREETS  </P> <P> About a dozen citizens who were hastily ushered into Van Nuys Municipal Court  last Friday evening and pressed into impromptu jury duty were given unexpected  court instructions Tuesday -- an order to go home.  </P> <P> "I have good news for you. You're all discharged from the case," Van Nuys  Municipal Judge Kenneth Lee Chotiner told the panel after the man facing trial  pleaded guilty to the charges against him.  </P> <P> Jurors, who earlier had jokingly chanted the slogan "Free the Chotiner 12,"  filed out of court in seemingly good spirits.  </P> <P> "I think it was a worthwhile experience," said Mike Mewlon, 45, an executive  with a Van Nuys construction company, who added that jurors should be selected  this way more often because it is efficient.  </P> <P> Pam McGuiggan, a phone company saleswoman from Van Nuys, said she didn't mind  being pressed into jury service even though it made her late for a Bible study  class and her boss docked her two days pay for missing work.  </P> <P> "We were needed," said McGuiggan, who was withdrawing money from a bank teller  machine on Van Nuys Boulevard when a marshal ushered her into court.  </P> <P> "You don't know how much I appreciate how well you've taken this," said  Chotiner, who ordered the juror roundup so he would not have to dismiss  misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace charges against Steven Dean  Beaudry, 35, of North Hollywood. Beaudry was accused of throwing beer on a  Dodger Stadium security guard Aug. 9.  </P> <P> Courthouse jurors had all been sent home last Friday when Chotiner's clerk  called for a jury panel shortly after 4 p.m.  </P> <P> When Beaudry refused to have his trial postponed, Chotiner invoked an 1872 law  that allows judges to press citizens into jury service. Marshals gathered the  17 people from street corners and nearby buildings.  </P> <P> A handful of jurors were later dismissed.  </P> <P> Chotiner placed Beaudry on two years probation and sentenced him to 12 days in  jail, which he has already served.  </P></p>

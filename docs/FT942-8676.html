			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / JP Morgan set to salvage Banesto stake JP Morgan, the US bank embroiled in controversy over its involvement with Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), is close to reaching a deal that would allow it to rebuild its equity stake in the Spanish bank cheaply. Morgan's Corsair investment fund, which has threatened to sue Banesto, is to be offered an extra Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) stake in Banesto by its new owner Banco Santander at a price of about Pta830 a share, compared with yesterday's price of Pta1,125. The deal would give Corsair options to restore its stake to near its original 7.9 per cent. Corsair's Dollars 162m investment was heavily diluted by the Banesto refinancing which gave Santander control. The deal is seen by Morgan executives as a chance to repair some of the damage done to its reputation by Banesto. Morgan acted as adviser to Banesto's former management as well as selecting the bank as an investment for Corsair. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, Morgan's chairman, was involved in talks with the Bank of Spain and Santander. Morgan told the Bank that it might sue Banesto over its alleged failure to give Corsair a true picture of its financial state. Morgan has placed itself in an awkward position because it chose Banesto as the first investment for the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, in which it holds 10 per cent. In the refinancing, Santander acquired 60.2 per cent of Banesto for Pta281bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, is thought to have wanted to give Morgan a chance to regain some value from its involvement in Banesto because the US bank has faced severe criticism over its apparent lapse of judgment. However, Santander is also likely to present the deal as evidence that it did not over-pay for Banesto. It bid Pta762 per share in the auction last month, considerably more than its rivals, and its shares initially fell. The exact price of Dollars 40m placing, and the terms and pricing of the share options, have yet to be settled. An announcement is expected within two weeks. In return for the stake and options, Morgan would abandon any claim against the Bank of Spain and the country's deposit guarantee fund, which would be liable to pay compensation for any breach in Corsair's investment agreement. Corsair investors which bought separate stakes in Banesto, including General Electric Pension Trust, are likely to be offered options by Santander. Santander has already placed shares with others including Royal Bank of Scotland. Morgan and Santander both declined to comment on details of discussions yesterday. However, Morgan said it was considering a further investment in Banesto on behalf of Corsair, and had been 'exploring legal alternatives'.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Serious Money): Welcome to a brighter Weekend The launch of Weekend Money as a separate section allows us to offer readers two complementary services: an extended review of the financial highlights of the past week, and a more consistent analysis of investment and savings. Both services are bolstered by many more statistics and charts. This page summarises the main financial stories of the past week, and it pulls together the financial indicators of most use for personal investors. Market Week helps you check developments in the main UK and overseas stock markets. FT-SE winners and losers picks out companies on the move - big, medium and small - and the leading and lagging stock market sectors. If you have a portfolio of individual shares, you can - as always - find their prices in the London Share Service at the back of the main newspaper. But our new tables then help you to check your shares' performance against other companies of a similar size: if it is a blue chip, check it against the Footsie 100 index; if it is a small company, the FT-SE Small Cap or Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index are better yardsticks. Our list of popular shares shows the latest price movements and allows you to calculate your profit (or loss) since the original launch. People's financial needs and interests change during their lifetime. So, we have tried to make it easy for you to find the topics relevant to you, now, by signposting the different subjects clearly. Our main categories are Markets, Companies, Investing for Growth, Investing for Income, Saving and Borrowing, and Financial Planning. If you want more detail on the latest developments in the main stock markets, turn to Page 2 where we analyse both London and Wall Street every week. We will also be highlighting one other market or sector in the news. This week, for example, we weigh up oil shares in the light of this week's go-ahead for the new Foinaven oilfield, west of Shetland. And the American investment guru, John Train, is the first expert in our new guest column, 'In the Pink'. We are expanding substantially our analysis of UK company news (pages 4-6), with regular coverage of bids, coming results, and new issues. And each week  -in 'Pick of Lex' - we will be reproducing a handful of company analyses which have appeared in the influential Lex column during the week. Many types of investment can be used both to secure capital growth and to provide an income to live on. But investors need to be clear whether they are aiming for growth or income. So, we are dividing our investment pages by objective rather than type of investment. Shares, unit trusts and investment trusts can all fall under the growth tag (Page 6), depending on their individual characteristics. Far Eastern stock markets or small companies, for instance, appeal mainly to growth investors and offer a negligible current income. Fringe 'investments' such as gold bullion or art are patently suitable only for growth investors, since they offer no income. Many people think instinctively of bank and building society deposits when the word 'income' is mentioned. But the range of income-producing investments is far wider. On Page 7 we list the main types and will be discussing them in more detail in future weeks. We are also publishing regular tables of gilts suitable for different types of taxpayer, and prices of building society permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). Our existing table of the best deposit rates caters for the most cautious type of income investors - savers. From this week, we are complementing it with another table showing the best borrowing rates, including mortgages, personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards. Financial planning is an enormous subject, and our financial planning page (9) will range from basic investment and tax planning, to pensions, annuities and employee share schemes. Briefcase (on Page 8) will continue to answer readers' problems. Our new unit and investment trust statistics (Page 10) allow you to check the performance of your units and investment trust shares against the best of those in the same sector. We have ranked the funds on their performance over the past three years. Other yardsticks include yield, and volatility - a measure which gives you an indication of how risky a fund is. Do remember, though, that performance figures are of historic interest only: they are not predictions of future performance, let alone recommendations. Last - but just as important - we hope you find Weekend Money enjoyable as well as useful. Making the most of your assets can be fun.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE OF LITHUANIA  </P> <P> Reading the article "Vilnius: An Exodus From Rebirth" (July 9), I was surprised  that writer Esther Schrader did not mention that Vilnius was not always the  capital of Lithuania.  </P> <P> Between 1919 and 1939, Vilnius was a Polish City called Vilno. The capital of  Lithuania was Kaunas.  </P> <P> The Lithuanians worked very closely with the German occupation forces (after  1939) and were always in assistance when a ghetto in Poland was eliminated. No  wonder the Jews are leaving Vilnius. They do not trust the Lithuanians.  </P> <P> BENNO FISCHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

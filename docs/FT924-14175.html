			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Fraud alleged in Cameroon elections CAMEROON'S main opposition leader alleged widespread fraud in yesterday's first multi-candidate presidential election, but said he still expected to win, Reuter reports from Yaounde. President Paul Biya's strongest challenger, Mr John Fru Ndi, claimed the government had stuffed ballot boxes, altered electoral lists and distributed inadequate ballot papers for the opposition. The government-controlled radio did not report fraud but serious organisational problems were observed at polling stations in the capital, Yaounde, the northern city of Garoua and some other centres. Numerous problems with electoral lists and ballot papers delayed the start of voting. The second main opposition candidate, Mr Bello Bouba Maigari, said the voting had been 'badly organised'. A prominent member of Mr Biya's ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) described the organisation in Garoua as perfect. Reports that the Douala-based opposition politician, Mr Jean-Jacques Ekindi, had withdrawn from the race, reducing the number of candidates to five, were denied. But Mr Ekindi's ballot papers were not distributed in several Douala polling stations.</p>

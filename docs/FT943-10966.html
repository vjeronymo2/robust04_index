			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: NatWest seeks to excite City - The bank hopes its results will ignite its shares When National Westminster Bank announces interim results this morning, its directors will hope they bring about a change of mood. Despite a strong recovery in earnings and a general respect for its management, the bank has struggled without much success to excite the stock market. The frustrations of its share price having lagged behind Barclays since its rival appointed Mr Martin Taylor as chief executive show. 'We have done the revolutionary things Martin Taylor talks about, the things no-one is supposed to have done before,' says Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive. Apart from being perceived as a less dramatic recovery story than Barclays, NatWest has suffered from a relatively meagre 6 per cent dividend increase last year. This compared poorly with banks such as Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland which had stronger capital ratios, and paid more. It contributed to a 24 per cent fall in its share price in the year to mid-July. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, nonetheless defends the logic of the decision. 'It did not go down very well, but as someone said at the time, that said more about the market than (about) what we did.' The signs are that NatWest will attempt to reassure the market this morning with a bigger rise. Lord Alexander told the annual meeting that bad debt provisions were falling faster than expected, and that uncertainty over provisions was one reason for previous caution. 'Our general philosophy is that the dividend sends a signal for the future in terms of confidence, but we also believe it should be firmly covered,' he says. The dividend was 1.9 times covered at the full year, but was not cut during the bank's worst year of 1991, and was uncovered for three years. One difficulty facing NatWest is that its capital ratios - especially the tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted - are lower than other banks. Its tier 1 ratio at the year-end was 5.7 per cent - well above the Basle minimum of 4 per cent but below the 6 per cent seen by analysts as a benchmark. Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer, has argued strongly that there are dangers in banks holding too much capital. Yet investor sentiment could be improved by NatWest breaking the 6 per cent barrier, something that it seems likely to have achieved in the first half. There are two broader challenges for NatWest. The first is to demonstrate that the bank's directors can both run existing operations well and make wise acquisitions. The second is to show that its mix of businesses is well-balanced and has growth potential amid growing competition. It has an initial advantage in having a new layer of senior managers who are respected by analysts. But, as Lord Alexander admits, the achievement of clearing up past mistakes in the US and Australia and bringing down bad debts in the UK does not mean they are instinctively trusted in all decisions. 'We have to establish credibility not just now, but at all stages in the economic cycle,' says Lord Alexander. The bank experienced scepticism recently when it paid Dollars 300m - or 2.4 times book value - for Central Jersey Bancorp, to reinforce NatWest Bancorp, its US retail bank. Some analysts question whether it would have been better to buy before the price rose. Mr Goeltz says they are missing the point. 'Clearly, the best returns for shareholders two years ago came from clearing up Bancorp's existing problems rather than making new acquisitions,' he says. Mr Wanless stresses the rigour with which NatWest's group executive reviews such proposed acquisitions. 'We had a US bank in a poor state which we have turned around. We know we can take 35 or 40 per cent of the costs of Central Jersey out and double non-interest income,' he says. Lord Alexander argues that NatWest is now being 'run like a modern business and not - as was certainly the position - as a quasi-public institution'. Its directors cite decisions such as pulling out of retail banking operations in France as evidence that it is not afraid of painful decisions. The second challenge is to build a strong mix of operations which can withstand downturns in particular sectors, or the UK as a whole. 'UK retail banking is clearly a market where it is not going to be easy to operate in the short-term. There is a lot of competition here,' says Mr Wanless. The difficulty is to show that diverse operations such as NatWest Bancorp, Lombard, the finance house, Coutts, the private bank, and NatWest Markets, its investment bank, can not only meet the bank's target of 17.5 per cent post-tax return on equity, but make sense as a business together. Mr Wanless says there are obvious ways in which they fit. Lombard can offer leasing and discounting to small companies which are less willing to take bank loans; and the retail bank can sell medium-sized companies products developed by NatWest Markets such as currency and interest rate swaps. Less obviously, he says that the UK retail bank gains from the group owning a US retail arm which can experiment with new ideas in an innovative market. He cites a project run by NatWest Bancorp in which it is offering financial services through a cable television link in New Jersey. Yet the fact remains that investors are more likely to be convinced of NatWest's merits by a clear dividend signal this morning than by discussion of the bank's general strengths. However, it makes NatWest's directors feel a Martin Taylor premium in the share price may otherwise elude them.</p>

In his  interview with SELSKAYA ZHIZN he refuted allegations that the  joining of the rouble zone by Belarus is undermining its  sovereignty, or that this decision means a kind of charity on  the part of Russia. "In this case those European politicians who  are working for the introduction of a common instrument of  payment for europe are bad patriots either," Kebich stressed.    In his opinion, the root cause of Gaydar's resignation is  much deeper than the problem of signing an agreement on the  unification of monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. "In  general terms, it could be described as the difference in views  between the prime minister and the deputy prime minister over  the way the reform should be developed," he said.    The rouble zone will not mean a political and economic  alliance, it will be nothing but a common financial and monetary  system. According to Kebich, "in conditions of a common monetary  system, Belarus will have a chance to follow its own path. The  same is true of Russia. We have complete understanding on that  matter with Russian leaders."</p>

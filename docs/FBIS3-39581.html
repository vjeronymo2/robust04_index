			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pope Receives First Israeli </F> `Ambassador'"]    [Text] Vatican City, 10 Feb (ANSA) -- Pope John Paul II  today granted a private audience to Shmuel Hadas [name as  received], the first "special representative of the State of  Israel to the Holy See." Hadas, who has the rank but not the  recognition of ambassador, is the first Israeli diplomat  accredited to the Holy See and his appointment is the result of  the agreement last December 30 for mutual recognition, but not  yet full official, diplomatic relations.    The visit by the Israeli diplomat, observers pointed out,  was  one of courtesy given that he has yet to present letters of  accreditation. This, they added, explained why there were not  official addresses and official Vatican sources did not comment  on the event.    Born in Argentina of Polish parents, in 1931, Shmuel Hadas  is  married with two children. He emigrated to Israel in 1954 and  has held diplomatic posts in Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and  Spain. He has also represented Israel at several international  forums, included the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    In related developments today, the official Vatican  spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, voiced satisfaction for the latest  positive developments in the negotiations between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).    It is the position of the Holy See, he recalled, to favor,  in  the Middle East as elsewhere else in the world, negotiations  which lead to solutions which respect the rights of men and  peoples, including Israel's right to security and the right of  Palestinians for a state.</p>

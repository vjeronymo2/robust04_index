			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan-U.S. relations are at a standstill with the  rupture of the bilateral economic framework talks at the  February summit talks. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called  the bilateral relations a "mature relationship." However,  according to the results of a public opinion poll conducted by  MAINICHI SHIMBUN, together with a survey on the economic  situation and the employment issue, about 30 percent of  respondents, who are top corporate executives, thought the  current Japan-U.S. relations are in a "serious" situation. The  other 70 percent also expressed their anxieties, saying "they  are rather concerned about the situation."    Moves for preventing trade frictions, such as the settlement  of the mobile phone issue, and the automakers' voluntary plans  to expand procurement of foreign-made auto parts, have been made  one after another. The cabinet also approved in late March the  "outline of external economic policy reforms" as measures to  promote deregulation and market opening. Yet, only one  executive answered "Japan-U.S. relationship will improve"  through this outline, while 90 percent expressed disappointment,  saying: "It will not change." Three respondents even said "it  will worsen."    In answer to a question on measures Japan should take  (multiple-choice answer), about 90 percent of those polled cited  the implementation of "large-scale relaxation and abolition of  regulations." About 70 percent pointed out the need for  "extensive market opening." With regard to expanding domestic  demand, 50 percent sought "large-scale tax reduction," and 30  percent, "further increase in public investment." While the  majority tended to rely on the government to take some measures,  about 20 percent pointed out the need for "cooperation at the  private-sector level." Only one respondent answered there was  no other choice but "to accept the numerical targets" which  caused the rupture of the economic framework talks.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET COMMUNISTS CEDE CONTROL OVER MOST TOP JOBS;  </P> <P> REFORMS: TO SOME EXTENT, THE PARTY'S SELECTION POWER ALREADY HAD BEEN WRESTED  AWAY. THE SYSTEM IMPEDED PERESTROIKA.  </P> <P> In another sign of the Soviet Communist Party's waning influence and changing  political role, its leadership on Wednesday abandoned the so-called  nomenklatura system, which empowered Communists to control virtually every  important job in the country.  </P> <P> The nomenklatura system was a key element of the party's power monopoly, now  being dismantled under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It had given the party  the right to choose, in secret, who would occupy perhaps 3 million key  positions nationwide.  </P> <P> Top government and armed forces posts were included, but so were those of  factory directors, labor union bosses and the managers of department stores.  Although never codified in law, the practice had given the Communist apparatus  fabulous power in all realms of society since the era of Soviet founder V. I.  Lenin, but the system impeded the reforms and new thinking now so keenly sought  by Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "A research institute director, the editor of a literary magazine, the head of  a trade department must by approved by the appropriate party committee," the  tabloid weekly Moscow News said this year. All too often, the person chosen was  selected not because of professional qualifications or accomplishments but  because of party ties or adherence to orthodox political views.  </P> <P> Non-party members could be named to some jobs but had no say in the selection  process. "The system is illicit in that it cannot be controlled or held  responsible," Moscow News complained. "A real dictatorship is not burdened by  any laws and is not accountable to anyone."  </P> <P> Heeding the new realities of Soviet political life, the Communist Party  Secretariat decided Wednesday to relinquish its veto power over top political  and economic jobs, although, to some degree, events already had wrested away  that power.  </P> <P> "It is considered expedient to abandon the nomenklatura posts of the CC CPSU  (Central Committee of the Communist Party)," declared the Secretariat, which  manages day-to-day party affairs. "From now on, only party workers, heads of  press organs, scientific agencies and institutions of learning subordinate to  the CC CPSU will be approved" by the Central Committee.  </P> <P> That leaves the party's policy-making Central Committee in charge of only those  positions that have party connections -- for example, the editorship of the  party's flagship daily newspaper Pravda.  </P> <P> Last October, under the aegis of Gorbachev, a high-level party commission  recommended that the party terminate the nomenklatura system in picking the  occupants of top jobs and allow instead "an influx of active campaigners for  perestroika (political and economic reform) from among Communists, non-party  members and members of all sectors of the population."  </P> <P> Wednesday's decision also represented a tacit recognition on the part of the  Moscow-based party apparatus that it has lost the power to impose its will  throughout what is becoming a fragmented society. Entire republics, from the  Russian Federation to Armenia, are now in the hands of non-Communists, and  their leaders, such as Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, refuse to obey party  decrees.  </P> <P> In many regions, the party machine continues to dominate local life, however,  and in those places the effect of the change will be problematic. The  Secretariat recommended that personnel policy in the 15 Soviet republics be  redefined by local party leaders to take into account "new conditions," but  that is no guarantee such a thing will happen.  </P> <P> The most important nomenklatura, or roster of jobs over which the party claimed  right of review, had long been filled by the party's supreme organs, such as  the Politburo and Secretariat. The positions include, among others, defense  minister and chairman of the KGB.  </P> <P> The national party congress this summer made it clear, however, that the center  of gravity in Soviet political life has shifted to the governmental  institutions established by Gorbachev, including his personal cabinet, the  Presidential Council.  </P></p>

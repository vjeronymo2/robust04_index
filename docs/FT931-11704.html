			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse leaves Indian tea trade in a stew - The price being paid for over-dependence on a single market NO OTHER single factor has done as much harm to the international marketing of Indian tea as the over-dependence on one single market, the erstwhile Soviet Union, which in 1991 took 104.5m kg out of total Indian export of 203m kg. Assured of such a big market, Indian exporters withdrew largely from several traditional markets, including the UK, and the vacuum was filled largely by Kenya, Sri Lanka and Malawi. But last year, India had to resort to aggressive marketing in the countries which it had earlier vacated, since Russia and the other CIS constituents bought only about 45m kg. In spite of the sharp setback in Russian purchases, India could ship more than 180m kg of tea in 1992. The Indian tea companies cannot, however, claim credit for the fairly high level of exports as this was facilitated to a great extent by a shortfall of more than 125m kg in world tea production. According to Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, director of McLeod Russel, while the Indian tea producers were happy selling bulk teas to the Soviets at 'artificially high rupee prices because of a skewed rupee rouble exchange rate', many other big tea importing countries got used to the 'light and bright Kenyan teas whose quality remain uniform throughout the season. The quality perception of tea drinkers has undergone a revolutionary change in many countries.' Assam tea, on the other hand, is thick and creamy and its quality does not remain uniform throughout the year. An international blender using Assam tea has, therefore, to maintain a high stock level. At the recent international tea convention in Delhi, some overseas delegates complained that India, which earlier could sell any tea in the Soviet Union, had neglected quality. Mr Krishna Kumar, managing director of Tata Tea, concedes that 'our manufacturing processes, both in the field and the factory were geared to offer a product-mix to a particular buyer which now require a complete review and redefinition'. Moreover, as the Indian tea industry made handsome profits, thanks to the Soviet buying, the tea company managers became complacent and the cost of production rose sharply. The government also did not feel shy about making tea the most taxed industry in the country. But with their profit margins now under severe pressure, the tea companies are desperately seeking tax relief. According to Mr Susim Mukul Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, the two principal challenges faced by the industry are 're-establishing itself in the markets where it has become near strangers and competing with the low cost producers who are attuned to the tastes prevalent in these markets.' India may be producing a lot of bad teas, but it also grows some of the finest in the world. Besides assurances about quality and competitive prices, international buyers, according to Mr Ahmad, want to be sure that India will remain a reliable supplier of tea in the long run. The doubt arises from the fact that the 540m-kg Indian domestic market is growing at an annual average rate of 3 per cent. The international buyers also have strong reservations about the export infrastructure, including documentation and shipping facilities available in India, which will have to be improved significantly to catch up with neighbouring Sri Lanka. There is a consensus in the industry that Indian tea production can be raised substantially by changing certain cultivation practices and raising the rate of replantation. While the average yield of tea in India is 1,761 kg a hectare, clones giving yields of more than 3,000 kg a hectare are now available. Mr Ahmad believes that Indian tea production by the turn of the century could be raised to 1,000m kg, which should leave an exportable surplus of at least 250m kg.</p>

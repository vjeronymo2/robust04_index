			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Europeans nearer to HDTV agreement EUROPEAN television manufacturers, broadcasters and satellite operators have indicated their willingness to develop high-definition television (HDTV) services in Europe, signing a joint declaration which the European Commission described yesterday as 'a major step' towards advanced TV services, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. But the different interest groups have yet to agree a legally-binding memorandum of understanding. Such a document would commit the industry to a firm strategy and is essential to the Commission's plan to develop HDTV. The companies will meet again in May to discuss a revised text.</p>

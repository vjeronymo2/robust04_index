			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / LDP flounders without its godfather: An unseemly contest without Kanemaru's guidance JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, facing the new experience of life in opposition, is feeling the loss of Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather, who held together bickering factions, coerced and coaxed opposition parties, and generally created order from the chaos of Japanese politics. Needed in the backroom, Mr Kanemaru was instead in a courtroom, defending himself against tax evasion charges and taking the rap for a corrupt political system. Had he been moving through the better bars of Tokyo's political district, the godfather would have calmed the fractious factions and prepared the LDP for a difficult week. In the next few days, the LDP must find a successor to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the party president, but the greatest loss for the old order lies in its inability to replace Mr Kanemaru. His resignation led to a split in the party's largest faction, which he controlled, then to a split in the LDP and, now, to the prospect of the party losing power. If seven opposition parties can put their many differences aside, they will be able to appoint the next prime minister and that will mean opposition for the LDP, which has ruled since 1955. The seven are still negotiating over policies and candidates. Members of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, were undecided yesterday, while another pro-reform party was having second thoughts. The selection of Mr Miyazawa as prime minister two years ago was simpler. Mr Kanemaru appointed him after having removed his blessing from Mr Toshiki Kaifu. For the past decade, Mr Kanemaru oversaw the queue for the leadership and cultivated the SDP, the largest opposition group, to ensure that controversial legislation would eventually be passed by parliament after a ritual show of outrage. Without the guidance of the godfather, the LDP's leadership race has become an unseemly rush. Two ailing elders, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, the justice minister, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the former foreign minister, are potential successors. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who heads the largest LDP faction, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, ex-finance minister, and Mr Kaifu are keen to take the job. Most of these candidates are unacceptable to younger LDP members, let alone to the coalition partner that the LDP must attract to ensure that it has the numbers next Monday when parliament is expected to vote in a new prime minister. At the July 18 election, the LDP won 223 of 511 seats, while the proposed coalition of seven parties took 243 seats, independents aside. In response to the unappetising array of LDP candidates, Mr Seiichi Ota, a 47-year-old LDP member, yesterday announced he would stand at a selection meeting on Friday or Saturday. His candidacy is way out of order in the LDP's strict hierarchical system, as Mr Ota has been re-elected only four times, compared with the nine times of Mr Miyazawa and the 10 times of Mr Watanabe. Mr Ota is typical of the pro-reform members who insulted their seniors late last week when party executives were called 'war criminals' for having failed to win a majority in the election and allowed the faction of Mr Hata, to become the Japan Renewal party. The remarkable conflict has been replayed many times on Japanese television. These younger members are crossing factional lines and are not prepared to wait patiently behind an executive which has not recognised that the party is on the brink of falling from office and lacks an organiser of Mr Kanemaru's calibre. The aspiring successor to Mr Kanemaru is Seiroku Kajiyama, a gruff, hustling politician who seems unable to win friends and influence people. Three years ago when he was justice minister, Mr Kajiyama toured a Tokyo red-light district three years ago, delivering unscripted jibes which were taken as insults by Asian women and Americans. On election night, Mr Kajiyama, 67, the LDP secretary-general, plotted the demise of Mr Miyazawa on national television, unware that his conversation was broadcast by microphones in front of him. He was confiding conspiratorially to Mr Koko Sato, 64, the LDP general council chairman, implicated in the Lockheed bribery scandal of the 1970s. These two share party power with a third executive, Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the policy research council. Mr Mitsuzuka's confidence has grown with the break-up of Mr Kanemaru's faction, which, through weight of numbers, was the LDP's anchor and gave the godfather his influence. There are now four LDP factions of relatively equal strength, all wanting an inordinate share of power, and unable to concentrate on the crucial nemawashi (literally, digging around the roots of a tree, the groundwork laying). Mr Kanemaru may be a symbol of all that is wrong with Japanese politics, but his shovel skills are unmatched.</p>

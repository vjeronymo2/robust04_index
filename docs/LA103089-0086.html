			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> $68 MILLION BID FOR FREE PRESS  </P> <P> An investor group has offered to buy the Detroit Free Press for $68 million as  lawyers prepared for oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case  involving a joint operating agreement with the Detroit News.  </P> <P> William D. McMaster, head of the Michigan Investor Group, made the bid to buy  the Free Press in a letter Sunday to James K. Batten, president of  Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the newspaper.  </P> <P> "The Michigan Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the Free Press, will  continue the 158-year-old Detroit Free Press as an ongoing enterprise and will  convert the editorial format to a 'statewide community newspaper,' " McMaster  said in a news release.  </P> <P> The owners of the two newspapers, Gannett Co. Inc. and Knight-Ridder, have said  the joint operating agreement would trigger layoffs and a price increase.  Knight-Ridder has said it will sell the Free Press or close it if the agreement  is denied.  </P></p>

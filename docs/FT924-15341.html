			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: World Bank commercial lending cue Sir, Michael Prowse's reflection on the worldwide cutbacks in overseas aid budgets ('The twilight of foreign aid', September 28) implies that commercial sources of finance are readily available to make good the shortfall in official funding for the developing countries. In fact, the decline in commercial lending has been so severe that, since the onslaught of the debt crisis 10 years ago, net flows of commercial capital with the developing countries have been negative. The reduction in official aid flows will create something of a dilemma for the World Bank, but there is more that it could do to promote lending from commercial sources. The bank's Expanded Cofinancing Operations (ECOs) do not go far enough to induce the commercial banks to participate, despite the latter's excellent repayment record.

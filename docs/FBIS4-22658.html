The treasury is faced  with deficits, the investment policy is not working, industrial  bankruptcies are on the increase, and the process of economic  recovery has been aborted. This state of affairs is partially  explained by absence of economic reforms, political instability,  and breakdown of commercial relations with the former Soviet  republics. In my view, however, the primary fault lies with  improper developmental and financial priorities. For example, in  1989 87 percent of Ukrainian farms made a profit of 30 percent  or better; in 1992 only a fourth of them did.    On the surface the problems appear insurmountable, but are  they really? The March 1993 currency emission of 1.2 billion  karbovantsi gave a 803 billion karbovantsi credit to the  agricultural sector. Unfortunately, the credit was squandered  across the board rather than directed at the remaining  productive collective, state and private farms that can still  show a profit.    Although the number of private farms in Ukraine has already  exceeded 25,000, the average size is only 15 hectares and most  are about two hectares. Obviously, such farms have a limited  profit potential and cannot make a serious contribution to the  national economy.    In his time Stolypin saw Ukrainian future as a land of 100  hectare farms. In the U.S. an average farm has 187 arable  hectares and in Germany 77. What can Ukraine accomplish with an  average of 15 hectares?    The fact that only a small percentage of the farms is  profitable need not be discouraging. This is the case in most  countries. In the U.S., for example, 52.4 percent of the farms  are weekend farms or farms that barely make a profit or operate  at a loss. The average income from such farms stands at $930 a  year. The real income is generated by the 13.9 percent highly  profitable farms that feed the nation and provide industry with  raw materials. In addition, the U.S. treasury makes more than  forty billion dollars a year from agricultural exports.    The following facts can be used to assess efficiency of our  farms. For example, in the Brusyliv Rayon of Zhytomyr Oblast  Volodymyr Stadchenko runs a very efficient farm consisting of 60  hectares of arable land. To feed the entire rayon, only two such  farms would be needed. The entire oblast could be fed by some 50  farms, and all of Ukraine by 1250. If we could but concentrate  our attention on some 5000 farms and provide them with full  financial support, young stock, high quality seeds, and the  latest in agrotechnology and education we could get rid of many  of our problems. I have the impression that the present minister  of agriculture is heading in this direction.    Concomitantly, Ukraine must restructure its credit-granting  and financial systems so as to enhance productivity and  production. Consider average wages: in Ukraine it comes to $7 a  month and in Germany $21.3 an hour. The hourly wages in France  are $15.2, in Italy $16.2, and then follow Portugal --$3.5,  South Korea -- $4.1, Singapore -- $3.7, Hong Kong -- $3.2, and  Poland -- $2.7. Prices of sugar, meat, butter, gas, gasoline,  electricity, housing and services have approached -- and in some  cases exceeded -- world prices, while our government has not  seen fit to increase wages. Frankly, the people feel that they  are merely the chattel of a bureaucratic-mafia cabal rather than  builders of an independent and sovereign Ukraine.    The majority of laws passed in Ukraine are unenforced and  exist only on paper. Issuance of housing, industrial and real  estate "Privatization Certificates" has been scheduled but not  implemented. What value will they have if they cannot be  purchased, sold, or transferred as a gift or inheritance? What  we need are certificates that have commercial value and can be  freely traded and exchanged to create funds in lieu of money.  Since they will be unsuitable for commercial transactions they  will be unlikely to affect productivity.    Ukraine needs a national currency, but its introduction is  beset with difficulties. Our economic problems, lack of gold  reserves, shortage of industrial goods, and of a stabilizing  fund in the amount of two billion dollars demands a novel  approach since we cannot wait until these roadblocks are  overcome. Further, I believe a national currency has to be  introduced in a stepwise manner to maintain its value.    Initially the hryvnya should be limited to certain sectors  of  the economy such as agriculture, gas and oil industry and  railways. The hryvnya should have been introduced at the time of  the 1993 harvest for gas and oil purchases, while the railway  industry should have been included because of its massive size  and stability. Thus, for a time two currencies would coexist: a  convertible hryvnya and free-floating kupon, with the hryvnya  establishing its own sphere of influence and stability. In 1993  the need for hryvnya was acute since we had to buy gasoline,  salt, oil, mineral fertilizers, etc. for world prices while the  price for hard wheat was set at 362-600,000 karbovantsi a tonne  -- or $60 at the old exchange rate -- while the world price was  $240.    How can we expect our farmers to sell their products to the  state at a quarter of the world price? And if they don't, will  we have to buy these products abroad? The first order of  business should be to instill in the farmers a sense of  confidence in Ukraine and the introduction of the hryvnya is a  step in the right direction.    Successful introduction of the hryvnya will also depend on  creating the right conditions for its support. One priority is  to reduce the size of the military establishment -- over a  million men in the army, navy, national guard, border guards,  security service and other formations -- which in proportion to  the general workforce exceeds that of any other country. Ukraine  has 2800 military airplanes while England has 1500, Germany  1350, Italy 840 and France 1550. Then there are thousands of  modern tanks, strategic missiles... What country has the economy  to support all this? A rational review of the military doctrine  should save us 500-700 million dollars.    A second priority is exporting grain, which in 1993 could  have earned us 450-500 million dollars.    A third priority would be to utilize the productive might of  the military-industrial complex in which a karbovanets-kupon  equals a dollar or, in some cases, five dollars. The income  derived from such sources could be on the order of two to three  billion dollars.    A fourth priority is the creation of a tax base to support  the hryvnya. All industrial sectors have to be taxed without  exception. For example, the metallurgical complex in Kryvyy Rih  has been working at 100 percent capacity since April 1993 and  its production has been on the increase as a result of the  industry getting tax relief. But 70 percent of the metal goes to  Russia and the profits are lodged in their banks, while the rest  of the Ukrainian industry lacks for metals and the Ukrainian  treasury doesn't get a penny from such "close relation." For  whose benefit does Kryvyy Rih complex pollute the environment  and deplete Ukraine's natural resources?    The fifth and last priority in setting our economy aright  has  to deal with rational use of our energy resources and raw  materials. No one yet has reimbursed the state for oil imported  in 1992. The oil just disappeared into various mafia-controlled  networks. What happened to the oil of the Black Sea fleet? Was  it paid for by the dismissal of the Ukrainian naval commander  Borys Korzhyn?    Finally, the economy will only improve if every aspect of  society and production -- land, capital, work, science,  technology, intellect, environment -- is recognized as having  monetary value.    Unless land is sold, work valuated, and the ecologic costs  of  oil pipelines and terminals computed, it will be impossible to  create a Ukrainian market economy.</p>

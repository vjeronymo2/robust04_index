			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Supreme Council statement: "The Supreme Council Has </F> Expressed a Lack of Confidence in the Socioeconomic and Legal  Policy of the Government and Called for a Dialogue Among All  Branches of Power"]    [Text] Recognizing the lack of an alternative to the course  toward deep reform of social relations, the state, and the  economy and expressing its readiness for constructive dialogue  with the president, the executive and judicial branches, and  social associations, wishing to reach a compromise and agreement  among the various political forces that reflect the social and  national interests of the citizens of the republic, and noting  that the government, by declaring a course toward a market  economy, is essentially blocking this, which has led to economic  chaos-- the Supreme Council shall adopt the following statement  as a basis for its immediate activity:  <H5>  I </H5>   The government was unable to develop a national program of  reforms which could become the basis for the consolidation of  society, which made it impossible to have constructive  interaction among the branches of power or to conduct an  integrated, logically complete legislative policy, as a result  of which the democratically elected Supreme Council, reflecting  the will of the majority of the voters as expressed by them at  numerous pre-election meetings, has been forced to express a  lack of confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policy of the  government.    In the given situation the only possibility of avoiding  complete paralysis of power is to have a constructive dialogue  among all of its branches as well as social and political forces  in order to create a national program of reforms and to form a  government capable of carrying it out.    Until the adoption of a coordinated program the Supreme  Council shall focus its attention on the following issues:    1. Consideration of the president's edicts adopted in the  absence of a legislative organ.    2. Execution of the budget and approval of the budget for  the  next fiscal period.    3. Performance of oversight functions.    4. International treaties subject to ratification.    5. Expansion and strengthening of international ties.    6. Consideration of laws adopted on the first reading by the  Supreme Council of the 12th convocation and returned by the  president for further discussion.  <H5>  II </H5>   The Supreme Council recognizes as a priority the task of  immediately providing the maximum possible social protection for  the population and making this protection more targeted and  effective.    The Supreme Council intends:    1. To undertake a number of legislative measures for staunch  support of commodity producers.    2. To legislatively limit the authority of the executive  power to dispose of state property.    3. To expand the independence of enterprises with all forms  of ownership.    These measures are needed exclusively to ease the  consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy,  to eliminate the unsystematic legislation which is ruinous to  the state, and to provide for stability of legislation in the  Republic of Kazakhstan.  <H5>  III </H5>   The Supreme Council expresses its hope in the possibility of  achieving accord among the branches of power and sociopolitical  forces.    The Supreme Council proposes getting started immediately on  consultations among representatives of the president, the  Supreme Council, other state organs, political parties, and  other social associations to work out conditions for working on  the coordinated reform program.    Adopted on 27 May 1994.</p>

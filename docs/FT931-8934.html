			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Criteria review at investor watchdog THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services, has appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of membership criteria. The appointment follows a letter in December to the PIA's board from Mr Andrew Large, Securities and Investments Board chairman, saying the PIA would not be approved as a self-regulatory body unless it raised standards of investor protection. Sir Brian is expected to seek a meeting with Mr Large to discuss SIB's requirements. The PIA board said it had asked Sir Brian for recommendations on how to assess the 'fitness and properness' of applicants, and on standards for members to meet and transitional arrangements to meet those standards. Sir Brian will also seek meetings with banks, building societies, unit trusts, life offices and representatives of the independent advisory sector. It is expected that he will complete his report to the PIA board by April or May. The move is seen as a sign that the retail financial services industry has taken seriously the threat that SIB might refuse to recognise the PIA. Some in the industry have urged the PIA board to resist Mr Large's demands - particularly the minimum capital requirement for members and the insistence that the PIA must vet all firms, even if they were previously members of another self-regulatory body.</p>

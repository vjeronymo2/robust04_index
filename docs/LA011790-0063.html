			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOVEALL BARRED FROM WESTLAKE GAME  </P> <P> Kevin Loveall of Newbury Park High, suspended last week for trying to punch a  Westlake player after a Marmonte League basketball game, will not be allowed to  compete in the Jan. 29 rematch between the schools, according to Newbury Park's  athletic director.  </P> <P> Loveall, a 6-foot-8 senior who averages 10.6 points and 11.2 rebounds a game,  was suspended from school for three days last week and sat out Newbury Park's  88-61 loss to Simi Valley on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Newbury Park Coach Greg Ropes had feared that Loveall would not be allowed to  play tonight in a home game against Camarillo, but Athletic Director Bill  Manzer gave him clearance. Loveall had returned to the team Friday.  </P> <P> During Newbury Park's 67-62 loss to Westlake on Jan. 8, Loveall was involved in  a shoving match with Westlake's Matt Weaver early in the fourth quarter that  resulted in Loveall's fifth personal foul and subsequent ejection. A videotape  of the game shows Loveall pushing Weaver and swinging at the 6-3 senior as  players were shaking hands after the game.  </P> <P> Westlake Coach Greg Hess said that Loveall should be allowed to play against  his team.  </P> <P> "He learned his lesson, so let the kid back on the court," Hess said. "Let him  play against us and prove he's a class act and give him a chance to beat us."  </P> <P> Ropes said he is pleased that the team's leading rebounder and third-leading  scorer can return to the lineup. Newbury Park will attempt to snap a six-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> "He practiced Friday and had a real good practice," Ropes said. "He'll be ready  to roll."JEFF RILEY  </P></p>

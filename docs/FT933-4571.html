			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PowerGen to raise interim by 18% POWERGEN, Britain's second largest electricity generation company, is to raise its interim dividend by 18 per cent - paving the way for another round of high pay-outs for shareholders in the sector. The increase, announced at yesterday's annual meeting, follows a series of above-average increases announced in the final year results of the sector two to three months ago. PowerGen's total dividend for last year was 13.5 per cent ahead of 1991-92s. Yesterday's announcement, which will take the interim dividend for the year ending April 3 1994 to 3.95p, led to a slight fall in PowerGen's shares initially. That reflected disappointment that PowerGen had not gone further following bullish statements on dividends three months ago. Its share price recovered to close  1/2 p down at 393 1/2 p after analysts cautioned that it would have been imprudent of the company to lift dividends too high during a review by the industry regulator on the generators' costs and margins. This is due to be completed by the end of the year. SG Warburg Securities left its forecast for the full year dividend at 12.5p, a rise of 19 per cent. Separately, Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, assumed the chairmanship of PowerGen yesterday in succession to Sir Graham Day. He said the management's control of costs and the renewal of coal contracts would lead to a 17 per cent real reduction in the price of electricity to the regional electricity companies over the next five years. The second of the company's three planned gas fired stations, at Rye House in Hertfordshire, would be commissioned shortly. It would open on time and within budget. The interim dividend will be payable on November 12.</p>

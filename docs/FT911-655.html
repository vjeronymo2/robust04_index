			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Institute of Economic Affairs Conference on Regulation: BT network charges backed by Oftel Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulatory authority, is unlikely to yield to complaints from potential new entrants into the industry that British Telecom being allowed to charge too much for enabling them to interconnect with its network. The issue of the price it will cost new competitors to inerconnect with BT's network is at the heart of the government's plans to open the telecommunications market to greater competition. Without access to BT's network to complement their own networks, new competitors will not be able to provide a comprehensive service. BT has said competitors should pay for interconnection to help the company cover the cost of installing and maintaining its network. Sir Bryan told an Institute of Economic Affairs conference on the future of regulation that he had received a large number of submissions on the issue. Many complained that the prices charged by BT would deter competitors from entering the market. Sir Bryan indicated that he would not compromise on the principle of charging for interconnection. Those objecting to the charge would have to show that it was fair for BT to carry the financial burden of the network while others did not, he said. He pointed out that Mercury Communications, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, already paid an interconnection charge, while cable television companies planning to operate local telecommunications services would be able to charge for interconnection with their local networks. Sir Bryan said that none of the details of the interconnection arrangements had been set in concrete. He would carefully study detailed suggestions over the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bols Wessanen slips 7.9% Bols Wessanen, the Dutch food and beverages group, blamed a downturn in its beverages activities for a 7.9 per cent decline in first-half net profit to Fl 110.2m (USDollars 63.0m), from Fl 119.6m a year earlier. It said the decline was partly due to poor weather during the second quarter in Italy. In the Netherlands its profits from spirits fell because of an increase in excise duties. Group turnover rose by 6.4 per cent to Fl 2.66bn, with most of the increase due to acquisitions, but operating profit fell by 3.6 per cent to Fl 66.8m. In spite of the first-half decline, which caused the company's shares to fall nearly 10 per cent on the Amsterdam stock exchange yesterday, Bols Wessanen predicted that full-year net earnings per share, excluding extraordinary items, would at least match the 1993 figure.</p>

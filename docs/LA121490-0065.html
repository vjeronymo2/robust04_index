			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' ON TRUCE IN ANGOLA REPORTED AFTER TALKS  </P> <P> Representatives of the two warring factions in Angola met Thursday with three  outside mediators, and a joint statement issued afterward reported "significant  progress" toward a cease-fire in the country's civil war.  </P> <P> Joining the Angolans at the talks were officials from the United States, the  Soviet Union and Portugal, the former colonial power in Angola and site of the  five rounds of peace talks held thus far this year.  </P> <P> "We believe that significant progress has been made and that the prospects for  a successful sixth round of negotiations in Lisbon early next year have been  enhanced," the joint statement said.  </P> <P> The statement said the delegates were favorably impressed by the friendly  atmosphere created by the two Angolan parties as well as by the seriousness of  their approach to the negotiations.  </P> <P> The U.S., Soviet and Portuguese participants held a news conference late  Thursday but declined to cite the areas in which progress was made. They also  said the discussion was an exchange of views rather than a negotiating session.  </P> <P> Herman J. Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs,  said the "main point of agreement" is that Angola's leftist government is now  willing to implement constitutional changes to convert Angola from a one-party  Marxist state to a multi-party democracy. This was agreed to at a party  congress last weekend.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union have been arming opposite sides in the  conflict but have agreed to stop weapons shipments once a cease-fire agreement  is reached. The war has dragged on for 15 years and killed hundreds of  thousands of Angolans.  </P> <P> Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Angolan rebel movement UNITA, said Thursday after  a meeting with President Bush that peace prospects have improved as a result of  joint efforts by the superpowers.  </P> <P> "I think both the United States and the Soviet Union are joining hands in  trying to find a solution to the Angolan problem," Savimbi said after a  20-minute meeting with Bush, during which he thanked Bush for U.S. support for  his forces.  </P> <P> He said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair elections by the  end of the year. He said the rival factions in Angola are close to a  settlement.  </P></p>

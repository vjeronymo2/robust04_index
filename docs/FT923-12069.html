			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Ruling sought from EC courtover delisting THE European Court of Justice is to be asked to rule on whether European Community law gives shareholders, as distinct from a company, a right to be heard when the Stock Exchange is considering delisting a company's shares. A High Court judge yesterday referred the issue to the Luxembourg court in the context of a challenge by shareholders in Titaghur, a Scottish-based jute company, to the delisting of its shares in December 1990. The Stock Exchange said last night that it had been advised that there need be no reference to the European court and it would be seeking to establish this in the Court of Appeal. The shareholders - Else (1982); Mr Leonard Brealey, brother of Titaghur chairman Mr Reginald Brealey; and Mr Gerard Thomas, a Scottish solicitor - had sought a judicial review to quash the delisting decision, made by the committee on quotations of the International Stock Exchange. A ruling in Luxembourg in favour of the shareholders would nullify the committee's decision and require it to reconsider the delisting. Titaghur's shares were suspended in June 1988. Mr Reginald Brealey was charged with insider dealing, but the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence at his trial. Mr Justice Popplewell said yesterday the first issue was whether the shareholders had the legal standing to seek judicial review. He was satisfied they did not - unless they had had the right to be heard by the committee. That depended on the interpretation of the European Commission's 1979 admissions directive co-ordinating the conditions for the admission of securities to official Stock Exchange listing in EC states. The shareholders argued that Article 15 of the directive made clear that, as investors, shareholders had a right to be heard. The Stock Exchange, whose practice when considering suspension or delisting is to hear only the officers of the company, disputed that. A European Court ruling was needed to enable the English court to decide the issue, the judge said. Rejecting the shareholders' other arguments, the judge said there had been the required 'special circumstances' justifying the delisting decision, made on the ground of the inadequacy of Titaghur's accounts. He rejected 38 allegations of irrationality against the committee. saying it was 'simply not possible' to say its decision had been unreasonable. He said he had no doubt the decision had not been disproportionate to the damage it had been designed to prevent. The shareholders, who say if the delisting decision were to be set aside they would be entitled to damages, may appeal.</p>

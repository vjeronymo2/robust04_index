			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 8 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  called Tuesday [8 March] for 1,000 armed military observers to  be deployed in the occupied territories to protect the  Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre.    'Arafat told the Egyptian daily AL-JUMHURIYAH: "We don't  want  a force equipped with heavy arms and tanks. We are only asking  for two battalions, about 1,000 men, carrying individual arms as  part of a multinational force."    He added that Russia, France, Britain and Belgium had agreed  to take part in such an international force.    Meanwhile the Palestine Liberation Organisation  representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP that the  observers must be deployed "immediately" in Hebron before the  stalled PLO-Israeli talks can resume.    The PLO has insisted that measures be taken to protect  Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank before it  agrees to resume talks with Israel on implementing the September  13 accord on Palestinian self-rule.    The talks were suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre  when a Jewish settler slaughtered 29 Muslims at prayer.    Kamal said: "We are asking for an Israeli agreement in  principle on international protection for Palestinians in the  occupied territories which must start immediately with the  deployment of observers in Hebron."    'Arafat told AL-JUMHURIYAH that if the PLO's demands on  security guarantees were met, "the confidence of the Palestinian  population could be restored."</p>

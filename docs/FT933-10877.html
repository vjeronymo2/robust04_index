			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / GM boost for car industry in Taiwan GENERAL MOTORS of the US has signed a letter of intent with Taiwan's Economics Ministry to help develop the island's car industry, Reuter reports from Taipei. The pact calls for GM and Taiwanese partners jointly to promote overseas markets and upgrade the capability of local car component manufacturers. The pact is the fifth such agreement on a strategic alliance signed by Taipei, Mr Yang Shih Chien, Taiwan's vice-economics minister, said at a news conference at the weekend. Taiwan's car market has been growing because of the booming economy, with domestic car and truck production totalling 420,000 in 1992 compared with 390,000 in 1991. General Motors has a five-year agreement with Taiwan's Chinese Automobile Co (CAC), announced earlier, under which CAC assembles Opel-Astra sedans on behalf of GM for Taiwan's domestic market. Production started last month and monthly output is between 800 and 1,000 cars. This will jump to 2,000 in early 1994, CAC said. CAC has invested USDollars 45m (Pounds 30.2m) in the project, he added. General Motors has also invested more than Dollars 7.5m in local vehicle parts factories making some components for the Opel-Astras, CAC said.</p>

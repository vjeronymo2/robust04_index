			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hoping to put profits on the line - Binatone's plans will bring it into competition with Amstrad BINATONE Electronics, the privately-owned electronics group run by Mr Gulu Lalvani, is poised to broaden its product range and compete directly for the first time with companies like Philips and Amstrad in Europe's consumer electronics market. Binatone, founded by Mr Lalvani and his brother in 1958, became the UK's leading importer of transistor radios in the 1960s. It has grown into an international group with headquarters in Hong Kong and annual sales of between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m focused on audio equipment and more recently on the UK market for consumer telephone equipment. Now Mr Lalvani has positioned his group to gain a larger share of the fast growing market in continental Europe for consumer telephone equipment, while expanding its product range to include satellite television, facsimile and video equipment. One immediate consequence of this growth strategy is that the friendly rivalry between Mr Lalvani and Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's chairman, who was given his first business break by Asian-born Mr Lalvani, has become more strained. This was highlighted last month by the surprise announcement that Mr Robert Watkins, Amstrad's technical and manufacturing director and a key Sugar aide, was joining Binatone as group managing director. Mr Watkins helped develop many of the products which fuelled Amstrad's success in the 1980s. At Binatone he will be responsible for UK and Hong Kong operations. His first task has been to complete a business review and work out a strategy for taking Binatone from corded telephones and expanding into cordless telephones and then into satellite systems. In the first year he expects to increase sales by 50 per cent and launch Binatone into 'three or four new product areas', beginning with a high-specification low-price cordless telephone due in September. Binatone's design and marketing expertise coupled with its low cost manufacturing base in the Far East should give it a advantage over many of its competitors. In the UK it has been targeting the consumer telephone business for more than two years and has an annual turnover of about Pounds 20m. Binatone has captured an unrivalled 30 per cent market share under its Binatone and Dialatron brands. It also supplies equipment which is re-badged and sold by other companies such as BT. Most of its products are made in Hong Kong and southern China. The timing of its drive into broader markets in Europe is critical. The advent of the single market presented new business opportunities, as has the steady deregulation of markets like telecommunications. Meanwhile, many local competitors, including Philips and Amstrad, have seen their consumer electronics business hit hard by competition from manufacturers in Japan and the Far East. Amstrad in particular appears to be drifting following last month's abortive attempt by Mr Sugar to buy-out his fellow shareholders for 30p a share. However, during the attempt it became clear that Mr Sugar, who said he had run out of 'blockbuster' product ideas for Amstrad, also saw the market for consumer telecommunications equipment as a potential growth area. Amstrad already manufactures facsimile machines for domestic and small business use and is developing a videophone product with GEC Marconi. A determined push into the telecommunications equipment market would come through Betacom, the separately-quoted UK-based consumer telephone equipment company which became a Amstrad subsidiary last year. Mr Sugar has described Betacom, which has a modest Pounds 13.7m market capitalisation, as Amstrad's telephone arm. He has moved quickly to consolidate his grip over the loss-making company which has been run by Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's former corporate finance director, since last July. Mr Ashcroft has instigated a rationalisation of Betacom's product range and refocused its business on the UK market. One consequence of Amstrad's ownership is that its 49 per cent stake in Loewe Betacom, a profitable German joint-venture, was put on the auction block. In November it was acquired by Binatone for about Pounds 1.8m. The joint venture, in which BMW and Mitsubishi are its partners, was founded in 1990 with the aim of supplying equipment to the newly-liberalised German telephone market. In its first full year of business sales reached a profitable DM20m (Pounds 8.4m) and during the first 10 months of last year it increased its share of the German market to 10 per cent with a 50 per cent increase in sales. The joint venture is an important plank in Binatone's new European strategy. Mr Lalvani believes there is substantial growth potential in the German market itself, and that Binatone will be able to apply the lessons it has learned from the deregulation of the UK market. He also sees the renamed Loewe Binatone as a springboard for telephone equipment sales across continental Europe where telecommunications liberalisation is expected to fuel a fast growing consumer equipment market. In the UK the telephone equipment market is one of the few areas of the economy to have shown growth in both volume and value throughout the recession. Sales of telephone answering machines, for example, increased by 30 per cent last year and Binatone more than doubled its sales. This year Binatone will concentrate on boosting cordless phone sales in the UK. However, there is little doubt that the UK market for consumer telephone equipment, worth Pounds 158m at end of 1991, is maturing and margins are growing thinner. Over the next three to five years the best growth prospects for may well lie in continental Europe. If so Amstrad, the share price of which is languishing around 25p, and Betacom, the price of which has climbed back to 17 1/2 p recently having fallen to a low of 13 1/2 p in October, may have to reconsider their strategy yet again. By that stage investors could have another choice. Mr Lalvani said he would consider bringing Binatone to the market once the recession is over.</p>

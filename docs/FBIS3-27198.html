			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 18 (XINHUA) -- A senior Hong  Kong-based Chinese official has condemned the British attempt to  grab the maximum possible economic benefits before it leaves  Hong Kong.    Such deeds on the British side infringed on the interests of  Hong Kong residents and creates an economic burden for Hong  Kong's future administration, said Zhu Yucheng, deputy director  of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, after attending a  spring festival cocktail reception held here Thursday [17  February].    He called on local residents to heighten their vigilance on  this matter.    He pointed out that the aim of the British side in its  financing arrangements for the new Hong Kong airport is to spend  money to the maximum extent and shift debts onto the future  government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).    According to the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on  the Construction of the New Airport in Hong Kong [HK], the total  amount of debt on the ten airport core projects to be repaid  after June 30, 1997 should not exceed five billion.    However, Zhu said, the British side has tried every possible  means to outgrow this limit in a bid to leave a big burden for  the future SAR government. The fourth financial plan put  forward by the British side still aims at imposing a debt of 23  billion HK dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) on the future SAR  government.    Zhu said that it is not convincing for the Hong Kong  Government to describe the debt borrowed by the Provisional  Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation  (MTRC) on the airport construction as non-government debt.    The above-mentioned two units are government-funded and the  Hong Kong Government serves as the sole shareholder of these two  units. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government is, of course,  responsible for the refunding of the debt, the deputy director  said.</p>

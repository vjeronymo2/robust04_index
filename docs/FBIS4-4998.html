			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Objection to U.S. Hardline Policy"] </F>   [Text] The Super 301 provision of the U.S. Omnibus Trade  Act is just like a "sacred sword" which will never be used. If  the United States invokes sanctions, such as imposing high  tariffs on selected goods, in line with the Super 301 provision,  it will face international criticism. Moreover, U.S. consumers  will suffer damages from the difficulties in importing goods  subject to sanctions.    An event in the Japan-U.S. construction talks proves that it  is not easy for Washington to invoke sanctions. During the  talks, the United States began to take the steps necessary to  impose sanctions, but it twice postponed the implementation of  sanctions. It eventually did not invoke sanctions because an  agreement was reached with Japan in January.    In short, the Super 301 provision is a tool to obtain  concessions from a trading partner by threatening sanctions. A  nation such as Japan, which is still on the threshold of  "adulthood," is not immune to such trade tactics. We can see  the evidence in the recent cellular phone talks.    The "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade  Barriers" released by the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative [USTR] is one such tactic. Although it is a  regular annual report, this year's edition focuses its attention  on Japan, a nation with a huge trade surplus. The report  stresses Japan's uniqueness, in referring to the stalled  Japan-U.S. framework trade talks. It notes that the USTR will  specify the market sectors that are subject to the application  of the Super 301 provision unless improvements are made within  six months.    We know that the current U.S. domestic situation has forced  the Clinton administration to adopt a hardline strategy on  trade. While calming down Congress, where there are many who  take a tough stand toward Japan, the administration has to  secure the support of labor unions to prepare for an off-year  election in November. The opening of Japanese markets will be  necessary for the United States to boost its exports and to  maintain the growth of its economy.    Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline tactics are not only  unfavorable but also dangerous.    Although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor evaluated  highly the U.S. strategy in negotiations with Japan over  cellular phones by saying that it would set a good precedent for  future negotiations, the president of Japan Motorola expressed  regret. He said: "The image of our company has suffered  (because of our many demands in the cellular phone  negotiations). It was a mistake."    President Clinton should listen to what he has said. Even if  the United States assumes by any means an advantageous position  in negotiations, deals with Japan will not necessarily be  smooth. Not only Japan but also other Asian countries have  deepened their distrust of the United States for its selfish  trade tactics.    What worries us more is the possibility that the United  States' threatening to impose sanctions will develop into a  trade war between Japan and the United States. If a trade war  occurs, it will become a drag on the world economy, which is  still in the doldrums.    Following the issuing of the trade report, Washington has  reportedly been considering taking hardline steps in some  sectors as early as the end of April. While refusing to resume  the framework trade talks, the United States is considering  taking hardline steps. The nation lacks a broad view and is  concentrating more on domestic issues. We hope that the United  States will change this attitude.    The great trade imbalance between Japan and the United  States  stems from the cyclical factor of different economic trends, as  well as from structural factors. While Japanese products enter  the United States, which is a nation of overconsumption,  regulations and business practices that bar foreign products  from entering this country have taken root in Japan, which is a  nation of excessive savings.    President Clinton once said the United States was to blame  for most of its trade deficits. Both Japan and the United  States need to make efforts to rectify the trade imbalance.    It seems that the Clinton administration thinks that  although  Washington has struggled to reduce its budget deficits by  implementing such measures as unpopular tax hikes, Tokyo's  efforts are lacking. This assertion is understandable, but it  is also true that Washington has not carried out its task of  increasing savings.    The tasks to be undertaken by Japan have been discussed many  times. For the moment, it should work to formulate effective  economy-boosting and market-opening measures by the end of June.  Japan must take bold actions to ease trade frictions with the  United States.</p>

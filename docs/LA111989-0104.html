			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOUGH LESSON ON RULES  </P> <P> Last week, three Orange County football teams were stripped of their status in  their respective playoffs, two of them for using ineligible players and the  third for a fight among players after a game. Cruelly, the teams and their  supporters careened between elation and despair as the issues were decided and  re-decided in the courts -- prompting a judge in one of the disputes to say  that pretty soon a good lawyer will be more important to a team than a fast  tailback.  </P> <P> When the dust settled, it appeared that one thing survived for better or worse:  the rules. That is good, because a healthy respect for the rules of the game is  one of the primary lessons that sports has to offer to youths. But, at least in  one case, it seems that the penalty was harsher than was necessary.  </P> <P> At two high schools, Huntington Beach and Savanna in Anaheim, highly successful  seasons were marred by the discovery that there were ineligible players on the  teams. At Savanna, one teammate had played too many semesters. At Huntington  Beach, a player did not live in the district with a parent or guardian as  required. Especially in the latter case, it appeared that the ineligible player  simply did not understand the residential rule, nor did the school offer much  guidance. Initially, a Superior Court judge ruled that the penalty of an entire  forfeited season was unfair. But California Interscholastic Federation lawyers  argued successfully in appellate court that if an exception were made for the  youth, any school could "take a chance" and field a player and then seek  eligibility later.  </P> <P> Perhaps, however, with these two fresh examples, the CIF, which is made up of  school principals, can come up with a more reasonable set of penalties. Instead  of throwing away the season, the CIF could declare the guilty player ineligible  for playoffs and strip the team of a home-field advantage. Or fine the school,  or put it on probation, or remove the coach, or prevent the school from playing  in its division the next year.  </P> <P> But what also seems clear from last week is that students either do not  understand, or think they can flaunt, the eligibility rules rightfully designed  to discourage athletes from "shopping" for schools and control out-of-district  recruiting. Coaches and principals need to walk them through the rules and  explain that they are serving no one -- certainly not their teammates or their  schools -- by violating them.  </P> <P> As for the Anaheim-Garden Grove Chargers, who play in a league for 12- to  14-year-olds, the penalty for fighting was appropriate. As the team's coach  noted, the team learned "the hard way" that "there's no place for fighting on  the football field."  </P></p>

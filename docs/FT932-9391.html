			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / EC tussle over North Sea THE European Commission said yesterday it had no immediate intention to bow to Norwegian pressure and withdraw proposals aimed at increasing competition in North Sea oil and gas exploration. A spokeswoman for Mr Abel Matutes, the EC energy commissioner, said the decision on whether to adopt the directive was up to the 12 existing members of the Community. 'We can't take a decision on the basis of the hypothetical situation that Norway has joined,' she said. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, warned this week that adoption of the measure could hinder attempts to convince the country's electorate about the benefits of EC membership. The directive would outlaw preferential treatment of national oil and gas companies applying for drilling or exploration licences and has provoked strong opposition from Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, and from Norway, both of which grant certain licence privileges to their state oil companies. Last month, Denmark postponed an energy ministers' meeting partly to avoid a sensitive decision on the directive. Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen adds: Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has written to the Danish government, signalling support for Denmark and Norway over the proposed EC directive on oil and gas licensing, according to the Danish prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.</p>

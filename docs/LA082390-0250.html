			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEARL BAILEY'S MOURNERS JAM INTO CHURCH  </P> <P> Mourners wound around the block today to say farewell to singer Pearl Bailey.  </P> <P> Deliverance Evangelical Evangelistic Church opened its doors at 10 a.m. for the  viewing.  </P> <P> The service and burial was set for later today.  </P> <P> "I think they should have opened the doors last night," said the Rev. Steven  Parks, the West Oak Lane Church of God associate pastor who was among the first  inside.  </P> <P> Miss Bailey was 72 when she died Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital  after collapsing in her hotel room. The singer was recuperating from knee  surgery. A preliminary autopsy report indicated that she died of heart disease.  </P> <P> She made her debut in Philadelphia at age 15 by singing "Poor Butterfly" in an  amateur contest. Among her best-known performances was her lead role in the  black version of the musical "Hello, Dolly!" in the late 1960s.  </P> <P> "Miss Bailey was one of the greatest recording artists and one of the most  talented people in the world," remarked James Brooks, a Philadelphia native now  living in Los Angeles, as he walked into the church.  </P> <P> Brooks said he had met the singer numerous times.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] According to election commissions in constituencies  in the presidential election on June 26 9 million 87 thousand  995 voters (38 percent) cast their ballots for the incumbent,  Leonid Kravchuk, and 8 million 221 thousand 515 (32) percent,  for ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma.    A total of 25 million 800 voters took part in the  presidential election.    Under the Ukrainian law if neither candidate collects 50  percent of the votes at once, the two top candidates qualify for  a run-off.    The central electoral commission is going to set a date for  the election of the Ukrainian president later this week. The  run-off is to be held no later than two weeks after the first  round.    The chief of the presidential service Vladimir  Shlyaposhnikov  has told IF that Kravchuk's victory was not a surprise. As for  the complete failure of the ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, who  according to early returns holds sixth place, it was totally  unexpected. The returns from the first round of the  presidential election in Ukraine are evidence that neither  candidate is regarded as a a consolidating figure and that the  trend of Ukraine's split along geographic and political lines  goes on. The West voted for Kravchuk, and the East for Kuchma,  the chairman of the State Duma's Committee for the CIS affairs  and contacts with compatriots Konstantin Zatulin has said. He  led the Russian parliament's observer delegation monitoring the  election.    He believes that irrespective of the results of the run-off  it is clear that Kravchuk has lost the status of the national  leader.    Zatulin has described the relatively high percentage of  votes  cast for Kuchma as his major success, emphasized by the fact  that the entire state machinery worked against him throughout  the election campaign.    Zatulin pointed to the fact that in contrast to the  parliamentary elections the presidential election was attended  by far fewer international observers, which may lead to election  rigging. Zatulin said that by not sending their observers the  Western countries gave Leonid Kravchuk and the party in power in  Ukraine a chance to influence the outcome of the elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Announcement by Defense Ministry Press Center"] </F>   [Text] With regard to the petition organized at the end of  February this year by the chairmen of the clubs and coordinators  of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officers Legion (Rakovski BOL) in  Khaskovo and the appeal addressed by them to the commissioned  and noncommissioned officers of the Bulgarian Army, the defense  minister and the Bulgarian Army chief of staff have issued a  relevant order.    The order states that, by their actions, the officers in  question violated the Bulgarian Armed Forces statutes, the  Rakovski BOL Statute, and the Basic Premises for Mutual  Relations Between the Defense Ministry and the Rakovski BOL. It  is pointed out that Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov, acting  independently and without the knowledge of his colleagues in the  legion's Confederative Council and speaking through the mass  media, took it upon himself to compare the appeal by the  officers in Khaskovo to "the Bloody Letter" [letter written in  blood announcing the 1876 April Uprising against the Turks]. By  doing this, quite apart from committing a grave disciplinary  offense, he caused additional tension among the public and  indirectly issued a provocative call for appropriate action.    For committing these disciplinary offenses and with a view  to  forestalling actions by Bulgarian Army commissioned and  noncommissioned officers in the future that contravene the  legally based and statutory order established in the Army,  Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov is dismissed on disciplinary  grounds and various punishments are imposed on the other  officers that signed the appeal and the petition.</p>

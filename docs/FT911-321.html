			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Racal demerger plans face delay DETAILED plans for the demerger of Racal Electronics, which Sir Ernest Harrison, the UK electronics group's chairman is due to announce with the interim results in June, may not be fulfilled before next year. With less than a month until the plan is to be presented to shareholders, Racal has still not appointed new non-executive directors who will need to decide what to do with Racal Electronics' Pounds 375m of debt ahead of the proposed flotation of Racal Chubb. Sir Ernest is expected to announce on June 12 the timing of the first stage of the demerger - the hand-out to shareholders of Racal Electronics' 80 per cent share in Racal Telecom, the subsidiary that operates Vodafone, the world's largest cellular radio telephone network. But before the proposed flotation of Chubb, Racal's wholly owned security subsidiary, new non-executive directors will have to scrutinise how much of the debt should be left with the 'rump' of Racal Electronics. Last November, when Sir Ernest announced he would break up Racal after what he said was the market's persistent under-valuation of the group, he promised to appoint independent directors early in the new year. Sir Ernest has said he will lead a management buy-out team once the slimmed-down Racal Electronics had traded for an appropriate time in the market. The amount of debt carried by the slimmed down Racal Electronics would have a bearing both on how easily Sir Ernest could find MBO finance and the financial return for the MBO team, analysts say. Racal Telecom already has a quotation and would not be encumbered by any of its parent's debt. As a result, the first stage of Sir Ernest's plan would not require the scrutiny of new independent directors, analysts say. Racal Electronics and its advisers, NM Rothschild, have been talking to potential new non-executive directors and are expected to announce the new appointments no later than June.</p>

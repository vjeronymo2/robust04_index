			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SANDERS REPORTS TO FALCONS  </P> <P> Cornerback Deion Sanders finally showed up at the Atlanta Falcons' training  camp today, two weeks after he left the New York Yankees when a $2-million  baseball deal fell through.  </P> <P> Falcons spokesman Charlie Taylor said Sanders reported to trainer Jerry Rhea  early this morning, and then went to an Atlanta doctor's office for his  physical.  </P> <P> He was expected to participate in the NFL team's practice this afternoon.  </P> <P> Sanders is out $37,000 in fines -- $1,500 per day for missing 18 days of  training camp, plus a $10,000 fine for missing the team's mini-camp July 9-19.  </P> <P> The second-year player from Florida State spent most of his summer playing  baseball with the Yankees, who were reported to be considering a $2-million  contract extension that would have made him a full-time baseball player through  1991. The deal fell through, however, and Sanders left the Yankees on July 29.  </P> <P> Sanders, who is under a four-year, $4.4-million contract with the Falcons,  missed the team's NFL preseason opener Saturday night, a 31-27 victory over the  Washington Redskins. But he is expected to play in this Saturday's game against  the Cincinnati Bengals at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.  </P></p>

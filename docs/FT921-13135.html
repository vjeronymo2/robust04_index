			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Solutions to the career problems of women with children (2) Sir, As a mother in charge of two small children and my own London public relations company, Diane Summers' article on obstacles to women's career opportunities ('The little things that mean a lot', January 13) touched a chord. My own employment experience bears testament to the unimaginative rigidity of many employers and the frustrations faced by many professional women with a mind to combining career and motherhood. With an Oxford university degree and 12 years' experience in PR behind me, I tried to persuade my corporate employer to let me return to work on a flexible basis after the birth of my first chIld. I offered to take a 50 per cent pay cut to carry on doing the same amount of work, if they would let me return on a three day a week basis. I even guaranteed to put in extra time at short notice whenever required. My employer remained locked in an established policy of only accepting post-natal women back to work on a full time basis. With regret, I left the company. Before long I had set up my own business, with control over my working arrangements, and was reaping the rewards of a considerably higher income. I determined never to lose a valuable employee through inflexibility. I have a good team of female PR executives, and will soon welcome back my deputy director to a two, then three day week following the birth of her first child.

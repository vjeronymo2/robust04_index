			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Banks raise lending rates Japan's leading banks will today raise their long-term prime lending rate, the rate charged on loans to their most creditworthy customers, by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 per cent, the second increase in little over a month. The decision, announced yesterday by 11 big commercial banks, reflects the sharp rise in bond yields since the start of the year. The yield on the government's 10-year benchmark bond has risen from 3.2 per cent in January to 4.5 per cent this week as investors have grown increasingly optimistic about the country's economic prospects, and more fearful of resurgent inflation. That improving confidence was reflected in figures published yesterday by the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) that suggested the long slump in capital spending may be ending. Private-sector machinery orders, excluding orders for ships and from electric power companies, declined by a seasonally-adjusted 5.8 per cent in July from the previous month, to a total of Y895.4bn (Pounds 5.79bn). The figure represents a rise of 2.6 per cent on July last year. But an EPA spokesman said the longer-term trend suggested capital spending was on course to rise 1.1 per cent in the current quarter compared with the previous three months. That optimistic assessment was supported by a Japan Development Bank survey published yesterday showing companies expect their capital investment to fall just 2.4 per cent in the year to March.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Problems for Russia's new private farmers Shortage of cash and soaring prices are causing problems for Russia's new private farmers, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Tass quoted Mr Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the Association of Russian Farmers, as saying that the government's failure to finalise laws on land ownership and mortgage payments was also slowing the development of new farms. 'The resources already allocated by the state to support individual farmers are clearly insufficient,' Tass said. The agency said that there were currently 173,000 private farmers in Russia, cultivating 7.3m hectares of land. The division of Russia's big collective farms into smaller units, or their transformation into joint stock companies, is a key element in the reform of agriculture.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITISH CABINET SHAKE-UP  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed new foreign and defense  secretaries, fired two other Cabinet ministers and switched several more in the  biggest government shake-up since she won power in 1979. Thatcher named John  Major, 46, little-known chief secretary to the Treasury, the No. 2 financial  post, as the new foreign secretary to replace Geoffrey Howe. Howe was moved to  a vacant post as deputy prime minister and the governing Conservative Party's  leader in the House of Commons. Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King was named  defense secretary, replacing George Younger, who resigned. Fired were Transport  Secretary Paul Channon and Social Services Secretary John Moore. The Cabinet  reshuffle is designed to halt the government's slide in popularity.  </P></p>

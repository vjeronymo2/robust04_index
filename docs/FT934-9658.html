			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Further fall in inflation rate of goods leaving factories THE RATE of inflation for goods leaving factories fell for the second consecutive month in October, indicating that price pressures in the economy remain subdued as manufacturers hold down prices. Output prices rose 0.2 per cent in October to stand 4 per cent up on a year ago. This compares with 4.2 per cent in September and 4.3 per cent in August, and prompted some economists to suggest that producer output inflation has passed its peak. But the underlying measure rose for the sixth successive month. This index, which excludes volatile prices of food, drink, tobacco and petrol, rose 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to October, compared with 3 per cent in the 12 months to September. It has risen every month since April, when the annual rate was 2.2 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said the seasonally adjusted rise in the underlying index in the latest three months was equivalent to an annual rate of increase of 3.6 per cent. There was a sharp fall in input-price inflation. Prices of industry's raw materials and fuel rose 0.9 per cent in the 12 months to October compared with 3.8 per cent in September. The steep fall was mainly due to the year-on-year comparison.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: N Sea oil price slide continues NORTH SEA oil prices fell a further 10 cents yesterday, adding to a 60-cent downturn since the middle of last week as negative sentiments reasserted themselves amongst traders. The price of North Sea Brent crude for July delivery slipped back to Dollars 18.40 a barrel yesterday from Dollars 18.48 on Friday. The market has been kept in broad equilibrium for the past month as pessimistic and optimistic reports have tended to cancel each other out without affecting the price. But traders have adopted a more gloomy tone in the past few days while demand has remained erratic. Some traders are beginning to doubt the strength of the US recovery and are becoming uncertain about oil demand in the peak driving season - the summer months. At the same time news last week of Kuwait's plans to push for a higher quota at the next meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has led to fears that Opec's current production discipline could be jeopardised. Some North Sea platforms will be shutting down in the next few months for summer maintenance programmes. This can lead to temporary tightness in the Brent market and can push prices higher. But higher prices will also depend on increasing demand. Refiners have been in the market buying supplies in recent weeks, but their purchasing patterns have been erratic and are currently not strong enough to keep prices above Dollars 19 a barrel.</p>

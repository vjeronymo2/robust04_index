			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Scottish rebuff for Labour leader MR JOHN Smith, the Labour leader, suffered a further setback yesterday in his efforts to introduce one-man-one-vote reforms for his party's voting structure. The party's Scottish executive, meeting in Edinburgh, voted heavily against Mr Smith's proposals and called for Labour to retain a 'collective union voice'. A senior party official played down the significance of the vote, saying it had been union-dominated. The Labour leadership is hoping that a debate over the summer months will still allow Mr Smith to win at the party's annual conference in the autumn.</p>

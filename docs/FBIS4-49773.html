			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Some Beijing-based U.S.  entrepreneurs called recently for their government to extend  China's most favored nation (MFN) status this year out of  consideration for U.S. business interests in the large market of  China.    The entrepreneurs include the first representatives of the  Beijing offices of General Motors (GM), Ford, McDonnell Douglas  (MDC), Motorola, United Technology Company (UTC), Du Pont,  American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), Chase Manhattan  Bank,  Amoco and Caltex oil company.    During recent interviews with XINHUA, they shared the view  that China's economy, developing at a high rate and providing  favorable opportunities for U.S. enterprises in the country, and  the bilateral trade ties played a significant role in the  recovery of the U.S. economy.    The United States would pay a high price if the U.S.-China  trade relations were damaged as a result of suspension of MFN  status, they said.    Diane Terry, secretary general of the American-China Chamber  of Commerce representing 400 U.S. companies in China, pointed  out that the countries' two-way trade has expanded rapidly since  the two countries established diplomatic relations 15 years ago,  and China has become the 8th largest trade partner of the United  States.    And more than 500 multi-national companies in the U.S. have  marked China as one of their future investment priorities, she  said, adding that total U.S. contracted volume of investment  reached 11 billion U.S. dollars in China's over 10,000 projects  by the end of last year, which led all foreign investment in  China.    Only if the bilateral trade ties were normal could the U.S.  companies make expected achievements, she said.    Richard Latham, president of the United Technologies China  operation, expressed his hope that President Clinton would  extend China's MFN status in the interest of U.S. companies in  China.    Peter Chapman, president of McDonnell Douglas China company,  said that if the U.S.-China relations can develop smoothly, U.S.  enterprises will benefit a lot since China will import goods  valued at 700 billion U.S. dollars within the next seven years.    He took his company as an example by saying that since MDC  entered China in 1975, it had sold China a batch of planes, and  40 planes have been assembled by the MDC-China joint venture in  Shanghai.    If an agreement could be reached, the company would  manufacture scores of additional planes for China's main air  routes, Chapman said.    Rudi von Meister and James Paulsen, heads of GM and Ford in  China, shared the view that if a trade conflict was triggered by  the MFN issue, other Western companies, taking the opportunity,  would occupy the lion's share of the Chinese market, thus  becoming strong competitors of U.S. enterprises.    Chai Sun Lai, president of Motorola China company, said that  when President Clinton makes his decision in June, he must take  into account the interests of the American people.    According to some experts, the inflation rate in the U.S.  would be 0.15 percent more annually if it lost China, a main  supplier of consumer goods, and each U.S. consumer would pay 140  dollars more for substitutions for Chinese products. Besides,  160,000 people would lose their jobs.    Besides, all these enterprisers pointed out, the policy of  linking trade and human rights is popular neither in the world  nor in the United States.    "In the past, companies postponed canvassing in Washington  until May," Latham said. "But they began their action at the  beginning of the year this time. UTC has made a plan from  January to June."    All the businessmen said that a good trend has appeared  recently in Washington, and they hoped that Clinton would not  make the "mistake of the times" as THE NEW YORK TIMES called it  -- eliminating China's MFN status.</p>

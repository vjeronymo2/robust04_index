			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Venezuela opens up oil sector THE Venezuelan government has opened the door to private investment in the country's oil industry for the first time since the petroleum sector was nationalised in 1976. Five oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, won deals to develop five groups of inactive oilfields. They are to invest Dollars 480m (Pounds 258m) in the oilfields by 1996 and a total of Dollars 720m over the next decade. Shell was one of the international concerns whose Venezuelan assets were nationalised 16 years ago. Other winning companies were Teikoku Oil Co. of Japan, Benton Oil &amp; Gas of the US, and two Venezuelan companies, Vincler and Lingoteras. Sixteen Venezuelan and international groups presented tenders on the operating contracts. BP made a bid but did not win. In announcing the winners, Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's Minister of energy and mines, said the companies would sign 20-year contracts under which they would develop fields, produce crude oil and turn it over to subsidiaries of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.</p>

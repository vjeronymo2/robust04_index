			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Hungary acts on borders Hungary's new Socialist government yesterday opened the way for a 'historic reconciliation' with Romania and Slovakia by offering to renounce formally all territorial ambitions against them. Mr Gyula Horn, making his inaugural speech to parliament as prime minister after winning May's elections, announced that Budapest would begin treaty talks 'without delay' with Bucharest and Bratislava. Mr Horn said Hungary was ready to enshrine in new bilateral agreements a guarantee of the inviolability of borders upon which Romania and Slovakia had insisted. He tied his concession to the incorporation of a commitment on minority rights for the roughly 2m ethnic Hungarians in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia. He has nevertheless abandoned the position of the outgoing centre-right government, which ruled out the revision of frontiers by force but refused to carve in stone a territorial settlement it deemed unjust. In pointed contrast to a conservative predecessor who called himself premier of all 15m Hungarians, within and beyond the borders, Mr Horn said he was prime minister of Hungary's 10.5m inhabitants alone. 'This government is the government of the citizens of Hungary,' he declared. Tension however remains high in Cluj, capital of the Romanian region of Transylvania, after nationalist mayor Mr Gheorge Funar tried to remove a statue of King Matthias of medieval Hungary, which is a central symbol of the city's ethnic Hungarians.</p>

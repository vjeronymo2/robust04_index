President Alfredo Cristiani has said that there is no  concrete evidence on information disclosed by Guatemalan  authorities related to weapons caches destined for Guatemalan  guerrillas originating from El Salvador; he added, however, that  the clues they have so far are quite convincing, and he  expressed his concern for rising violence in Guatemala, where  the last guerrilla group in Central America is still active.    In reference to the armed uprising that has been taking  place  during the past few days in Mexico--which is led by the peasant  group the Zapatista National Liberation Army--Cristiani  expressed his regret that even Mexico has a problem now.    We all wish that this type of problem did not exist and we  are willing to cooperate with each other, the president added.    With respect to the events in Mexico, the Salvadoran  president said that the participation of Central American  nationals has not been confirmed; nevertheless, he announced  that the issue would be examined together with Mexican  authorities during an official visit. Cristiani did not disclose  when the official visit to Mexico would take place.</p>

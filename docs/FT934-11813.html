			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No reason to hold up Bosnia airlift Sir, Please let me commend you for your leader on Bosnia ('Bosnia still', October 22). As the world's attention moves away from Sarajevo and the other remaining remnants of the territory of the independent, internationally recognised nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so the Bosnian Serbs tighten the noose. They have proved brilliant at moving whenever the world loses interest. Yet, as you say, the United Nations Security Council has declared its willingness to protect these enclaves, and to get humanitarian supplies through, pledges that today clearly embarrass the western powers. It should be possible to airlift enough food and medical supplies to these enclaves. If Tuzia airport, still in government hands, is reopened, large cargo aircraft could land there. It is inexplicable that this airport has not been used because of Bosnian Serb objections. It should be possible to protect cargo aircraft - indeed, it would give our Nato fighter aircraft, now pointlessly and expensively overflying Bosnian air space, something worth doing. And it would show western resolve to stop the last flickering embers of a brave attempt to create a civilised multi-ethnic society from being extinguished for ever.

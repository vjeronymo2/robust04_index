Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor said this to  newsmen in Kuala Lumpur today.    He disclosed that the police, through the arrangement of  Interpol, is hoping to interview the editors or the reporters  who wrote the reports in the newspapers concerned. The two  dailies are the Sydney-based SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and CANBERRA TIMES  based in the Australian capital. SUNDAY TELEGRAPH had reported  on 10 January that senior opposition members of parliament have  over the years received tens of thousands of dollars from ASIS.  CANBERRA TIMES, however, reported on 3 February that the  receipients were members from the ruling party.    Tan Sri Rahim said the police is viewing the allegations  very  seriously and he hopes the two newspapers will give the  necessary cooperation.</p>

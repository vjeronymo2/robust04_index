			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Holmes Protection HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group quoted in the UK, reported continued progress in its recovery following its recently completed debt restructuring. Pre-tax profits in the three months to September 30 totalled Dollars 3.29m (Pounds 2m) on turnover of Dollars 13.8m, but included a Dollars 2.77m exceptional gain resulting from the reversal of an acquisition reserve created in prior years. Earnings per share were 7.8 cents. In the same period last year there was a Dollars 2.33m pre-tax loss on turnover of Dollars 14.4m. The group cautioned that the latest results were not comparable because of changes in accounting policies and the significant adjustments, which required a Dollars 1.24m exceptional charge to cover severance pay and the cost of a proxy fight. The latest results underpin the group's return to profitability in the first half and lift nine month pre-tax profits to Dollars 4.76m (Dollars 3.73m) on turnover of Dollars 42.1m (Dollars 44m). Earnings per share came out at 11.2 cents. Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said the recovery was continuing 'despite the difficult economic environment that persists in the US'. He added that the group's objective remained to improve profitability by reducing costs, generating new sales, acquiring subscriber contacts from third parties and by developing the Dictograph franchise. He noted that the number of employees had been reduced from 762 last year to 676, and the company had recently acquired subscriber contracts with recurring revenues of Dollars 168,000 per year. Sir Ian also said that during September the group bought 100,000 of its shares in the market at an average price of 45 1/2 p. Holmes' shares were unchanged last night at 45p.</p>

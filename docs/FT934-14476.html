			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat talks at early stage GREYCOAT, the property company struggling to fend off receivership, said yesterday that talks regarding a possible takeover or a financial restructuring were at an early stage and no formal proposals had been received. In a brief statement Greycoat's board said it had noted the recent price movements of both its ordinary and preference shares, together with press speculation regarding an imminent announcement of either a possible takeover or a financial restructuring. The board acknowledged that it had received 'a number of approaches from interested parties', but said it wished to emphasise that 'these talks are still at a preliminary stage and no formal proposal has yet been received.' The statement added that the board intended to co-operate fully with interested parties, but that it was unlikely that those discussions would lead to definitive proposals 'before the latter part of next week.' NM Rothschild, Greycoat's adviser, has confirmed that it had received at least two approaches, including one from the UK Active Value Fund which is advised by corporate financiers Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger. It controls 18 per cent of Greycoat's ordinary shares. Other interested parties declined to be identified. Yesterday the UK Active Value Fund claimed to have 'very substantial backing' for its approach from a number of large UK and US institutions and private families. Greycoat's shares closed up 4p at 31p.</p>

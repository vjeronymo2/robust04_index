			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Audit rap for housing associations HOUSING associations must improve their financial and management controls if they are to deal with the extra private-sector funds planned for them by the government, a report by the National Audit Office warns today. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, also recommends extra powers for the Housing Corporation, which distributes government grants to the associations. The government intends to reduce the proportion of housing association funding which comes from government grants from 75 per cent to 55 per cent by 1995-96. Between now and 1995-96 an estimated Pounds 2.5bn of private finance is needed to support forecast investment by the corporation of Pounds 5.4bn. Sir John says this exposes the associations to greater financial risk and questions whether sufficient controls are in place for associations to deal with the higher borrowing requirements which will follow these grant cuts. He says the borrowing requirements will 'place associations' financial management systems, practices and skills under substantially greater pressure than has been experienced so far', while 'vigorous efforts will be required to carry forward work on enhancing their oversight and monitoring'. Sir John also warns: 'The willingness of the private sector to meet associations' borrowing requirements has yet to be tested at the level required to meet planned levels of development over the next few years.' The report, based on a detailed study of 14 associations, makes several criticisms of their management: Some managing committees must be strengthened. The audit office found that six associations had had difficulty recruiting members with the necessary expertise, particularly in the area of finance. On average, 37 per cent of committee members were over retirement age, and in one case this figure was 69 per cent. The pay of committee members and staff is limited by law. Internal audits must be increased. Only six of the 14 associations studied had been visited by internal auditors, and the corporation has no national data on how effectively internal audits have been implemented. Most of the associations without internal audit managed a 'significant' number of housing units (from 1,350 to 5,600), and two had been advised by the corporation in 1988-89 to start an internal audit. External audits often fail to receive a sufficiently swift response from associations - in one case the auditors raised the same observation in successive years. Borrowing strategies are inadequate in some cases. The report found few associations had made 'long-term assessments of the availability of adequate security for their proposed long-term borrowings'. The audit office also found formal inquiries into associations by the corporation were 'exhaustive and time-consuming'. It suggests the corporation should be allowed to intervene before completing an inquiry, and should publish research into using inter-association comparisons as performance indicators. The corporation has no power to vet the accounts of associations' unregistered subsidiaries even though its 1991 survey found 30 associations facing potentially serious financial difficulties because of investments in subsidiaries ranging from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12m.

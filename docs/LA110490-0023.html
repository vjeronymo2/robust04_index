			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINKERING WITH TAXES WON'T BOLSTER ECONOMY  </P> <P> James Flanigan's column, "Washington Fiddles, Productivity Burns" (Oct. 19),  hit it on the nose. The pie (economic growth) is simply not big enough.  </P> <P> How can we increase the size of the pie? As Flanigan pointed out, not just by  tinkering with taxes.  </P> <P> To increase productivity, an economy needs three things: increased investment  in plant equipment, increased investment in the infrastructure and an educated  work force that can cope in the modern workplace.  </P> <P> To stimulate increased investment in plants, the government must use the  carrot-and-stick approach. This means at some level taxing consumption while  rewarding savings.  </P> <P> The infrastructure is the responsibility of the government. More money must be  spent on bringing our roads, bridges, and water and sewage treatment facilities  into the 21st Century.  </P> <P> The most difficult problem, however, is improving our education system.  </P> <P> When a large segment of the adult population is functionally illiterate and  lacking basic math skills, how are they going to be able to operate the  increasingly complex machinery that is necessary to increase our productivity.  </P> <P> More money is not the answer.  </P> <P> The importance of education must be sold to the average person. Public policy  should encourage a change in our heroes, from athletes and rock stars to  individuals who excel intellectually.  </P> <P> GERALD J. BARRON, La Canada  </P></p>

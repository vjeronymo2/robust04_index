			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region in southeast China has made remarkable  achievements in capital construction in such fields as energy  supply, transportation, raw materials and posts and  telecommunications.    Last year fixed-assets investment reached 27.2 billion yuan,  up 93 percent over the previous year. Infrastructure received a  record investment of 11 billion yuan, twice the amount for 1992.  And more than 8,200 projects were launched.    The region has introduced flexible measures to speed up the  construction of important projects. For instance, the first  joint- stock venture in the field of electric power was set up  last year to promote the construction of the Bailongtan Station,  which cost over 100 million yuan.    By the end of 1993 a total of 34 priority projects were  progressing smoothly, with over 20,000 long-distance telephone  lines and five fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed,  and ports achieving an annual handling capacity of 2.7 million  tons.    The region's construction industry has also seen remarkable  progress. In 1993 it registered 5.03 billion yuan in output  value, 78 percent more than in the previous year.    Meanwhile, the real estate market has been booming in the  area. Last year it grossed 1.4 billion yuan in sales of  commercial dwellings, making a profit of over 100 million yuan.    Meanwhile, the province has strengthened control over the  industry, having already closed down about 380 substandard real  estate companies.    So far, the region has 14 cities, with an urban population  of  7.38 million. In 1993 it poured 2.8 billion yuan into urban  construction, three times the figure for 1992.</p>

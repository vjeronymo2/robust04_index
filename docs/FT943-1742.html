			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden agrees to meet Kazarian for bid talks Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group that last week agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, yesterday reluctantly agreed to meet another would-be suitor in the shape of Mr Paul Kazarian, owner of a Rhode Island investment firm called Japonica Partners. Neither party would comment on the agenda for the meeting, but it is believed that Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of Sunbeam-Oster, the US consumer products group, has repeatedly expressed an interest in bidding for Borden since the food group put itself on the block earlier this year, only to have his approaches rebuffed. Borden's decision to agree to a meeting with Mr Kazarian comes amid mounting evidence that some Borden shareholders are deeply unhappy about the KKR deal and may revolt against it. Yesterday, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said it was advising the pension funds of its 150 affiliates, which between them hold at least 247,000 of Borden's 141.5m shares, not to tender their shares to KKR. It also said it was meeting other institutional investors to discuss its concerns about the KKR offer. Under the complex deal announced last week, KKR offered to exchange half its 35 per cent stake in RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, for 80 per cent of Borden's stock. RJR Nabisco would buy the remaining 20 per cent of Borden's shares, using newly issued RJR stock, and would also take an option to buy a 10 per cent stake in Borden from KKR. Borden shareholders are irked by several aspects of the deal. If they reject the offer, KKR still gets a 19.9 per cent stake in Borden at a bargain price of Dollars 11 a share - Borden's shares closed up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 14 yesterday - and will receive a Dollars 50m fee from Borden. Conversely, if the deal succeeds, Borden will have to pay KKR a Dollars 50m 'advisory' fee. Mr William Patterson, director of the office of corporate affairs at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the bottom line was that Borden shareholders were having their stock purchased at a time when it was at its lowest point with 'tremendous' upside, and in return they were receiving stock in RJR Nabsico which had substantial downside risks because of its potential tobacco liabilities. 'We are equally alarmed that this seems to be an extremely self-serving transaction from the point of view of KKR in the sense that they are paid a very large fee whether or not the deal happens,' he said. Few analysts believe Japonica's Mr Kazarian has access to the financial resources necessary to launch a serious bid for Borden. However, Mr Patterson said Borden's shareholders should wait and see whether other, better offers come along before accepting the KKR deal. 'Why the rush?' he said. 'The company's not going to implode overnight.' However, Mr Arthur Cecil, a research analyst with the T. Rowe Price mutual fund management group, a Borden shareholder, said the fact that investors were venting their frustration with the KKR deal was not necessarily an indicator that anything better will emerge. 'If I were a betting man, I would say that the KKR deal is pretty well done,' he said.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Forte to retain stake in Gardner Merchant FORTE yesterday announced the sale of its Gardner Merchant contract catering subsidiary to a consortium led by venture capital company CinVen, but said it would retain a 24.8 per cent stake. It also said it was acquiring 52 motorway restaurants and four hotels in France from the Accor hotel group for FFr540m (Pounds 63.8m). Forte will announce details tomorrow of a joint venture with Agip, the Italian state-owned petrol company, to manage 18 hotels in Italy. Forte will receive Pounds 342m in cash for Gardner Merchant, including repayment of inter-company loans. It will also get Pounds 29.6m in deep discount bonds and Pounds 28.6m in redeemable preference shares. It will receive Pounds 1.9m in ordinary shares and convertible redeemable preferred ordinary shares which will represent, on a diluted basis, 24.8 per cent of Gardner Merchant. Forte said Mr Garry Hawkes, Gardner Merchant managing director, would continue to run the business and, together with other senior staff, would subscribe for 8 per cent of the company. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, said his group had been offered the alternative of more cash but had decided to take a higher equity stake. He said the investors in Gardner Merchant hoped to float the company in four years' time. Mr Forte said the purchase of the restaurants in France would give Forte a 40 per cent share of the country's motorway catering business, second only to Accor. Lex, Page 16</p>

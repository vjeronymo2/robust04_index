			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-U.S. ARMS CONTROL ADVISER NITZE HAILS LATEST SOVIET OFFER TO CUT TROOPS  </P> <P> Paul H. Nitze, a key Reagan Administration arms control adviser, Wednesday  hailed as "extraordinary" a Soviet proposal to cut conventional forces and  urged President Bush to work "hammer and tongs" to nail down a pact.  </P> <P> "I think he ought to negotiate very seriously on it; the Soviets are moving  toward our initial (arms control) initiative," Nitze said in response to  questions at a National Press Club luncheon.  </P> <P> "I see no reason for not going at this hammer and tongs to try to work out this  conventional reduction and stabilizing proposal," Nitze said. "I'm sure they  will do that. I don't see how they could refuse to look at it."  </P> <P> Nitze, who advised President Reagan on a range of arms control matters, said  the proposal made by Soviet arms negotiators at a closed meeting with U.S. and  allied officials in Vienna on Tuesday nearly matches the one offered earlier by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union proposed sweeping reductions in its military forces in Europe,  including cutting 1.26 million troops and tens of thousands of tanks, artillery  and armored vehicles.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (12): SST-2 is still far away - A look at the successor to Concorde The development of a second-generation supersonic airliner to succeed the Anglo-French Concorde depends on two factors - satisfactory financing and production arrangements and solving the outstanding technological difficulties, especially those affecting the environment. Few doubt that such an aircraft will eventually emerge, although it is now accepted that its likely birthdate may be around 2010 to 2015. By 2000, Concorde will have been in service with British Airways and Air France for nearly 25 years, so that every year thereafter heightens the possibility of either a diminution of existing supersonic services as Concordes age and are 'cannibalised' for spares, or a gap of some years before a successor emerges. Despite the aerospace industry's desire to start developing a successor, there is little enthusiasm for such an aircraft among the world's leading airlines, faced as they are with their cumulative losses of more than Dollars 15bn over the past four years. They are more inclined to spend their available cash on airliners that are more likely to meet mass market demands, help reduce congestion and generate profits, than on second-generation supersonic transports. As a result, they are far more interested in a new subsonic 500-plus seater, the so-called megajumbo, than a second-generation supersonic transport. Moreover, the airlines remain suspicious about the financial and environmental acceptability of an SST-2. The two airlines flying Concordes, British Airways and Air France, have made it clear that while they may be interested in the long-term in any SST-2, they want to be absolutely sure that such an aircraft is profitable to buy and fly from the start, and totally acceptable in every way to the communities it will serve. They are keenly aware that government-imposed environmental constraints upon the airlines and aerospace industries are likely to become even more stringent in the next century, and such an aircraft, may well face environmental constraints that have not yet even been defined. The SST-2 research so far has been concentrated on an aircraft seating 300 passengers (against Concorde's 100), with a range of about 5,600 to 6,000 nautical miles (against Concorde's 3,000), and a speed of around about 1,500mph. Despite the undeniable advances in research into supersonic transport technology since Concorde first went into service in 1976, especially in the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions (N0x), the latter remain a problem. There is also still no answer to the sonic boom created by large aircraft flying at twice the speed of sound even at high altitude. This means that future supersonic services would still be largely restricted to over-ocean routes, with subsonic flights over land masses. This, in turn, means that interest in such aircraft is likely to be confined to those airlines with a substantial number of long-distance over-ocean flights in their overall operational patterns. There is also the problem of development cost, likely to be between Dollars 8bn-10bn, or about the same as the cost of any subsonic megajumbo. It is doubtful whether aerospace industries could finance both developments in tandem. Although demand for the megajumbo may be limited - with perhaps only a score or so airlines likely to support it initially - its ultimate market seems likely to be significantly larger than that for a second-generation SST. The airlines believe that the subsonic megajumbo is more likely to improve their battered balance sheets. Another reason for airline scepticism about the SST-2 is that while much technical research is under way, especially in the US through the government-sponsored National Aeronautics and Space Administration, there is still no sign of a coherent and practicable design, development, production and marketing plan for such an aircraft. While theoretically the airlines might prefer to have competitive designs from which to choose, industrial and financial logic dictates that one common design would stand more chance of economic and technological success. But any kind of agreement on such a formula appears to be a long way off. There have been wide-ranging international discussions between the US manufacturers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and their European counterparts, British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Alenia of Italy and DASA of Germany, with both Russian and Japanese companies also involved, on the possibilities of an eventual joint venture. At the same time, however, the US and European companies have also been pursuing their individual studies. The balance appears strongly to favour the US at present in terms of government financial involvement. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been, and still are being pumped into aeronautical research through NASA's own high-speed research programme, and by the leading engine and airframe manufacturers. There is no comparable coherent programme in Europe. Concerned at this situation, the leading European manufacturers earlier this summer told their respective governments and the EU that some level of state and/or community input to help research into a Concorde successor was essential, so as to ensure that Europe did not fall behind the US. So far, however, there has been little sign of any such cash support. Any single SST-2 venture would also probably have to be global anyway, to ensure the widest spread of costs and the biggest possible market. Whether US anti-trust laws would permit such an alliance remains a significant query. Demands for cash to finance the renewal of much of the existing ageing subsonic fleet are already heavy, and will escalate as traffic grows and fleet expansion becomes imperative. Lenders other than governments seem more likely to favour the procurement of a subsonic megajumbo, offering some guarantee of successful financial returns, than any SST-2 venture.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Safeland trebled to Pounds 1.09m Pre-tax profits at Safeland, the property trading and investment company, more than trebled in the six months to September 30, from a restated Pounds 327,000 to Pounds 1.09m. Turnover showed a similar increase, from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 14.6m. Mr Ray Lipman, chairman, said the results reflected the confidence that had returned to the market in early 1994, particularly in the residential sector. Trading opportunities were running 'at healthier levels than we have seen for a number of years', he added. Six retail investment properties were purchased during the half-year, increasing the value of the investment portfolio from Pounds 7.06m at the year end to Pounds 10.4m. Net asset value per share rose to 33.5p (32p). Earnings per share came out at 2.89p (1.05p). The interim dividend is 0.86p against 0.6p.</p>

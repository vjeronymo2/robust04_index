			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE AND PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> I fully agree with Kirk on the destructive nature of pornography. It's a  progressive "disease." It feeds on fantasy. If one continues to expose one's  self to pornography on a regular basis, what's normal and what's not gradually  gets blurred.  </P> <P> But ban pornography? That scares me more than the crime. The argument for  banning it to reduce the crimes of violence associated with it can validly be  used on other freedoms we have: i.e., the freedom to drink, to bear arms, and  on and on. To regulate it on moral grounds terrifies me. Who's going to be  making my moral decisions?  </P> <P> Pornography is not a positive thing for society. But who among us does not have  a vice, that if taken to the extreme, does not have the possibility of being  destructive?  </P> <P> JAMES C. FROELICH  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR FAMILY LEFT BEHIND, 'IT'S LIKE THEY CUT THE WORLD IN HALF'  </P> <P> "When they push the ship away from the pier, it's like they cut the world in  half -- and they did. They cut my world in half," said Karen Powell, whose  tears fell onto the 6-month-old baby in her arms as the destroyer-tender Acadia  pulled out of the 32nd Street Naval Station.  </P> <P> The first San Diego-based vessel leaving from the West Coast to join Operation  Desert Shield sailed Wednesday, marking a painful separation for the families  watching the ship depart.  </P> <P> Powell, a 30-year-old substitute teacher and mother of two, stood on Pier 7,  waving to her husband, Norman, who clutched his binoculars and stood sandwiched  between rows of sailors. As the 20,000-ton repair ship pulled away from shore,  Powell held her infant above her head.  </P> <P> "You feel so helpless," said Powell, whose husband has served 12 years in the  Navy. "There's nothing you can do."  </P> <P> Before the Acadia's 10 a.m. departure, the pier was crowded with couples  clutching one another and children crying. When the lumbering ship began to  draw away from the pier, a hush fell over the dock. One lone sailor ran toward  the vessel, clutching his bag, with his wife, three small children and a  supervising officer in tow. Too late to stop the ship, officers hurriedly  summoned a tugboat, dubbed Mister Randy, to relay Petty Officer 1st Class  Crescenio Corotan to the departing Acadia.  </P> <P> Corotan, a laboratory technician, was not initially scheduled to join the ship  on this deployment. But because his replacement never showed up, Corotan was  informed Tuesday that he would have to ship out.  </P> <P> "I was so happy because he wasn't going. Now it's all this rush and he didn't  have time to pack," said his wife, crying quietly.  </P> <P> Chaos erupted on the dock behind her. Husbands and wives yelled, some waved  signs. As Barrie Leonard clutched her 6-month-old baby, her other son, Kenneth,  6, bawled: "Daddy! Daddy! Don't leave me!"  </P> <P> The Acadia will not be deployed to an area where heavy fighting is anticipated,  since it is a repair vessel with little ability to defend itself. For the  families gathered on the pier, this fact provided some consolation.  </P> <P> While many were accustomed to routine six-month deployments, this departure was  different and the possible dangers seemed very real.  </P> <P> "I get this fear -- I am afraid I won't be seeing my husband anymore, that this  is the last time I see anybody," said April Adamson, 19, a sailor whose husband  stayed ashore.  </P> <P> Adamson is one of 300 female crew members aboard the Acadia, which also has 900  men. Though law prohibits women from participating in combat, they can serve  out of the line of fire. Currently, 460 women are deployed aboard vessels  participating in Operation Desert Shield. And so the pier was crowded with men  as well as women, left behind to take care of the children.  </P> <P> "It has to be done," shrugged Chris Faith, a shipping clerk who bid goodby to  his wife and walked hand-in- hand with his 7-year-old son and 4-year-old  daughter.  </P> <P> Six San Diego-based vessels are participating in Operation Desert Shield, but  those ships were already in the region. The Acadia is the first to leave the  city, sailing toward the Persian Gulf. Sending the Acadia, which could take  several weeks to arrive, suggests that the United States is hunkering down for  the long haul, experts said.  </P> <P> "It sure signals that we intend to keep our destroyers in the Persian Gulf a  long time," said retired Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, director of the Center  for Defense Information in Washington. "The indication is clear that ships  there intend to stay at least five months; otherwise they wouldn't need the  services of a tender."  </P> <P> The Acadia, commissioned in 1981, has been in the Persian Gulf before. The ship  assisted the Navy frigate Stark that was hit by an Iraqi missile in 1987.  </P> <P> The Acadia was originally expected to leave port in January. But because of  escalating tension in the Mideast, that departure was moved up to September.  And many families, though they learned of the schedule change a month ago, felt  the crunch of preparing for a six-month departure with relatively short notice.  </P> <P> "I think I am still in shock," said Kaye Hunter, ombudsman for the ship, who  clutched the hand of her husband, John, minutes before he boarded the vessel.  But the Hunters' 13-year-old son was more blunt.  </P> <P> "We were going to see my grandparents in New Mexico. This was going to be our  second Christmas together -- everything is shot," said John William Hunter,  gazing at his father. "Every time something good is happening, my dad is always  leaving."  </P></p>

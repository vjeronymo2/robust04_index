			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Waiting for carpets to bag a reasonable pile - The receiver's attempt to sell Lowndes Queensway's Carpetland chain ANOTHER CHAPTER in the saga of Lowndes Queensway, the furniture and carpet retailer which went into receivership in August last year, could soon be written. The chain's carpet business, which trades under the Carpetland name in England and General George in Scotland, has been formally put up for sale by Ernst &amp; Young, the receiver. Unusually for a receiver, Ernst &amp; Young has produced the sort of glossy marketing brochure which is more typical of an information memorandum produced by a merchant bank for a more conventional trade sale. The brochure has been sent to more than 20 possible purchasers in the UK and continental Europe, all companies with some retail connection, and some responses have already come in. Mr Terry Carter, the Ernst &amp; Young partner dealing with Lowndes, says the firm considered calling in a merchant bank to organise the sale but decided its own corporate finance department could handle the deal. Lowndes was formed by a Pounds 450m leveraged buy-out of Harris Queensway, Sir Phil Harris's business, in summer 1988. Mr James Gulliver, who headed the buy-out, had started negotiations with Sir Phil in the spring. Ironically, just as the talks started, UK base rates started to reverse their previous downward trend. By the time the deal was struck, interest rates were climbing again. That rise in rates was to be Lowndes' undoing. Higher interest rates both depressed sales in the stores, and increased the cost of the debt taken on to finance the deal. Even more ironically, the receivers were called in on the night of August 14 last year, only a few weeks before the first cut in interest rates came. When Mr Carter moved in he found a business with nearly Pounds 200m of bank loans, about 430 shops open, and sizeable on-going trading losses. The first hope was to sell the businesses off as going concerns, and a number of small deals were done. Since then 85 stores have been sold and contracts to sell another 12 have been exchanged. A further 52 have been dealt with, such as leases being surrendered to landlords, and Mr Carter says, there are offers on another 40 and expressions of interest in more. Meanwhile, Lowndes customers who had paid deposits have had their money back. One idea originally discussed was a management buy-out of the carpet business. But, says Mr Carter, by November this had been ruled out as conditions were simply not favourable to a deal. Having recognised that, Mr Carter says, he had to see what could be made out of the business. After cost-cutting and store closures, the reduction in size from 150,000 to 15,000 sq ft of a huge carpet-cutting centre, reductions in staff to about 830 people, and the establishment of a management team under Mr Ray Nethercott, a budget could be produced. This showed that, assuming no worsening in the economic climate, Carpetland should be able to make sales of about Pounds 50m and profits of perhaps Pounds 1m in the current financial year, to end-January 1992. Such is the operational gearing in retailing, that once the fixed costs are covered, any rise in turnover would feed through rapidly to profits without much in the way of marginal costs. The shops were operating at much higher turnover levels back in the consumer boom of the late 1980s and the implication is that Carpetland could make much higher profits in future years. This analysis persuaded Mr Carter, and the banks owed money by Lowndes, that it was better not to sell off Carpetland at any price but to hold on for a higher one. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the furniture side, now cut back to about 115 shops, with a turnover running at about Pounds 500,000 a week. The plan for this business continues to be to sell off shops in dribs and drabs, with outlets kept trading in the meantime to offset at least some of their costs. However, Mr Carter is hoping that a buyer for Carpetland could be persuaded that a purchase now would be the opportunity for a bargain. A lot of reconstruction work has already been done - not least the painful task of cutting staff numbers. Mr Carter is optimistic that Carpetland has a future, and reckons it has about 5 per cent of the UK carpet market. The book value of the Carpetland business is about Pounds 20m, including stock, although no value has been ascribed to short-lease properties, and a majority of the shops are owned on this basis. However, analysts feel that the likely sale price would include negative, rather than positive, goodwill. With luck, Mr Carter hopes to complete the Carpetland sale by mid-May but realises that the date may slip beyond that. On the other hand, he stresses this is not a fire sale, and though receivers are not normally long-term holders of companies, he is content to keep the busi-ness until the best offer - which could yet come from a management buy-out - can be obtained. While the Lowndes receivership is likely to drag on for some time yet, and the banks are now resigned to taking a substantial loss on their loans, at least part of the Lowndes business could soon be in the hands of a long-term owner again.</p>

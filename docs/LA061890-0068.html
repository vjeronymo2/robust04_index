			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYORS CALLING FOR REPEAL OF DEFICIT-REDUCTION LAW;  </P> <P> CITIES: THE LEADERS SAY URBAN PROGRAMS WOULD BE THE FIRST TO BE HIT BY  GRAMM-RUDMAN CUTS. THEY ALSO SEEK A LOWER SOCIAL SECURITY TAX.  </P> <P> America's mayors Sunday gave initial approval to a broad and costly domestic  agenda that asks Congress to repeal the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and  to cut Social Security taxes for nearly 120 million workers.  </P> <P> The more than 70 resolutions approved by the U.S. Conference of Mayors' key  policy committee contain repeated pleas for a multibillion-dollar infusion of  federal funds for anti-drug, housing, education and anti-poverty programs.  </P> <P> The resolutions endorsed Sunday will go before the full conference of more than  200 mayors Wednesday. But the panel's decisions are rarely changed  significantly in those votes, which set the lobbying agenda for the  organization's Washington staff.  </P> <P> The mayors, who have spent much of the first three days of their six-day annual  meeting criticizing the federal government for slashing aid to cities, said  repealing Gramm-Rudman would force lawmakers to confront the deficit.  </P> <P> "Too many of our members of Congress are using this as a crutch to hide some of  the true problems of our economy," said Mayor Paul Soglin of Madison, Wis. "A  series of budget gimmicks have been implemented."  </P> <P> Under Gramm-Rudman, automatic spending cuts take effect if Congress and the  White House do not meet specified deficit-reduction targets. The mayors  complained that city-level services would be the first to feel the automatic  cuts.  </P> <P> Conference staff said the mayors group -- if the full conference endorses the  proposal as expected -- would be the first organization of elected officials to  call for repeal of Gramm-Rudman.  </P> <P> In calling for the Social Security payroll tax to be cut from 7.65% to 6.71%,  the mayors panel also called on Congress to remove the cap on outside earnings  of Social Security recipients and stop using the balance in the Social Security  trust fund to mask the true size of the federal deficit.  </P> <P> Also included in one tax-related resolution approved Sunday was a statement  opposing a capital gains tax cut favored by President Bush.  </P> <P> Throughout this year's meeting, big-city mayors have been urging their  colleagues to be more militant in their lobbying of Washington and to lay claim  to a good chunk of expected defense savings by warning that urban tensions are  reaching a boiling point because of cash-poor anti-poverty programs.  </P> <P> Scuttled Sunday was a bid by some mayors to call for a constitutional amendment  that cities receive a "fair and fixed" percentage of federal revenues if  Congress refuses to pass a law mandating the revenue sharing.  </P> <P> That idea had sparked a split Saturday between conference committees on human  development and urban economic policy, with the latter group prevailing in  getting the amendment language deleted.  </P></p>

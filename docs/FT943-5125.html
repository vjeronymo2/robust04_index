			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Boeing launches big 737 version on back of orders - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of civil aircraft, yesterday launched a new version of its 737 twin-engine narrow body airliner family after securing commitments from four airlines, writes Paul Betts. The 737-800, launched at the Farnborough Air Show, is the largest member of the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft. Mr Ron Woodard, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft operations, said four undisclosed customers had committed themselves to order more than 40 of the airliners. The new 737-800s will seat 164 to 189 passengers and complement the new 737-700, which seats around 144 passengers. South West Airlines of the US and Maersk Air of Denmark have already placed launch orders for the 737-700. Mr Woodard said commitments for the 737-800 and 737-700 were worth around Dollars 2bn. Boeing also confirmed it was planning to launch a new smaller version of the 737, seating more than 100 passengers, as soon as it has secured sufficient initial commitment from airline customers. The group is also studying the development of a smaller 80 to 100 seat regional jet in collaboration with an Asian partner. The company is in active discussions with China and Japan over this project. Boeing indicated it is prepared to be a minority partner in a regional jet project with Asian partners, while maintaining overall leadership on the technology of the aircraft, which was likely to draw heavily on the 737 airline family. Boeing also announced four firm orders for Boeing 767-300ER jetliners - valued at Dollars 384m - that will be leased to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines by International Lease Finance Corporation. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is rationalising its aircraft fleet by replacing ten European Airbus A310 wide-body airliners with US Boeing 767-300 aircraft. It will lease seven Boeing 767 aircraft. The decision is a disappointment for Airbus, and reflects a trend among international airlines to rationalise their fleets to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Boeing also announced it was starting next-day shipment on available routine spare parts orders, in a move it said would potentially save customers millions of dollars. Mr Woodard said more than 400,000 different parts would be available 'ready for shipment the next day', or 30 times faster than the industry standard, through its Spare Parts Distribution Center in Seattle. Next-day shipment will be phased in at other spare parts centres in Altanta, Brussels, Singapore, London and, soon, in a new site in Beijing. Aircraft on ground orders, the most urgent category of spares, are now ready for shipment within two hours of the receipt of orders.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Exports make small dent in US trade deficit A REBOUND in exports led to a US trade deficit of Dollars 8.3bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in September, Dollars 300m lower than in August but still one of the biggest deficits in two years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The slight narrowing in the deficit reflected unexpected strength in exports, which rose 6.8 per cent from August to Dollars 38.2bn, a record in cash terms. The improvement was broadly based, with sectors such as computers, semiconductors and civilian aircraft rebounding after declines in August. Imports rose 4 per cent to Dollars 46.5bn, also a cash record. The increase was concentrated in consumer goods, reflecting a recovery of personal spending. The longer-term trends, however, point to a deterioration of the trade deficit in coming months. Adjusting for the volatility of monthly figures, exports have barely risen since the spring, while imports have increased sharply. The discrepancy mainly reflects stronger growth in demand in the US than in other big markets, such as Japan and Europe. The deficit for the first nine months of the year was Dollars 60.1bn, compared with Dollars 49.2bn in the same period last year. The geographical spread of the deficit indicated possible trade tensions next year with Japan and other Asian countries should the US recovery, and hence import demand, gather momentum. Last month, the US ran deficits of Dollars 4.4bn with Japan, Dollars 2.3bn with China and Dollars 1.7bn with Asia's newly-industrialised countries. By contrast it ran a surplus with most other regions, including western Europe and Mexico.</p>

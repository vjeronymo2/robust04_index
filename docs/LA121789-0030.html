			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESKY FURLOUGH PROVES JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND  </P> <P> It is with a degree of cynicism that I write this letter. On Nov. 16, a picture  of poor Ivan Boesky appeared in the business section.  </P> <P> Hollywood buffs will immediately notice that his appearance bears some  resemblance to the late great yachtsman and movie star, Sterling Hayden. Please  note that clutched in the prison-hardened left hand is a pair of yachting deck  shoes and jeans. In the right hand appears to be a soft bag, the type sailors  use for weekend yachting.  </P> <P> Prison has indeed changed Mr. Boesky. Madam justice may be blind, but in  white-collar crimes, she appears to have a taste for the good life.  </P> <P> CLARENCE C. GRAHAM JR.  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Scottish peat profits bogged down by wet spell MONTHS OF diluvial conditions in the peat bogs of Scotland followed by a long spell of wretched gardening weather in the suburbs of England caused shares in a leading maker of potting compost to fall 15 per cent yesterday. As the sun shone and temperatures soared, Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman of William Sinclair Holdings, reflected sadly on a combination of events which obliged the company to issue a profits warning to the stock exchange. Last summer was so squelchy in the company's peat bogs in Scotland that it could not cut the usual amount of peat for making into compost. The reduced harvest would have been just about sufficient, but in February and March the weather was so wet the company's machines became bogged down in the mire. 'They've had double the normal rainfall in that part of Scotland in the past 12 months - 55 inches,' Mr Sinclair said. To meet demand, the company had to buy in peat from other suppliers. But then came the miserable weather that affected most of Britain in May and early June which meant gardeners could not get to their flower and vegetable beds to dig in the annual injection of compost. 'You have to put it in during May and early June,' says Mr Sinclair. 'After that it's too late. In England and Wales we've had the wettest May for seven years.' Sales of J. Arthur Bowers compost, William Sinclair's brand, were sluggish in the crucial weeks as gardeners deserted the garden centres. Turnover in the entire British gardening market has been down 8 or 9 per cent this year, Mr Sinclair says. William Sinclair does not extract peat from picturesque, environmentally sensitive areas of the Highlands and Islands but from diggings close to former coal mines in the prosaic landscapes around Lanark and Falkirk in central Scotland. It has not been affected by controversy over the extraction of peat from sites of special scientific interest which has created difficulties for Fisons in Yorkshire and aroused the ire of the Prince of Wales. William Sinclair, based in Lincoln, told the stock exchange yesterday that because of 'cold and wet weather conditions' affecting its horticultural division, pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 would be 15 to 20 per cent below last year's Pounds 4.6m. He said the pet, aquatic and household products division had shown solid growth and the board intended to maintain its dividend of 7p per share. William Sinclair's shares fell 36p yesterday to close at 196p.</p>

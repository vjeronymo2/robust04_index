Industrials finished steady as the sector shrugged off lower world markets and a number of dividend payments from major companies.

The overall index ended 22.4 down at 5,901.8, industrials slipped just 4.3 to 6,942.9 and the gold shares index dropped 34.6 to 2,104.2. Banking stocks were firm again amid a lack of scrip and following recent good results and bullish prospects.</p>

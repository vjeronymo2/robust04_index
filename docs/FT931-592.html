			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / G7's reluctant convert to Russia's cause: Japanese misgivings about aid WHEN a mainstream Japanese magazine recently shouted 'Yeltsin, Starve to Death]', the harsh headline reflected a frustration distilled during a century of unease between the two countries and made more potent by international demands that Tokyo assist the 'unreliable Russians'. Through gritted teeth, Japan has invited Mr Yeltsin to the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven nations, but there is a deep anguish that the country must be pleasant to Russia without the prospect of much in return. Also, there is annoyance that most G7 members are blind to the Japanese vision of history. Other G7 countries may have haunting visions of the collapse of Russian democracy or of bloody civil war, but Japan dwells more on the past than the future. The preoccupation with settling old debts will colour the country's response in the coming months as the host-nation of the G7 summit in July, and play a sometimes difficult-to-perceive role in the international debate on Russia. Given an uncompromised choice, Japan would not rush to provide assistance to Russia. But, wanting to avoid an embarrassing diplomatic isolation, the government has promised funds, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the blunt but revealing foreign minister, retreated from his assessment that 'it is wrong to give top priority to economic assistance'. Japan has promised Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.97bn), more than half of which is trade insurance; so far a third of the total has been disbursed. History aside, Japan has genuine misgivings about pouring funds into Russia when there is no guarantee that they will be used profitably. The government has also agreed to host a meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers in mid-April, an event that will itself increase the pressure on Tokyo to give generously. Having once described the Russian leader as 'dishonest', Mr Watanabe is a good case study of the conflicting emotions working away inside Japanese officials. Policy on Russia is handled almost solely by the Foreign Ministry, in contrast to, say, China policy, which is influenced by vested economic interests and the personal interests of powerful politicians. While officials in Tokyo admit that China suffered terribly at the hands of the invading Japanese army, they are adamant that Russia was an unprincipled aggressor at the end of the Pacific war. The obvious symbol of this continuing 'injustice' is the disputed Kurile Islands group, known here as the Northern Territories, and occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the war. Mr Michio Royama, professor of international politics at Sophia University, explained that 'historically, we don't have a friendly feeling towards Russia,' and that there is a 'strong anti-Russian faction in the Foreign Ministry' which is distorting the Japanese reaction to the changes in that country. 'In the case of most countries, there are, you might say, 'pro' factions and 'anti' factions, as in the case of the US. This is not so with Russia,' Professor Royama said. 'There were a lot of frictions before World War Two, but people have forgotten what we did to Russia. Also, Russia has lost its power. It is not of value for Japan.' The rapid collapse of Russian power has exposed a long-hidden contempt in Tokyo, once intimidated by the Kremlin's claimed 'moral authority' of communism and in awe of Soviet military prowess. Communism has lost that power to intimidate as an ideology, and Russia was revealed to be a decaying society. Japan would prefer that other countries shared their suspicions. Professor Tadae Takubo of Kyorin University suggested that what Europeans see as a disaster, the dumping of Yeltsin, would serve Japan's interests: 'The most desirable outcome in Russia for Japan is that Yeltsin is defeated before the summit; Europeans would then lose a reason for supporting Russia'.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Issue flood tests investor demand NEW-ISSUE fever broke out in the international bond markets yesterday. Some bankers expressed bewilderment about whether investor demand will match the flow of issues, particularly with large transactions also coming soon from the World Bank and the Province of Ontario. 'It's the new-issue shop going mad again, just because it's the start of the year,' said one. The credit quality of borrowers joining in the early year stampede remained high, however, with top-rated supranationals featuring prominently. Credit Suisse First Boston said the two US dollar straights it launched for Toyota Motor Credit Corp and Intelsat were both successful for different reasons. The Dollars 300m three-year issue from Toyota, along with Ford Credit Australia, one of only two pure corporate borrowers so far this year, sold to both institutional and retail investors on its name recognition and benefited from a dearth of quality paper at the shorter end, said CSFB. Other bankers agreed that the spread on the Dollars 150m seven-year issue for Intelsat, the international satellite network, was right, but that while the credit appealed to them, Intelsat's paper tends to be held to maturity by institutional investors rather than traded. CSFB said it was premature to comment on rumours that Nordic Investment Bank was looking to do a Dollars 500m five-year issue through it as lead manager. The number of collared floating rate note issues is already giving cause for concern. While acknowledging the appeal of the interest rate floor these offer to investors, some bankers feel that with eight issues totalling Dollars 1.1bn in the first two working days of the year, there may be too much product in the market for the moment. European Investment Bank's Dollars 250m 10-year issue was arguably the pick of the day's new collared floaters, while Export Development Corp of Canada's tighter priced Dollars 100m issue with the same maturity looked unlikely to sell out quickly. Merrill Lynch, the lead manager, acknowledged that EDC's pricing was tight but argued that it is an infrequent borrower which sells well in Switzer-land. A number of borrowers are considering tapping the Canadian dollar market, say bankers, for a combination of traditional reasons. The currency is currently around its historical low point against the US dollar, leaving room for possible currency appreciation, and investors are attracted by the yield pick up over the US dollar of around 120 to 130 basis points. In the swaps market, spreads are historically high, offering some of the best opportunities around to achieve sub-Libor funding. The short burst of activity is not necessarily matched by investor demand, however, and banks are wary of repeating last year's oversupply when there were some CDollars 3bn of new issues in January. The volume of redemptions is unlikely to provide large-scale support for new issues until March, says Wood Gundy, when the bulk of the first quarter's CDollars 2.4bn or so of redemptions are due to take place. Nordic Investment Bank's CDollars 150m five-year issue went reasonably well, said lead manager Daiwa Europe, although it will take some time to sell. NIB is competing for attention with Credit Local's CDollars 300m three-year issue, which was thought to be suffering because of its size and because Credit Local is perceived as having been a touch too active as a borrower in the various markets. In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Finland's DM2bn issue was priced in the middle of the indicated range, to yield 53 basis points over comparable US Treasur-ies. Dresdner Bank, the lead manager, said the yield spread narrowed to 50-51 basis points in later trading. If it stays at that level, an increase is not ruled out. Deutsche Bank increased its self-led deal to DM1.5bn from DM1bn. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is running the books on a Pounds 200m additional tranche to the Kingdom of Sweden's five-year issue launched last November, taking advantage, it said, of domestic and international interest in sterling. UBS says that while the spread on the new tranche is 10 basis points higher than the original at 55 basis points over comparable gilts, the cost of funding to Sweden is less as swap rates have widened further.</p>

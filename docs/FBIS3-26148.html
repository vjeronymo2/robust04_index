			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kuo Hung-chih (0948 1347 3112): "Trend Report </F> by Academy of Social Sciences Believes China's Economic and  Political Reforms Will Continue To Face Difficulties This Year"]    [Text] A 1994 trend report by the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences [CASS], which will be published soon, points out  that there will still be difficulties this year in implementing  the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee on establishment of a market structure. There  will be no significant breakthroughs in the effort to change  government functions and the pace of political structural reform  will probably not be accelerated. Moreover, if the CPC cannot  effectively resolve the problem of corruption, social unrest may  appear in some parts of the country because of possible  resentfulness among the masses.    The report points out: A reason for the economic disorder on  the Chinese mainland last year was that the CPC was not  sufficiently prepared mentally for the appearance of an economic  boom after Deng's south China tour in 1992. As a result, the  ability of government involvement and control was unable to  catch up with social development. Moreover, as a result of the  reshuffle in the central and local government organizations last  year, the morale of some officials had been sapped and they have  taken an attitude of wait and see instead, and their ability to  handle affairs has thus decreased.    The report believes that to suit rapid changes in economic  and social fields and demand, it is necessary to split up  government functions. But at the same time, the administrative  power of the government should be relatively centralized,  because without this power the government will be unable to  exercise its functions. However, the splitting of government  functions is often confused with dispersed administrative power  and various government departments often make use of their power  to restrain each other, which has resulted in low work  efficiency.    The report is not optimistic about reform of government  organizations and change of government functions this year. It  points out: The CPC will still mainly rely on administrative  means to exercise social control this year, and its policies  will continue to play some superficial and temporary roles. It  also says that all three organizational reforms on the Chinese  mainland over the last 10 years or so were supposedly carried  out simultaneously with the change of leadership in state  organizations, but the first two were only touted in a big way  before leadership changes and then petered out after the changes  were made.    At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, held last November, a "Decision on Certain Questions  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure" was adopted, which will serve as a general program  for changing the economic structure in the future. The report  of the Academy of Social Sciences points out: Although this  decision is operable in concrete practice, judging from the  current management ability and authority of the mainland  government, its implementation remains an arduous task. It  warns that when implementing this "decision" in various economic  reforms, its possible impact on political and social affairs  should not be overlooked.    On the relationship between central and local authorities,  the report says that it is necessary to resolve the  contradictions between central and local authorities arising  from the implementation of the revenue-sharing system. It  particularly points out that with the expansion of the scale of  opening to the outside world, there will be increasing space for  various localities to participate in international activities.  However, local governments should not regard participation in  international activities as their central work. If they go  against major diplomatic policies of the central authorities,  the latter should deal with them seriously so that they do not  lose their authority.    Many people are expecting that the change in the mainland's  economic structure will bring forth a reform of its political  structure. But the report believes that at present, conditions  are still not ripe for carrying out political structural reform.  This year, the pace of legislative work and the legalization  drive will be faster than last year, but that of political  structural reform will remain basically the same.    On the problem of corruption, the report predicts that if  substantive results are not achieved in the "struggle against  corruption," the masses of people will be disappointed and  resentful, which will affect social stability to a certain  extent. But it believes that if the CPC handles the matter  properly, resentfulness in some parts of the country will not  result in overall disorder.    In conclusion, the report of the Academy of Social Sciences  points out: The most important work for 1994 is to maintain  political stability and continue to strengthen economic reform  and construction.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Earthquake aid flown to India INDIA received its first foreign shipment of disaster relief aid since independence in 1947 when a US cargo plane carrying tents and shelter material touched down at Bombay airport yesterday, Reuter reports from Bombay. The aircraft also carried US President Bill Clinton's personal envoy, Mr Ray Flynn, who will assess India's aid needs following Thursday's earthquake. Meanwhile, the death toll in the country's worst natural disaster since independence is probably far less than the 30,000 earlier feared. Police and rescue workers had estimated the number of dead and missing at 30,000. But Mr Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra chief minister, put the total number of bodies recovered so far at 9,349, and officials said the final figure was unlikely to be much more than double that.</p>

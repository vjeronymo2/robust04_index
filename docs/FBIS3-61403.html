			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, president of the </F> Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, full member of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, and twice Hero of Socialist Labor, by  PRAVDA correspondent Viktor Drozd; place and date not given:  ``Academies of All Countries, Unite!''--first paragraph is  PRAVDA introduction]    [Text] The founding meeting of the International  Association of Academies of Sciences (IAAS) was held in Kiev.  One of the initiators of its establishment, President of the  Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, a full  member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and twice Hero of  Socialist Labor, answers the questions of a PRAVDA correspondent.    [Drozd] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you appraise the policy  of  Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries of the CIS with respect  to science, first of all basic science?    [Paton] The cooperation of labor of scientists of Ukraine,  Russia, and the other countries, which were a part of the USSR,  is very significant. This cooperation enriched world science  with outstanding achievements and discoveries. The harm, which  is being done today to science in our countries under the  conditions of the growing economic crisis and is hard to  compensate for, is all the more perceptible. Creative  collectives and traditional ties, which were established by the  efforts of scientists of several generations, are  disintegrating, the scale of basic research in the most  promising, vitally important directions is decreasing. This then  and there resulted in a substantial decrease of the overall  level of scientific research, affected the quality of the  training of scientists and scientific and technical personnel,  and caused irreversible consequences in the entire system of  education. Today the governments are no longer able to finance  properly even the most prestigeous research institutions that  are concentrated in the academies of sciences. Hence the mass  ``brain drain.''    All this represents an unmistakable threat to the national  interests of Russia, Ukraine, and the other sovereign states and  is fraught with the most serious consequences for the  intellectual potential of our peoples. For, as the great Pasteur  noted, science should be the most sublime incarnation of the  homeland. At all times in the most developed countries  scientists enjoyed special attention and privileges. Precisely  the labor of scientists promoted the economic and social  progress of these states. It is appropriate to mention that in  the five most developed countries (the United States, Japan,  Germany, Great Britain, and France) the financing of science per  scientific worker came in 1992 on the average to  $130,000--several hundredfold more than in our countries. Such a  situation threatens us with chronic backwardness and the  irrevocable loss of previously gained leading positions in world  science.    [Drozd] What must be done to correct the situation?    [Paton] It is necessary to formulate quickly a goal-oriented  technological strategy, which has been coordinated with the  program of the structural reorganization of industry and the  conversion of the defense complex and with economic  organizational transformations. Further it is necessary to  increase state support of basic research and to develop the  innovation process. To form what is called ``firm'' science, to  establish large state sectorial and intersectorial scientific  and technological centers in priority directions, and to ensure  the rapid transfer of technologies between the civilian and  military spheres.    All this should be provided for in the state concept of  scientific and technical policy. Ukraine, Russia, and the other  countries, which have come into being on the territory of the  USSR, thus far do not have such a concept. The efficient  coordination of the structures of the state management of the  scientific and technical sphere and the financial support, which  is independent of them, of priority basic scientific research  are needed.    [Drozd] Will the established association, apparently, serve  the restoration of the intellectual potential and broken  scientific ties?    [Paton] The scientists of the academies of sciences of the  republics, which were a part of the USSR, are sincerely  interested in the continuation of cooperation that is based on  the community of a large number of scientific schools.  International experience also confirms that progress in science  is impossible both without the narrow specialization of  scientists and without the integration of sciences. The role of  science and scientists in the establishment and strengthening of  a favorable climate of interrelations among states is also  indisputable. That is why the aspiration to preserve the jointly  produced scientific potential is inducing people to specific  actions. One of them is the uniting of leading scientists in the  International Association of Academies of Sciences.    [Drozd] In what will the activity of the association  consist?    [Paton] The concept of the association in the process of its  formulation and discussion changed, subject to the political  situation. And this is understandable. The changes in the state  structure and the profound crisis of national and economic  relations, by which the countries that were a part of the USSR  were affected, are also affecting the sphere of science. It is  therefore exceptionally important to create precisely now such  conditions for the cooperation of scientists of the sovereign  states, which would make it possible to use effectively the  common intellectual potential.    Of course, the IAAS neither in its goals and functions nor  in  the nature of its activity will be any administrative  superstructure over the national academies of sciences. Each of  them (and not just those from the countries of the CIS) in its  activity is completely independent of the association and is  guided by its own charter and the legislation of its state.    The basic work of the association will be concentrated in  permanent and temporary committees for fields, directions, and  the most important problems of science, which can be established  at scientific centers that hold a leading position in their  field. Fundamentally important questions of the development of  basic science will be discussed at sessions of the general  assembly or at conferences of the association.    [Drozd] What assets will the IAAS have? Who will finance it?    [Paton] It is proposed to carry out the financing of the  IAAS  both by means of subsidies of the association members themselves  and by means of expert and scientific consulting activity and  charitable contributions.    [Drozd] How many national academies of sciences were  founders  of the association?    [Paton] The establishment of the IAAS has now been supported  by 12 countries of the former USSR. The republics of the Baltic  region have expressed interest in cooperating with the  association after its establishment. The Academies of Sciences  of Vietnam, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic are also among  those who signed the agreement on the establishment of the  Association. The last two did so as observers. Representatives  of the international scientific community: Sir Arnold Bergen,  president of the Academy of Europe, and Prof. Mohammed Hassan,  executive secretary of the Academy of Sciences of the Third  World, also took part in the founding meeting of the IAAS. The  agreement on the association is open for signing by the  academies of sciences of other states.</p>

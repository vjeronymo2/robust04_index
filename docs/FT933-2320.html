			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / EC labour costs to fall below Japan: Survey shows Europe narrowing gap with US AVERAGE European Com-munity hourly labour costs will this year fall below those in Japan for the first time, and Europe is also narrowing the gap with the US, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual survey of European labour costs. The survey, based on production workers in manufacturing, casts some doubt on the growing pessimism about Europe's ability to compete in world markets. But the favourable trend for European hourly wage costs is largely due to the strength of the yen and the dollar and European wages are still expected to rise faster than in the US or Japan this year. The survey predicts a rise of 4.9 per cent in Europe, down from 5.7 per cent in 1992, compared with 3.2 per cent in the US and 2.8 per cent in Japan. The survey also finds that western Germany's wage cost problem is deteriorating further. The country tops the league table with an hourly average of Dollars 25.34, well ahead of Switzerland on Dollars 22.48. The problem is compounded by the strength of the D-Mark against other European currencies. In contrast Britain's labour costs will drop to an hourly average of Dollars 12.90 this year, less than half the German rate and a third lower than the European average. The UK is placed 12th in the table of 16 western European countries at the lower end of the 'Europe medium' cost band which is headed by France, moving ahead of Italy and Finland. The 'Europe high' group in order of cost is: western Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. The Europe 'medium group' is France, Italy, Finland, UK, Ireland and Spain, while the Europe 'low group' is Greece and Portugal, with the latter on Dollars 4.69 per hour. 'While France has pursued a 'franc fort' policy, Italy has been able to reap the benefits of currency devaluation following the lira's suspension from the ERM last year. The UK figures suggest that a similar pattern is emerging for Britain', says Mr Graham Hatton, director of the survey. The survey takes account of all direct payments made to employees, including overtime, bonuses and holiday pay, plus non-wage costs incurred by employers such as health and social insurance costs. On that basis, average weighted EC labour costs will be Dollars 18.64 an hour this year - a 6.5 per cent decline since last year in dollar terms - compared with Dollars 16.58 in the US, up 7 per cent year-on-year, and Dollars 19.05 in Japan, up 18 per cent. For western Europe, including several non-EC European countries, the figure is Dollars 19.08. The gap between European and US labour costs will narrow to 15 per cent in 1993, against 26 per cent the previous year.

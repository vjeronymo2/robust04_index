			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Lim] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (AFP)--Cronies and relatives of  China's ruling elite are at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar  fraud, setting up their own firms in Hong Kong and then loading  them up with Chinese state assets, financial sources here said.    Mainland assets worth more than three billion dollars have  been squirrelled away in these firms, which also generate  profits that go back into private pockets rather than to the  state, they said.    Hong Kong and Chinese financial watchdogs are impotent to  combat the fraud, which is masked by a thick-woven web of  personal contacts and exploits differing financial controls in  the British colony and the Communist mainland.    The fraud entails so-called "nominee" firms which are set up  in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese. There are around 2,000 at  present, either publicly listed or wholly privately-owned.    Reliable sources in the Hong Kong banking world said many of  these "nominee" firms had been loaded up with assets from some  of the 50 Chinese state-owned firms which have now registered in  Hong Kong and comprise seven percent of the market's  capitalisation.    "In my estimate, at least three billion dollars in assets  have been swindled," a Japanese banking official, whose company  has widespread business interests in China, said.    The asset transfer goes via a so-called "backdoor listing,"  in which a shell company is set up by an individual, and then  the Hong Kong-listed state firm buys into its capital and hands  over some assets, such as factories, office buildings and land.    In this way, the transferred assets become "joint ventures,"  a status that gives them big tax advantages in China and also  protects them from being sold, should China ever decide to  privatise its state sector.    Profits from the venture are recycled into secret bank  accounts, used for property or stock speculation in Hong Kong,  or "reinvested" as share options in the nominee firm, sources  said.    A Chinese Communist official in charge of overseeing Chinese  firms in Hong Kong said he was bitter and frustrated at the  extent of the scam.    "Money now rules these state-owned enterprises," he said.  "They no longer think of the welfare of the party or the state."    The sources said a core of figures, known as "taizidang," or  princelings, was most active in the scam, many of them the  offspring of party leaders and political chiefs surrounding  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened up China's economy.    Hong Kong financial regulators say they cannot interfere in  the activities of these firms, as under Hong Kong law nothing  illegal has been done because assets are on Chinese soil.    Speaking for mainland businesses in the territory, Chao  Suicong, vice chairman of the Chinese Enterprises Association in  Hong Kong, said: "All our members have been approved by the  state, and they follow Chinese policy and Hong Kong law."    "So far, we haven't heard of any of our members stealing  state assets."    Despite this official serenity, the Chinese government is  showing signs of deep disquiet at the scent of corruption and  its dwindling stock of state assets.    According to official estimates, cited by XINHUA news agency  Sunday, cheap sales of state assets have cost the country 60  billion dollars over the past decade.    The State Council, or cabinet, has now issued a circular  tightening regulations governing transfer of state property,  requiring all assets to be accurately evaluated and banning all  transfers at an "unrealistically low price" or on credit.    It also requires all sales of property by local state firms  to be approved by city administrations above prefectural level,  while deals involving large enterprises and those under central  management must be forwarded to the State Council.    The move intends belatedly to reassert central control over  the behemoths, analysts said.    State firms which have a listing in Hong Kong report not to  their nominal ministry as other state enterprises do, but to  their local governments -- a factor that has boosted regional  political power as well as cronyism.</p>

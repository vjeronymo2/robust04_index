			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / People: Ford seeks to clean up Ford, following in the wheeltracks of Volkswagen, has appointed a full-time director to oversee the car-maker's environment and safety-related activities in Europe. The appointment as director, environment and safety, of Austrian-born Walter Brandstetter, 52, underlines the increasing importance environmental issues are assuming to all Europe's car-makers, as pressure mounts on them to produce 'cleaner', more economical vehicles, to use less energy and materials to make them, and finally recycle efficiently the nearly 15m cars Europe scraps each year. Brandstetter, who received his doctorate at Vienna's Technical University and who has previously combined technical stints at General Motors and Volkswagen with a career in lecturing, will have a similar role at Ford to that of Ulrich Steger at Volkswagen. Steger became Volkswagen's full-time head of 'green' affairs last year; the first appointment of its kind in Europe. Since joining Ford in 1988, Brandstetter has been head of engine engineering at Ford in Germany, and thus has also played a significant role in the development of new engine families like the Zeta, on which Ford is relying heavily to restore its lacklustre reputation for engine development inside Europe. He will continue to be based in Germany, where he was recently made an honorary professor by Lower Saxony's Minister of Science and Culture.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Observer: Common denominator The rise of Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat Party leader who is set to become Thailand's next prime minister, is dealing a heavy blow to the country's reputation for having an exotic and incomprehensible political system staffed by gangsters, retired generals and fanatical Buddhists. The mild-mannered Chuan  - whose pastimes include playing darts alone at home  - has startled the neighbours in the squalid quarter of Bangkok where he lives by appearing on television and turning out to be quite important. He is, in short, Thailand's answer to John Major. 'He is very quiet. He doesn't mind when the drunken neighbours make a lot of noise, breaking glass or singing late at night,' according to one local taxi driver quoted in The Nation newspaper. Chuan's critics say he is as incapable of making important political decisions as he is of getting angry with the neighbours, but most Thais seem relieved at the prospect of being led by such an unremarkable man. The alternatives include the aforementioned generals and gangsters and Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist who led the street protests in May (when 50 demonstrators were killed) and who abstains from sex  - even with his wife.</p>

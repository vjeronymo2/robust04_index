What, you might reasonably ask, should you do with your CD? What has happened to DAT? And who is to say that DCCs and/or MDs will not go the same way (nowhere, fast)? However, jazz music buyers with an interest in these things should note that PolyGram, which is owned by Philips, will soon release potentially big selling albums from Stan Getz, Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Henderson in DCC format, on its Verve jazz label. Over at EMI, meanwhile, the Blue Note label continues to mine its back catalogue of lovingly hand-crafted analogue recordings for transfer to CD - and CD only. This latest series of 'Classic Blue Notes' consists of four sides of greasy originals and standards on one disc from Hammond organist Jimmy Smith (Plain Talk and Open House). Recorded in 1960, subsequently remastered but not released until 1967, the discs are class all-star sessions. Smith's captivating Hammond sound was often used as a comfortable, easy moving vehicle for the label's top horns to relax with and these dates feature trumpeter Blue Mitchell and saxophonists Ike Quebec (tenor) and Jackie McLean (alto) kicking back into a wild blue yonder. The series includes a similarly blue tinged bag of standards from tenorist Stanley Turrentine with wife Shirley Scott piloting a chintzier Hammond (Never let me go) and a Seventies soul time capsule from trumpeter Donald Byrd (Blackbyrd). The latter is a tremendous period piece whose chunky groove and wah wah guitar conjure up pictures of cool, Shaft-like dudes in bubble hair-dos and long leather coats. At opposite ends of the swing spectrum is Art Blakey's sextet version of the Messengers, Buhaina's Delight and Early Circle, Chick Corea's abstract quartet (Anthony Braxton, Dave Holland and Barry Altschul) of 1970 which completes the series. Two contemporary but very different CDs worth exploring are Paul Grabowsky's Tee Vee and Spirits Rejoice from the Dedication Orchestra. Australian composer/pianist Grabowsky is a thoughtful stylist along the lines of Bill Evans with some good tunes. His tempered playing here is set against the better established talent of fellow Aussie, tenorist Dale Barlow. The splendidly overwrought 24-piece Dedication Orchestra is a celebration of the South African ex-pat Blue Notes, whose wayward improvisation found a welcome home in London in the Sixties. It is also an effervescing showcase of the city's most liberated jazz musicians and sure to become a collectors item for that reason alone.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Retail investors board Coupon Express - International It must be difficult to get a seat on the 'Coupon Express' from Brussels to Luxembourg, if the recent flood of Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance is anything to go by. The train, which leaves the Belgian capital in the morning and arrives in the Grand Duchy a few hours later, is a favoured route for wealthy Belgians whenever they need to attend to their financial affairs. After a good lunch at one of Luxembourg's many restaurants, they can pay a quick visit to their bank to buy some more bonds or cash their coupons and be back in Brussels by the evening without the Belgian tax inspector being any the wiser. Although in recent years, the eurobond market has become more geared to the institutional investor with the evolution of large global bond issues, the Luxembourg franc sector is one of the few remaining bastions of the old-style retail investors which prosper in the Benelux region. Mr Frank Reinert, senior manager of origination and syndication at Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, estimates that about 80 per cent of Luxembourg franc eurobonds are bought by retail investors. There are two main attractions: the two currencies have long been linked, so the foreign exchange risk is minimal; and, unlike Belgium, Luxembourg does not levy a withholding tax on interest income. Furthermore, even though there is a liquid primary market in Luxembourg franc eurobonds, there is virtually no secondary market because the bonds are invariably held until maturity, says Mr Tom Ineke, syndicate officer at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. As a result, they rarely react to the volatility which frequently occurs in the secondary market. 'This means that they are a pretty safe investment,' says Mr Ineke. In both 1991 and 1992, Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance topped LFr200bn, according to IFR Securities Data. But last year issuance fell to just over LFr150bn as the drop in bond yields to historically low levels prompted investors to switch out of medium to long-dated bonds into bank deposits, money-market funds or equities. 'Three-year to five-year deals had yields below 6 per cent and 10-year bonds just above 6 per cent, and clients did not like that,' says Mr Reinert. However, since January, the yield on 10-year Belgian government bonds has jumped from just under 6.5 per cent to almost 8.5 per cent. As a result, investors have been moving their cash out of deposit accounts, where they were getting around 4 per cent, back to the long end of the yield curve where the returns are greater. So far this year, Luxembourg franc eurobond issuance has reached just over LFr190bn, and could rise above the levels reached in the early 1990s if the recent run of offerings continues. The relatively high redemption flows this year suggest that subscriptions will remain healthy. According to Mr Reinert, LFr118bn could theoretically be re-invested in the market this year. Unlike the rest of the eurobond market, the emphasis in the Luxembourg franc sector is not on the yield differential against the underlying government bonds, but on the coupon or yield. 'If you can offer the psychological yield of 7 per cent or 8 per cent, people will buy it,' says Mr Ineke. Meanwhile, borrowers have been keen to tap this market because of the attractive swap opportunities. The swaps, which are done against the Belgian franc, have enabled issuers with triple-A rating to achieve funding levels of as much as 20 or 30 basis points below Libor in recent weeks. The renewed activity in the sector has been accompanied by an increase in the size of individual offerings from about LFr500m a few years ago to about LFr5bn. However, syndicate managers believe that this corner of the eurobond market will remain the preserve of the retail investor. It is rare to see anything other than a fixed-rate deal, and the few attempts to diversify into equity-linked or dual-currency transactions have not had much success. The lack of a Luxembourg franc swap market has also deterred some borrowers. Some Luxembourg banks which underwrite the bonds do not run a swap book, which means that another counterparty has to be brought in to execute this part of the deal. Although these menages a trois have been harmonious so far, such an arrangement could easily end in tears.</p>

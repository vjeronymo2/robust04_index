			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Soros takes 35% gain on British Land sale Mr George Soros, the international financier, has sold the majority of his Quantum Fund stake in British Land for a 35 per cent profit, and has also disposed of the fund's shares in Berkeley Group, the Surrey-based housebuilder. The proceeds of the British Land stake will be ploughed back into the British Land Quantum Property Investment Partnership (BLQ), Mr Soros's Pounds 500m joint venture with British Land. The shares were part of a 4.8 per cent stake purchased when the fund was set up. Quantum UK Realty and G. Soros Realty Investors sold 5.3m British Land shares at 402p, compared with their 298p purchase price. They retain 4m shares. The Quantum Fund also sold 2.48m shares in Berkeley Group, which, based on yesterday's closing price of 398p, raised about Pounds 9.86m. The Berkeley shares were purchased in January 1993 at less than 330p. Mr Soros and his Quantum Fund will realise Pounds 21.3m from the British Land disposal, but this is to be reinvested in the fund in addition to the Pounds 250m already committed to BLQ. Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said British Land would match the additional Soros investment, enabling the fund to invest a further Pounds 80m since the equity would be matched by debt. The setting up of the Quantum Fund marked a turning point in perception towards the UK property market, and the share price of British Land has reacted accordingly since Mr Soros took his stake. Brokers said it made sense for Mr Soros to focus his investments in the UK property market on the British Land fund. The fund has so far invested Pounds 600m in UK property, and Mr Weston Smith said it was roughly 55 per cent geared, indicating that Quantum and British Land have each injected Pounds 135m in equity funding. The fund's main purchases have been the Pounds 128m Sterling Estates portfolio and a Pounds 70.5m office property at Leadenhall Street, in the City of London. It has also purchased a 29.9 per cent stake in the property developer Stanhope, which it is hoping will enable it to secure a half share of Broadgate Properties, also in the City, providing a high quality core to the Quantum portfolio.

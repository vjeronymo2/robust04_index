			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa  said Salvadoran authorities could not prevent the departure of  U.S. Major Mike Lopez as the U.S. Embassy acted in accordance  with the Vienna Convention, which protects diplomatic officials.    Although Gen. Corado deplored the murder of Salvadoran  bodyguard Crecensio Diaz, he said that in his opinion the U.S.  Embassy acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention articles  that regulate diplomatic relations. Nevertheless, Corado added,  diplomatic immunity does not mean that embassy officials cannot  be punished according to the laws of their own countries when  they commit a crime.    [Begin Corado recording] The Salvadoran Government has the  right to remain vigilant in this case and demand from the U.S.  Government, which represents U.S. interests, that Maj. Lopez be  judged according to U.S. laws in an impartial trial. [end  recording]    According to Corado, if Maj. Lopez left the country in a  U.S.  aircraft, it could not be intercepted, because the personnel and  the infrastructure, including ground vehicles and air vessels of  foreign missions, are also protected by diplomatic immunity.    [Begin Corado recording] Extraterritoriality exists in  embassies, aircraft, or any other type of vehicle owned by the  embassy. Therefore, whenever a foreign citizen or diplomatic  official is aboard an embassy aircraft, car, or any type of  vehicle, it is as if he were in his own country. [end recording]    On another subject, regarding the fact that many Central  American countries are reorganizing their armies, Corado said  that the Salvadoran Armed Forces are not opposed to changes as  adjustments consonant with the current situation in the country  can be made.</p>

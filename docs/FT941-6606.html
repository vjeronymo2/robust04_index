			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: PolyGram While other entertainment companies diversify in response to multi-media mania, PolyGram makes a strong case for the virtues of single-mindedness. Despite delays in releasing hit records and with recession still rippling through its home European markets, PolyGram lifted net income by 21 per cent in 1993. Imagine what would have happened in a good year. Efficiency gains nudged operating margins up to 12.6 per cent. Weak European sales were offset by a 31 per cent gain in the far east and a strong performance in the rest of the world. After some years of disappointment, PolyGram's US business is also coming good, benefiting from unutilised tax losses. The acquisition of Motown will further help the cause. Sales of classical music, which account for 12 per cent of revenues, may be increasingly squeezed by cut-price competitors. But the company can more easily resist the trend in pop music where teeny boppers with a craving for the Cranberries have nowhere else to go. PolyGram's focus grows somewhat fuzzy round the edges with its infant film production business still losing money. It may cautiously explore other ventures in related fields, such as video games and publishing. That threatens to dilute short-term financial returns but may increase PolyGram's industrial appeal as a global software factory. Few investors are likely to sell such a prospect.</p>

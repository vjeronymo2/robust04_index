			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Gilts: Investors nervous on supply signs BUYING pressure for gilt-edged securities continued, even though at the end of last week investors showed a touch of nerves on indications about a large supply of the instruments over the next two years. During the week yields came down by about 10 basis points for long-dated securities and by slightly more for instruments at the short end of the yield curve. But, the accompanying rise in prices was reversed on Friday after news of a Pounds 1.2bn public sector borrowing requirement in December, far above most City estimates. The figure indicates that the Treasury's forecast of a Pounds 10.5bn PSBR for 1991-92 is unlikely to be met. It is more likely to be about Pounds 12bn, with a borrowing requirement of perhaps twice this in 1992-93. Of concern to many investors is that a large increase in gilt issues - which would be needed to pay for public spending over the next two years - could lead to a glut of the securities, depressing prices. Other potential negatives for gilt investors concern the election, which must be fought by July. A change of government would introduce new uncertainties into the gilt market, which is worried by the prospect of the still larger borrowing that could be required to pay for a Labour administration's spending plans. Such considerations, and the possibility that sterling might further test its limits in the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) over the next few months, have led some gilt specialists to wonder if the recent rise in gilt prices might be about to end. Mr Mark Cliffe, an economist at the London office of Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, said he thought the market had recently indulged in 'wishful thinking' about the prospects for gilts. In his view, the difficulties because of the ERM constraint in reducing UK base rates from their current 10.5 per cent would decrease the popularity of the government, reducing its chances of a clear-cut election victory. If Mr Cliffe is right, the recent downward movement for yields will soon start to run out of steam. The underlying support by many investors for gilts in the second half of 1991 was highlighted by a Bank of England report showing long-term investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and investment, unit and property unit trusts, bought a net Pounds 1bn of UK government securities in the third quarter of 1991 after being net sellers of nearly Pounds 3bn of such securities in the first half of 1991. The institutions sold a net Pounds 2.96bn of UK government securities in 1990 and Pounds 6.49bn in 1989 when the government's finances were in surplus. Last week the trend of continued gilt purchasing was clear, with prices edging up. The Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing in 2008 was quoted on Friday night at 98 17/32 , a rise of just under 1 point on the week, while the shorter-dated 10 per cent Treasury stock due in 1994 rose in price by rather less. It was quoted at 100 21/32 on Friday, from 100 7/16 the previous week. The only stocks which fared poorly (with yields staying roughly unchanged) were in the 10-year maturity range. This area of stock is to feature in a Bank of England gilt auction on January 29, with the Bank due to announce tomorrow further details, and the likelihood of up to Pounds 2bn of gilts in this maturity range coming on to the market in the near future kept many investors from buying. Part of the reason for the price increases were a spate of data which were favourable for bonds generally. They showed little sign of an imminent end to the recession, and indicated inflationary pressures in the UK economy are likely to remain low, a development which will probably tempt more investors into bonds as opposed to other types of stock. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that in December the year-on-year rate of increase in prices of goods at the factory gate - the key measure of core inflation - was the lowest for 2 1/2 years. In December, prices at the factory gate were only 5 per cent higher than in December 1990, against a rise of 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to November. Meanwhile, the retail-prices index, which provides a measure of so-called headline inflation, rose by just 0.1 per cent between November and December, the lowest figure since July. Even though the year-on-year rate last month rose to 4.5 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in November, behind the figures is a large element of price cutting in shops and by companies offering consumer services, underlining the weakness in the economy. A continued fall in inflation is good news for the government. But a problem for the Conservatives is that, due to the ERM factor, a cut in UK base rates is likely only after the German Bundesbank decides its rate reduction. And that may not be until well into the spring, or even later, a development which may be delayed too long to boost the 'feel good' factor among voters and so help the Tories' chances in the election.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Borland Int'l plunges 48% in second term BORLAND International, the US personal computer software company, reported a sharp drop in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, as revenues fell 16 per cent. Net income was Dollars 2.8m, or 11 cents per share, down 48 per cent from Dollars 5.4m or 20 cents last year. Revenues declined to Dollars 107.4m from Dollars 127.8m. Borland blamed the declines partly on a court order that forced it to temporarily withdraw and make changes to its spreadsheet programme, Quattro Pro. It is involved in a dispute with rival Lotus Development, which has accused Borland of copying certain features of its 1-2-3 spreadsheets. Borland quickly issued a new version of Quattro Pro omitting the offending features. In a bid to gain market share, it has priced its new version of Quattro Pro at less than half that of competing spreadsheet programs. Borland said it was also hit by weakness in Europe.</p>

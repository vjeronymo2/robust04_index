			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: G7 backs benefits restraint, says PM MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday claimed growing international recognition of the need to rein in the escalating cost of state-funded social provision, Philip Stephens writes. In a statement to MPs on the outcome of the Tokyo summit, the prime minister said that the seven leading industrial nations had also endorsed Britain's call for increased de-regulation and labour market flexibility to halt the rise in structural unemployment. But he faced calls from Labour leader Mr John Smith for an immediate cut in interest rates to bring down the jobless total. Mr Smith said he welcomed the recognition that there was insufficient growth and too much unemployment and called for 'closely co-ordinated international action' to combat both problems. Mr Major's comments came as Downing Street refused to rule out the possibility that the government's long-term spending review could suggest the eventual replacement of the basic state pension with private insurance schemes. Officials, however, said that there was no question of the government abandoning during this parliament its commitment to a universal state pension uprated annually in line with inflation. Mr Major said the agreement negotiated in Tokyo to restart the Gatt world trade talks had reawakened the prospect of a deal by the end of this year to complete the stalled Uruguay round. But Mr Major acknowledged that there were serious obstacles to be overcome on services and agriculture before a Gatt deal could be signed.</p>

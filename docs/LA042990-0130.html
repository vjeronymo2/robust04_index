			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN USES HIS FAITH TO AID GANG MEMBERS  </P> <P> Three days after his 16-year-old son was killed in a February gang shooting,  Blinky Rodriguez found himself driving through Pacoima. Police suspected a  rival gang member from this turf had pulled the trigger. Rodriguez said he was  drawn to these streets.  </P> <P> "These kids are falling out every day. My son is lying in a grave. Ten days  ago, another kid went down," Rodriguez said recently. "Who will stand in these  perilous times?"  </P> <P> Rodriguez -- a former professional kick boxer who runs a Van Nuys gym -- has  not returned to work since the funeral. Instead, he walks East San Fernando  Valley streets and preaches the Gospel to any young man or woman who will  listen.  </P> <P> This crusade is the work of an anguished father, a church-going man who  immersed himself in his religion after the death of his son, Sonny, who was a  gang member. The change in Rodriguez has been startling and swift. Before, the  36-year-old man fancied himself an entrepreneur, wearing expensive suits as he  circulated through the world of boxing and promoting. Once an unfailing  optimist, he now sees a darker side to life.  </P> <P> Rodriguez has support in his new quest. His Sepulveda church prides itself on  converting drug addicts and gang members. He has enlisted other men in the  congregation.  </P> <P> "We are an army of God," Rodriguez said. "I've got guys who were shot at and  stabbed, were in the penitentiary and were resurrected. We are willing to risk  our lives, to be on the street and talk to kids.  </P> <P> "Some of these guys have more tattoos than the kids. So the kids listen."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Rodriguez held a meeting that was attended by police and  local businessmen. The purpose of the gathering was to solicit money and  support. Rodriguez's "army" needs a van to take youths on outings. Rodriguez  and his cohorts have already arranged for a central California farm that will  host young men and women for six weeks during the summer, giving them a break  from the streets. An airplane mechanic has volunteered to teach his trade to  street kids.  </P> <P> Before the meeting, Rodriguez said he wanted to avoid speaking in the boldly  religious terms he now uses frequently. "In this day and age, if you talk about  God, people look at you like you have three heads. You have to be careful what  you say." But less than 10 minutes into his speech, he was quoting Scripture.  His voice became loud, angry. He referred, as he often does, to Ephesians.  </P> <P>  Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles  of the devil.  </P> <P>  "People might look at me as a radical or a fanatic," he told the room, "but  this world is radical and fanatical."  </P> <P> William (Blinky) Rodriguez was raised in San Fernando. He got married at 14 to  21-year-old Lilly Urquidez, a Pacoima woman whose brother Benny was soon to  become one of the best-known kick boxers in the history of the sport. Rodriguez  and his wife took up kick boxing, too, and became champions, traveling the  world with Benny.  </P> <P> In 1982, the clan returned home to open the Jet Center gym. Rodriguez trained  with martial arts film star Chuck Norris. He began negotiating television  contracts for kick-boxing tournaments. He took in a young boxer named Alex  Garcia -- a San Fernando native who served five years in prison for stabbing a  rival gang member -- and led him to the national amateur super-heavyweight  title and a silver medal at the 1986 World Amateur Boxing Championships.  </P> <P> But Rodriguez could not steer his own children from the violence and trouble he  had avoided so deftly in his youth. The eldest of the Rodriguezes' five  children, David, is serving time in a state penitentiary for armed robbery and  attempted murder. And now Sonny, who police suspect was in a gang, is dead.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't believe the spiritual awakening," Rodriguez said, referring to  the change he went through after his son's death.  </P> <P>  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the  breastplate of righteousness.  </P> <P> In addition to his recent street preaching, Rodriguez tries to coax youths to  Thursday night meetings at his house in Sylmar. As many as 75 youths, recruited  by Rodriguez and his army, have shown up in an evening. So far, the youths  don't say much. They listen to Rodriguez as he tells them to stay away from the  street crowd, the drugs and the violence. Rodriguez reads some Scripture, but  mostly it's a counseling session.  </P> <P> "I don't know if people outside can understand . . . to come from where we come  from, drugs and partying, that's all we know," said Richard Sarabia, 19, who  said he is a member of a San Fernando gang and has been attending meetings. "I  ask myself, 'Why am I even going?' I could be partying.  </P> <P> "Blinky's for real. His son got shot. We always think that all our friends are  dying and who's next?" Sarabia said. "Blinky's trying to get us to do good  things. He has his own wife and kids, he has everything. But he doesn't even go  to work anymore. He goes to the park where we hang out. He's telling us things,  doing something for us, all this time and effort and love for us and what the  hell did we ever do for him?  </P> <P> "I don't know anybody who cares about us and doesn't want anything in return."  </P> <P> Pastor David Martinez of Victory Outreach Church, which Rodriguez attends, also  speaks to the youths.  </P> <P> "For 10 years I roamed the streets of San Fernando. I ended up as a drug  addict," Martinez said. "I know that people in the street can change."  </P> <P> Rodriguez is taking his message to the schools as well. He will stage a  kick-boxing exhibition Friday at Sepulveda Junior High.  </P> <P> "We felt it would be good for the kids," said Dan Hensley, a physical education  teacher at Sepulveda Junior High. "It sounds like Blinky and his wife use the  martial arts as a hook to get the kids' attention and then give them the  message about staying away from drugs."  </P> <P> It's too soon to tell if Rodriguez's crusade will win any victories. His  approach might seem simplistic in an era when police and government profess to  have few answers to gang violence.  </P> <P> Rodriguez says only that he must react to Sonny's death, and this is his  natural reaction.  </P> <P> "These kids in the street are smoking whack and listening to the rappers.  They're all putting up a facade. They don't want to look weak," he said. "But  you have to remember that they're just kids. They have so many fears and  insecurities.  </P> <P> "What good do programs and agencies do for these kids? They respond to love."  </P> <P>  Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to  withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  </P> <P>  "Who will stand in these perilous times?" Rodriguez asked. "I'm going to  stand."  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Truck owner is fined after deaths The owner of a heavy truck which went out of control on a steep hill causing the death of six people was fined Pounds 5,000 by Halifax magistrates yesterday. It was the maximum fine that could be imposed on Fewston Transport of Skipton, which pleaded guilty to using a heavy goods vehicle with defective brakes. Mr Richard Hodgson, prosecuting, said the truck was inspected after the crash and excessive wear was found on most of the brake drums and shoes. It was indicative of a general lack of attention and adjustment to them. Mr Stephen Kirkbright, defending, said the inexperience of the driver, Mr Derek Waterworth, who died in the crash, might have been a factor in the accident on the main street of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, last September. Mr Waterworth, of Bradford, was working as an agency driver for the company when his 10-tonne, eight-wheel truck, carrying 20 tonnes of stone, crashed into a BT van. The truck and van crashed into a row of shops killing both drivers, three women and the two-year-old daughter of one of the women. Mr Kirkbright conceded that the braking systems on all eight wheels were defective but said that the company had a system of inspection far better than that recommended by the makers. Mr Kirkbright said the brakes were working properly - a driver behind Mr Waterworth had almost run into him when he braked sharply only minutes before the fatal crash. 'There is no evidence that the brakes were applied at all,' Mr Kirkbright said. The company was also ordered to pay Pounds 100 costs. Two similar charges were withdrawn against the firm's managing director, Mr Anthony Eyers, of Fewston, Harrogate, and his transport manager, Mr Eric Preston, of Skipton, following a guilty plea on behalf of Fewston.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 28 (CNA) -- The greatest difficulty in  dealing with Mainland China lies in Beijing's reluctance to  honor its commitments, a mainland affairs official said Monday  [28 March].    "Beijing has not only failed to faithfully implement the  written agreements it has reached with Taiwan but has also often  distorted oral agreements or interpreted them out of context,"  said Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC], which sets Taiwan's policy toward Beijing.    Kao was commenting on the slow progress in the ongoing round  of talks in Beijing between the two semi official intermediary  bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait on the three thorny  issues -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the  repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution  of cross-strait fishing disputes.    The talks between officials from Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have deadlocked over Beijing's  reluctance to recognize Taiwan's legal jurisdiction. During the  talks, Kao said, mainland delegates have unilaterally distorted  "consensuses" reached in talks between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao  Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart, Tang Shubei, in Beijing late  last year concerning the three issues.    For one thing, Kao explained, the joint press statement  issued at the end of Chiao-Tang meeting said Taiwan would agree  not to include the repatriation of criminal suspects in  cross-strait agreements on the repatriation of illegal  immigrants and hijackers if Beijing would agree to SEF proposals  that Taiwan be allowed to automatically repatriate illegal  mainland immigrants and that it not have to repatriate Taiwan  nationals who hijack mainland planes to Taiwan.    In the current round of talks, which began March 25, Beijing  rejected the two SEF premises while simply insisting that  criminal suspects be excluded from any agreements on the  repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers.    Talks were adjourned Monday with no progress reported, and  will resume Tuesday. Reports from Beijing quoted chief Taiwan  negotiator Hsu hui-yu as saying that whether the talks will  continue through Wednesday as scheduled depends on whether any  progress can be made in Tuesday's talks. Hsu is also SEF deputy  secretary-general.    This is the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three  issues since the heads of the two organizations met in Singapore  last April. The two sides failed to reach any agreements in  subsequent talks held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei in the  second half of last year.    Another SEF secretary-general, Shih Chi-ping, was originally  scheduled to leave for Beijing Monday for talks with ARATS  officials on some cross-strait economic issues, but his trip was  canceled because of the lack of progress in talks on the  aforesaid three pressing issues.</p>

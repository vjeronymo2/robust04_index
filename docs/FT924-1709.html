			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / German warning on party ban Mainstream German politicians cautioned yesterday against banning the far-right Republican party, under investigation on suspicion of being anti-democratic, Reuter reports from Bonn. Several state interior ministers said they hoped the investigation announced by the government on Tuesday would help major parties win a public opinion battle with the Republicans, the strongest of several small rightist parties. But they warned an outright ban, like ones Bonn imposed recently on two smaller rightist groups, would only drive members underground or into other far-right organisations. Germany unveiled a new computer system yesterday to help accommodate the huge influx of refugees from eastern Europe and developing countries. The DM2m (Pounds 823,000) system, in operation from April 1, is designed to distribute asylum-seekers more quickly between crowded refugee hostels. It allows officials immediate access to information on how many beds are available in each of Germany's 16 federal states, which take refugees based on a quota system.</p>

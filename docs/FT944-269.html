			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Haitians offered Dollars 80 to return The US told more than 4,000 Haitian refugees at its naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, yesterday they would all have to return home and offered them Dollars 80 (Pounds 52) - up from the Dollars 16 previously on offer - to do so, the State Department announced. The statement in Creole to the Haitians at the base said that since the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on October 15, 'Haitians in safe haven can now return home'. The announcement appeared to have been met with acceptance by the 4,468 Haitians in the refugee camps. The refugees fled Haiti by boat last year to escape life under a military junta then ruling the country.</p>

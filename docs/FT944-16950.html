			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Powerless lunchers Once they buzzed like bees round a honeypot; now they're all too busy. To have lunch with Baroness Thatcher, that is, during her fleeting visit to the Tory conference. John Major will share a cup of coffee with her, before she waltzes on to the conference platform - though is otherwise engaged for lunch. So too it seems are most other senior government members. Nothing of course to do with the latest stories about her son Mark. Her media and business friends have more spare time. Sunday Telegraph editor Charles Moore, Sir James Goldsmith and ITN's Dame Susan Tinson are on the guest list. Probable menu: pawn cocktail; roast beef of old-fashioned England (with envious greens); sour grapes and hard cheese to follow. Will Sir Basil Feldman, Tory grandee and conference organiser, be welcome? Surely not. Greeting the press, he recalled that Bournemouth 'has many happy memories'. Forgetting, surely, that in Bournemouth 1990 the party prepared to ditch Lady Thatcher, who was gone within weeks.</p>

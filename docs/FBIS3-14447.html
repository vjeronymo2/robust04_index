He  noted that the foreign ministers of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan,  who are now present in Cairo, may hold consultations to set an  initial date for a meeting among themselves to coordinate their  countries' policies on the peace talks.    Buwayz noted that U.S. envoy Robert Pelletreau, who visited  Beirut recently, told him that Israel and the PLO may sign an  agreement for limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in April.  Buwayz called on Israel to announce its commitment to withdraw  from the occupied part of southern Lebanon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Austrian President Thomas Klestil at the EU </F> summit in Corfu -- live]    [Text] President of the European Council, President of the  European Commission, President of the European Parliament,  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    On 12 June, the citizens of the Republic of Austria voted in  favor of participating in the process of European unification  with a convincing yes that is unprecedented in the history of  the European Union [EU]. With this vote, they set an impressive  signal -- a signal that shows that they believe in the European  idea, a signal of confidence in the European Union that has  become the central stability anchor of this continent, and a  signal of determination that they want to participate actively  and with commitment in the European peace work and Europe's new  orientation. With great pleasure and encouraged by this clear  plebiscite, the Austrian delegation has just signed the  accession treaty.    We have come a good way. Numerous friends throughout Europe  have accompanied us on our path and have supported us. I would  like to convey cordial thanks to all of them at this festive  ceremony -- for their understanding, their assistance, and the  conviction of so many Europeans that European unification is  ultimately not possible without Austria. Without being  presumptuous, Austria considers itself the central country in a  larger Europe -- a country that can look back on a century-old  tradition of actively shaping European policies. Its historical  experience has led to a deep skepticism of nationalism, hatred,  and intolerance, but also to a special openness for larger  European structures. It is a country that has for decades  belonged to the family of highly developed West European  democracies because of its stability and efficiency. On this  foundation, Austria has developed an extensive social network  and high environmental standards. One of the goals of our  participation in the European Union will be to make these  achievements a yardstick for the whole of Europe. However, our  experiences have also taught us a lesson about the obligations  of democracy -- that its institutions must be made even more  unambiguous and that they must be brought closer to the citizens.    The European Union has repeatedly proven its willingness for  further development and its ability for change in an impressive  manner. We Austrians hope that we will be able to make an  all-European contribution with our support for federalism and  subsidiarity.    Austria is also a country of bridges and crossings. This  leads to a special understanding for the colorful variety of the  cultures and traditions and a close relationship with the young  democracies in our neighborhood. After decades of dictatorship,  it is finally possible for them to share the values of freedom  and democracy with us. They are eagerly waiting for their  participation in the process of integration. I am convinced  that Austria is the ideal location from where the European Union  can continue its future all-European efforts. Integration and  solidarity are the most effective foundations of this large  peace work.    Ladies and Gentlemen, more than all other European  countries,  the Republic of Austria saw the historic changes in Europe at  close range. Its citizens know their security will continue to  be indivisibly linked in the future with Europe's security.  They are strongly interested in the development of an  all-European system. Thus, we are looking forward to our  participation in the European Union with great pleasure and  confidence. We have prepared ourselves well for membership and  are determined to take part in Europe's restructuring and  unification to the best of our ability. May we all be granted  luck and happiness.</p>

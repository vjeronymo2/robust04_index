			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Hanson alters payout policy HANSON, the Anglo-US con-glomerate, yesterday announced a new dividend policy to minimise its tax charge as it reported a 6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the first quarter to the end of December 1991. Lord Hanson, chairman, blamed the recession in the UK and the US for the fall in taxable profits to Pounds 226m compared with Pounds 241m a year ago, its first-ever quarter-on-quarter fall. Sales rose to Pounds 2bn against Pounds 1.9bn, while diluted earnings per share were unchanged at 3.9p because of the change in dividend which has resulted in a lower tax charge for the first quarter. To minimise its advanced corporation tax liability for the year to September 30, 1992, Hanson will pay its dividend quarterly from July. There will be three further payments in October, January and April. The quarterly dividends will not be less than 2.75p totalling at least 11p by April - the same as last year's full dividend. Last year shareholders received 3.15p in July and 7.85p in February enabling Mr Martin Taylor, vice chairman, to argue they would be better off since they would receive 75 per cent of the dividend by January - earlier than last year. However, Mr Charles Pick, conglomerate analyst at Nomura, said: 'Hanson will be affected by the dividend move since it is tantamount to a cut in the dividend payment for 1991-2 although it equates to a maintained dividend on a tax year basis.' Hanson's shares yesterday fell 2p to close at 197 3/4 , reflecting market unease at the change of dividend policy. Some institutional shareholders yesterday put the move down to Hanson's 'financial wizardry' while others said the group was being 'too clever by half'. Analysts estimated that the move was worth up to Pounds 50m in tax benefit because Hanson would only declare two dividends this financial year. This will boost group earnings per share and allow Lord Hanson to announce record earnings per share for the financial year. Mr Taylor said the quarterly dividend payment was in response to growing international interest in Hanson and its US ADRs. Most US companies pay quarterly dividends. Shareholders are likely to ask for a detailed explanation Lord Hanson and Lord White in London today. Lex, Page 14 Waiting in the Wings, Page 12</p>

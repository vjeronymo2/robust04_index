			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: General Motors in pact to sell car rental offshoot General Motors and Vestar Equity Partners have signed a letter of intent for GM to sell the assets of National Car Rental System to an investment group led by Vestar, Reuter reports from Detroit. The proposed agreement includes provisions for National to continue to employ its 6,400 employees, and to maintain its long-term fleet agreement with GM to purchase vehicles. In June, National's president Lawrence Ramaekers told Reuters the rental firm was expected to fetch more than Dollars 1bn. GM declined to comment on the sale price, saying the deal was contingent on the signing of a definitive agreement and the approval of GM's directors. The US carmaker said the sale reflected its strategy to divest non-core assets. GM acquired 45 per cent of National in September 1988 and, since then, has acquired full ownership of the company. Last year, GM retained Jay Alix &amp; Associates, turnround specialists to improve National's operating performance. 'National Car Rental is an established franchise that we believe has real potential,' John Howard, co-chief executive of Vestar Equity Partners, said in a statement. 'We have been quite impressed with the efforts of GM and Jay Alix &amp; Associates to improve National's operating performance. We will work closely with the management team to build on this progress.' National services more than 5,000 locations in 132 countries worldwide. New York-based Vestar has organised 13 management buy-outs during the last six years. The firm manages a Dollars 260m equity fund dedicated to management buy-outs. GM's move marks the second time this month one of Detroit's Big Three car companies has sold its stake in rental car firms. Earlier this month, Chrysler sold its stake in Snappy Rent-A-car to a group of investors led by Jackson Partners LP in New York. Chrysler still owns a stake in Thrifty and Dollar Rent-A-Car. In April, Ford Motor increased its stake in Hertz to 100 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Trade and Investment Office of the Embassy of Ghana in the United States expressed opposition to including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entandrophragma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Khaya  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in Appendix II. However the basic differences in controls between Appendix II and Appendix I may not have been fully understood by them or the Ghana Forestry Department, as the Embassy included a statement from the Ghana Timber Export Development Board (Takoradi, Ghana), similar to the letter of the Forestry Department, both of which expressed the view that ``A ban [sic] on exploitation of these species in the case of Ghana is rather likely to undermine current efforts to protect them *&blank;*&blank;*'' The Embassy stated that the timber industry is a very important contributor to foreign-exchange earnings, those two genera constitute about 50 percent of their production and exports, and the country has made great strides (giving details) towards sustainable management of Ghana forests. They stated that forest management in Ghana now is recognized as being the best in sub-Saharan Africa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Embassy included a detailed statement from the Timber Export Development Board which stated that Ghana has made forest-management reforms and has conservative forest-exploitation controls and protective strategies that provide adequate regulatory measures to ensure sustainable utilization, which are being enforced. The Board provided details about the four  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entandrophragma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species and three  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Khaya  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species that are native, indicating that four of the seven species are quite widely distributed and some of the species occur nationally at very low densities, and giving thorough estimated inventories of the seven species (for the high-forest region of southern Ghana). The Board noted that there are few remaining large trees for exploitation, but that ``*&blank;*&blank;* this implies commercial extinction of the species only, as there is plenty of regeneration and the present management system has been designed to protect the species.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service was advised that Germany would submit proposals to include the two genera in Appendix II, and decided that the United States would evaluate the German proposal objectively without being a co-proponent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Non-native Aloes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp.). All species of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are in the CITES appendices, with nearly all in Appendix II, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (synonym  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe barbadensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The genus is essentially African. Plants regarded as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been used by people for millennia and the yellow-flowered species may be extinct in its native range_it may have been native to the southern Arabian Peninsula or northeastern Africa (e.g., Ethiopia) where similar species occur (but perhaps instead was native to the Canary Islands).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The parts and derivatives of artificially propagated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are unregulated. The whole plants commonly in trade as aloe vera are of artificially propagated (or also naturalized) origin, and they have become an enforcement burden. On January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832), the Service announced that it was considering submission of a proposal to remove the non-native population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that is geographically distinct from the general African area. All species of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> where they may be native thus would have continued to be regulated by CITES, including those on the Arabian Peninsula and the islands neighboring Africa, such as the Canary Islands, Socotra, and Madagascar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although no written comments were received during the comment period, Mr. Gary W. Lyons (of Gary Lyons Garden &amp; Horticultural Consultant &amp; Design), a member of the IUCN/SSC Cactus and Succulent Specialist Group and past chair of the Conservation Committee of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America, renewed (by telephone within the comment period) the concerns in his written commentary provided to the Service for the September 1993 CPC Meeting, and in August 1994 provided a copy of his analysis written for consideration during the 23rd Congress of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study. On April 12, 1994, the United States discussed the subject at the 17th CITES North American Region Meeting near Ottawa, Canada. That group recommended that a proposal not be submitted, because of the risk it would create for illegal import of rare  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe taxa, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  possibly including native wild  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service considered whether exclusion of the plants from the non- native (non-African) population of Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would significantly increase risk to the survival in its native range of any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i.e., species, subspecies, botanical variety, or significant population). The United States decided not to submit a proposal. The subject was discussed at the CPC meeting in May 1994; Switzerland has since submitted a proposal for the removal of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe barbadensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [sic] [i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ] from Appendix II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is now seeking comments on that proposal; see the September 6, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (59 FR 46023). The Service is considering whether the artificially propagated whole plants of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe vera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> can be dealt with in a different way, without putting wild  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aloe taxa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at increased risk.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

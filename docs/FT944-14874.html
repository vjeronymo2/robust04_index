			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) Booker makes a catch in farmed Atlantic salmon Correction (published 21st October 1994) appended to this article. Booker, the British food group, will become the world's largest farmer of Atlantic salmon with its Dollars 122.1m (Pounds 77m) agreed bid for Marine Harvest International, a US company 27 per cent owned by Hanson, the UK conglomerate. The deal will more than quadruple Booker's salmon interests which will now account for about one-tenth of group profits. Booker, with about 7 per cent of world production, will leap ahead of Norsk Hydro and other Norwegian producers with whom it is engaged in a recurring price war. Booker's share of Scottish production will rise from about 9 per cent to just under 25 per cent, Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, said. The consolidation was 'very good news for the Scottish industry which is under attack from the Norwegians,' he added. A counter-bid from Norway or Asia could not be ruled out but was unlikely, he said. No other bidders had been flushed out by Marine Harvest's announcement several weeks ago that it was discussing an offer at about Dollars 10.50 a share. Booker is offering Dollars 10.20 for the shares. Booker has 34 per cent of Marine's equity in the net, 27 per cent from Hanson and less than 8 per cent from the family of Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's US arm. Most of the assets Booker is buying were in the salmon farming business Unilever sold to Marine in October 1992. Hanson is retaining Marine's shrimp business with a net asset value of Dollars 25.2m which it will sell or liquidate. Booker will reimburse Hanson if its loss on the sale exceeds Dollars 8.5m. Booker is paying for Marine from existing credit lines and the placement of 10.5m new shares, equal to 4.9 per cent of its existing equity. The shares were placed at 404p while Booker's shares closed down 7p at 413p. Marine gives Booker production in Chile, considered the world's best and cheapest fish farming location, and access to the US and Japanese markets. Its present farming is in Scotland and aimed at Europe. Marine's salmon operations reported operating profits of Dollars 19.9m on turnover of Dollars 89.3m in the year to September 1993. Mr Bowen said the purchase price was about 10 times Marine's net income from salmon and that the deal would 'modestly enhance' Booker's earnings in the first year. Lex, Page 26; Optimism at last, Page 39 CORRECTION Hanson will reimburse Booker for losses over Dollars 8.5m on the sale of Marine Harvest International's shrimp business, and not vice versa as reported in yesterday's edition.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market retreats after pact talks failure LONDON COCOA prices were in retreat yesterday following the virtual abandonment on Friday of the International Cocoa Organisation's attempt to formulate a new international agreement with economic clauses. The May contract shed Pounds 15 to close at Pounds 682 a tonne. The ICCO earlier this month failed at the fourth attempt to bridge the gap between producers and consumers at talks under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva. Delegates to last week's council meeting at the ICCO headquarters in London were hoping to make enough progress to return to Geneva later this year. The ICCO agreement has operated without market support measures since early 1988, when its buffer stock system collapsed. The agreement runs out in September, threatening the possible sale of more than 230,000 tonnes of cocoa on to a weak market. Delegates will meet again for a special ICCO session in London from June 8 to 11. They will discuss a proposal from Mr Matthew Nwagwu, chairman of the ICCO Council, for 'a limited form of economic agreement which would discard temporarily the problem issues such as price range for withholding purposes, withholding scheme and financing of the withholding scheme'. The latest proposal envisages controlled liquidation of the buffer stock, and a production and consumption policy. Analysts now believe there is little chance of the withholding scheme, which was planned to keep 350,000 tonnes off the market, ever coming into force, although the proposal allows for its revival at a future date. Basically, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures brokers, ICCO members will be trying to prevent the liquidation of the buffer stock.</p>

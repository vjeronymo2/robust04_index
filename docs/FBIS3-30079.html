Aubrey G. Thomas, chairman of the group for the study of the  chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Goedverwagting, Guyana,  said that the ideas expounded by respected President Kim Il-song  in the rural theses were the unique idea elucidating a clear  vista of solving the rural question and great idea indicating  the right way of completely liberating the farmers freed from  exploitation and oppression even from the fetters of old ideas  and nature.    The Egyptian paper AKHER SA'A wrote that President Kim  Il-song created the chuche method of farming after his earnest  study while personally raising crops in the garden for the  settlement of the rural question and applied it to farming.    The Central African news agency said that the development of  agriculture in Korea was made entirely by the wise guidance of  the respected leader President Kim Il-song, adding that Korea  has firmly laid the powerful material and technical foundations  which make it possible to endlessly increase agricultural  production, unaffected in any unfavourable condition.    The Syrian paper NIDAL PALYAHIN said that the farmers of  Korea are now leading a rich and cultural life; like in towns.    The Zambian paper ZAMBIA DAILY MAIL in an article stressed  that the countryside of Korea built by the great President Kim  Il-song reminds us of paradise or utopia pictured by ancient  people to themselves.</p>

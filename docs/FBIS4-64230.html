			<p>BFN     [Text] Mannheim -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) continues to urge the conclusion of  an agreement with Turkey that will protect activists of the  banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] who are deported to  Turkey from the death penalty in their home country. The goal  of the agreement is to guarantee sufficiently to authorities  dealing with foreigners and to the courts that the Kurds are not  facing the death penalty in the event of their deportation,  Kanther told journalists in Mannheim today. However, the PKK is  no "Robin Hood group," but a criminal organization, "and is  being treated as such in Germany."    Kanther stressed that assurances by the Turkish Government  that torture is not used by the state in dealing with people who  think differently would be sufficient. The minister reported  that after the ban of the PKK at the end of 1993, about 30  affiliated organizations were also forbidden. The overwhelming  majority of the Kurds living in Germany do not want to have  anything to do with the PKK.    Bonn is interested in a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish  issue in Turkey and feels sympathy for the maltreated people in  the civil war zone. However, this has nothing to do with the  prosecution of terrorism in Germany. "I do not care why  somebody erects burning barricades on the roads. He is a  criminal," the minister stressed.</p>

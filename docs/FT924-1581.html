			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Observer: Power-lust package Goodness knows how many small boys have been turned off science for ever by finding that the chemistry kits they were given for Christmas contained nothing fit to cause a respectable explosion. But what price a new kit from Japan which replaces the lure of the big bang with the scientific Holy Grail of cold fusion? The prospect of harmlessly harnessing the process that powers the sun and stars galvanised the world when Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced three years ago that they had done the trick. Despite countless repetitions of their experiment, however, the results have proved a damp squib. Far from there being a surge of radiation, it was hard to tell whether any more electricity came out of the process than had been fed into it in the first place. The Japanese test kit is designed to provide better proof by detecting an atom that only cold fusion could produce: helium-4. But it is hardly a Christmas gift the average family could afford. Marketed by NTT's Advanced Film Technology, the package costs Pounds 360,000 - and no money-back guarantee if it fails to deliver the goods.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TITLE COMPANY 'STING' LEADS TO PAIR'S ARREST;  </P> <P> SUSPICION AROUSED BY FORGED DOCUMENTS IN LOAN APPLICATION  </P> <P> A title insurance company may not seem a likely setting for a "sting"  operation. But, such is not uncommon today in an industry plagued by a  proliferation of forged title documents.  </P> <P> H. Collyer Church, vice president and chief counselor for Glendale-based World  Title Co., is part lawyer, part sleuth.  </P> <P> He is a former assistant attorney general for the state of Washington and a  specialist in insurance underwriting law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Successful 'Sting' Operation  </P> <P> Last December, Church and others at World Title brought together a mortgage  broker, the conservator for the estate of a West Los Angeles widow, her  attorney, a banker, a title security guard and bunco and forgery detectives of  the Los Angeles Police Department. The successful sting operation, involving  World Title personnel and Sgt. Doug Mahoe and his partner, Det. Charlene  Reming, led to the arrest in December of two suspects in a forgery-embezzlement  scheme, who are out on bail awaiting trial.  </P> <P> Tell-tale signs of fraud in the case surfaced when the title company was asked  to insure title to a single-family residence in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The request involved a home-equity loan application for $95,000 through a  private loan broker. The house was valued at about $150,000.  </P> <P> Records showed that the house had been purchased in 1929 by the previous  owners, Harry and Rose Meyers, and that they had executed a community oil and  gas lease in 1964.  </P> <P> So far, nothing unusual, Church said. "But our role as a title insurance  company is to spot the exception. A title search requires an examination of  public records, laws and court decisions to disclose all facts, current and  past, concerning ownership.  </P> <P> "A further look through the documents revealed a grant deed from Harry and Rose  to the new party, recorded on Nov. 4, 1988. But there was one suspicious detail  -- a 10-month gap between the date of the deed and the recording date, with  taxes on the deed indicating a sale price of $50,000 in January of 1988, well  below the market value of comparable Westside properties."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Commission Issued  </P> <P> Another inconsistency: The signatures of the owners on the 1964 oil and gas  lease did not match those on the 1988 notarized deed, which was apparently  uninsured and handled without an escrow, Church said. A check with the  California Secretary of State's office revealed that no notary commission had  been issued in the name used for the notary's signature on the deed.  </P> <P> "After calls to Harry and Rose, answered by a phone machine, and a check of the  assessor's rolls and telephone directory, we learned from neighbors that Rose  had been taken to a convalescent home a few months before and that Harry had  been deceased for three years," Church said. "Rose's nephew-conservator was  contacted and a quiet-title action was initiated for a lis pendens notice (a  pending suit that would block any transaction on the property)."  </P> <P> The mortgage broker told the loan applicant that he would have to deliver a  statement of confirmation from the sellers to World Title, before the money  would be paid. A detective posing as a title officer arrested the suspects when  the money exchanged hands.  </P> <P> "It was a very satisfying experience for all of us," Church said. "It saved the  widow the expense of clearing her property and saved the loan broker $155,000."  </P> <P> Title insurance can provide important protection to the homeowner and it is  important for the seller or buyer of a property to understand what it does,  Church said.  </P> <P> "For one thing, it does not insure against errors, such as boundary lines; it  is the responsibility of title officers to check for any discrepancies as to  boundary lines. I've done work on farmland, for example, where property lines  followed rivers and were marked by trees.  </P> <P> "But over the years, the rivers had changed and the trees had been chopped  down. Often we have to get statements from neighbors on either side, agreeing  to what is assumed to be a rightful boundary," Church said.  </P> <P> World Title has identified the following as danger signals that the consumer  should be alert to:  </P> <P>  -- A deed, mortgage or deed of trust is usually insured today and if it is  not, it should be examined closely.  </P> <P>  -- To increase the apparent equity in the property, a forger will place on  record a forged release of mortgage or reconveyance of deed of trust. A release  of this type will usually occur independently of any other real estate  transaction.  </P> <P> "We also look carefully at drop-in customers, excessive demand for speed by the  customer and a property that is vacant, in which case we require additional  verification of the identity of the seller," Church said.  </P> <P> Fraud can be treated either as a misdemeanor or felony. A misdemeanor  conviction can lead to a sentence of not more than one year in county jail; a  felony sentence could be a year or more in a state penitentiary.  </P> <P> Church said he plans to submit proposals to strengthen legislation dealing with  possession and control of notarial seals.  </P></p>

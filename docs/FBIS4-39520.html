The resolution was adopted on the initiative of the Ingush  president and chairman of the committee for affairs of  international servicemen under the council of heads of CIS  states, Ruslan Aushev.    "The resolution, which affects the fate of over 700,000  people, was adopted by the council of the interparliamentary  assembly practically without demur," said Vladimir Shumeyko in  an interview with ITAR-TASS. He pointed out that the settlement  of problems connected with legal and social aid to servicemen  involved in wars and military operations in foreign countries  encounter difficulties in the CIS. He came out for the  improvement of the system of the realization of interstate legal  acts of aid to veterans, adopted in the framework of the CIS,  including control over their implementation by top legislative  bodies of sovereign states.    Shumeyko expressed the hope that programmes, coordinated  between countries of the CIS and connected with the welfare and  health care of war veterans, will be given budgetary support.</p>

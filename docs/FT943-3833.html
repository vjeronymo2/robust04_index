			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Results August saw the start of the European first-half results season, covering all the main markets and touching each sector. Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson says that some early trends are becoming clear. Of the 171 larger corporate results, profit growth averaged around 40 per cent. But from the initial figures, sector trends were hard to discern. However, a large proportion of results came from the cyclical markets and a comparison of capital goods figures suggested that results from the engineering, metals, motors and chemicals sectors had been good or exceeded already high expectations. The banks' results were disappointing results , mainly due to bond losses, while in the building sector the more competitive environment was to blame. Pharmaceuticals, on the other hand, were disproving the bears, with increasing sales growth. Overall, while results had been good, they had not been outstanding. This suggested, says Mr Evans, that Europe's volatile equity markets were not going to be able to break free, for at least the next month or so, from the present influence of bonds, which nervously await each economic statistic.</p>

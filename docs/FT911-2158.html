			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Societies' tax appeal LEEDS PERMANENT building society yesterday accused the government of a conspiracy of silence in its attempts to keep Pounds 57m in overpaid tax owed since 1986. Several societies are pressing the government to back down on clause 50 in the Finance Bill, which retrospectively prevents societies reclaiming tax overpaid in 1986 during the introduction of composite rate tax.</p>

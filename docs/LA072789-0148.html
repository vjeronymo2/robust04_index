			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> EVEN BOLSHOI FARM TEAM SOWS MAGIC  </P> <P> The dancers were only the farm team for the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet. The  choreography was conservative. But the mystique that surrounds one of the  world's leading bastions of dance worked its magic on San Diego balletomanes  Tuesday night when the Bolshoi Ballet Academy made its local debut at the Civic  Theatre.  </P> <P> Billed as "65 stars of today and tomorrow," the group of students and recent  alumni of the Bolshoi's 200-year-old school were well-drilled and eager to  please as they gave the first of seven performances in town. And, despite their  youth (some of the dancers are only 16), they displayed a stage presence and  amplitude of attack that glossed over many of the rough spots in the  performance.  </P> <P> In keeping with the school's emphasis on the classics, Tuesday's performance  included excerpts from some of the oldest balletic masterworks in the popular  repertory. Unfortunately, it was impossible to rely on the program distributed  by the ushers or the slick souvenir version sold in the lobby to follow the  action.  </P> <P> A company spokeswoman blamed the botched programs on a clerical error, but that  did not explain why there were no pre-curtain announcements to signal the  changes or credit the replacements in the cast.  </P> <P> The classic showpieces of the evening were the second act of "Swan Lake"  (1895), excerpts from "La Fille Mal Gardee" (1789), a fleeting solo from  "Coppelia" (1870) and "Le Corsaire" pas de deux (1899). Most of these crowd  pleasers will be recycled during at least two of the three separate programs  scheduled for San Diego.  </P> <P> Some 20th-Century repertory works showed up along with the old war horses on  the eight-piece program, but they hardly qualified as contemporary: "Adagio,"  an ensemble work by the group's longtime director, Madame Sofia Golovkina, and  "Narcissus," the solo recently turned over to Vladimir Malakhov (the sensation  of the Moscow Classical Ballet during its stint in Boston last year and a gold  medalist at the Moscow International Ballet Competition in June) were on the  program.  </P> <P> A handful of rising stars are among the ranks of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy,  including Michael Shannon, 19, of Los Angeles, who talked his way into a spot  in the celebrated Soviet school. Although Shannon was expected to be partner to  Galina Stepanyenko, 21, (another gold medalist at the Moscow competition) in  the "Le Corsaire" pas de deux at Tuesday's performance, his only appearance was  in a brief solo spot from "Coppelia."  </P> <P> Shannon burst on stage with gusto as Franz, displaying the kind of performing  brio and physical abandon that have become hallmarks of Soviet ballet. The only  American in the troupe proved quite convincingly that classical dancing prowess  and a bravura presence are not exclusively Russian traits.  </P> <P> The real superstar in the company, however, is Malakhov. This 22-year-old  wunderkind has already reached world-class stature, and he flaunted that star  quality in the pas de deux from "Flower Festival at Genzano." His easy  elevations, virtuosic turns in the air, long leaps and general buoyancy in the  sunny phrases of the Bournonville classic evoked a well-deserved chorus of  bravos.  </P> <P> Malakhov's solo, "Narcissus," was more introspective (evoking shades of  Nijinsky's "Faun") and less of a showcase for his sheer bravado. But the  charismatic performer kept the audience entranced with small nuances, such as  the flick of his head as he sleeked the movements.  </P> <P> The biggest rafter raiser of the evening was "Septet," a dance that abounds  with invigorating macho moves and breathtaking pyrotechnics. Danced to  Ukrainian folk music, the flamboyant folk dance -- performed in blazing  Cossack-style costumes -- sent the fleet-footed dancers into a series of  gravity-defying jumps and those punishing squat kicks rarely seen on American  stages. "Septet" was buried in the middle of the program, but it was the hit of  the evening with the first-nighters.  </P> <P> The best corps dancing was seen in the clockwork precision of "Swan Lake."  Stepanyenko (a dancer with the Stanislavsky Theatre Ballet) stole the spotlight  as Odette. The frightened, bird-like flutter of her expressive ports de bras  and those deep back bends lifted her performance well above the average. She  was impressive in "Le Corsaire" as well, partnered with the dynamic (but sadly  uncredited) Bolshoi Ballet soloist Yuri Klevtsov.  </P> <P> Klevtsov made quick work of the dazzling feats of virtuosity Marius Petipa  designed for the bare-chested spectacle, but he was replaced in the closing  work (excerpts from "La Fille Mal Gardee") by Aleksei Musatov.  </P> <P> Although Ekaterina Besergani was a standout in the cast of "Adagio," there was  nothing memorable about the choreography. Besergani will get a better shot at  the limelight when she alternates with Stepanyenko in "Swan Lake" at subsequent  performances.  </P> <P> There was no shortage of kitsch in Tuesday's mixed bag. Heading the list was  the hyperactive "Sabre Dance." Aram Khachaturian's lightning-quick score  whipped the saber-wielding dancers into such a frenzy that they could hardly  maintain their equilibrium, but the audience was not taken in by its fury.  </P> <P> There was no live music, and the taped accompaniment to many of the dances was  scratchy and over-amplified, but the lavish costumes and decor for "Swan Lake"  were up to traditional standards.  </P> <P> The Bolshoi Ballet Academy will continue its run at the Civic Theatre tonight  through Saturday at 8 o'clock, with weekend matinees (Saturday at 2 p.m. and  Sunday at 3). The programs will feature Alexander Gorsky's version of  "Coppelia" (Act III), "The Girl and the Deer," "Sleeping Beauty's" bluebird pas  de deux, "Spring Waters," the Grand Pas from "Don Quixote," Act III of "Swan  Lake" and other repertory pieces.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, April 23 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign  Minister today contributed to a two-day international seminar on  "Germany and Europe" with a lecture called "What We Expect From  West Europe."    Despite forty years of totalitarianism, the Czech lands had  always been a part of Europe not only geographically but also  historically and culturally, Vondra said.    Vondra said in an interview for CTK that "The countries of  the European Union (EU) should show the same courage as Germany  and France did after the Second World War when they set out on  the road to European integration and cooperation. EU countries  should rapidly open their markets to us and demolish trade  barriers so that we may enter the common market before we even  become members of the EU."    He added that Western Europe (WEU) [as received] should  allow  the Czech Republic to join a defence community such as the WEU  before the country became a NATO member.    Asked for his assessment of Czech-German relations, Vondra  said bilateral relations had been good especially in the last  few months. Progress had been made in completing the  negotiations on bilateral agreements, which had been bogged down  for the past two years, concerning the Czech-German border  regime and refugees. If different opinions appeared in the  Czech press it was a question of the psychological level -- real  relations were good, Vondra said.</p>

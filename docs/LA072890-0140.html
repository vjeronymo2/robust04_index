			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: DENTICARE BEGINS TALKS WITH STATE OVER HMO, INDEMNITY  INSURANCE  </P> <P> Officials of National Health Care Systems Inc., responding to the state's  forbidding its Denticare of California subsidiary from selling indemnity  medical insurance or enrolling new members in its health maintenance  organization, said this week's state action is unjustified and may be  unenforceable.  </P> <P> However, the company added in a prepared statement, "for the benefit of the  company's enrollees and to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation,"  Denticare on Thursday began negotiations with the state Department of  Corporations, the state agency that oversees HMOs.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the department accused the company of illegally marketing  indemnity insurance without authorization from the state Department of  Insurance.  </P> <P> Since mid-1988, Denticare has been offering employers what it calls a  "dual-choice option" -- both an HMO and traditional indemnity medical  insurance. But the company said Friday that only about 9,000 of its 240,000  members are enrolled in plans that have indemnity coverage.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ASW incurs Pounds 10.8m deficit CONTINUED PRESSURE on margins pushed ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group, deep into the red last year, but the shares yesterday jumped 20p to 153p amid hopes of an upturn in steel prices. The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 10.8m for 1992, struck after restructuring costs of Pounds 4.6m, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.3m. The operating loss for the second half of 1992 was virtually the same as that for the first six months. Turnover fell 6 per cent to Pounds 367.8m (Pounds 390.7m). Losses per share were 16.2p (1.9p). The recommended final dividend is 3p, making 6p (9p) for the year. Net borrowings were Pounds 17.2m, with gearing at the year end of 14.5 per cent. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said 'abnormally low prices', at below 1982 levels, caused the poor outcome. Nevertheless, the group maintained volumes and made a profit on its basic steel operations. 'We remain one of the lowest cost producers in Europe, and have have again improved our cost base. 'Last year prices were reaching loss-making proportions across Europe; now they are recovering, and I expect to see a real improvement in results for the next half,' he added. With scrap prices up to about Pounds 70 a tonne from Pounds 53 at the start of the year, analysts estimated that margins for scrap-based products were improving markedly. Prices for other products - like wire rod and reinforcement bar in coil and length - were also rising. COMMENT ASW's reputation as a low cost producer remains untarnished despite yesterday's results, but with 40 per cent of its business on the Continent, in the immediate future it needs a recovery in European steel prices more than Mr Lamont's green shoots. Efforts to promote that recovery appear to be under way. But are they enough and will they be sustained? Regarding the state of Europe's steel industry, and the nervousness of the Commission in tackling state aids in their numerous guises, it is hard to be confident on either front. But with analysts predicting a 1993 profit of Pounds 12m pre-tax, and a prospective p/e of 15, things are looking up short-term.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD GIVES TENTATIVE BUDGET OK  </P> <P> After approving nearly $43 million in cuts, the Los Angeles Board of Education  has approved a tentative $3.8-billion spending plan for 1989-90, which slightly  exceeds this year's $3.5-billion budget.  </P> <P> Among the largest cuts approved are a 5% reduction in central administration  costs ($6.1 million), eliminating outside management consultants on school  construction projects ($2.4 million) and trimming per-student allotments of  lottery money ($3 million).  </P> <P> The budget includes some new expenditures required by law, such as earthquake  repairs ($1.2 million), handicapped access ($1 million) and replacement of  underground fuel storage tanks ($1.4 million). Other programs may be considered  later this week, but chief financial officer Robert Booker said that additional  expenditures would require further reductions in other areas.  </P> <P> The proposals for new spending include $6.5 million to implement a plan to end  low achievement, $250,000 for dropout prevention, $192,458 to expand humanities  education and $131,883 to give district employees first-aid training.  </P></p>

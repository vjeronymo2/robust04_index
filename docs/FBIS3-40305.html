			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Subert, spokesman for the Czech Ministry of </F> the Interior: "The Ensuing Twilight of Political Espionage"]    [Text] The former journalist Jan Subert, who is today  the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech  Republic, is setting out to familiarize readers of CESKY DENIK  with the recent past and the current status and direction of the  Czech intelligence service.    The mission of the current intelligence service of the  democratic state is to predict and mitigate the risks that  threaten not only the democratic state, but all of human  civilization. The greatest dangers include, for example, the  expansion of technologies and components for the production of  nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, international  terrorism, illegal transfers of classical weapons to locations  causing concern in the world, racism, chauvinism, as well as  anti-Semitism. But it is necessary to stress that positive  intelligence can function well and serve only as an integral  part of a comprehensive information system.    Much like counterintelligence, the present-day Czech  intelligence service--the Office for Foreign Contacts and  Information--has been rebuilt from the ground up and is  operating in accordance with totally new principles. After  November 1989, we took absolute account of the fact that every  secret service is a civilian barometer of the political regime  of a given country. We were completely guided by the principle  according to which a fundamental political change within a  country must be followed by a fundamental change in its secret  services. In other words, we did not embark on  "democratization," but, as the only postcommunist country, we  began building these services from the very beginning. Our  approach is highly regarded today by all democratic Western  services that accept us as equal partners as the only ones from  the former Soviet bloc.    As far back as 1990, communist espionage officers who  operated under diplomatic cover were withdrawn from all  Czechoslovak embassies. The liquidation of their stations also  resulted in disconnecting the entire agent net of the  pre-November intelligence service operated by the Federal  Ministry of the Interior, which employed around 300 agents and  confidential sources from among the ranks of foreign nationals  during the period of 1970-89. The likelihood that these people  continue to work against our Republic and against other  democratic states is virtually nonexistent. Intelligence  services with hostile aims must expect that the disconnected  agent net is not only known to our intelligence service today.    The Office for Foreign Contacts and Information even settled  with the so-called illegals who were operating abroad without  diplomatic cover. All of them--their numbers did not exceed  40--were exclusively Czechoslovak citizens who, as officers in  the communist intelligence service, had undergone long-term  training. They arrived at their destinations, where they lived  as foreign nationals, equipped with false documents, generally  via a third country from which they emigrated to the target  country after several years of living in the third country. They  were to be activated only in times of international crisis or in  the event of war. All of the illegals were invited to return by  the Office for Foreign Contacts and Information: Many heeded the  call and with respect to those who remained in place our side  undertook steps to limit their activities against our Republic  and against the other democratic nations.    The structure and activities of the Office for Foreign  Contacts and Information are based on a completely new  philosophy of positive intelligence that is based on the demise  of communism and, thus, on the demise of a bipolar world. The  harsh and merciless war between the democratic and totalitarian  secret services has come to an end and the bitter opponents of  40 years are faced with the possibility of partnership  relationships and collaboration. The twilight of political  espionage is beginning; traditional forms of espionage are being  reevaluated; the concept of an enemy is being replaced by the  concept of danger and the "espionage" environment of agents,  illegals, and active measures is being shifted to the area of  anticivilization risks. In current intelligence work, more and  more information is being acquired from overt areas.    But not even this development changes much about the fact  that secret services continue to represent a sharp sword and  that democratic states must hold them on a short rein by  exercising strict control over them. Nevertheless, the current  political climate has already given rise to the process for  their dedemonization and transparency. The public has the right  to know what the secret services in democratic countries are for  and why they exist. They are here to protect national interests,  to protect freedom and democracy, and, as a result, also to  protect every one of us against violence, crime, and a lack of  freedom.</p>

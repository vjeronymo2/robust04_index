			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent S. Milyanchikov, including </F> recorded comment by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov; from the  "Vesti" newscast]    [Excerpts] Elections to a new parliament were held in  Ukraine today.    [Milyanchikov] Unlike Russian elections to local councils,  Crimean elections can be regarded as valid. [passage omitted]    Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who also took part in  today's voting, believes that the results of Crimean elections  and of the poll [on relations with Russia] will not spoil  relations with Kiev.    [Meshkov] There are no grounds, no reasons for this. On the  contrary, the situation is becoming more clear and calm. Mutual  relations will be settled if we reach agreement and if the Kiev  leadership shows understanding. In this case all problems will  be solved.    [Milyanchikov] At 2000 Moscow time -- and I will remind you  that as of today Crimea lives according to Moscow time -- the  polling stations closed and the count of votes started. Two  forecasts can be made, however, before all the votes are  counted. The Russian idea, with which the Russia bloc and the  Crimea Russian-speaking movement came to the elections, has won.  And the second thing: In many constituencies, electors will have  to cast their votes again since more than 1,100 candidates are  vying for the 90 seats in the Crimean parliament.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US flotation boosts Jefferson Smurfit - Rights issue announced to raise IPounds 155m to help fund acquisition of Cellulose du Pin Jefferson Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based paper and packaging company, reported a surge in interim pre-tax profits, from IPounds 50.7m to IPounds 251.6m (Pounds 248.6m), thanks to the flotation of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation in the US, in which it has retained a 46.5 per cent stake. The company also announced an underwritten 1-for-10 rights issue to raise a net IPounds 155m towards its IPounds 684m acquisition of Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging operations of France's Compagnie Saint-Gobain, the purchase of which propelled it to the top of the European corrugated paper industry six weeks ago. The rights price of IPounds 3.30 represents a discount to the market especially after yesterday's rally, which took shares in London up 21p to 421p. The group expressed optimism about growth prospects in its core markets. 'We've got a very bullish outlook for the second half. It is time for this industry to start clawing back some of the losses it made in the past four years,' said Mr Dermot Smurfit, joint chairman. The results were buoyed by net exceptional credits of IPounds 206.9m, representing the write-back of a provision made against its investment in Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, which had been through a refinancing, and taking into account other gains and costs relating to the flotation. The underlying trading profit before interest and tax, including associate companies, rose only modestly to IPounds 41.8m (IPounds 39m). But the company indicated it expected to see strong cashflow coming through from its operations as price increases were absorbed by the marketplace. 'The recovery of raw materials costs has been slower than we'd like, but it is starting to happen in most of our major markets,' said Mr Smurfit. 'We're not talking about price increases, but price recovery; bringing prices back to where they used to be four to five years ago.' Earnings per share rose from 7.4p to 51.6p, with the exceptional item accounting for 44.6p. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.4p (1.2p), a 17 per cent increase. The group is looking to benefit from the industry's cyclical upturn over the next few years. 'This year is not where it's at for the company. The full impact of strong product price action and the real benefits of the US restructuring will only flow through over the next couple of years,' said Mr Michael Moroney, analyst at Goodbody's stockbrokers in Dublin. COMMENT Smurfit will take advantage of the paper industry's bounce back from recession over the next couple of years. Full-year profits are forecast at IPounds 100m-IPounds 110m, or 16.5p a share, giving a heady prospective p/e of nearly 26. This drops sharply to about 12 on next year's earnings forecasts, which go as high as 35p a share, buoyed by the price rises. The acquisition could have been funded from debt, but the rights issue looks a prudent move as it will give the acquisitive group some flexibility to look for takeover targets in Germany, where it sees a gap in its European portfolio.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (6): Grunge on the slopes - Snowboarding styles and nostalgia are dictating ski fashion Skiwear follows fashion like few other sports. Its trends mimic the mainstream but, like good pupils turning after their instructor, they are always a bit behind. Sleek glamour may be re-asserting itself in high fashion but skiers still appear to feel that a hard-edged one-piece spattered with gilt studs and the logo of some expensive German label is passe, if not naff. As ever a year behind, skiwear is in the grip of nostalgia and grunge, with which the snowboarding cult is closely associated. Snowboard style now calls the shots in ski fashion, which is odd considering the mutual distrust between the two disciplines and the determination of snowboard riders, with their own vocabulary and look, to maintain the separation. With no necessity for a team identity and the need to wear more rather than less, the skier can be anybody he or she wants to be under the anonymity of hat and goggles. People do not always choose the skisuit you might expect, though practical considerations enter the equation. There is little point in wearing gear built to withstand the rigours of extreme skiing if you are trundling round the nursery slopes. But many intermediates have flattered themselves with the latest expensive techno-suit. Skiwear companies are now jumping on the snowboarding bandwagon with special ranges. Reusch's is functional, with tough ripstop fabrics, anti-wear patches and long-backed smocks. More fashion-orientated are Tokka Tribe from Luhta and Eikowada from successful British skiwear firm Nevica which two years ago caused a stir by taking over the high-status, high-tech French label Killy with the blessing of Jean-Claude, its eponymous ex-ski champion founder. Ironically, he nowadays rides snowboards rather than skis. So to be a downhiller with dash, you need to look as if you own a board. The style appeals partly because its individualist scruffiness is a statement against slick designer uniformity and partly because baggy, fleece-lined layers are relaxed and comfortable to wear. There is also the crossover factor from ski to street wear. For the occasional skier, a subdued fleece-lined parka has added value as weekend wear. The style goes right through the market with budget-conscious C&amp;A having snowboard logos emblazoned across its fleece-trimmed, ripstop smocks and anoraks. The snowboard influence has resulted in a considerable quietening down on the slopes. Gone are day-glo brilliance and loud prints, replaced by near-dreary grunge colours and naive patterns pioneered by labels such as Oxbow, which originated in windsurfing. Fleece fabrics are essential, as an extra layer or to wear alone on warmer days, and as a soft, warm trim on everything from collars to caps. Even ranges known for their technical quality, such as Schoffel, now include fleece items. Skiwear now has an improvised, street-inspired mood. Jackets and salopettes or trousers no longer need to match and can be worn with an ordinary big sweater or lumberjack shirt for a look reminiscent of pre-package trip days. Nostalgia is a good alternative for those who feel that apeing a snowboard shredder may be a fraction too hip. Predictably, some fashion skiwear firms have cashed in, notably Post Card, an Italian range whose darkly rich-looking waisted parkas and sleek stretch trousers are sophisticated, dateless and the nearest thing to investment skiwear. Belfe is an associated mid-market range with a similar look; Chervo is on the same lines. A tougher offshoot of nostalgia is the backwoods look of chunky, square shapes, neutral matt fabrics, leather trims and checked brushed cotton linings. Primarily American, the Deerhunter look has inspired European labels such as Nevica's Chinook range. It is popular with British men perhaps because the dull colours remind them of the tweeds and wax jackets in which they feel more at home. There are two areas of skiwear which, though apparently eclipsed fashionwise, have enough of a following to stay afloat. One is technical gear. This is the world of competitive fabrics, breathable linings, high-tech insulation, and names like Degre 7, Tenson, Mover and The North Face. It has hitherto been a male domain but Schoffel and Nevica now recognise that women can also ski hard and high and are making high-specification suits in a feminine cut. The other, in complete contrast, is the snow bunny. Grunge style should have rendered her an endangered species. But there are plenty of slim-waisted one-pieces and pert, bottom-revealing jackets to tempt her, this year in soft, pastel iridescents (from V de V, Nevica and C&amp;A) or glowing, oriental mixes of flame and saffron or royal blue and purple (from Luhta). The trousers may be more generously cut and the shoulders softer than hitherto but the message is the same - glamour. If skiwear follows the catwalk as usual, by next year the snow bunny will be the winner of the fashion slalom.</p>

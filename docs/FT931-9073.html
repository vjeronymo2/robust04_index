			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Testing times for a company with global ambitions - United Biscuits' drive to internationalise faces some big challenges YOU NEED not search far for clues to where United Biscuits, Britain's fourth largest food manufacturer, thinks its future lies. They are emblazoned on the cover of its annual report, which pictures UB products spilling across much of the earth's surface. Such global ambitions are a far cry from the parochial, UK- centred approach which characterised the group under the autocratic 17-year chairmanship of Sir (now Lord) Hector Laing. But since he retired two years ago, UB's horizons have widened dramatically. A youthful top management team, headed by Mr Eric Nicoli, the 42-year-old chief executive, has set its sights squarely on transforming the group into a world leader in biscuits and savoury snacks. The company has rapidly expanded in continental Europe through a flurry of medium-sized acquisitions and joint ventures, and recently acquired an Asian-Pacific bridgehead by buying CCA Snacks in Australia. This year, for the first time, more than half of group sales will be overseas. Mr Nicoli and his team have impressed UB's shareholders with their determination to impart a more coherent direction to a group which was once notorious for haphazard, expensive - and often unrewarding - excursions into unrelated businesses. They are also widely praised for their open and collegiate management style. 'The main difference today is that we are much more focused, we have identified geographic and product priorities and we are organised to make expansion happen,' says Mr Nicoli. 'We firmly believe that a more disciplined approach will result in fewer mistakes and a tighter strategy.' Yet UB has still to convince many observers, notably in the City, that its dash for growth will succeed. Not only does its drive to internationalise face some big challenges; its past has an unfortunate habit of returning to haunt it. Much of Mr Nicoli's first year as chief executive was spent sorting out problems at Ross Young's, the UK frozen food business acquired for Pounds 335m in 1988 in what is now admitted to have been an ill-conceived diversification. Then, last year, the roof fell in at Keebler, the US biscuits and snacks maker owned by UB since 1974 and which accounts for a third of group sales. Caught short by severe price competition in a recession-struck market, Keebler's first-half profits fell 57 per cent, slicing 17 per cent off the group's pre-tax results. Though action has been taken to cut costs, replace top management and regain market share, Keebler's troubles will leave a deep dent in the group's 1992 full-year results, due on March 18. Analysts forecast pre-tax profit of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m the previous year. The experience has been chastening for a management which has worked hard to establish a reputation for professionalism and tight control over the business. 'It is very frustrating that we feel we are doing the right things, our shareholders feel we are doing the right things and yet - albeit temporarily - we go backwards,' Mr Nicoli says. Despite these trials, UB continues to enjoy commanding strengths at home. Though recession and cut-price competition have nibbled into UK sales of McVitie's, its biscuit division, massive low-cost manufacturing capacity has enabled it to retain a 43 per cent market share and handsome margins of about 14 per cent. KP Foods, while less profitable, has increased its share of the British snacks market from 30 to 40 per cent in the past decade, thanks to successful product innovation and heavy marketing spending. It now claims to have overtaken Pepsico of the US, owner of Smiths and Walkers, as UK market leader. But since the late-1980s, UB has increasingly recognised that scope for further expansion at home is limited. Its search for fresh sources of growth has focused primarily on continental Europe, where it has made nine acquisitions and formed three joint ventures in the past three years. A third of McVitie's sales now come from continental Europe, up from 8 per cent five years ago, while profits there rose 26 per cent to Pounds 15.6m in the 12 months to June. Much of the profit gain has come from one-off steps to rationalise production and distribution, but McVitie's says 10 per cent margins should be sustainable in the longer run. At KP, half of sales this year will be overseas, compared with a fifth five years ago, and the division is now one of the top two in each of the European markets in which it competes. However, the rapid growth which made Continental snack markets so attractive in the late-1980s has tailed off sharply, while heavy marketing costs have held margins on KP's continental businesses to 5 per cent, half the UK level. Mr David Hearn, KP's managing director, expects this performance to improve, but adds: 'It will take a long time to achieve 10 per cent margins on the Continent because we are always in an investment phase in one market or another.' However, despite its recent spending spree, UB still accounts for only 11 per cent of the Pounds 8.6bn European biscuit market. That is barely half the share of BSN of France, which out-manoeuvred UB in 1988 to buy the extensive European food businesses of Nabisco of the US, the world's biggest biscuit maker. In the European snacks sector, which is less mature than biscuits, UB's strengths are more evenly matched with those of Pepsico. The US company also has an uneven marketing record in Europe. But with snacks sales of Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) against KP's Pounds 504m, and with far higher margins, Pepsico has more room for mistakes than its smaller rival. Mr Nicoli dismisses such comparisons, arguing that the size of total sales matters less than strength in individual markets. However, UB is a leader only in the relatively small markets of Scandinavia and the Benelux countries. It still has no business in Germany and only a marginal presence in France and Italy. In several larger European countries, it relies on local partners to distribute its products. Though a low-cost route to the market, such partnerships cannot confer the same degree of control and profits which full ownership can provide. They can also be unstable, as McVitie has found since it agreed last year to form a joint sales company in Spain with Royal Brands, part of the state-owned Tabacalera group. Eight months later, a friendly bid by Nabisco for Royal Brands has put the future of that link-up in doubt. Nabisco's return to Europe has also prompted speculation that UB might eventually be among its targets. Meanwhile, industry observers are unsure about Keebler's longer term prospects. Mr Nicoli expects the corrective measures taken so far, along with tighter management and a revamped marketing strategy, to bring a recovery in its performance this year. However, Keebler remains a distant number two in the US to Nabisco, whose superior scale and margins rendered it far less vulnerable to the recent price war. In an effort to boost volumes, UB recently spent Pounds 47m to acquire Bake Line, a leading US producer of private label biscuits for supermarkets - a fast-growing business in the past few years. UB is confident that this growth will continue - though some in the American food industry believe it is a temporary pheno-menon due largely to recession. Whether or not UB yet possesses the size and weight to compete effectively in the international big league, it is unlikely to continue adding businesses at its recent rate. With gearing at 88 per cent, scope for further acquisitions will remain limited unless it makes a sizeable disposal or a rights issue. Neither option looks particularly realistic at present. The most obvious disposal candidate is Ross Young's. But past talks with potential buyers have got nowhere, and industry observers doubt that the business would fetch much more than half the roughly Pounds 450m UB has invested in it over the years. The Terry's chocolate division, which has recently performed strongly despite the UK recession, might attract more interest. But it is relatively small, with 1991 sales of Pounds 153m. Nor does a rights issue look practical while UB's share price continues to languish at about 360p, well below last year's high of 442p - least of all at a time when a queue of other companies is lining up for cash calls. In any case, even the most sympathetic observers believe that after the recent alarms and excursions, the group now needs a period of consolidation. As a fund manager with one of UB's larger institutional shareholders puts it: 'We're impressed by the management team's strategy in continental Europe and their aggressive attitude to costs. But they have still to prove themselves in a serious way over the longer term. How they come through the current year will be a real test of their performance.'</p>

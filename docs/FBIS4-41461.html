			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--"Russia does not develop and  produce binary chemical weapons," Professor Viktor Petrunin,  doctor of chemical sciences, said in an exclusive interview with  ITAR-TASS today. The scientist heads the State Scientific  Research Institute of Chemical Technology.    According to Doctor Petrunin, the American side was fully  acquainted with all works in this sphere even during the  preparation of the treaty on a universal ban on chemical  weapons. The over all volume of 40 thousand tonnes of poisonous  compounds and their location on the country's territory is no  more a secret for the world community. Foreign delegations and  representatives of ecological organizations have been to all  depots, he said.    The recently held international conference on chemical  disarmament "Moscon-94" [as received] in Moscow, in the  scientist's opinion, had additionally devised technology of  destroying chemical weapons. Many foreign specialists have  visited scientific research institutes and enterprises of the  so-called military-chemical complex. Russian colleagues did not  hide from them any secrets, assuming that chemical weapons are a  historical anachronism. Many Russian scientists and  manufacturers now are more interested in problems of conversion,  including financing of the best projects and technologies to  destroy and utilise poisonous compounds, the Russian scientist  said.    According to Professor Petrunin, Pavel Syutkin, who has been  appointed acting chairman of the conventional problems of  chemical and biological weapons committee under the Russian  president, will" continue openness of the disarmament  programme". Russian scientists are prepared to show  laboratories and industrial installations to U.S. specialists,  as was done earlier. Russia has nothing to hide. It is  sincerely fulfilling its all international obligations," Viktor  Petrunin emphasised.</p>

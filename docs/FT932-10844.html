			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (16): Budget was double blow for the industry - Taxation / Is there a new hard line in government thinking? THE pension fund industry can be forgiven for its impression that a bout of schizophrenia has overtaken government policy makers. For while proclaiming the government's desire to see individuals take greater responsibility for their own well-being in retirement, it has set in train tax increases which could well have the opposite effect. In casting about for ways to finance its burgeoning budget deficit, it is not surprising that the Treasury should have focused on the tax breaks for the pensions industry - a sum equal to Pounds 8bn a year by its own account. However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies, in a report financed by the National Association of Pension Funds, concluded that the tax breaks were worth a far more modest Pounds 1bn per year and these are relatively modest when compared against tax breaks offered in other countries. Whatever view the industry takes of its own tax advantages, Chancellor Norman Lamont's programme, outlined in his budget address in March, have far-reaching implications for pension fund finance. More worrying, perhaps, is whether they signal a new hard line in government thinking on tax advantages for the pensions industry. The budget contained two pieces of bad news for the pensions industry. First, the pensions 'cap' - the level of gross salary upon which final salary pension payments can be based and still attract tax relief - was frozen at Pounds 75,000 for the 1993-94 fiscal year. Second, and more important, the Chancellor reduced to 20 from 25 the rate of dividend tax which tax-exempt investors such as pension schemes can reclaim from the government. This move is expected to gain the government Pounds 1bn a year in tax revenues, largely at the expense of pension funds. 'I think this is quite a clever move to reduce the tax breaks on pension schemes,' said Mr Trevor Crowter, partner at KPMG Actuarial Services. Mr Crowter notes that initially at least, there was barely a ripple of protest from either the pension fund industry or scheme members. The effects of the changes are too complex to be quickly understood, a fact which allowed Mr Lamont to enact tax increases without losing political ground, he said. But the effects of the changes cannot be easily dismissed. From April 6 this year, income derived on the portion of pension portfolios invested in UK equities will be cut by 6 1/4 per cent. Because pension fund assets are valued not on the market price of underlying securities but on cash flow - known as the discounted cash flow method - the value of the assets pool will also have to be marked down. 'Companies will have to put in higher contributions or cut benefits,' said Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co. Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, illustrates the effect of the change by citing the case of a client with a surplus 4 per cent above liabilities. The client, he said, has been preparing to distribute that as a benefit enhancement to members. But the tax changes mean that to do so will leave the scheme slightly underfunded, a consideration which has forced the client to shelve plans for additional benefits. Mr Duncan Roberts, pension finance manager at T &amp; N, the engineering company, said the tax change is likely to knock Pounds 20m off the company's pension scheme surplus when the next actuarial valuation begins this month, thus hastening the day when the company's contributions holiday must expire. R Watson's Mr Wilson notes that schemes hardest hit by the tax changes are those with large numbers of current or deferred pensioners, few contributing members, and an employer fallen on hard times who is relying on investment income to meet liabilities. In effect, the tax changes will hit hardest those schemes which can least afford to respond to them. 'The Treasury has spent nearly 10 years attempting to cancel or restrict the so-called tax reliefs on pension schemes,' said Mr Robin Ellison, partner at solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a specialist in pensions law. Mr Ellison points out that the perceived tax breaks - most notably tax-free contributions and tax-free roll-up of capital gains and income - is actually a cash flow benefit. Eventually, members pay tax on both when they receive their benefits, albeit possibly at a lower marginal rate than they would have paid if tax had been assessed while they were employed. Pensions experts say it is highly unlikely that the government will release an onslaught of new taxes for schemes. The department of social security, studying how best to restructure the state's own basic pension, can ill afford to undermine occupational schemes which have largely been responsible for improving living standards for Britain's elderly over the past 15 years. However, the treasury is said to be eyeing several changes, including the abolition of the tax-free lump sum available to scheme members upon retirement. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated this could save treasury Pounds 3bn per year. Meanwhile, the pensions industry is hoping for tax 'simplification' from the Goode Committee, the gov-ernment's own advisory panel on occupational pension reform. Mr Kevin Spring, partner at consulting actuaries Wyatt Company, cites the anomaly of the simultaneous limit on the percentage of gross salary which employees can put into a pension scheme tax-free and the percentage of final salary which can be represented by pension payments. 'Either you tax it when it goes in or you tax it when it goes out. That should be the principle,' he said.</p>

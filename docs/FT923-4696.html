			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Heavy trading Sterling futures prices gyrated wildly yesterday after the announcement of poor employment figures upset the bullish mood that had followed the UK government's announcement of a Ecu 10bn borrowing to support sterling. In the early morning, the September and December contracts traded up to 89.83 and 89.89 respectively as sterling continued to rally on the foreign exchanges, rising above the DM2.82 level. However, the Bank of Italy's announcement that it would raise its discount rate by 1.75 percentage points to defend the ailing lira further highlighted that the UK is the one country in the exchange rate mechanism that has not altered rates as a means of controlling currency movements. Both contracts gradually descended to 89.62 and 89.63 at around lunchtime in London. The very bad non-farm payroll figure in the US sharply depressed the dollar and pushed sterling to a low of DM2.7750. The contracts were therefore further depressed, reaching lows of 89.56 and 89.54. But they later rebounded with the currency. The September contract closed 8 basis points down on the day at 89.70 and the December contract was down 10 basis points at 89.68. Trading in the cash market took similar turns. One year money peaked at 10 1/2 per cent following the US employment figure but later closed at 10 7/16 per cent, which was  3/16 per cent down from the previous close. The offered rate for 3-months money, which is a guide to where the market thinks base rates are moving, closed softer on the day at 10 3/8 per cent from a previous close of 10 1/2 per cent. One discount house trader said that yesterday's moves made it extremely difficult to trade in the market. 'All you can do is stick to a long term view and hold to it, though that's difficult right now,' he said. A clearing bank trader was confident that the gyration were over, however: 'There is a new confidence in the government's determination to hold sterling at DM2.95,' he said. The Bank of England's operations were straightforward. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 450m and, at lunchtime, bought Pounds 444m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon.</p>

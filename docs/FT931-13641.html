			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Investment income decline hits PWS The effect of lower interest rates on its investment income was cited by PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance broker, as a material factor behind its reduced results. The pre-tax figure for the year to September 30 fell from Pounds 2.86m to Pounds 2.21m on turnover of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 14.8m). Trading expenses for the year fell to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 15.9m). The reductions accrued from cost control and also from the closure of Fryer Cheasley. The final dividend is maintained at 2.5p for an unchanged total of 4p on earnings per share of 6.7p (9.2p). A scrip alternative is planned.</p>

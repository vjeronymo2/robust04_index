			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 27, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani here today expressed surprise that  certain countries are always trying to kindle war and disputes  in the region. "I am asking the hijaz government that how  fratricide in Yemen might benefit you," he questioned as he  referred to the Saudi provocations in the on-going civil war in  Yemen. [sentence as received] "Arabia cannot tolerate a  powerful country in its neighbourhood according to a historical  logic," he added.    Saudi Arabia supported the Iraqi regime in its war against  Iran (1980-88), and supported Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war, he  said, however, documents were disclosed later on which showed  that Saudi Arabia did not like the disputes to be settled.    Criticizing Riyadh policies in the region, Rowhani advised  the Saudi rulers to take lessons from bitter experiences of the  past, and choose the path of peace, stability and brotherhood.  "Iran has always extended friendship and brotherhood hand to  her neighbours within the framework of Islam and international  regulations."    Pointing to the Saudi helplessness to carry out a correct  planning and to guarantee the security of the hajj pilgrims,  Rowhani said administration of a ceremony in a holy site, where  2.5 million pilgrims are present, is a heavy burden on Saudi  Arabia.    "We knew from the very beginning that the Saudi  administration with all its money and massive presence of  foreigners in that country, would not be able to administer the  hajj ceremony in a proper way," said the vice-speaker.    He said the death of the hajj pilgrims in Mina is not only  limited to the current year. Whenever there is a crowd of  pilgrims, the Saudi police think that a demonstration is to be  organized, and therefore, attack the people with anti-riot  equipment, causing multiple death of the pilgrims.    "If the Saudi police did not involve in the Mina incident  this year, the number of victims did not exceed 30," he  regretted.    Reiterating the previous proposal by Iran on the  administration of the hajj ceremonies by the Islamic countries,  he said if Saudi Arabia is not ready to accept the proposal, at  least it can accept help by volunteer countries.    "We are sure that if we help Saudi Arabia, hajj pilgrims  will  not lose their lives to this extent, and the ceremony will be  held more appropriately," Rowhani said.</p>

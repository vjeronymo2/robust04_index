			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Few vote in Nigerian election A partial boycott and widespread public apathy led to a low turnout yesterday in Nigerian elections for delegates to next month's constitutional conference, which is to be the basis of the military government's political programme. It followed the annulment of a presidential election last June after it had become clear that Mr Moshood Abiola, a businessman from the south-west, had won. Political parties and associations have been banned since Gen Sani Abacha became head of state last November and no campaigning by contestants was allowed before yesterday's vote. The 270 elected delegates to the constitutional conference will be joined by 90 government nominees. Those who voted said that unless they took part they could not influence the constitutional conference. But senior politicians around Nigeria say there is no need for the conference because Nigeria's political problems lies not with the constitution but the military elite who obstruct it. The Campaign for Democracy has called the conference a ruse to buy time for a regime which lacks direction. In the Yoruba homeland of Mr Abiola in the south-west, a coalition of politicians led by two former state governors told its members not to stand as delegates for the conference and called for a boycott of the polls. Elsewhere two powerful groups have boycotted the whole process: leaders of the large Ijaw tribe in the south-east, and a powerful alliance of retired military officers from the central region.</p>

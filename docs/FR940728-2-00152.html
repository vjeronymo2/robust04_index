			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Matching Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mechanism for matching youth with mentors should be described. Where possible, there should be a match of similar ethnic and gender characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Mentor Support and Training Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mentor support is essential to ensure program success. Each program must employ a program coordinator for mentors to contact for feedback and advice. Periodic feedback from mentors and mentees should be obtained, especially during the first two months of the relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Mentor/Mentee Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must assure that projects operated in secondary schools will provide mentees with a variety of activities, including an opportunity to spend time or participate in the work environment, witness job skills useful for obtaining employment, obtain assistance with homework, and be exposed to positive new experiences. Projects involving elementary school age children should include such activities as academic assistance, exposure to positive new activities, and emotional support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Evaluation Methods and Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation is critical to assuring that the mentoring program is operating as designed and that it is meeting its goals both in terms of the process and the impact on the mentee. Data on the program operations must be collected as well as data on whether mentoring is having an impact on academic performance and behavior. OJJDP is required by the Congress to submit a report regarding the success and effectiveness of these programs 120 days after the programs' termination; consequently, programs funded under JUMP must be capable of providing this information and must provide written assurance that they will participate in a national program evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants should address how their programs either currently comply with these guidelines or describe the steps they will take to assure compliance. Applicants must demonstrate that they have or will create an infrastructure capable of fully supporting their program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants should provide a specific timetable for all program activities indicating what will be accomplished the first year, the second year, and the third year, if they are requesting funding for multiple years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must demonstrate that they have the support of schools and, where appropriate, public agencies and other community groups that might be directly involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Staffing/Budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether the school or an eligible public/private non-profit group is the primary applicant, it is suggested that one full-time staff coordinator oversee up to 60&hyph;70 matches. In addition, a second individual, either a volunteer, paid, or assigned employee, should generally be expected to devote at least 6&hyph;7 hours a week to this project. A cost of $75 per mentoring-match per year is also recommended. Program funds cannot be used directly to compensate mentors except for reimbursement for reasonable incidental expenses, such as transportation, that are directly associated with the mentoring program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products: If appropriate, applicants should describe what written materials they will produce and how materials may be useful to their own program participants and others hoping to replicate their efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Freedman, Marc, The Kindness of Strangers: Reflections on the Mentoring Movement, Public/Private Ventures, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Winter 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hamilton, Stephen F., Apprenticeship for Adulthood, Free Press, New York 1990, p. 156.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Requirements: Applications are invited from local education agencies and public/private non-profit organizations that can demonstrate knowledge of and/or experience with mentoring programs, as well as working with volunteers and youth. When a local education agency is the primary applicant, it must partner with a public or private agency or a public/private non-profit agency. Likewise, a public/private non-profit agency which applies as a primary applicant must partner with the local education agency. National organizations are not eligible for these funds. Consideration will be given to the geographic distribution (urban and rural) of applications and a variety of program designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

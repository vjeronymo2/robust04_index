Northern's spin-doctors are insisting that the arrival of Jean Monty as president and chief operating officer is merely a long-planned move to lighten the load on Paul Stern, the hard-driving American who has up to now carried the titles of chairman, chief executive and president. Monty was previously chairman of Bell Canada, Canada's biggest telephone utility which, like Northern, is controlled by BCE Inc of Montreal. He brings with him a personable style and wide contacts among Northern's key customers in the North American telephone business. But some outsiders speculate that Monty's main job will be to keep an eye on his boss.

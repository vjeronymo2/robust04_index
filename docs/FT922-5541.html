			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / ANZ denies losses in Indian scam THE ANZ Banking Group has again denied that it faces losses in the so-called bankers' receipt scams that have rocked the Indian banking system. ANZ Grindlays general manager for South Asia, Mr Bob Edgar, yesterday backed up an earlier ANZ statement which said the bank had no reason to anticipate losses from bankers' receipt shortfalls or associated transactions. 'Some sections of the Indian media have referred to a request from the Reserve Bank of India to ANZ Grindlays to make a provision for the disputed amount, relative to the alleged transaction with National Housing Bank,' Mr Edgar said. 'ANZ Grindlays have denied the existence of the alleged transaction. ANZ Grindlays' connection with this matter is only in respect of cheques processed in the normal course of business. ANZ does not believe that it is liable in this matter and has strong legal opinion to support this view. We have been co-operating with the Reserve Bank of India to solve these problems arising from the dealings of banks in the securities market.'</p>

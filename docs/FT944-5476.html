			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic appoints advisers Scantronic Holdings, the security components group, which has become the subject of growing bid speculation in recent months, yesterday appointed Samuel Montague as its financial adviser. Scantronic said it would need the advice 'particularly in relation to the unsolicited approaches received'. It also announced it was appointing Norton Rose as legal adviser. A number of companies have announced their interest in making a bid although the company has declined to identify its other suitors. Scantronic has appeared increasingly vulnerable over the past year. In July it announced the departure of its finance director, Mr Ray Dias, claiming that he had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions.</p>

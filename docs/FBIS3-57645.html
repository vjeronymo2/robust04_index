Just recall the historic ruling establishing the adversary  nature of the process, the direct appeal to legislators to  remove a deficiency in legislation, and the direct references in  judicial documents to the Russian Constitution. New ground in  judicial practice was also broken during the cross-examination  of Marshal Dmitriy Yazov.    It is well known that, following Yazov's arrest at Vnukovo-2  Airport, the marshal was cross-examined 22 and 30 August 1991,  first as a suspect, then as a defendant, without the  participation of an attorney. (Incidentally, the videotape of  these very cross-examinations turned up in the hands of crafty  journalists from DIE SPIEGEL in mysterious, and, quite possibly,  criminal circumstances.) Yazov's defense attorneys, Nikolay  Pechenkin and Lev Abdeldyayev, asked the Military Collegium to  exclude the record of these examinations from the range of  evidence being discussed in the judicial process. However, the  state prosecution persistently returned the accused marshal to  the evidence that he gave to the Prosecutor's Office  investigators in the absence of a defense attorney. In other  words, the question arose of the admissibility of evidence  obtained in violation of the law.    Formerly, the courts endeavored to ignore such problems,  which are of a theoretical rather than a substantial character.  The Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium under  the chairmanship of Anatoliy Ukolov invervened and issued the  following ruling: "The suspect or defendant in a criminal case  has the right to have a defense attorney either from the moment  the charge is filed, or from the moment of detention or the use  of preventive restrictions amounting to arrest. Evidence  obtained from a suspect or defendant in violation of this right  to a defense attorney has no juridical force and cannot be used  to prove the charge leveled."    This means that yet more holes have appeared in the  indictment against the members of the SCSE and their associates.  At the very least, the court has forbidden the subsequent use  of evidence given by Yazov 22 and 30 August 1991 and the  examination records compiled as evidence on this basis.    According to an ITAR-TASS report, the former head of the  Union miltary department admitted the unconstitutionality of  measures employed in August 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev,  former head of the USSR, and also the actual creation of the  USSR SCSE. However, Yazov, referring to the reality of the  collapse of the unified state, again stressed the forced nature  of the top USSR party and state leaders' actions at that time.    According to Yazov no combat orders were given to the  military formations sent into the capital; an instruction was  given only to place the Armed Forces on combat alert.    The examination of Dmitriy Yazov continues.</p>

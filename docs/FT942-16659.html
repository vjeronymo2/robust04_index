			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges forward after weak start Wall Street US stocks posted moderate gains yesterday after reversing course alongside a steadily improving bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.53 better at 3,693.94, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.83 higher at 450.88. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.78 ahead to 441.76, while the Nasdaq composite added 4.45 to 752.71 amid continued bargain-hunting after a big sell-off early in the week. Stocks opened on a weak note, as profit-takers moved in following Tuesday's 82-point jump in the Dow industrials and a smaller rise on Wednesday. The bellwether blue-chip index showed a 20-point decline at the start of trading but managed to return half way to its opening level by early afternoon. Early on, there was little to influence sentiment. The bond market was holding steady in spite of speculation over monetary policy triggered by the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, who was speaking to businessmen in San Francisco. He said he thought the country's economic pessimism was unjustified. Late in the day, bond prices improved steadily, unburdening equity investors concerned over the sharp rise in interest rates in recent weeks. Share prices pushed into positive ground and finished mostly higher. On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered declines, 1,355 to 754. In the previous session, Caterpillar was responsible for almost all of Dow's modest gain. Yesterday, it gave back Dollars 1 7/8 to 118 1/4 , while Allied Signal and International Paper also fell sharply. But their losses were more than offset by DuPont, General Motors, Philip Morris and JP Morgan, which rallied in the afternoon. The session was also punctuated by conflicting signs of the economy, neither of which were viewed as particularly significant. The Labour Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefit had risen slightly last week, suggesting a slowing of the economy. Conversely, the leading US store groups indicated that consumers had returned in droves to the shopping malls last month after February's deep freeze. The figures suggested that the economy as a whole may not have lost much steam in the first quarter. Strong sales data helped lift several of the big retailers. The Gap was near the top of the NYSE's most active list after posting a 16 per cent increase in business for stores opened at least a year. The stock jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 on the news. On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems gained Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 . Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock after the computer maker posted strong quarterly earnings. Canada Toronto prices rallied in late afternoon to close solidly higher in light trading. The TSE-300 composite index rose 25.81 points, or 0.6 per cent, to close at 4,339.07, its high for the day. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 442 to 305. Volume was 62.28m shares, down from yesterday's 69.59m and trading value fell to CDollars 700.9m from CDollars 755.1m. The market opened slightly higher, but quickly slipped into negative territory before returning to neutral ground for most of the session. However, strong gains were made in the final hour of trading, buoyed by strength in Canadian bonds and the Canadian dollar. Mexico Equities nudged 0.57 per cent higher with the market caught in a see-saw session between positive and negative factors that cancelled each other out. The Mexican market's key IPC index closed up 12.81 points at 2,273.33. Traders said bargain hunter buyers dragged the market upwards. But keeping a lid on the session's overall movements were lingering political uncertainties.</p>

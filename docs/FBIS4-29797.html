			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Petaling Jaya, Fri. -- The second batch of 35  police officers left early yesterday by a Malaysia Airlines  flight from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Subang to  serve as peacekeepers with the United Nations Operations in  Mozambique (Unomoz).    Led by Superintendent Shamsuri Abdul Rahim, 45, the officers  left at 1am [1700 GMT] to Johannesburg, South Africa enroute to  Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. They will be in transit in  Johannesburg for eight hours before catching a local flight to  Maputo.    Shamsuri is the head of the administration unit of the  Disciplinary Branch with the Federal police headquarters in  Bukit Aman.    He said his team would spend about a year with Unomoz and  gradually replace the first batch of 35 officers who began their  duty on November 16 last year.    "We will be stationed in groups throughout the 11 provinces  in Mozambique as observers for the October 30 general elections  there," he told newsmen at the airport. [Passage omitted]</p>

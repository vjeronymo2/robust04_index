			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: AN ALPHABET FOR GOURMETS BY M. F .K. FISHER (NORTH POINT  PRESS: $12.95)  </P> <P> A collection of short, pungent essays from 1949 that are less about food than  people's attitudes toward food. M. F .K. Fisher reflects on great meals,  terrible meals and the popular misconceptions of what constitutes good cooking.  The few recipes she includes sound horribly fatty by today's cholesterol- and  calorie-conscious standards, but Fisher probably would dismiss those qualms  about fine food as unworthy caviling. The book's charm lies in her  straightforward, delightfully self-assured style: At just over 200 pages, it's  a minor gem that belongs in the library of anyone who likes to cook -- or eat.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDING POOR A WELCOME TASK FOR MILLIONAIRE  </P> <P> Deborah Szekely was 62 years old and admittedly starting to feel lazy when she  found the challenge she wanted as president of the Inter-American Foundation, a  small, federally funded foundation that works in Latin America.  </P> <P> There were some who questioned whether Szekely, a Republican who became a  millionaire by running a health spa for the overweight rich, was the right  person to help poor Latin Americans.  </P> <P> But Szekely, now 67, quickly proved that she could do the work and do it well.  </P> <P> "She has been a stalwart. . . . She has done the kind of job that the  Inter-American Foundation was created to do . . . and she has done it with  great gusto," said Rep. Dante Fascell (D.-Fla.), who helped shape the  legislation that created the agency in 1969.  </P> <P> Szekely, founder of the Golden Door health spa, did have other options. She had  a chance to publish a magazine in New York. She considered moving to Paris and  studying philosophy at the Sorbonne. She could have spent her time traveling  and partying.  </P> <P> But Szekely decided that what she really wanted was "something to stew and fret  and worry about." Wrestling with the problems in Latin America has helped  satisfy that craving, she said.  </P> <P> Starting a second career at the foundation and coping with the challenge of the  work there also has sharpened her mind, kept her vital and enabled her to  blossom late in life.  </P> <P> "You can't stretch if you aren't challenged," she said, "and if you mind isn't  stretched, how do you keep your body flexible? The flexibility of both are so  interwoven."  </P> <P> In her Arlington, Va., office, brightened by colorful dolls and crafts made by  Latin American artisans and presented to her as gifts, Szekely talked about the  poverty she has seen on some of her trips.  </P> <P> Growing up during the 1930s as a child in Mexico, Szekely saw plenty of poor  people. "But every home had a vegetable garden, a goat tied in back, a few  pigs, chickens underfoot. Today, because of the increased population, they have  nothing. You go into houses, and there is nothing."  </P> <P> As foundation director, Szekely oversees an agency with a staff of about 70  people and a mandate to support the self-help efforts initiated by poor people  in 32 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.  </P> <P> When she travels, Szekely wears practical slacks, shirts and sandals. Her  elegant and expensive business suits stay in the closet of her Georgetown home  here. When necessary, she stays overnight in the field and sleeps in a hammock,  in keeping with local customs.  </P> <P> Although she is a self-described "health nut" who avoids meat at home, she has  learned to eat fresh-killed chicken, barbecued goat and skinned guinea pig when  it is served to her as an honored visitor. "When you have to eat shoe leather,  I eat shoe leather," she said.  </P> <P> Szekely never doubted that this job was perfect for her when she began lobbying  the foundation's board of directors to hire her as president in 1984. She  already spoke Spanish. She had worked in Mexico.  </P> <P> And she knew first-hand about development and management. She and her first  husband, Bordeaux Szekely, opened their health spa, Rancho La Puerta, in Baja  California in 1940.  </P> <P> "It was $17.50 a week, bring your own tent," she said. "We had kerosene lamps,  outhouses. We started with absolutely nothing."  </P> <P> Szekely opened a second spa, the Golden Door, in Escondido, Calif., in 1958.  She and her husband were divorced in 1969. Her second marriage also ended in  divorce.  </P> <P> But her businesses were booming. The Golden Door, which now charges $3,500 a  week, has attracted such guests as Cher and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)  </P> <P> Szekely sees a basic similarity in trying to serve the very rich and the very  poor.  </P> <P> "The most important thing is listening to what they are trying to say," she  said. "The poor have the same ambition as the rich: They want a more fulfilling  life. So you listen to what they are trying to say and try to establish what  they need and how you can help."  </P> <P> The worst poverty, she said, is in Brazil and along the Amazon tributaries,  "where the only thing the people have is 10 kids. A woman has 20 births and  maybe 10 live kids. And once in a while they will have a cassette radio, but no  electricity. And the schools are a disaster."  </P> <P> More than 80% of the foundation's $28-million annual budget last year was given  as grants to stimulate development in Latin and Caribbean countries.  </P> <P> Grants have helped farmers in Bolivia buy a tractor to grow more vegetables,  enabled fishermen in Venezuela to purchase equipment they needed to market  their catches and provided assistance to women artisans in Ecuador operating  knitting and weaving businesses.  </P> <P> Szekely believes she can apply what she has learned in Latin America in the  United States. So she is now planning a third career, in which she hopes to  establish a nonprofit agency to improve life of inner-city residents, just as  the foundation has sought to make life better for poor Latin Americans.  </P> <P> "I have always taken on big problems and big headaches," Szekely said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER, ANGEL FACILITIES COULD PRESENT OPTIONS  </P> <P> The tragic earthquake that jolted the Bay Area Tuesday has left the World  Series in limbo.  </P> <P> Could it be resumed? Should it be resumed? Where?  </P> <P> Will structural damage rule out further play in Candlestick Park or the Oakland  Coliseum?  </P> <P> Does anybody have the stomach to play games while dead are being buried,  injured treated and homeless cared for?  </P> <P> Regardless, Tuesday was not the time for decisions to be made, but one  possibility would be to move the Series out of the area. The most logical spot  would be the Southland, where there are two big ballparks -- Dodger Stadium and  Anaheim Stadium -- and the facilities to house the large group involved.  </P> <P> "All I could say is purely speculative," said Angel public relations director  Tim Mead. "Local (Bay area) officials, including the mayor, are supposed to  meet (today) to assess the damage. The Oakland Coliseum will have to be looked  at as well and then take the next step from there.  </P> <P> "I think, at this point, baseball is secondary. The World Series is so  important for baseball, but, for now, its secondary. I don't even know what the  mood will be for several days. I'm sure the Dodgers and Angels will be ready to  do whatever baseball requires. But again, it's so speculative.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, there is nothing in the textbook to tell you how to handle a  situation like this. (General Manager) Mike Port is there in San Francisco. So  is Kevin Uhlich, the stadium operations director. From reports I saw on  television, I would say the chance of moving the Series is doubtful."  </P> <P> Contacted at home, Dodger Vice President Fred Claire, when asked about the  possibility of staging games at Dodger Stadium, said: "I have no idea. That  would have to come from the commissioner. There is too much there for me to  even speculate until we receive word from the commissioner's office."  </P> <P> The logistics of making such a move would be staggering. The Anaheim Stadium  infield has already been covered for football. The Rams play host to the New  Orleans Saints Sunday.  </P> <P> How long would the Series be postponed? How soon could tickets be printed? Who  would get them?  </P> <P> Tuesday, nobody was interested in addressing such questions.  </P> <P> Two neighboring cities that had shared the thrill of battling each other on the  baseball field had suddenly been united in tragedy. Canseco and McGwire, Clark  and Mitchell were on the same side. They were among the survivors.  </P> <P> Nothing else mattered. Certainly not a baseball championship.  </P></p>

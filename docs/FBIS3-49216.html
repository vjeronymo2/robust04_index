"From this position, PDSR  fully backs the official efforts Romania is making to become a  member of the North Atlantic Alliance. PDSR salutes the  initiative of Romania's President Ion Iliescu to address on 24  December a letter to the heads of states or governments of the  NATO member states, before the upcoming meeting of the alliance,  reconfirming Romania's constant interest to become a full member  of the NATO structures.    PDSR took note with satisfaction of the recent declarations  of high officials in the U.S. Administration, according to whom  "the Partnership for Peace" is for the budding democracies in  Europe, Romania included, a first step in the process of their  integration in the NATO structures and a guarantee of security  at the same time. We are sure that under the conditions of the  political developments in our proximity, NATO will be in a  position to offer security guarantees to Romania, necessary for  preserving its national being and ensuring conditions for  carrying the democratic transformations the Romanian people has  committed to since the December 1989 revolution.    On the eve of the Brussels meeting of the NATO countries,  PDSR expresses hope that Romania's security interests will  resonate with the leaders of the NATO member states, that no  discriminatory practices will be accepted concerning the  countries interested to enter the Euro-Atlantic structures. At  the same time, we understand the concerns repeatedly expressed  by the U.S. Administration and other NATO member countries for  not isolating Russia and for taking into account its security  interests, without prejudicing in this way Romania's security  interests."</p>

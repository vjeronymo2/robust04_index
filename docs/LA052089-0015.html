			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESEDA BURIES BELL IN 90 MINUTES TO WIN 3-A VOLLEYBALL TITLE  </P> <P> The Bell High Eagles are the Minnesota Vikings of City Section volleyball.  </P> <P> They can't win the big one.  </P> <P> Three times in three years Bell has been to the City 3-A Division boys'  volleyball final, and three times it has gone home the bridesmaid.  </P> <P> Reseda did the honors Friday at UCLA's John Wooden Center, ousting the Eagles  in four games for the second consecutive year. The scores: 15-12, 11-15, 15-3,  15-3.  </P> <P> Unlike last year's match, which took 2 1/2 hours, this one was over quickly,  lasting a mere 90 minutes.  </P> <P> "It was awful. The third and fourth games, we stunk," Bell Coach Mike Mayfield  said. "Reseda has a great player. It would be interesting to see how they would  do without the superstar."  </P> <P> Mayfield was referring to Reseda's senior hitter, Coley Kyman, who this time  last year was in a hospital recovering from spinal meningitis. Kyman had a  match-leading 24 kills and celebrated nearly every one with a war whoop and by  raising his fist and prancing around the court.  </P> <P> "I'm happy as hell," Kyman said. "I wanted to win it for my teammates this  year."  </P> <P> Kyman recorded seven kills in the first game as Reseda (16-2) built a 13-7  lead, saw Bell (19-2) close to within 14-12, then won the game on the second  game-point when the Eagles' Carlos Arroyo set the ball over the net and out of  bounds.  </P> <P> Kyman had eight more kills in game two, but Reseda lost an 11-9 lead when Bell  scored the final six points of the game to even the match.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of breakdowns in that second game," Reseda Coach Bob Berrenson  said.  </P> <P> But the Regents came back strongly in game three behind Kyman and senior Scott  Kent, who was playing with a bad back. The Regents went ahead, 7-1, and coasted  the rest of the way, clinching the win when Joe Kretchet stuffed Cesar Uballe's  spike for a point.  </P> <P> "It was like my guys thought, 'Well, we won a game, let's go home,' " Mayfield  said. "They packed it in."  </P> <P> Indeed, the fourth game was more of the same as Reseda took a 5-0 lead. Kyman  added five kills in the game and Kent three, and the Regents sealed Bell's fate  on the first match point when the Eagles were cited for a net fault.  </P> <P> "It went by so fast," Berrenson said. "Last year was a nail biter for 2 1/2  hours and we were prepared for the same thing tonight.  </P> <P> "They were pumped up. They've played like that all year."  </P> <P> In addition to his spikes, Kyman had 11 blocks to lead Reseda.  </P> <P> Kent finished with 10 kills and seven blocks, Kretchet added eight kills for  the Regents, and Kyman's twin, Bobby, had seven kills.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOO OLD TO RILE IF NOT PROVOKED, ZSA ZSA SAYS  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor, complaining of a terrible headache, took the witness stand for a  second day of cross-examination Thursday and immediately confessed -- to being  old.  </P> <P> "Mr. Fox, I am an old lady," the 60-something actress told Deputy Dist. Atty.  Elden Fox, who is prosecuting her for slapping a Beverly Hills cop. "Would I  hit a 6-foot-6 cop with a gun if he isn't insulting me to death?"  </P> <P> Then Gabor, saying she was so fatigued she had not returned a Wednesday  telephone call from former President Ronald Reagan, stepped aside for other  defense witnesses, who supported her claim that she acted in self-defense.  </P> <P> Rosa Peric, a Hancock Park art dealer, became the star defense witness thus far  in the two-week trial, testifying that she was driving past the scene June 14  when Gabor emerged from her white Rolls-Royce and slapped Officer Paul Kramer.  With what she called a "perfect view" from high in her Jeep, Peric disputed  police officer testimony that Gabor stepped out of the Rolls on her own before  hitting Kramer.  </P> <P> Rather, Peric testified, Kramer pulled Gabor out by the wrist and then slammed  the car door. Peric called the treatment of Gabor "very rough, in my opinion."  </P> <P> Another defense witness, Melanie Jonkers flew west from Virginia to testify  that Kramer treated her arrogantly and abrasively after pulling her over for a  violation involving a child's car seat in October, 1988.  </P> <P> Jonkers, one of several witnesses called by Gabor to try to prove "a pattern"  of misconduct by Kramer, told jurors she ultimately was handcuffed and seated  on the curb while her 2-year-old daughter was kept in her car with the windows  up in 100-degree heat. Then she was jailed briefly.  </P> <P> Jonkers said she decided to testify for Gabor "to set the record straight . . .  about how abusive this man (Kramer) is."  </P> <P> Under cross-examination, however, Jonkers conceded that her daughter's head was  partially out the window of her Mercedes when she was pulled over by Kramer.  She also admitted that she refused to sign a traffic citation, explaining to  jurors that it was her first ticket, that she was not from Los Angeles and that  Kramer told her she would have to appear in court.  </P> <P> Jonkers said she became so upset at the time that she doubted Kramer was really  a police officer and ran into the street, attempting to stop a public transit  bus and a car as she cried for help.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: The power of pastiche - Television A man slumps at his desk, squeezing his temples and grimacing. Clearly he has a headache. A woman in a white coat approaches from behind. 'Tense, nervous headache?' she asks, taking a brochure from the desk drawer, 'You could choose a leading brand of painkiller or' - giving the man an almighty whack round the ear with the book - 'you could choose from thousands of First Choice Holidays]' Well it made me laugh. So did the commercial where the dialogue goes 'Is it a bird?' 'No, it's a plane]' 'No, it's a fat chef]' because clearly the object flying through the air is a fat chef. This is one of a series so successful that they have actually lodged their punchline in my memory. Since I can never remember which product a commercial is for, even when I enjoy the joke (for instance the one where the 'bouncing bomb' union flag towel gets to the sun lounger ahead of the German tourists; gloriously politically incorrect, but which beer?) this seemed quite an achievement . . . until I realised they had taught me 'Pay attention, Medomsley Road, Consett' but failed to lodge in my mind the name of the crisps which are made there. My current favourite among the ads is the series where various middle aged men - one overhearing himself discussed in the men's washroom, another undergoing an operation - mime to the Nat King Cole recording of 'Let's Face The Music And Dance'. I re-wound the tape to check on the advertiser which is Allied Dunbar pensions and life assurance, hence the importance of the line 'There may be trouble ahead'. And do these enjoyable ads have anything in common? They do: all are pastiches of well known television items. 'Tense, nervous headache?' was for years used by a branded analgesic (heaven knows which). 'Is it a bird? Is it a plane?' is meant to produce the response 'No, it's Superman]' And the miming, in style, music period, and particularly the hospital setting, is clearly a tribute to the late Dennis Potter. Enjoyable as they are, however, those commercials are the exceptions. Since the summer schedules are stuffed with so many repeats and duff programmes it seemed a good moment to check on those bits of television where the critic usually hits the 'Fast Forward' button: the commercial breaks. Flashing through the tapes, zapping out the programmes and watching only the advertisements certainly makes a change, and brings home certain truths. We know, of course, that production values are often high in the breaks, after all people can spend as much producing 30 seconds here as on 30 minutes of programming. But it is startling to find how much is old or even very old, and how much is infuriating and counter productive. Given the whiz-kid image of the ad biz, and the impression advertising people like to convey that all new trends spring directly from them, it seems astonishing that the talking chimps are still promoting PG Tips. They began in 1956. In concept and gentleness of humour virtually nothing has changed in 38 years. If the series does ever end (and no doubt somebody is already campaigning for the rights and dignity of chimpanzees) it will leave an unfillable hole. In 1959 Domestos was undertaking to 'kill all known germs in an hour'. In 1994 it is offering to 'kill all known germs anywhere'. After 40 years detergent manufacturers are still comparing the grey laundry of their competitors with their own dazzling whites. The first cat named Arthur stuck his paw in a tin of cat meat in 1967; last week another white cat named Arthur was still doing it. It is 30 years since Esso urged us to 'Put a tiger in your tank' and today the tiger is racing across crumbling ice floes (why?) to get to an Esso station (why, if as we are told the big petrol companies routinely use supplies from one another's tankers?) And the umpteenth pretty woman is giving head to Cadbury's Flake. Concentrating on the commercials you also notice how often they try to baffle you with science. Remember 'WM7'? That was Omo's secret ingredient in 1963. In the past few days products have boasted of 'pro vitamin B5' of a 'hydromat complex', and of a 'unique hydroxy formula'. Others offer 'time release freshness' or 'anti-static agents' and, in the case of a razor, 'micro fins'. All of a sudden every toothpaste manufacturer is promising that the product is stuffed with bicarbonate of soda. So what? And why, anyway, is quite so much television time currently occupied by advertising for toothpaste, toothbrushes, denture fixative and so on? Do we pay more attention to our teeth in the summer? The claims in those ads are, mostly, merely ludicrous. There are others, for companies with which many of us are familiar, that may actually turn many viewers against them. How dare the AA, for example, claim 'To our members we're the fourth emergency service', thus attempting to appropriate public esteem for ambulance crews and firemen? Remembering how long you have sat in the rain waiting for the AA to arrive, this campaign is enough to drive you into the arms of the RAC. Similarly, if there was any alternative to the Post Office most of us would surely take it after our experiences in waiting to buy a few stamps, or being refused a tax disc on a Saturday morning. So to be told repeatedly that the Post Office is 'part of everyday life' is enough to make you spit with fury. And what makes anyone imagine that Bob Hoskins being coy and gnomic, even if he does have the estuary accent which is now mandatory for commercials, is going to make us use the phone more? We know what it is already costing us. Nor is it just a question of service organisations. In view of recent revelations about The Body Shop, the commercial for American Express which consists of Anita Roddick being all green and feminist and third world seems a teeny bit unfortunate. Commercials surely cut both ways. There is little informational advertising on television: overwhelmingly it is concerned with brand awareness and market share, and it depends heavily upon the predisposition of the viewer. If you begin with deep reservations about the treatment dished out to the public by high street banks or major airlines, then their television advertising, far from changing your mind, is likely to reinforce your feelings. Now that Nicole (she with the oh-so-stupid 'Papa') has allowed us to see her taste in underwear, why should any of us trust her taste in motor cars?</p>

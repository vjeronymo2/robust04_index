			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 20 (AFP) -- European employers  called on governments here Monday [20 June] to get off the backs  of business by cutting public sector spending and lowering  social charges levied on employers.    The Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of  Europe (UNICE) said the way to economic recovery lay through  lowering the burden due to the state, improving labour  flexibility and boosting small business.    "There can no longer be any question of imposing more  charges  on businessmen. They are sinking. They are no longer  competitive," UNICE president Francois Perigot said.    He presented a UNICE report entitled "Making Europe More  Competitive" which said that businessmen needed to wean  themselves away from state aid and that EU governments should  not depend on business to fund swollen welfare programmes.    The report called for deregulation and privatisation of such  government sectors as posts and telecommunications, energy and  transport, plus a more efficient public sector and more open  public procurement tenders.    It urged stricter conditions for unemployment, health and  other welfare handouts, along with a lower minimum wage, fewer  restrictions on dismissing workers, and pay rises pegged to  productivity.    Perigot rejected suggestions that governments should fund  welfare programmes from an energy tax.    "For 30 years we have been continually expanding the sources  of (government) revenue without ever attacking spending," he  told a press conference.    UNICE's call came four days ahead of an EU leadership summit  on Friday and Saturday which will look for ways to cut  unemployment and boost Europe's declinin competitiveness against  the United States and Asia.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter (1): Demise of NEDC leaves UK without means for valuable industrial dialogue Sir, I am glad that Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint: June 18) did not cheer the demise of the National Economic Development Council. It needed reforming, of course, but not abolition. The council, and its many working parties, have brought together national representatives of industry, trade unions and consumer interests to exchange views and also on occasion to agree action. Other European countries all seem to find dialogue of some kind valuable, and it could have been made more effective here. In one form or another consultation and dialogue surely must take place, and it is up to government to decide how it should be organised, The research activities of NEDO, on the other hand, can readily be taken over by the private sector. Indeed the public interest may be better served by sponsoring independent research. This is the sort of pattern followed in Germany and in most countries of continental Europe. As Samuel Brittan says, what is needed is not just routine economic forecasting but 'research into the obstacles to growth' and how they can be overcome. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has been following such an agenda since well before NEDO was founded. We have benefited from co-operation with NEDO over the years. Now we must try to fill some of the gap that will be left when it goes. Andrew Britton, National Institute of Economic and Social Research, 2 Dean Tench Street, Smith Square, London SW1P 3HE</p>

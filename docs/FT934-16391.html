			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: King defends LME copper squeeze move MR David King, chief executive of the London Metal Exchange, has rejected sharp criticism of the exchange's action last month in imposing a limit on the cash premium for copper, which was being inflated by a technical squeeze on metal available for immediate delivery, Reuter reports. He declined to elaborate on a statement he made at the time that the LME board had taken the action 'in anticipation of the development of an undesirable situation', but he strongly defended the exchange against any suggestion of irregularity in the way the decision was taken. Mr John Champagne, president of Magma Metals Company, has said he was extremely disappointed by the LME move. At a lunch of mining analysts last month, he also suggested that the exchange had too many short position holders on the board and criticised it for delaying announcement of its decision for one and a half hours. 'In view of the comments made in the press,' Mr King said yesterday, 'it's appropriate that people know that behind the scenes there are all sorts of checks and balances. 'Standard practice is that whenever significant decisions are made in the board, our compliance people automatically track trading activities of directors' firms. . . We need to be able to confirm that no advantage has been taken of that information.' He said he had been unable to read the decision across the floor of the market immediately because it was not in session. 'We announced the decision at the first available time in the afternoon when the market was operating,' he declared. 'In wanting to ensure a level playing field we need really to announce it on the market floor,' he explained. 'Then all the ring fraternity instantly knows at the same second what the board's decision is.' Mr King said it was totally wrong to say, as some had, that the copper price fell precipitously prior to the announcement. Even at the end of the day the market had not dropped much. The slide in copper prices has been resumed at the exchange this week, with the three-months position closing yesterday at Dollars 1,686 a tonne, down Dollars 12.75 since Friday's modest rally and about Dollars 200 below the level ruling when the squeeze suddenly evaporated at the and of last month. With the cash position falling even more steeply the Dollars 56 cash premium over three-months metal has been replaced by a Dollars 23 discount, which is regarded as a normal level for the cash/three-months spread when supplies of the metal are freely available. The cash discount, or 'contango', represents the costs of holding physical metal, chiefly storage, insurance and lost interest on the capital employed. Business on the exchange hit a record in September, driven mostly by volatility in copper, which plunged to six-year lows after the LME limited the cash premium. Copper futures traded 2.24m lots (25 tonnes each), up from just 771,105 in the same month last year, and copper options were traded on 220,380 lots, up from 44,399. Altogether in futures and options, LME volume hit 4.2m lots in September, up from 2.42m in the same month last year, while the total for the first nine months soared to 25.28m lots from 17.76m.  -----------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS        (As at Monday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium  +6,350 to 2,208,075 Copper     -1,025 to   600,700 Lead         -250 to   287,275 Nickel        +48 to   117,978 Zinc       +1,475 to   803,250 Tin          -150 to    20,935  -----------------------------------</p>

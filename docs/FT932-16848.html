			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / No such thing as a free flight: Guy de Jonquieres and Michael Skapinker examine what lessons the flawed Hoover offer holds for other consumer businesses Hoover's free flights fiasco, which culminated this week in the dismissal of three top managers and a Dollars 30m provision by Maytag, its US parent, may have turned the company into a national laughing-stock. But for many other consumer businesses, the affair has struck too sensitive a nerve to allow much gloating. Though Hoover's programme was deeply flawed, it is a stark reminder that all sales incentive schemes involve risks - and that when things go wrong, the consequences can be as severe for companies as for their customers. 'My attitude is one of sympathy,' said one travel industry executive. 'There but for the grace of God go all of us.' Tempting buyers with promises of something for nothing is one of marketing's oldest wheezes. Recently, recession and keener competition have brought many new players into the game and provided a bonanza for consultants in 'value-added' or promotional marketing. 'There are loads of different rewards on offer - from free holidays to compact discs and video-recorders,' says Ms Sue Short of the Institute of Sales Promotion, an industry body. 'Many retailers launched programmes after they saw Hoover's success in generating sales.' Long popular with the tabloid press, 'value-added' promotions have spread to quality newspapers, including the FT, with its promotions of 'Lunch for a Fiver' and two business class air tickets for the price of one. Supermarkets including J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway have all recently offered incentives such as cheap air tickets and holidays and free computers for schools. About 140 groups have contracts with Air Miles, a company set up in late 1988, which give their customers credits towards the cost of air tickets. An estimated 15 per cent of British households now collect Air Miles. Foreign travel incentives are particularly popular, partly because excess capacity in the travel industry makes them cheap to offer. Many airlines and tour operators provide discounts for 'value-added' promotions free of charge in exchange for the advertising they generate  - and also because they stand to make profits by selling extras such as car rental. Most such schemes have run smoothly, because experience has taught their sponsors to take precautions against pitfalls. What distinguishes the Hoover case is that the company seemed oblivious to the dangers. Indeed, in the view of many marketing experts, it made almost every mistake in the book. The key to 'value-added' schemes lies in calculating how many consumers will take advantage of them. 'It is essential to know the full extent of your exposure in advance,' says Mr Terry Leahy, marketing director of Tesco, which rewards customers spending more than Pounds 25 at its stores by contributing towards the cost of computers in their children's schools. Many companies use sophisticated computer models to forecast the likely take-up rate by eligible applicants. For travel-related schemes this averages 10 per cent or less. If the rate risks being much higher, most companies will insure against losses. Dixons, the electrical retailer, says it will only run promotional schemes if it is sure they will be profitable. Hoover neither did its sums properly nor, it says, did it take out insurance. The company's most serious error was to generate an uneconomic take-up rate by offering too good a bargain: the chance to acquire air tickets worth as much as Pounds 400 by buying an appliance for only Pounds 119. Many consumers bought Hoover products simply to qualify for free flights. No other company in recent times has made such a generous offer. But then most say their promotions, unlike Hoover's, are not designed to induce consumers to make purchases they had no intention of making; rather, the aim is to persuade those who are already in the market to choose one brand over others. Mr Tony Bennett, marketing director of travel agents Thomas Cook, which recently ran a promotion with the consumer electronics company Sony, says: 'You don't get people going into Currys or Dixons saying they want a Sony television; they say they want a television. All we want to do is influence them at the point of sale to buy a Sony television.' Outright free gifts, unless of trivial value, are also a rarity. Most promotions require a further investment by consumers in order to take advantage of an incentive. The most popular method is to offer discounts on the total cost of purchases such as holidays, restaurant meals or air tickets. Some schemes are also designed to reward customer loyalty. Safeway recently offered discounts of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on Thomson holidays, depending on how much customers spent on groceries over a three-month period. Hoover's problems were compounded by confusion about the conditions of its promotion. This had already been amended at the insistence of the Advertising Standards Authority, the industry watchdog, which objected that it did not make clear that the free flights were limited to certain dates and destinations. Yet thousands of consumers still claimed to have been misled. 'Hoover were not bold enough about the restrictions on their programme. By the time people came up against them, they were emotionally committed to taking the flights,' says one travel manager. Worse still, many customers who had complied with the conditions were kept waiting for flights by the travel agents administering the scheme. According to Mr Steve Dowdle, marketing director of the UK subsidiary of Sony, avoiding customer complaints is the first rule of 'value-added' promotions. 'We have turned down schemes which looked marvellous on paper because the conditions were too complex,' he says. Sony also sets up a telephone helpline for every special offer. 'If more than 1 per cent of eligible customers complain, a promotion has not worked,' says Mr Dowdle. Companies such as Sony, Sainsbury and Tesco are acutely aware that whenever they launch a promotion, they put on the line their single most precious asset - their brand. For them, a short-term sales boost is valueless if it is achieved at the expense of customers' long-term confidence in them as reputable suppliers. But do special promotions really yield tangible benefits - or are they simply necessary to match the competition? Tesco says market research shows well-run schemes enhance customer loyalty. Mr Don Gray, marketing director of Express Newspapers, says they can raise circulation by up to 5 per cent - though he is unsure how much of such gains is permanent. The FT says promotions help it both to forge a closer relationship with readers and to build up information about them which is useful in selling advertising. Mr Dowdle of Sony is more sceptical, saying his company engages in special offers mainly to satisfy retailers. 'I would love to do no promotions at all, because I'd like to feel that people choose Sony because of its products, not for the incentives,' he says. Mr David Pugh, marketing manager of the Telegraph group, fears the Hoover fiasco has devalued even reputable promotions. 'The next time we run a special offer, questions will inevitably arise in readers' minds,' he says. 'We will have to go out of our way to distance ourselves from Hoover-type schemes.' Given that consumers' right to legal redress over poorly handled promotions is often unclear, such prudence is probably their best guarantee against future fiascos. But that is small consolation to Hoover as it struggles to repair damage to its reputation which threatens to linger on long after the financial costs of the affair have been settled.</p>

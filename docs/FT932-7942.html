			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commerce nominee withdraws in US MR John Rollwagen, President Bill Clinton's choice to be deputy secretary of commerce, has withdrawn after his Senate confirmation hearings were delayed by investigation of possible insider trading at his former company. The withdrawal is another setback in the administration's slow filling of the top positions in each department. The Commerce department is notably short of Democratic appointees; Mr Ron Brown, the secretary, is the only nominee yet confirmed by the Senate. Lower-level nominees have been held up by the delay over Mr Rollwagen's confirmation. He is a former chairman of Cray Research and said in a letter to Mr Brown that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested 'background information' from him. The 'unplanned delay' in his Senate confirmation hearings had given him 'valuable time for personal reflection.' The SEC investigation is understood to involve sales of shares in Cray Computer, a spin-off of Cray Research, shortly before the company announced that it had lost a big contract from its principal customer.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> THE SPOILED COOK  </P> <P> My mother's idea of a great meal was one that could be cooked in 10 minutes.  She'd come breezing into the apartment, throw her hat onto the kitchen table  and the cast-iron skillet onto the stove. Then she'd dump a can of peas into a  pot, salt the skillet, take the lamb chops out of the refrigerator and the  Minute Rice down from the shelf. The meat would hiss as it hit the hot salt,  sizzle as she set the table. As she called out "dinner" she'd glance at the  clock and peel off her gloves. "Eight minutes," she'd say with satisfaction.  </P> <P> The books piled on top of the refrigerator -- where the cookbooks should have  been -- all had titles like "I Hate to Cook," and "No Fuss Food." My mother  felt that she had better things to do with her life than spend it in the  kitchen. My father, apparently, agreed. "Your mother," he'd say solemnly and  often, "is a marvelous cook."  </P> <P> I think he really believed it. Fortunately for him, he was blessed with an iron  constitution. In our family you needed it to survive. My mother certainly  thought she had better things to do than clean out the refrigerator. And she  definitely didn't believe in the concept of spoilage. "Just a little bit of  mold . . . " she'd say, scraping it off.  </P> <P> My mother was equally blase about what went into the pot. I once watched her  construct a casserole for dinner. It began with leftover turkey and broccoli.  She found some ancient stewed prunes and plopped them in. Then she unearthed a  little leftover rice. "This might be interesting," she mused, adding some  cottage cheese she found floating on one of the lower shelves. By now she was  happily dumping everything that was in the refrigerator into the casserole.  "Mom," I said finally, stopping her, "you just threw in half an apple pie!" She  looked disconcerted. "I did?" she asked. Then she shrugged. "Who knows," she  said, "it might be good."  </P> <P> I don't think it was -- to anybody but my father. But then I can only remember  one time when my mother made something that even my father could not swallow.  </P> <P> It was early one Saturday morning. Early for Dad and me -- late for my mother  who, at 7, had already been up for at least three hours and greeted us with  disgustingly cheerful smiles. All either of us ever wanted to do in the morning  was to be left alone. In our house, that was impossible. "I need you to taste  something," said my mother to my father. He followed her, groggily, into the  kitchen. She held out a spoon. He obediently opened his mouth. But as he closed  it, a look of absolute horror spread across his face. He stumbled to the sink  and spat it out. "That," he said, gasping, "is the worst thing I've ever  tasted."  </P> <P> "Um hum," said my mother, "just as I thought. Spoiled."  </P> <P> My mother might have been bored by everyday cooking, but parties were  different. She entertained eagerly, often -- and eccentrically. Her main  objective was to be creative, to feed her friends something they had never had  before. For my mother, this was no problem; she was the first on her block to  serve mussels, to serve wild rice, to serve kiwis. While ordinary cooks were  concerned when people looked up from their plates and said, "This is so, er,  unusual," my mother took it as a compliment.  </P> <P> Occasionally, however, she accidentally hit on something really good. Like her  baked corned beef. It was so good that when I was in college, I actually wrote  and asked her for the recipe. "Your friends will love it," she wrote back,  "it's so different."  </P> <P> MIRIAM REICHL'S BAKED CORNED BEEF  </P> <P> 1 (3- to 4-pound) corned beef  </P> <P> Few bay leaves  </P> <P> 1 onion, chopped, or 1 tablespoon onion flakes  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard  </P> <P> 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> Whole cloves  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 15-ounce) can spiced peaches  </P> <P> Place corned beef in pot. Cover with water. Add bay leaves and onion. Cook  until meat is very tender, about 3 to 4 hours.  </P> <P> Remove meat from water. Skin off all fat. Make paste of mustard and brown sugar  and cover meat with paste. Insert whole cloves as desired.  </P> <P> Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour, basting frequently with some syrup from spiced  peaches. Serve with drained spiced peaches. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P></p>

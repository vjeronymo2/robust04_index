Under the impact of the wave of  reform in the rural system, large numbers of farmers are  escaping from the confines of the land, applying themselves  vigorously to enlarging the scope of their business activities,  and continually opening up new fields of endeavor in rural  modernization. Twenty-one percent of rural female workers have  already turned to lines of work outside of agriculture, which is  not much different from male laborers, of whom 30 percent have  turned to lines of work outside of agriculture. Of them, 52.4  percent have turned to industry and processing; 16.5 percent are  putting their efforts into commerce, or the service industries;  4.7 percent have entered the ranks of the construction industry;  2.8 percent are specializing on the transportation industry; and  23.6 percent are going into other industries. Women are involved  in many parts of social production, and their income is  increases every day. The ratio between the incomes of women and  men is approximately 0.78 to one.    Education and Training. In the 15 years since reform and  opening up, 46.3 percent of rural women throughout China have  received some kind of training in agricultural technology.  According to this survey, women make up 27.6 percent of farmers,  with occupational titles of agricultural technician and above.  The rise in their own educational level has also further raised  the consciousness of rural women about providing even more  educational opportunities for the younger generation. The survey  found that 80 percent of women aged 18 to 29 expect their  children to attain at least a high school education.    Marriage and the Family. Changes show up mainly in that a  wife's opinions on important policy matters in her family cannot  be ignored. There has also been a steady decrease in incidents  of family violence.    Participation in Society. The results of an evaluation of  the  political awareness of China's rural women show that 49.8  percent of them could correctly give the name of the general  secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and 11.2 percent could  give the name of the President of the United States in that  year. Among the major topics that they discussed with others,  13.8 listed social phenomena and issues first, while 13.4  percent ranked first exchange of information related to their  work. It is plain that rural women harbor great enthusiasm for  participating in external affairs.    Pre-Natal Care. According to the survey, over the last ten  or  more years, rural women have come to attach more and more  importance to pre-natal care, while rural pre-natal care  services have also become more and more organized and  standardized. Among women under 40, 46.3 percent are able,  during pregnancy, to receive prenatal examinations in accordance  with their doctor's advice, and 57.2 percent have the assistance  of a midwife, or medical personnel, during delivery. At present,  66.5 percent of villages have a trained, qualified midwife.    Social Attitudes. Although the traditional idea that "men  should be in charge of the outside, and women should be in  charge of the inside," is still deeply rooted in rural areas,  the self-awareness of China's rural women is gradually being  increased. The survey shows that 66.1 percent of people either  doubt or deny the view that "males are by nature better than  females;" 61 percent deny the notion that "a woman should avoid  being in a higher position than her husband;" and 71 percent  approved of the statement that, "I would despise myself if I  could not accomplish anything."</p>

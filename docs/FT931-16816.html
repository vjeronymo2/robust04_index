			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Argentines taxed by economic recovery: Reforms are under pressure FOR the first time in years Argentines have a government strong enough to make them pay their taxes. The crackdown on tax evasion is a central feature in Argentina's extraordinary economic recovery: by dragging hundreds of thousands of people into the tax net, the government can finance itself without printing money for the first time in a generation. The political consequences are intriguing. Argentines are rediscovering that tax payments also give them the right to decide how money is spent, that government resources are limited and, thus, that they have a personal stake in how they are governed. The government forecasts that, by raising tax revenues by a third, it will have a balanced budget this year. Virtual elimination of the budget deficit has already cut inflation to less than 20 per cent a year - from a record 197 per cent a month in July 1989 - and, as a result, the economy is growing rapidly. Previous governments, both civilian and military, lacked either the power or the legitimacy to collect taxes, so from the first military coup d'etat this century, in 1930, they simply printed money. Few countries can match Argentina's ensuing inflation and massive devaluations, its vicious juntas, its Kafkaesque bureaucracy, its corruption, or its visceral aversion to paying taxes. Now Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, says inflation and devaluation are no longer options. He has made the currency convertible and required the central bank to hold reserves equivalent to the entire money supply. The result may be an overvalued currency, but Mr Cavallo says convertibility is 'brutal, ultra-realist. It removes from all sectors (the ability) to evade reality. All sectors used to believe there was always a rabbit in the top hat.' As well as raising taxes, President Carlos Menem is dismembering the corrupt and inefficient state, eliminating the over-regulation that justified its existence but suffocated the economy. Nearly all state companies are being privatised this year and the civil service is being decimated.  This attack is hugely popular. However, Mr Menem has left little in its place. Mr Miguel Angel Broda, a business consultant, warns: 'The state is as inefficient in providing education as it was in making steel. We need a small but efficient state.' The atrocious social services are especially worrying now that Mr Cavallo's economic reforms are beginning to hurt. Real wages are falling and wealth is becoming more concentrated. Mr Ricardo Gutierrez, Treasury secretary, admits: 'Growth creates losers as well as winners. We need a safety net, an efficient and rapid social service system.' Failure to respond to social demands could threaten the future of economic reform. Reform in Chile was imposed by a military junta and in Mexico by a one-party state. In Latin America, only Bolivia has succeeded in combining it with democracy. The difficulty in Argentina is that the people's will - expressed in regular, fair and free elections - may not coincide with Mr Cavallo's plans. In last year's congressional and gubernatorial elections, voters overwhelmingly endorsed Mr Cavallo's reforms. In elections in September this year, it may be a different story. The traditional option of appeasing public opinion by handing out wage 'increases' or providing public sector jobs is no longer valid. Already, though, Mr Cavallo is under tremendous pressure from within the government to ease his strict policies. Worryingly, he has responded with a 17.4 per cent increase in spending this year - which he must cover with tax revenues and privatisation receipts - and in October restored some trade protection. Although Argentina does not have much of a democratic tradition and is having to reconstruct its shattered political and economic systems simultaneously, democracy will probably withstand the stresses of reform. The military is discredited, the trauma of hyperinflation has created a consensus for change, and the examples of Chile and Mexico show that sacrifice can be worthwhile. The risk is that Mr Menem will shrink from reform in the face of public hostility, as he is trying to amend the constitution to run for re-election when his term ends in 1995. He makes little effort to hide his irritation with Mr Cavallo, whose days in office are in consequence often rumoured to be numbered. But Mr Cavallo says that with every day his policies remain in place he is winning new allies. As more individuals and companies pay taxes, repatriate their savings or hold local currency they become stakeholders in stability. Nobody likes paying taxes, but Argentines hate inflation and economic instability even more.</p>

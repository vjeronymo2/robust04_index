			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Deuce, ad Tories Do not bank on the idea that Labour is finished. That is what the crystal ball has indicated for most of the past fortnight, but these are early days. The great British political game of 1992 is not yet over. Indeed, it has hardly begun. The date of the contest is still uncertain, although it sounds like April 9. As to who will win, none of us can be sure. The poll results are maddeningly close. Just a few weeks ago, the score stood at deuce, advantage Labour. Today it stands at deuce, advantage Conservative. Next week the percentage point could hop back over the net. My current guess is that the Tories will squeak home, either with a majority of less than 10 or as the largest party in a hung parliament. This is also the conventional wisdom, which should be a warning that it stands a high chance of being wrong. The guesswork can be refined by asking why the Conservatives are doing so well and - an entirely different question - why Labour is not five or six points ahead. The first of these questions is the easier one to answer. Since the turn of the year, the Tory campaign has been extremely cleverly managed. In mid-December, the government realised that the Autumn Statement forecasts of economic recovery would not come true. It looked as if the continued recession would sweep the Conservatives out of office. So a decision was made to divert the public's attention. It has been adhered to with the fierce determination of ruthless politicians who want above all to win. Trump after trump has been played. The nature of the entire election campaign has been ingeniously restated. We are now to believe that this is not a clapped-out administration grasping for an unearned fourth term, but a brand-new government, headed by a personable young prime minister who is seeking his first mandate from the electorate. Labour's tax proposals have been subjected to intense and justified scrutiny, with by now well-known results. Other court cards have come out this week: a spot of trade union-bashing from Mr Michael Howard, followed by a reminder from Mr Tom King that the Tories are resolute on nuclear weapons. Mr John Major has been portrayed as something better than Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He is cast as both international statesman and the ordinary chap of humble origins who can be trusted by middle England. He suits the part perfectly. He is the Conservatives' ace. What is surprising is that Labour failed to prepare itself for all this. It was obvious that the government would focus on tax and spending during an election year. The correct defence was a pre-emptive attack. The shadow chancellor should have been put on television after Christmas to set out Labour's fiscal proposals in precise detail, in the hope of fixing them in the public mind before the Conservatives could make their Mr Major is cast as both statesman and ordinary chap who can be trusted move. The avuncular Mr John Smith could have achieved that. That he did not is symptomatic of what ails Labour. When Tories are down they pick themselves up and fight harder. When Labour is down it moans and turns in on itself. The party was ahead at Christmas-time, so it relaxed. It should have been hammering the Tories on a single theme, such as the persistence of the recession. But Labour's strategy is not managed by a single individual or a tight working group. The Conservatives have Mr Chris Patten as an energetic and surprisingly tough-minded chairman, plus Messrs John MacGregor, John Wakeham and Richard Ryder to help day-to-day planning. Labour's war cabinet is far more diffuse. Its campaigns co-ordinator, Mr Jack Cunningham, does not enjoy the powers or status of a Tory chairman. These operational details matter. There is no longer the hatred of the government that some expressed when Mrs Thatcher was in office. Nor is there much overt enthusiasm for Mr Neil Kinnock's party. Yet the underlying mood of the country is one of impatience with the recession. There is a feeling that it is time for a change, perhaps time to give Labour a chance. With a mood like that and gloomy economic outlook reports like the one from the Confederation of British Industry this week Labour should be five or six points ahead. It can still recover. The Conservative tax campaign, born of Christmas desperation, may have been timed too early for maximum impact. The CBI message may yet seep into the general consciousness, confirming what people know from experience to be true. This week's insinuation that the Tories would raise VAT if re-elected may not have been wholly countered by Mr Major's denial. Mr Smith's party political broadcast, stating who will benefit from Labour's proposals, may help. It did not have the knuckleduster quality of the Tories' anti-tax propaganda of the previous week, but it may be no less successful. Labour's decisions to adopt proportional representation for elections to a Scottish assembly and a new London authority could confuse the Liberal Democrats and attract some of their votes. Much therefore depends upon Labour's political dexterity over the next few weeks. If its tactics are sharp, it could recover. If not, the penalty could be severe. When Labour looks like winning, some Liberal Democrats vote Tory; when the danger seems remote, they return to the fold. In England, a Labour lead could therefore start the unravelling of the opposition. In Scotland, the peril is imminent. This week's ICM poll, published by The Scotsman and Independent Television News, shows 50 per cent in favour of an independent Scotland. This may not translate into Scottish Nationalist Party victories at a general election - unless Labour looks like losing the main contest. In that circumstance there could be an accelerated swing to the SNP. Mr Major would win, at the small price of losing Scotland. You would never have to worry about Labour again.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Changes that threaten employment prospects of disabled Sir, David Hunt, secretary for employment, has announced proposed changes to special schemes for disabled people in employment ('Grants to employers on disabled to be halved', June 26). This signalled an end to the Disabled Person's (1944) Employment Act. The fact that people qualifying for special schemes will not under the proposals need to be registered - which they currently are under the act - implies the 'quota' requiring 3 per cent of a workforce to be registered disabled people is dead. Does this indicate the government's intention to introduce new laws to protect the rights of disabled people? Other proposed changes have not been thought through. Currently, disabled people who need extra equipment or services to work receive them with no additional cost to the employer. After April 1994, employers will be required to pay 50 per cent. This may be acceptable to large companies but what about self-employed people and small companies which have just survived the recession? My company employs five people and has eight associates; all but one are highly qualified, skilful disabled people. The other is severely able-bodied. What will I tell them if these proposals put me out of business? Stephen Duckworth, Disability Matters, Berkeley House, West Tytherley, Wilts</p>

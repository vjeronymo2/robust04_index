			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: John Cage - Obituary THE composer John Cage died on Wednesday in a Manhattan hospital, three weeks short of his 80th birthday. Celebrations for that event were already in place across Europe and the United States, for Cage was much loved on the international new-music circuit. In many ways he could be regarded as the most influential figure in post-war music, one whose ideas ramified across the avant-garde arts. His own works may not endure (his own artistic stance would surely have rejected such conventional concepts as greatness and posterity) but his significant position among the convolutions of music in the second half of the 20th century is assured. Born in Los Angeles in 1912, Cage started his conventional musical training in his late teens, and his brief spell of study with Schoenberg in 1934 has become a legend in itself; Schoenberg refused to contemplate Cage's compositions, describing him as 'not a composer, but an inventor - of genius'. Within the next decade, however, he was beginning to create his own musical sound world, freed of the received ideas of his training. But while the percussion orchestras and prepared pianos of his pieces of the 1940s brought him close to the world of American experimentalism, his own philosphical inclinations led him far from their homespun transcendentalism. From the late 1940s Cage studied Eastern philosophies, and in 1950 began working with the Chinese I Ching, first using its chance procedures to determine the details and structure of his compositions in his Music of Changes a year later. From that first loosening of the composer's control over the shape and content of his music, it was a natural progression to a totally open-ended concept of what a musical composition could be, and quickly on to the notorious 4' 33' for any instrument or ensemble of 1952, in which the performers sit mute on the platform and the music consists of the external sounds that break their silence. Cage's ideas quickly attracted a small group of disciples in the US - composers such as Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff, the pianist David Tudor - and he established connections with visuals artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns; his lifelong collaboration with the dancer Merce Cunningham dated back to the 1930s. His significance to the European avant garde was slower to take root, but in the late 1950s he was discovered by the generation of Boulez and Stockhausen, who used his ideas of open-ended form to wriggle out of the strait-jacket of total serialism that threatened to stop their musical revolution in its tracks. The conceptual break made, Cage's subsequent work, his writings and lectures as much as his music, merely expanded and exploited that sense of absolute freedom in which nothing need be excluded from the work of art. His tape-pieces as much as his joyful instrumental collages utilised any sound material to hand, while his notated works used an increasing variety of means - astronomical charts, paper imperfections, computers  - to free his music from any taint of creative discrimination. By the 1980s his stature had turned decisively from that of derided eccentric to revered elder statesman; his own patent enthusiasm and open-handedness, his childlike fascination for games, as well as his serious interest in mycology all added to the portrait of a humane, multi-talented thinker. Whatever was done in his name by artists of subsequent generations, Cage's intentions were never ill-meant; subversive in the best sense of the word, they provided a necessary corrective to the over-insistent dogmas of the post-war years and can take much of the credit for the polyglot musical world in which composers today can work.</p>

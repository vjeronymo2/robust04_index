			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Sport: Cucumber sandwich set samples the Euro-hoopla - Croquet CROQUET is THE game for the 90s (although it can be played by any age group). It is family oriented, 'green' and 'caring' - it is astonishing how much the average croquet player cares when he fails to win - and it is the coming Eurogame. To appreciate how obvious this is you only have to look at the language. 'Croquet' is a French word which according to Larousse means petit biscuit sec aux amandes. Under another entry however, it is referred to as: (mot anglais) jeu qui consiste a faire passer sous des arceaux des boules de bois avec un mallet. This somewhat careless admission by the French that croquet is an English word (although the Oxford English Dictionary suggests the word is 'perhaps northern French, a dialect form of 'crochet' meaning 'hook'') makes it possible to permit the continentals to play. Having established that croquet is British, the rest may join in. There has been a spirited attempt to claim that the word croquet is of Irish origin, deriving from the Celtic cluiche (pronounced cloo-ic-ee). This should delight the denizens of Dublin in the year their city holds the title of Cultural Capital of Europe. No doubt, the EC Ministers who awarded the title were mindful of Ireland's contribution to croquet when they made their choice. They will have known that croquet's most likely route to England was from the beaches of northern France (where it was played with crooks by peasants) via Ireland. Here, the son of the ivory turner John Jaques whose name has become synonymous with English croquet, claimed that he picked up a set of croquet implements which he brought back to London and decided to copy and manufacture. His family were fanatics for inventing or reproducing games including 'Happy Families', 'Tiddley Winks' and 'Ping Pong' and their company was instrumental in popularising croquet in Victorian England. In the mid-nineteenth century, croquet was exported to Australia, New Zealand and North America and the British contrived to ensure that almost everyone played to their rules. The exception was the US which kept an early version of the game. This rather startled members of the Croquet Association of Great Britain, who visited in the 60s and found the Americans playing to rules the British had abandoned at the turn of the century. Now, croquet is booming in the US. Championship games are played on immaculate lawns in the prestigious surroundings of Palm Beach but the 'backyard' version, a nine wicket (ie hoop) game, continues to be popular. Recently croquet claimed to be the third fastest growing sport in the US (after surfing and volleyball). There are signs that the Americans have astutely recognised the importance of croquet in the European context. Rumour has it that a full-sized croquet lawn is being laid in the heart of the Euro-Disney Park, where a version of the famous game played by Alice, will be annually reconstructed using MEPs as hoops and black puddings as balls, with prawn cocktail crisps accompanying the Pimms at tea intervals. Balls will be directed by laser beams to music composed by Jean-Michel Jarre. There is a historical precedent for this form of musical entertainment. One of croquet's greatest champions was George Frederic Handel Elvey, a country parson whose father had been organist at St George's Chapel, Windsor, hence his son's resounding first name. Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, was a contender for the part of the Red Queen in the Euro-game and following his recent revelation that he is a croquet enthusiast (who has even played on snow), Lord Jenkins of Hillhead - known to the French as 'Le Roi Jean Quinze' - is a candidate for the role of king. The French are the reigning Olympic champions. They produced a team of 20 on the last occasion that croquet was in the Olympics - in Paris in 1900. They were the only entrants. Manchester was, of course, chosen as Britain's candidate for the 1998 Olympics because of its convenient proximity to Bowdon Croquet Club where the prestigious annual croquet invitation event, the President's Cup, is played. This is an attempt to move the game away from London which has been the centre of the croquet universe. Each year competitors have streamed to Hurlingham from all corners of the earth to take part in the World Croquet Championships (another version of which is sometimes held at a winery in California). The current champion is, of course, British; a young man called Robert Fulford who, when he is not playing croquet, studies mathematics at Durham University. Croquet's recent progress is largely due to the work of the game's Development Officer, Chris Hudson, a member of the Bowdon, who has done more in the last few years to galvanise croquet into taking a serious place in the sporting world than has been achieved in decades. This has been accomplished through Sports Council grants and careful planning, resulting in more domestic competitions designed to encourage garden players (the cucumber sandwiches and tea-set) to take up the 'official' game, more schools competitions which have produced the influx of young players such as Fulford, and more international events. Croquet has always been an international game. Test matches have been played between Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand since the 1920s. The US will join the triumvirate for the next Test, and Japan is also making progress. Croquet resembles the Japanese national game of Gate Ball and has become popular particularly among women. Fourteen countries will be at the World Championships this summer at Hurlingham. English croquet players visit Italy on a regular basis to teach the Italians and their pupils are so entusiastico that they have even contributed their own cup to the World Championship event. They call it the 'Fun Cup' and it was presented the first year to Jerry Stark of the US for sartorial elegance (he plays in plus fours held aloft by red braces) and in 1990 to Japanese competitor Toro Takano, for simply being there. Last year, the French hosted a tournament in the Loire valley where the food and wine were excellent and the lawns appalling. No doubt, the effect of the first had something to do with the judgment on the second. The latest European entrants are the Spanish and the Swiss. The Santa Clara Croquet Club at Jerez de al Frontera in Spain, founded in 1979, has around 16 members and a motto: 'No dues, no don'ts'. The Swiss have been keen garden players for years and are teaming up to play the Italians and the French for a Coupe des Alpes but the only official club to date is based at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research. The idea that croquet is a daft game for old ladies and colonels stands in sharp contradiction to the kind of people who currently make up the top 100 players in the official British league. Most are young men in their 20s who play other sports. Ask them why they play croquet and they will simply answer that it is a 'good game'. Association croquet combines the best of snooker and chess. It is an intellectual exercise in tactics played in the open air, mentally challenging and mildly energetic. It requires more psychological than physical stamina and, above all, a great deal of patience. Time moves slowly in croquet. A player can wait more than an hour for a turn and it has taken more than a century to try to codify the rules - which are still open to interpretation, as every croquet player, 'official' or otherwise, is well aware. Croquet can involve the kind of incessant quibbling and procrastination which makes the EC taking 22 years to make a law about jam seem a rather hurried affair. The history of the game is riddled with infighting, petty squabbling and 'personality clashes' which are at odds with the outward 'etiquette' of croquet. It is a game known for its style and a degree of Edwardian elegance and restraint which has all but disappeared from the rest of the sporting scene. For, whatever their internal rivalries, croquet players are generally undemonstrative in public. They are not given to throwing their arms about each other or taking anything stronger with their tea than a couple of distalgesic. Best of all perhaps, croquet is a game at which the British excel. With the exception of a handful of New Zealanders, the British really do play croquet better than anyone else which only goes to to prove the truth of the old saw, les Francais inventent, mais les Anglais perfectionnent. Now THAT should go down well in Europe. If you want to play croquet contact: The Croquet Association, The Hurlingham Club, Ranelagh Gardens, London SW6 3PR, Tel 071 736 8411).

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first of dozens of world leaders arrived in  South Africa today for the presidential inauguration next week,  among them United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  and Danish Prime Minister Nyrup Rasmussen. Nan Roux spoke to  them at Jan Smuts Airport.    [Begin recording] [Roux] Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived  just  before eight this morning and looked fresh despite a long  flight. He said he was deeply moved to be in South Africa, where  he said democracy was now a reality.    [Butrus-Ghali] I pay tribute to the people of South Africa  for this great achievement. I rejoice with you; you have shown  that democratic values can overcome differences and  discrimination. The new South Africa is a land of promise and  of hope. As you take your rightful place in Africa, in the  United Nations and in the world, we welcome you, we wish you  well.    [Roux] Next to arrive was Danish Prime Minister Nyrup  Rasmussen. He also offered his congratulations and said Denmark  and South Africa could look forward to better relations in the  future.    [Rasmussen] I can assure you that my country Denmark will be  here also to assist you in all what we can -- our experiences  and our systems. We will be there. We hope the best for the  future of South Africa.    [Roux] Among the other arrivals today were heads of state  and  representatives from the Comores, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and  Uruguay. Representatives from Sweden, Australia, Canada,  Israel, and Bahrain are expected tomorrow. [end recording]</p>

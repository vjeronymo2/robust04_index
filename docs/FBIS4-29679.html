			<p>BFN     [Text] Kin -- Over burdened with military exercises that  U.S. Forces in Okinawa have frequently conducted near  residential areas, residents in Igei District, Kin Town, set up  signs reading saying "All Military Vehicles Are Prohibited From  Using This Road" in two locations on 16 June. In this way, the  residents clearly manifested their objection to the passage of  U.S. military vehicles through their district. Igei District is  located near a Camp Hansen training ground and U.S. Forces have  intensified guerrilla warfare training in Range-5F (jungle  warfare) since late May; Range-5F is located near a reservoir  forest. A growing number of U.S. military vehicles have passed  through the district to the range. Igei District chief Masafumi  Ikehara said: "Setting up those sings is our inevitable  response to protect our children's educational climate and the  lives of our residents."    Igei District villages are hundreds meters away from  Range-5F. During live-firing training, rounds land near the  reservoir forest, which is a source of water for the residents.  According to a resident, U.S. troops fire their automatic  rifles, mortars, and other heavy weapons during their training,  and the sounds are audible.    Tsuneo Nakama, chairman of the Igei District Administrative  Committee, has said: "It is highly possible that fire caused by  the training could burn the reservoir forest and there is a fear  of stray bullets." On 3 June, the committee adopted a  resolution demanding that the live-firing exercise be halted,  Range-5F be removed, and the passage of U.S. military vehicles  through the district be prohibited. The committee has asked Kin  Town and the Okinawa Prefectural Government to make the same  demand, but training still continues unabated in Range-5F and  the number of U.S. military vehicles passing through the  district is growing.    U.S. military vehicles pass through residential areas in  accordance with "the Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement  [SOFA]." American troops and military vehicles freely pass over  almost all roads in Okinawa in the name of "their movement  between military installations."    Masafumi Ikehara has vented his anger over damage inflicted  by U.S. military bases, saying: "No matter SOFA, it is  ridiculous that U.S. Forces in Okinawa are threatening the lives  of our residents without listening to their opinions. U.S.  Forces in Okinawa have continued to cause accidents in Igei  District during their training and our district is like a  battlefield. We can no longer tolerate the frequent passage of  U.S. military vehicles through our district."    Each of the two signs, measuring 1.8 meter in height and 0.9  meter in width, was set up at a farm road near Range-5F and at  the entrance to the town road in the village. The two signs  read in English, "Any Military Vehicles Are Prohibited To Go  Through This Road." Igei District, that put up the two signs,  plans to stringently check the passage of U.S. military vehicles  through the district and check on training by U.S. Forces in  Okinawa.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE VALLEY: LEARNING TO NOT BE LATE  </P> <P> The procrastinators advance across green lawns toward the Pierce College  classroom, seeking salvation and looking sheepish.  </P> <P> They are late.  </P> <P> A class titled "How to Stop Procrastinating" is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. on  a warm, lazy Saturday. Twenty students are registered. Three arrive on time.  One is a reporter writing a column that originally was going to be written six  months ago -- a legacy from a previous columnist who really meant to get to it  last year.  </P> <P> Instructor Barbara Cheresnick-Rosenbaum, 38, has been waiting 15 minutes. She  is a Woodland Hills psychologist and creator of "Video Aspirin," a videotape  she describes as an antidote to stress "the natural way, without drugs, for  only $14.95."  </P> <P> Rosenbaum wears a purple ensemble: dress, nails, high heels. She has a  formidable air of confidence and self-discipline, a diminutive exorcist ready  to battle the demons of sloth and lethargy.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum's watch is an hour fast. This is not part of some high-powered time  management strategy, however. She confesses that she has put off resetting the  watch since daylight-saving time ended.  </P> <P> Someone mistakenly has scheduled Rosenbaum's class in the same room where a  marketing class is in progress. The marketing students react with loud  contempt, evidently unacquainted with poet Pablo Neruda's sentiment that "there  is nothing more beautiful than wasting time." They jeer as Rosenbaum and their  instructor discuss the mix-up:  </P> <P> "That class was last year."  </P> <P> "They put it off."  </P> <P> "Do it tomorrow."  </P> <P> The procrastinators retreat to a classroom next door. Eight in all, they  include senior citizens and college students, hardened veterans and rookie  offenders.  </P> <P> Max is a lanky, folksy government engineer with gray hair beneath a baseball  cap. His wife signed him up. Max accuses himself of being a workaholic and  putting off fun things, such as vacations to Hawaii and target practice with  his pistol. He quotes Clint Eastwood: "A man's got to know his limitations."  </P> <P> Donna, the tanned mother of a tyrannical, insomniac 3-year-old, exudes health  but complains that motherhood has put her fitness program on permanent hold.  She calls procrastination the family vice. "You know the rabbit in 'Alice in  Wonderland' -- 'I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date?' That's the  story of my life."  </P> <P> The procrastinators swap war stories about their battles with time. One woman  says she combines exercise with walking her two large dogs. Max exercises at  work whenever nature calls, climbing six flights of stairs to the farthest  possible restroom. And he strengthens his shooting muscles by hoisting his  briefcase repeatedly as he walks to and from the corner where he meets his van  pool; he rises to demonstrate.  </P> <P> Max again rises when Diana, the young divorcee on his right, explains that she  is emotionally scarred because she grew up in a family where nobody ever "gave  me a hug and told me everything was OK."  </P> <P> "You want a hug?" Max says. "I'll give you a hug. Everyone should get a hug."  </P> <P> Max and Diana hug. Everyone beams. Rosenbaum says, "Isn't that great?"  </P> <P> Then Concepcion, who sits on Max's left, discusses the hardships of living  alone. Max wastes no time, asking, "Do you want a hug, too?"  </P> <P> Concepcion complies, somewhat hesitantly. Everyone beams. Just as it looks as  if a hugging melee might break out, Rosenbaum gets back on track.  </P> <P> She explains that procrastination results from anxiety, paralyzing  perfectionism and the understandable desire to postpone unpleasant tasks. She  instructs the class to map out their priorities on paper. She tells them to  imagine themselves very old, asking them what -- years from now -- they would  think they gained and lost if they stopped procrastinating now.  </P> <P> "I'm not Einstein," she says. "But I can give you some good, practical  suggestions."  </P> <P> Rosenbaum recommends that students construct schedules on daily, weekly and  monthly matrices. The leatherbound Cadillac of personal organizers is available  in stores for $175, a portable reminder that time is money.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum also punctuates the self-help jargon with a touch of the drill  sergeant.  </P> <P> "Repeat after me," she commands, pacing in front of the room. "It's OK to be  less than perfect!"  </P> <P> It's also OK to be a bit ruthless, apparently.  </P> <P> As the students shed the shackles of aimlessness and transform themselves into  hard-charging, agenda-toting uebermenschen, they will have to step on some  toes.  </P> <P> "So what do you delete from this schedule because it's too full?" she asks.  "Other people. Delete others. Learn to say no."  </P> <P> Practice on strangers, she says. Take no guff from telephone salespeople.  </P> <P> Then unleash a stern new assertiveness on pushy friends, demanding relatives,  even children.  </P> <P> "I have lots of friends," Rosenbaum says. She explains how she recently applied  a verbal stiff-arm to one friend who was intent on a marathon telephone chat.  </P> <P> "She was a little upset. But I felt great. I had done something for me."  </P> <P> After class, Max buys an $8.95 audio cassette version of "Video Aspirin." He is  in his 60s, old enough to have seen a daughter graduate from Princeton, young  enough to have decided that the procrastination has got to stop.  </P> <P> "Just spending three hours today talking about it has helped," Max says.  </P> <P> He heads off into the night: a satisfied student, proud father, philosophical  procrastinator -- a man who knows his limitations and who plans on getting  around to doing something about them one day.  </P></p>

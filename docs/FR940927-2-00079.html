(``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on August 23, 1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation/National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist assigned to the stock on the Amex; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's stockholders more liquidity than is presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group of market-makers and, in doing so, expand the capital base available for trading in its Common Stock; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Company believes that firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS system will be included to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional research and advisory reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before October 13, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

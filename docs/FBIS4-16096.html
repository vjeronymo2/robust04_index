			<p>BFN     [Text] Dissatisfied with the mild statement of the State  Duma on the situation in Bosnia, approximately 20 radically  inclined deputies -- Aleksandr Nevzorov, Anatoliy Lukyanov from  the Russian Way group, Vyacheslav Marychev of the Liberal  Democratic Party, and others -- decided to hand in their own  appeal to the U.S. ambassador in Russia on Wednesday evening.  Expressed in it is, and I am quoting: profound indignation at  the barbaric bombing by NATO aircraft approved by President Bill  Clinton. The statement also contains the demand, and I am  quoting again, that: The illegal operation be investigated  immediately and NATO troops be withdrawn at once from the  territory of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

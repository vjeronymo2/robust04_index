A research team, headed by senior geologist Huang Zhongxin,  under the Changqing oil-prospecting administration of the basin  came to the conclusion based on a systematic study of a large  amount of hydrogeological materials and other related  information amassed over the past four decades.    According to them, the basin has a water-bearing area of  144,000 sq [square] km, with total reserves of 11,400 billion cu  m [cubic meters], of which, 6,960 billion cu m are fresh water.  This is equivalent to 267 times the volume of China's largest  freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, in east China's Jiangxi Province.    Most of the water-bearing strata lie 500 m to 600 m below  the  surface, but some of them, especially in Shaanxi Province, are  no more than 100 m below the surface.    The scientists believe that the development of such rich  water resources will not affect oil and natural gas prospecting  work in the basin.    They add that the exploration of the water resources will  play an important role in helping solve the problem of  industrial and drinking water supply and underground flooding of  oilfields in the area.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GET IN GEAR  </P> <P> It must be exasperating for the White House to watch Soviet President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev taking bows in the East and the West like some conquering Caesar.  But on the global scale in which the Bush Administration surely will one day  learn to operate, exasperation is what makes big-league diplomats really turn  on the charm, not lapse into name-calling.  </P> <P> If it was the purpose of Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, in  calling Gorbachev a "drugstore cowboy" to cut the Soviet leader down to size in  the eyes of the world, he failed. For one thing, the slur belongs to an earlier  generation, and few Americans and fewer Russians know what it means. Even the  lexicons leave some question about whether a drugstore cowboy is more a fraud  than a fox.  </P> <P> Instead of knocking Gorbachev off his pedestal, the episode simply emphasized  again that Bush so far has failed to articulate what he wants for his nation in  a world of rapid change, and how he can best get it, particularly when it  involves dealing with Gorbachev. Worse, all that his advertised review of  foreign policy strategy has produced along that line is another voice from the  past, a proposal to let reconnaissance planes fly at will over both eastern and  western countries.  </P> <P> What the nation needs from its President now is a strategy for moving as fast  as possible to trim nuclear arsenals to whatever minimum number is needed to  deter conventional war.  </P> <P> It needs quick and massive reductions in ground and tactical air forces that  face each other in Central Europe, along the lines already suggested -- again  taking the initiative -- by Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Perhaps even more important is the need for a coherent strategy for disengaging  Eastern European nations from the control of -- indeed the armed occupation by  -- the Soviet Union and letting them turn toward their historic roots in the  West. That must be done without the kinds of sudden moves that might lead to  violence and, in turn, far more serious confrontation between East and West  than now exists. It will take considerably more delicate maneuvering than the  trips Bush plans to Poland and Hungary, both of which may look good on  television, but neither of which can substitute for years of solid and  difficult diplomacy.  </P> <P> The United States also needs to hold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  together for as long as it takes to achieve the other goals. But the sluggish  pace of strategic thought in the White House these days not only risks but also  encourages a breakup of the Western Alliance.  </P> <P> Bush should be more concerned than he seems to be, for example, that Paul H.  Nitze, former chief arms control adviser for President Reagan, is appalled at  the Bush Administration's opposition to West Germany's yearning for  negotiations with the Soviets to reduce the stock of short-range nuclear  missiles that are on its land, or pointed at its land. Nitze provided much of  the intellectual justification for hard-line U.S. positions in the Cold War and  has worked just as hard in recent years to take advantage of the opportunity  for a thaw.  </P> <P> The Soviets have fallen back into sullen old habits as a result of the argument  over whether to modernize U.S. short-range missiles or negotiate smaller  arsenals. Twice in the past week, ranking Soviet officials have threatened to  leave in place some SS-23 missiles that they agreed more than a year ago to  take out of the European theater under the INF treaty that called for  abolishing an entire class of U.S. and Soviet medium range missiles. In typical  Cold War rhetoric, the Soviets are now engaged in endless denials that such a  clear violation of the treaty would be no violation at all.  </P> <P> Sooner or later, Bush will discover that these and other irritations and  exasperations tend to grow when the superpowers are yelling at one another  instead of talking with one another. He will have a better chance to achieve  the nation's goals if he makes the discovery sooner.  </P></p>

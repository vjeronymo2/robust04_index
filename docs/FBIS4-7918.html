			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- Today parliament  defeated both bills on amendments to the Value-Added Tax [VAT]  Act which came into effect on April 1. The mass media demanded  that newspapers, advertisements in them and Bulgarian books be  exempted from VAT. One of the bills was moved by Yuriy Borisov  and Ivo Atanasov, MP's of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party].  Under it Bulgarian scientific and fiction books and newspapers  with the exception of porn publications would be exempted from  the 18 percent VAT for a period of three years. The other bill  was moved by MP of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] Lyubomir  Pavlov; under it advertisements in the mass media would also be  exempt from this tax.    The Borisov-Atanasov bill was defeated 111-65; the Pavlov  bill was killed 140-27. According to Miss Velislava Dureva, MP  of the BSP, the secret ballot was prompted by media threats that  MP's who vote against the amendments would from now on be  totally ignored by the press.    Before the plenary sitting Mr. Petur Balabanov, MP of the  BSP, told reporters that the parliamentary BSP (holding 99 of  the 240 seats) had decided to back the Borisov-Atanasov bill.  The New Union for Democracy (16 seats) had similar intentions,  voiced by its co-chairman Stefan Bozhilov two weeks ago. As to  the parliamentary SDS (87 seats), its attitude was officially  declared at a plenary sitting by Mr. Ivan Kostov. It backed the  proposal of the Budget and Finance Committee but it was not  moved in the form of a bill and could not be put to the vote.  The Budget Committee suggested that newspapers do not register  for VAT purposes until the end of this year and be further  charged 10 percent turnover tax. The parliamentary DPS [Rights  and Freedoms Movement] was not unanimous, said Mr. Hasan Ali  before the plenary sitting. They finally decided that everyone  should follow the dictates of his own conscience. The  independents also failed to take a clear stand. Its members  would vote differently, said Mr. Ruslan Semerdzhiev.    The two bills were not put to the vote at the end of last  week for lack of quorum. [passage omitted]    If passed by Parliament, the exemption of newspapers,  magazines and Bulgarian literature from VAT would cost the  national budget no more than 50-70 million leva a year, said the  chairman of the Parliamentary Economic Committee, Mr. Asen  Michkovski. Although parliament's regulations provide for both  open and secret ballot, the choice of the latter for a bill, and  at first reading at that, sets a precedent in our parliamentary  practice, he pointed out.    After that parliament went on to pass parts of the Judiciary  Organization Act at second reading and debated amendments to the  Incomes Tax Act at second reading.</p>

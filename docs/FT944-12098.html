			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Australia/NZ aviation talks Mr Laurie Brereton, Australia's transport minister, yesterday said he would meet his New Zealand counterpart, Mr Maurice Williamson, next week to discuss an aviation dispute between the two countries. Mr Brereton also stressed that a memorandum of understanding, which would have allowed Air New Zealand to fly domestic Australian routes from November 1, had not been cancelled. A row erupted last week when the Australian government announced unilaterally that it was 'freezing' the memorandum for an unspecified period on the grounds that some of the conditions had not been fully complied with. This prompted speculation that the Australian government was trying to protect the flotation of its 75 per cent interest in Qantas, due next year.</p>

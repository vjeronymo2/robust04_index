			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 11 (AFP)--Fierce artillery duels  erupted near the southern stronghold of Aden on Saturday  breaking the latest ceasefire in Yemen's five-week-old civil war.    Explosions could be heard from the centre of Aden marking an  end to a lull in fighting after the ceasefire called by the  north came into force at midnight (2100 GMT) Friday.    A southern spokesman also accused the north of launching an  air raid Saturday on the Aden oil refinery but said the  warplanes missed their target.    The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden,  was hit earlier in the week in northern air raids, and six oil  storage tanks were set ablaze.    Earlier, northern army units loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih halted their bombardment of Aden and nearby  villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said.    Jumhuriyah hospital in Aden, where the fighting has cut off  drinking water supplies to the 500,000 residents, reported no  new casualties since the ceasefire.    The government in Sanaa proposed a joint military commission  to supervise the ceasefire but southern leaders insisted on  international observers.    "The joint military commission formed at the time of unity  no  longer exists," said the southern leadership, which declared a  breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21.</p>

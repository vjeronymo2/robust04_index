			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Package trading ceases THE EXPIRY of trading in the Electricity Package, the grouping of shares in the electricity distribution companies which were floated on the market in 1990, was accompanied by a substantial bear squeeze in all the constituent stocks. Institutions which had not sold their packages by the close yesterday, will receive the constituent shares on September 28. The run-up to the cessation of trading in the package has seen share prices in the smaller, more illiquid electricity distribution companies, come under substantial pressure as dealers anticipate that big institutions will sell their unravelled holdings in the smaller groups. The final quotation for the package was Pounds 3,228, a rise of 120 on the day; the opening price for the package on December 11, 1990, in its partly-paid form, was Pounds 1,575. Specialists said that the 'recs' had been sold short ahead of the final 70p call on the shares, due on September 15, but the prospect of much higher dividend growth in the recs compared with the water sector was said to have helped the recs rise sharply yesterday. The best individual performances came from the smaller stocks, notably South Wales, which jumped 19 to 372p, Seeboard, the same amount up at 321p, and Northern, 18 higher at 333p. Water stocks hit by the switching operations included Severn Trent, 6 lower at 409p and Southern, 7 down at 391p. Mirror deal Shares in Mirror Group (MGN) were very heavily traded as a block of 6.5m was bought at 62 and sold at 62.5 in a cash deal. The stake represented almost 1.5 per cent of the company's shares. Dealers speculated that the Irish food and media tycoon Mr Tony O'Reilly, who has built up a significant stake in MGN through his media group Independent Newspapers, might have in creased his holding. Last month, Mr O'Reilly, raised his stake in MGN to 2 per cent from 1.3 per cent and was reported to be holding talks with bankers who bought shares in MGN in the wake of the collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's media empire after his death at sea. Yesterday, MGN eased 2 to 61p with recorded turnover of 14m shares. Carlton active Television production and services group Carlton Communications surged after consideration of a weighty and enthusiastic piece of research and in response to the early recovery of the dollar. The shares jumped 22 in early trading and closed 9 up on the day at 589p on heavier than average turnover of 3.4m. Barclays de Zoete Wedd published a 36-page booklet on the group earlier in the week but said the effect was just beginning to be felt. BZW argues that Carlton's 'growth prospects are above average, its management and balance sheet strong. The shares' premium rating is fully justified and prospects for 1993/94 mean that we continue to recommend purchase.' However, another securities house pointed out that with 44.5 per cent of profits generated from the US yesterday morning's recovery in the dollar was bound to impact on Carlton shares. Abbey National shares, boosted in midweek by hopes that a possible end to free banking would produce a big influx of new customers to Abbey, turned down sharply to close 10 off at 267p. Legal &amp; General, where worries about the safety of the dividend abated after the much better than expected figures released by Sun Alliance, jumped a further 9 to 315p, leaving the shares 25 higher over the week. Thorn EMI, responding to a buy note issued by Kleinwort Benson, jumped 8 to 687p on heavy turnover of 1.7m shares. Mr Tim Hirst at Kleinwort said recent selling of Thorn, prompted by downgrades and worries about an OFT investigation into compact disc prices, had been overdone; 'on a p/e of 12.5 and cash flow multiple of 4.5 the shares represent good value. BP dipped 5 to 196p with the market unimpressed with suggestions that it is discussing a possible sale of its minority stake in the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia. 'BP has been trying to sell the stake since 1988,' said one analystwho said the asset would realise some Pounds 200m 'at best'. The weakness in Enterprise Oil, triggered by the sale of a 2.1 per cent stake continued yesterday with the shares down to 310p, a fall of 10; over the week Enterprise shares have retreated 38. Dealers said the sale of the near 10m-share stake, could be the catalyst for further institutional sales. Norwich Union is among the biggest holders of oil shares of the UK institutions, but has not been seen as a seller of Enterprise in which it holds. Lasmo suffered along with Enterprise, sliding 3 to 125p. Tightly-traded Rothmans 'B' jumped 15 to 532 with two buyers trying to pick up stock and vague old bid rumours circulating. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo remained firm throughout the day after announcing that its Zofran anti-nausea drug was recommended for post-operative nausea and vomiting by a US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Thursday. However the recommendation had been expected and the shares gained only 3 at 749p. Reckitt &amp; Colman recovered 2 to 535p following its post results weakness on Thursday. Nomura Research was buying the stock after issuing a recommendation which argues that the shares are near their all time price/earnings relative low against the market. Northern Foods bounced 10 to 227p, after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker said recent falls had been overdone. Rank Organisation was once again a nervous market with the appearance of a small line of stock sending the price falling 10 to 483p. Good two-way business continued in Ladbroke. Turnover reached 5.6m as the shares shed a penny to 150p. Laird Group bucked the market trend jumping 9 to 266p as the market appreciated a 43 per cent improvement in interim figures. British Aerospace fell 12 to 213p as turnover reached 1.1m on fears of a reduction in orders for the Airbus aircraft for which BAe builds the wings. Aero engine and turbines group Rolls-Royce remained in the doldrums after Thursday's poor results, the shares giving another 5 to 123p, in trade of 3.5m shares. Turnover in motor dealer Trimoco rose to 25m with its predator Hartwell, the Saudi Arabia - controlled motor group believed to have been the day's main purchaser. Trimoco closed slightly easier unchanged at 20p. Conglomerate Trafalgar House yesterday achieved the dubious honour of being the biggest faller in the market in percentage terms when the shares shed 4 1/2 to 43p as financial worries surrounding the company continued to take their toll. Williams Holdings, weakened by profit downgradings. gave up 10 to 237p with 1.8m traded. Publishing to oil services conglomerate Pearson jumped sharply at the market opening after the group announced encouraging half-year results but closed only 2 better at 314p.

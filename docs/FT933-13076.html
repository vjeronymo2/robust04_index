			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Matters of record regarding council leader's resignation Sir, You carried an article by John Authers on July 15 about Westminster City Council ('Troubles mount for Tory council'). May I put on record three points. In particular, Mr Authers said that the council's managing director, Mr Montacute, refused to publish certain letters. Mr Authers did not ask me if he could see them. Had he done so I would have made them available to him. My resignation statement makes clear that I resigned as leader of the council 'as a result of political disagreements over my approach to the council's management'. Other reasons which you have suggested were not relevant. With regard to the housing policy of designated sales, this is in full operation and is one of our most popular policies among our council tenants. At the last council meeting tenants of a further estate requested that they, too, should be allowed to have 'designated sales' status. I cannot anticipate what the district auditor may report on the subject. What I can tell you is that the council obtained the advice of leading counsel about it on three different occasions: in 1987, when the policy was first implemented; in 1989 when the Labour party first made the allegations that you described; and in 1993, in the light of new papers which have been requested by the district auditor. On every occasion the QC confirmed that the policy was legal. No action has been taken following the raid on my office by the managing director because no action was needed. Only 11 sheets of paper were involved; they were all perfectly legal. David Weeks, former leader of the council, City of Westminster, London SW1E 6QP</p>

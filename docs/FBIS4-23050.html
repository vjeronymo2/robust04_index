V. Bogdan, A. A. Grom, and A. F. Goncharenko, </F> NPO ``Khimtekstilmash,'' Chernigov; UDC677.021.12]    [Abstract] Tire cord is presently still being produced in  the classical method which includes filament making, stretching  and pre-twisting, twisting, and weaving. The stretching and  twisting operations are carried out on type KV-III-250 KA  twisting-stretching machines and on the single process KO-228  twisting machine. These obsolete, noisy, and difficult to  maintain machines operate at low speeds not exceeding 177 meters  per minute with 2.85 kg packets being produced. The NPO  ``Khimtekstilmash'' and the Chernigov PO ``Khimvolokno''  developed a new process to produce single wound tire cord. The  process includes four sequential operations: forming the  filament, stretching, twisting, and weaving it. The stretching  and twisting operations are carried out on new high-output  machines, winding-stretching machine NV-400-KT24M and twisting  machine KD-600-IK. The new process turns out high strength  single wound capron filament for production of grade 35KNTS-O  tire cord. Figures 2.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A clash of symbols WE ARE only two days into the election campaign proper and the British public is in danger of falling asleep to the clash of symbols. Exactly a week ago we had Mr Norman Lamont's Budget, which confirmed that the government could not risk a huge pre-electoral bribe for fear of how the markets might react. What was on offer was therefore almost wholly symbolic. It was pocket money now, as an earnest of intent to cut taxes by serious amounts in the future. Yesterday we had Mr John Smith's Budget. It was more or less all his own work, which cannot be said of Mr Norman Lamont's proposals. That is why when talking of the politics of the matter it feels apposite to refer to broad Tory fiscal strategy as that of the prime minister and First Lord of the Treasury, not the Chancellor. Mr Smith, like Mr Major, was constrained by the magnitude of the public sector borrowing requirement. You have to be a Liberal Democrat, with no hope of achieving office, to dare to tell the voters that you would actually increase a projected PSBR of Pounds 28bn by a further Pounds 2bn. This proposal, made by the Lib Dems yesterday, is not damaging to Mr Paddy Ashdown's party because nobody believes that there is the slightest chance of it being put into practice. Mr Smith enjoys no such luxury. He has a reputation to maintain as the most conservative potential chancellor to appear on our television screens since the then Mr Roy Jenkins bowed out in 1970 - or do I mean Sir Stafford Cripps in 1950? Perhaps Mr Jenkins. Either way, Mr Smith is a star. If he led his party Mr Major and the Conservatives would not stand a chance. When Mr Smith's face appears on the television screen you know that all is right with the world. He is sober, serious, sympathetic, straight and, to cap it all, Scottish. No mere English politician can compete. So when he presented his alternative Budget yesterday Sober John was careful to preserve his reputation. It all had to look right. It did. It had to appear to be no more profligate than the Tory offering. I suspect that to untutored eyes it may have done so. It was also supposed to add up. It did not. Something specific on inflation assumptions and privatisation receipts would have helped. Absent of such little details, achieving the appearance of probity must have been a strain. The net effect is that some of the electoral bribes being offered by the shadow chancellor are almost as symbolic as those put forward by Mr Lamont. Mr Smith's scratch outline must at least further neutralise the Tories' efforts In the examples provided by the party the top beneficiary is an engineer on Pounds 19,527 a year, married to a bank teller on Pounds 10,270 with three children 'and Grandma living in with a pension of Pounds 54 per week'. Thanks to significant increases in child benefit and pensions, the total household gain would be some Pounds 500 a year compared with Mr Lamont's Budget - but try telling that to Grandma in the hope of a larger increase in her contribution to housekeeping. I suspect that the engineer, who doubtless hopes to earn more than Pounds 21,000 next year, would be put off voting Labour by the abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions. The bank teller/mother of three is well-bribed, however. Unfortunately for Mr Smith, most of the other examples are down to the symbolic level, even if you use his trick of citing family rather than individual incomes. As to a solicitor on Pounds 24,000 married to a teacher on Pounds 16,071 with two children, Mr Lamont's Budget is shown in Labour's examples to be the better financial bet. There would have been more for Labour to spend lower down the income scale if its original threat to extend the 9 per cent National Insurance impost to 'unearned' income had been maintained, but Mr Smith learned in time that this would be a vote-loser, not least among the party's many potential supporters who are nursing large redundancy payments. The shadow chancellor's spending plans may do more political good for the party than his juggling with taxes. Labour is now able to assert that it has properly costed a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme, a 'minimum' further increase of Pounds 1bn on the National Health Service, and Pounds 600m for education. That should in theory wrap up the nurses, the teachers, and the building workers. It is also offering something to encourage capital investment which may raise the hopes of some of the unemployed. Add to these categories mothers gaining child benefit, pensioners gaining Pounds 5 a week if single and Pounds 8 if a couple, irrespective of their current incomes, and other state beneficiaries, and the Labour spending programme can be said to be well-market-researched by the Institute of Bribery, Inducements, Handouts, Backhanders, Vote Purchasing, Wallet Voting and Symbolic Democracy. As to its effect, we shall see in next week-end's polls. Labour's backroom officials were in a state of some excitement in advance of Mr Smith's presentation of his Budget yesterday. This, they argued, would break the tie between the two leading parties. It would put Labour ahead of the Tories in the opinion polls, and keep it there. They must be at least half right: if Mr Lamont's Budget neutralised itself last week, Mr Smith's scratch outline must at least further neutralise the Tories' efforts this week. There remains, however, the other half. That is the long list of Labour spending promises which must, by definition, now go unmet. Either these are to be made good later, breaking yesterday's shadow Budget, or they are like so much else in this election: merely symbolic.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Consumers exercise a tight rein paying back more than they borrowed on credit agreements excluding mortgages. Demand for consumer credit shrank in the three months to April, according to Central Statistical Office figures. This suggests that the repayment of expensive debts accrued during the 1980s is a priority. A Gallup survey, however, suggests that consumer confidence picked up last month. The survey of more than 2,100 people found that the balance of those who thought the time was right for making big purchases was the highest for a year. In May, the balance - those who think the time is right minus those who think it is wrong - was 8 compared with 0 in April. According to the survey, confidence increased among all consumers, particularly those aged between 16 and 24. The seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO, which do not include mortgages and account for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt, show that consumers repaid a net Pounds 114m in the three months to April, compared with net repayments of Pounds 293m in the three months to January. In April, the latest monthly figure available, consumers repaid a net Pounds 56m on agreements with finance houses, building societies and bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system. That compares with a net repayment of Pounds 71m in March and was the eighth month out of the past nine in which net consumer credit has fallen. The median forecast among City analysts was for outstanding credit to grow by Pounds 75m. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief UK economist at James Capel, the stockbrokers, said: 'Figures suggest that credit is very, very sluggish and provide no evidence that people geared up after the April election.' Although the overall net credit figure fell by Pounds 56m, it included an Pounds 83m rise in borrowing on credit cards in April. That probably reflected the 0.8 per cent rise in retail sales in April after the Conservative general election victory. In the three months to April, outstanding credit-card debt increased by Pounds 239m, a sharp increase on the three months to January, when it grew by only Pounds 34m. New consumer credit advanced was also more buoyant. It was Pounds 4.1bn in April, the highest monthly figure since December. In March, new credit advanced was Pounds 3.9bn. Measured on a three-monthly basis, new consumer credit advanced grew by 3 per cent in the three months to April, compared with the previous quarter.</p>

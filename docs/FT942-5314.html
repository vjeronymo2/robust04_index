			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Health reforms hurt drug sales Healthcare reforms in France and Italy depressed pharmaceuticals sales in the first quarter of 1994, according to figures published at the weekend. France introduced guidelines at the start of the year to reduce the country's notorious over-prescribing habits; doctors were asked to prescribe only drugs appropriate to a given medical condition. Sales in France in the first quarter of 1994 were worth Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.9bn), compared with Dollars 3.2bn in the first quarter of 1993. The decline was 4 per cent, taking into account currency fluctuations, IMS International, the London-based market research company, reported. Italian reforms significantly affected sales, which fell 11 per cent in constant currency terms to Dollars 1.8bn. Italy has introduced limited lists of drugs for which the state medical system would pay in the treatment of patients. By contrast, sales in Germany, Europe's biggest individual market, recovered 6 per cent against a year earlier to Dollars 3.1bn. However, the comparative improvement was partly due to the low level of last year's figures for the first quarter, when new healthcare reforms penalised doctors for over-prescribing. Sales in the UK, where reforms have been relatively modest, grew by 8 per cent, faster than any other large country. Nevertheless, UK doctors remained relatively low prescribers, and sales of Dollars 1.3bn were less per head of population than Spain. The US, where sweeping healthcare legislation is still being discussed, saw drugs sales rise 6 per cent to Dollars 12.2bn. Sales in Canada, which has a thriving generics (cheaper unbranded drugs) industry, rose 1 per cent to Dollars 822m. Sales in Japan, where the government has pushed through drug price cuts, fell 6 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn. By therapeutic area, cardiovascular drugs, including many treatments for heart conditions, remain the biggest single area, with sales 5 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. But the next biggest category, digestive tract drugs including the world's biggest seller, Glaxo's Zantac, was one of the fastest growing sectors. Sales increased 7 per cent.</p>

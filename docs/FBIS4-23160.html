			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] has lifted all remaining  economic restrictions on South Africa. In a statement released  in Johannesburg, the EU followed the decision by the UN Security  Council to lift its own sanctions earlier this month. It was  also motivated by the desire to assist the new South African  Government.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORMAN'S DOUBLE-EAGLE LIFTS HIM TO 2-STROKE LEAD IN AUSTRALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> GOLF: HIS 'PERFECT SHOT' FROM 279 YARDS AWAY HELPS HIM RECORD A 4-UNDER 68 FOR  THE DAY. THREE PLAYERS ARE TIED FOR SECOND.  </P> <P> Greg Norman got the first double-eagle of his career today, holing out from 279  yards with a three-wood, en route to a 4-under-par 68 that gave him a  two-stroke lead after two rounds of the Australian Open.  </P> <P> Norman, whose 3-under par effort came on the fifth hole, also chipped in from  25 yards for an eagle on No. 15. He had a 36-hole total of 138.  </P> <P> Jeff Maggert of the United States and Australians Brett Ogle and Peter Lonard  were tied for second.  </P> <P> Maggert and Ogle had 69s today on the 7,080-yard The Australian Club course.  Lonard had a 70.  </P> <P> "I feel good," Norman said. "I had a good night's rest and my concentration  wasn't clicking on and off. I've got no reason to be uptight about anything. I  guess holing a 279-yard shot with a three-wood would make anyone feel pretty  good.  </P> <P> "Any time you do something for the first time, it feels wonderful. I saw it go  in -- it was a perfect shot. The ball never left the line of the flag and  rolled in like a putt."  </P> <P> Norman also had a birdie and two bogeys.  </P> <P> Vijay Singh of Fiji, who shared the first-round lead with Chris Gray of  Australia, shot a 72 to fall three shots behind Norman. Gray slumped to 147  after a round of 78.  </P> <P> British Open and Masters champion Nick Faldo had a 70 and was six shots off the  pace.  </P> <P> "If I play well on the weekend, don't make any mistakes and make a few more  birdies, I'll be up there," Faldo said.  </P> <P> Maggert birdied four of the first eight holes but went on to bogey three holes  while adding two more birdies.  </P> <P> Ogle, who won the Australian PGA championship last week, putted superbly for  five birdies and two bogeys.  </P> <P> "I'm swinging well and I'm comfortable out there," Ogle said.  </P></p>

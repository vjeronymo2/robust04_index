			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> Another day, another congressional outcry. On Oct. 4, the day after the failed  military revolt against Noriega, senators and representative like Sen. David  Boren (D-Okla.) and Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), respectfully blasted the Bush  Administration for doing too little to help the insurgents (Part I). Boren, a  usual opponent of covert action against Noriega, said Bush should have ordered  U.S. military intervention while the rebels held the headquarters of the  Panamanian Defense Forces. Likewise, Hyde thought the U.S. missed a perfect  opportunity to resolve the Noriega problem.  </P> <P> While these senators and representatives talk about blown chances, they fail to  see the most powerful weapon in front of them. This weapon is patience. By  being patient, the United States will eventually capture Noriega. Noriega can  escape bullets, rockets, and coups but he cannot escape time.  </P> <P> KEN HEMPY  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Afrikaner supporters drive through Mmabatho Armed supporters of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement drive through the Bophuthatswana capital of Mmabatho yesterday. The South African army later moved into the black 'homeland', chasing out rightwing whites and attempting to restore order after riots left dozens of people dead. The events were seen as a humiliating defeat for the right wing. Report, Page 22</p>

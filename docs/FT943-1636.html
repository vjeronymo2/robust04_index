			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Inflation 'toughest on the rich' under Tories Richer households have suffered a rate of inflation some 3 percentage points higher than the official inflation rate under the Conservative government, an economic study says. In contrast, the rate of inflation experienced by the poorest 10 per cent of the population was about 1 percentage point lower than the officially defined measures. The research, carried out by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, shows that between 1979 and 1992 the rate of inflation experienced by households has varied significantly from the official inflation data shown in the retail prices index. The report admits that the retail prices index is not an entirely accurate measurement of inflation because of the differing impact of housing costs. If capital gains and losses on housing are included, for example, the data suggests that elderly poor people who own their houses may have been disproportionately hit. Nevertheless the findings are likely to prove controversial, not least because they run contrary to the usual wisdom that poor households have suffered under Conservative rule. The main reason for the discrepancy, the report says, lies in the differing patterns of consumption of rich and poor households. Rich households, the report notes, spend a large proportion of their budgets on luxury items, with two-thirds of their income spent on items that have been subject to value added tax. Poor households, by contrast, spend more on basic necessities such as food, fuel and clothing, with only a third of their income spent on items subject to VAT. Because the cost of luxuries has risen faster than overall inflation, not least because of the rise in VAT on luxury items, this has meant that richer households have been disproportionately affected. Poorer households, by contrast, have benefited from the fact that the relative cost of food, clothing and fuel has fallen during this period. UK Household Cost-of-Living Indices: 1979-1992.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Paulo Sotero in Washington, D.C.] </F>   [Text] The talk took place at OAS headquarters during the  evening of 3 March, during a farewell cocktail party in honor of  Brazilian Ambassador to the OAS Bernardo Pericas. Encouraged by  the Mexican Government's decision to speed up its political  reforms, and by the possible success of the FHC2 [Fernando  Henrique Cardoso 2] program, a high-ranking White House adviser  for Latin American affairs shared the splendid scenario that he  had in mind with two Brazilians.    "We could have -- in a matter of months -- democracy in  Mexico and the stabilization of the Brazilian economy under  way," he said. He could have added that the two major stumbling  blocks for Washington's integration policy in the hemisphere  would thus be overcome. Brazil is perhaps likely to curb  inflation sooner than a Mexico under President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari becomes a democratic state. The government's opponents  in Brazil, at least, do not have hide their identities behind  masks when they negotiate with authorities, as is the case with  the Indians from Chiapas who rose in revolt.    In any case, one of the Brazilians who took part in this  conversation -- a senior Brazilian representative before the OAS  -- took up Clinton's aide on that point, in order to reiterate  the importance of U.S. support for the Brazilian economic  program. "Whoever opposes an agreement between Brazil and the  IMF will be responsible for a great harm inflicted not only upon  Brazil, but upon the international financial system as well," he  said.    This utterance hints at two things. First, one can hardly  expect that the gap between the economic team's estimates and  those of the IMF, as far as the budget is concerned, will be  bridged with a calculator. Once again, the IMF management and  the governments from the seven most powerful industrial  countries, which are in control of the majority of votes at the  IMF executive board, will have to make a political gamble and  approve a stand-by arrangement with Brazil.    IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus got his fingers  burned  the last two times he adopted a receptive stance on the  Brazilian program. He has already told Cardoso that unless he  is convinced of the soundness and political feasibility of the  FHC2 plan he will not put the IMF's credibility in jeopardy.    The second hint included in the Brazilian official's remark  to Clinton's aide is a warning: If the IMF and the U.S.  Government refuse to support Brazil's current economic policy,  they will make the country embark upon a path that is opposite  to that of stabilization, and will for all practical purposes  line up the voters in support of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's  presidential candidacy.    The decisive step in the negotiations with the IMF started  on  4 March. Based on the results of the technical evaluation by  the IMF mission to Brazil and on an analysis of Brazilian  political situation, Camdessus will have to decide whether he  endorses the Brazilian economic program. He must reach a  decision by next weekend so that Brazil can then work out an  agreement with creditor banks by 15 April.    Washington's skepticism toward the Brazilian economic  program  was broken last week by economist Albert Fishlow, a Brazilian  scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. A pessimist  in his analysis of Brazilian business cycles, Fishlow accurately  forecast the failure of several Brazilian attempts to curb  inflation since the Cruzado Plan in 1986.    On 4 March, however, he surprised an audience comprised of  the upper echelons of the U.S. Government, high-ranking members  of international organizations, and Latin American experts from  leading Washington "think tanks" when stating that "the new  stabilization program will probably be a complete success."  Addressing a seminar on the economic integration of the  Americas sponsored by the Inter-American Dialogue, Fishlow gave  three reasons for his optimistic forecast. The first was that  unlike previous programs, the current one is based on a strong  fiscal policy.    The high level of foreign exchange reserves that the country  has gives the government plenty of leeway. Finally, the  economist noted that the program is politically coherent, as it  may catapult Cardoso into the presidency. Clinton's aide -- who  was present at this seminar -- did not seem to be very much  convinced. "Fishlow's friendship with Cardoso may have impaired  the former's prowess at analysis," he said. And yet he arrived  at the OAS cocktail some hours later dreaming about the idea  that Brazil would stabilize its economy and that Mexico would  become a democratic country "in a matter of months."</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AF GROUNDS ALL B-1S AFTER WING CUTS FUEL LINE  </P> <P> The Air Force, in another setback for the troubled B-1 bomber, has grounded all  97 of the $300-million aircraft because of a malfunctioning wing spotted on one  plane, the Defense Department disclosed Tuesday.  </P> <P> Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the bombers were put on "precautionary  stand-down" Monday until the Air Force can find and correct a problem that  caused one of the wings of a bomber to sweep too far forward. The problem,  detected during a routine ground check, caused the wing to puncture a fuel  line.  </P> <P> The action brought an abrupt halt to the roughly 20 B-1 bomber training flights  conducted daily at bases in South Dakota, Kansas and Texas. The Air Force said  that the moratorium will continue until the service, working with engineers  from the plane's manufacturer, Rockwell International Corp., pinpoints the  cause of the problem and makes any needed repairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ready to Take Off  </P> <P> But the Pentagon also said that the force of bombers remains ready to take off  on short notice and would be capable of flying its wartime mission if ordered  to do so.  </P> <P> The B-1 intercontinental bomber, centerpiece of the Ronald Reagan  Administration's $260-billion effort to modernize the nation's strategic  nuclear arsenal, is the Air Force's principal manned penetrating bomber.  </P> <P> It is the third time since the planes were introduced to the force in  September, 1986, that technical problems have grounded them. Three of the jets  have crashed. Some industry sources say that it will cost as much as $11  billion to fix flaws that limit the bombers' ability to perform as originally  intended.  </P> <P> Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a frequent critic of the B-1 program, called the  latest development "very disturbing." He said that, 2 1/2 years after the  bomber's introduction into the arsenal, 'this kind of problem should not be  recurring."  </P> <P> The latest trouble was discovered during a preflight check of the plane at  Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Tex., where 25 of the planes are based. The  problem appeared to involve the plane's "variable geometry" wing, which can  swing forward or sweep back to increase the aircraft's ability to maneuver.  </P> <P> "The first or second time the wings were swept, it was noted that they were out  of sync," Pentagon spokesman Howard said. "The third time that they swept the  wings forward, a clunking noise was heard. They shut down the aircraft and  observed the fuel leak."  </P> <P> The Air Force suspects that the device that swings the wing into the forward  position punctured the fuselage in a spot where fuel is stored.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman for the Air Force's Strategic Air Command  in Omaha, said it is not yet known whether the problem may exist in other  planes.  </P> <P> "All of these questions have to be answered before we can go back to our  training flights," he said. "We consider this a precursor step to a grounding."  </P> <P> The B-1's fuel system has been implicated in a crash last November. The bomber  carries its fuel in available spaces throughout the wings and fuselage, and Air  Force experts said that leakages have been difficult to pinpoint and stem.  After the November crash, the Air Force bolstered inspections and maintenance  of fuel lines and began assessing possible changes in the design of the B-1's  fuel system.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Obituary of Sir Henry Phelps Brown: Rare master of economics 'It has long been claimed that an economist is not trained who is not numerate; but neither is he trained if he is not historiate.' This argument, made in Sir Henry Phelps Brown's presidential address to the Royal Economic Society, published in the Economic Journal in 1972, defined his creed as an economist. In his outstanding work on labour economics Phelps Brown combined economics with history, sociology and statistics. This eclecticism made him somewhat unfashionable. He returned the compliment in complaining of modern theoretical economics that 'its usefulness is not equal to its distinction'. Born in Calne, Wiltshire, on February 10 1906, Phelps Brown was educated at Taunton School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was secretary of the Oxford Union in 1928 and gained first class honours in modern history in 1927, and politics, philosophy and economics in 1929. He was a fellow of New College from 1930 to 1947. In 1936 he published The Framework of the Pricing System, which contained an orthodox exposition of marginal theory. After distinguished war service, Phelps Brown became the first professor of the economics of labour at the University of London, teaching at the London School of Economics until 1968. A Course in Applied Economics was first published in 1951 and issued in a second edition with Jack Wiseman in 1964. Economics of Labour appeared in 1962. Among the principal concerns and, indeed, tensions in Phelps Brown's work was the relative role of market pressures and historical forces in pay determination. In 1968 he published A Century of Pay, analysing pay and production in France, Germany, Sweden, the UK and US. Among its conclusions were that 'the number of jobs increased at the same rate, decade by decade . . . as the number of applicants' and that 'wages, in terms of the product, rose in the same proportion as productivity'. In similar vein, he published The Inequality of Pay in 1977, which argued that market forces were more important than 'custom, convention, status, or power'. LSE statistical studies were republished, in 1981, in Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkin's, A Perspective on Wages and Prices. This included an analysis of real wages in building, first published in 1955, which was based on a wage series and a widely used and justly celebrated consumer price index, going back seven centuries. The principal finding was one of remarkable stability in real wages, with no sustained change in 500 out of the 690 years. Similar stability was found in wage differentials between craftsmen and labourers, this being ascribed to the 'inertia of convention'. Alongside such predominantly statistical studies went analyses of the history of British labour relations. One such was The Growth of British Industrial Relations: a study from the standpoint of 1906-14, published in 1959. Another was The Origins of Trade Union Power, published in 1983. In the latter, he argued: 'Much of the history of trade unionism can be written out of (the) clash between the requirements that the economic system imposes impersonally on labour as a factor of production, and the welfare of workers as human beings, seeking a livelihood from the exercise of particular skills, and attached to particular neighbourhoods.' Sympathetic to incomes policy, he concluded that the threat to it 'arises when the trade unions have not too much power but too little'. He suggested unions should be made jointly responsible for decisions. Phelps Brown thought that attitudes 'are among the basic determinants of history'. His own determined his approach not just to his work, but to economics as a subject. Economists, he suggested in 'The radical reflections of an applied economist,' published in the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review in 1980, should not merely 'study economics as that subject now stands' but try 'to gain an understanding of the economic aspects of human affairs so as to be able to contribute to their healthier development'. An element in that contribution was work on public bodies. Phelps Brown served on the Council on Prices, Productivity and Income in 1959; on the National Economic Development Council in 1962; on the OECD Working Party on Wages and Labour Mobility from 1963 to 1964; and on the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth from 1974 to 1978. His interest in the commission led to a monumental last work, Egalitarianism and the Generation of Inequality, published in 1988. Phelps Brown was president of the Royal Economic Society from 1970 to 1972. In his presidential address he said: 'In an experimental science, assumptions chosen a priori can be tested against facts of observation; but in economics there is little opportunity for experiment.' Furthermore, 'though fortunately some possibilities do exist of testing assumptions about behaviour against statistical aggregates, running regressions against time series is only likely to deceive'. If assumptions cannot be tested, their plausibility can only be assessed from observation and analysis. For this reason, he said, 'we ought to value powers of observation more highly than powers of abstraction, and the insight of the historian more than the rigour of the mathematicians'. One reason this approach to economics has become rare is that, as he noted in his 1980 article for the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro: 'The more abstract the material, the more evident is the intellectual power of those who master it. For this among other reasons the economic theorist moves among his fellows with a certain majesty.' He also admitted that historical analysis may explain, but cannot yield predictions. Among the most important reasons, however, is that what Phelps Brown wanted economists to do is so difficult. He, however, was a master of the art.</p>

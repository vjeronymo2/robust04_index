			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Dusan  Kovacevic, defense minister of the Srpska republic, said today  he "hoped reason would prevail rather than NATO's war option  based on erroneous accusations and that the bombardment of Serb  positions in Bosnia would not take place on 21 February."    "We have already taken military and other measures to  protect  the population, vital installations, and the infrastructure so  that there will be the least possible damage if the threats do  materialize," Kovacevic told Radio Jagodina in Serbia and added:  "We do not wish the attacks to occur, but if they do we will use  every means at our disposal to defend ourselves."    "We do not have a choice. We are not attacking anyone; we  are defending ourselves, our homes, and our people," Kovacevic  specified and added: "We have no reason for concern; we will  effectively defend our positions and our territory with our own  resources."    Asked what had tipped the scales in favor of halting the  withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb artillery, Kovacevic replied:  "We were ready to withdraw the artillery as prescribed by the  ultimatum on condition that the Muslim infantry be placed under  supervision at the same time."    "Since UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] representatives  replied they were not in the position to do this, we  decided--and they (UNPROFOR) agreed--not to withdraw the  artillery from existing positions but to group it at certain  points and place it under UNPROFOR supervision, and this  solution was generally accepted."    "America can interpret this as it wishes, but we must make  sure we do not put ourselves in an inferior position to the  Muslims either through negotiations or wrong moves," Kovacevic  said and stressed that possible NATO aggression against the  Srpska republic would result in the escalation of the war that  will not be extinguished easily.    "The world knows this; it also knows that NATO's attacks on  our positions cannot be as effective as they would like,"  Kovacevic said.</p>

Referring to a  possible political realignment in the future, Kubo said: "I  think it is impossible to merge coalition parties into one based  on the theory of nation building, behind which there is an idea  of establishing a two-conservative-party system advocated by  Ichiro Ozawa, chief secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party]." In this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would not  agree to a plan proposed by Shinseito and Komeito that coalition  parties should merge and form "a new party" to contest the next  House of Representatives election as a single party.    Kubo stressed: "I share the same view with Hokkaido Governor  Yokomichi. We think that the coalition parties should cooperate  in tackling urgent issues and that those who aim to establish a  similar government should cooperate." In a question and answer  session after the lecture, Kubo clarified differences between  his idea and Ozawa's, saying: "My idea about the nation is  different from Ozawa's. I think we also have differing opinions  on Japan's international contributions and the Constitution."    With regard to the issue of reshuffling the cabinet, Kubo  said: "If the government is considering a cabinet reshuffle to  remove a certain minister, it will lose its centripetal force."</p>

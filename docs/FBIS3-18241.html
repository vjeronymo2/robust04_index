The deficit is 5 billion higher than in  1992 and 4.7 billion higher than expected.    What was already understood when the 1994 draft budget was  presented was confirmed by the 1993 calculations, which were  approved by the Federal Council on Wednesday [23 February]; the  federal financial situation has dramatically deteriorated within  a year. The bad economic situation affected both the revenue  and expenditure side; moreover, the excessive structural burden  on the budget has also been clearly demonstrated. The 1993  draft budget still had a deficit of 3,086 million. Meanwhile,  Parliament approved 2.9 billion francs in supplementary credits.  Actual additional expenditure only amounted to 862 million  francs. Moreover, there are credits of 2 billion francs  remaining. Thus, these are twice as high as in 1992. On the  revenue side, 3.9 billion francs less was earned than expected  in the budget. [passage omitted]</p>

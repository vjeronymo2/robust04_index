			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] This morning the Mt. Ozren chetniks, together with  their recently arrived reinforcements, intensified their attacks  on the free Maglaj territory. Fierce artillery fire directed at  the positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade on the northern  parts of the front, near Bijela Ploca, (Kojundzevaca), and  Haluge started just after 0700 and went on until midday. Tanks,  Bofors, and mortars from the infamous strongholds on Mt. Ozren  fired at the town center. Two people were lightly wounded.    The UN Protection Forces in Maglaj again came under attack  this morning, and the blue helmets were again -- for the second  day running -- forced to respond to the chetnik fire. This  time, however, NATO planes appeared very quickly. The Serbian  aggressor is continuing to concentrate his forces toward Maglaj,  so new attacks on this part of the free Bosnia-Herzegovina  territory appear imminent.</p>

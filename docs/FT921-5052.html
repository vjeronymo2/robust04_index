			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Moves to bridge divide between the east and west FOREIGN MINISTERS from all 10 independent states bordering the Baltic Sea agreed here yesterday to revive historic trading and cultural links between them and to create a community with its own specific identity, but closely linked with existing European organisations. In his opening statement, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said he expected that, 10 years from now, all the countries in the Baltic region would be either members of the European Community, or closely linked to it. 'It means that it will be possible to speak of a Baltic Community as a region within the European Community,' he said. 'Co-operation in the Baltic region should facilitate the linkage of the European Community with the non-member countries of the region.' The fundamental aim of the German-Danish initiative, which has brought together Germany, Russia, Poland, all the Scandinavian states and the three newly-independent Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, is to bridge the divide between western and eastern Europe and to tie the former communist states of the region firmly into the western democratic and free market system. The conference, which will end today, yesterday decided to establish a Council of the Baltic Sea States, which will serve as a regional forum for intensified co-operation and co-ordination of policies in the region, ranging from trade to the environment, energy, transport, communications, education, culture and humanitarian aid. A priority of the new council, which will meet at foreign minister level once a year, supplemented by more frequent meetings of officials, will be to give technological aid to the former communist states in the region and to help them set up democratic institutions. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said he saw the Baltic Sea region as one of the most important zones of growth in Europe in the coming decade. It contained a diverse industrial structure, access to raw materials and a highly educated workforce. Everything possible should be done to realise the growth potential of the region. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, stressed that the new Councils's main task was to facilitate the eastern countries' transformation into democratic and free market societies, with a view to their closer association with the EC and the European economic area.</p>

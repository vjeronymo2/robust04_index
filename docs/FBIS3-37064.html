Observers think it is a very large staff. In  addition, the president as a head of state and of the executive  branch has the entire Crimean Council of Ministers at his  disposal. As a matter of fact, on 8 February Yuriy Meshkov had  separate meetings with the power ministers and the rest of the  Republic of Crimea's government members. No information about  the results of the meetings, however, has been made public.  Participants in the meetings have said to your NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA correspondent that Meshkov told them that he had come  without his own team and asked them all to stay on in their  offices.    On 10 February, when Meshkov was absent, various people from  the presidential administration called Crimean Economy Minister  Tatyana Shandra four times during the day. They demanded that a  fact sheet on the state of affairs in the peninsula be drawn up  and her proposals for ways to lift the economy out of the crisis  be presented. Tatyana Shandra told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent that the documents had been prepared.</p>

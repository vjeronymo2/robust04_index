The videoconferencing facility was established to improve communications between the agency and interested parties. The facility will be used for a variety of purposes, including meetings, with the public and regulated industries, internal FDA meetings, and training. The facility will be used to supplement face-to-face meetings and allow broader participation in discussions with FDA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Angela M. Youngblood, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;50), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;0724.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA has established a videoconferencing facility for general use by FDA. The facility, which became operational on June 1, 1993, is located in rm. 13B&hyph;37 in the Parklawn Bldg., 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The facility has a capacity for 25 to 30 people and can be used to conduct videoconferences with FDA. The establishment of the facility culminates a 3-year project by FDA and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association to improve communications between the agency and interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency does not intend to restrict the use of the videoconferencing facility to any specific purpose. The facility can be used to expedite meetings with the public and regulated industries, or to facilitate training and internal FDA meetings. In addition to improving communications, FDA believes that the facility may even shorten FDA review times for applications because the facility can be used to facilitate prompt resolution of specific issues. Videoconferencing will also facilitate broader participation by industry staff in FDA meetings and make meetings more productive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Policies and Procedures for Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has established videoconferencing as an optional means of communicating with FDA. The decision on whether to conduct a face-to-face meeting or videoconference, or a combination of meetings and videoconferences, must be agreed to by both the agency and the interested party. Use of the videoconferencing facility is not intended to limit, in any way, either face-to-face, telephone, written, or any other type of interaction involving FDA personnel. In fact, videoconferences can be used to supplement face-to-face meetings and enable more persons outside the Rockville, MD area to participate in discussions with FDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All existing confidentiality rules that apply to face-to-face meetings also apply to videoconferences. The transmission signal between the videoconferencing sites is conducted through cables and is scrambled to provide security. Ordinarily, there will be no videotaping of videoconferences, but videotaping may be permitted if all parties agree to videotaping before the videoconference is held. FDA will not permit videoconferences to be broadcasted, however, because some information presented at such meetings may be confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All current FDA procedures for conducting meetings will apply to videoconferences. Because some participants may not always be in view of the camera, FDA recommends that each videoconference begin by introducing or identifying all participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA will schedule videoconferences in response to a specific request. The request should be made to the contact person listed above. FDA recommends that parties request a videoconference at least several weeks in advance, and there is no time limit on how far in advance a videoconference may be scheduled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scheduling will be done on a first-come, first-served basis. FDA will consider the geographical location of the parties when scheduling a videoconference; thus, for example, FDA will schedule morning meetings with parties in the Eastern United States, and schedule afternoon meetings with parties in the Western United States. The agency does not intend to establish prereserved blocks of time for parties in the Western United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a videoconference has been scheduled, the agency will not reschedule the videoconference except in emergencies. This policy is in consideration of the substantial amount of scheduling and preparation involved in setting up a videoconference. Additionally, videoconferencing should be reserved for meetings that are likely to run at least 30 minutes. If a videoconference extends beyond its scheduled time, the videoconference may be extended, provided the facility is still available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agenda and all materials planned to be presented during a videoconference should be sent to the Project Management Officer, Consumer Safety Officer, or appropriate official (in nonindustry-related meetings) at least 14 days before the scheduled videoconference. The materials will be used as reference or backup material and will help assure high quality communication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the videoconferencing facility's first year of operation, FDA will maintain a log on the use of the facility to determine the demand and variety of uses for the facility and to determine how much use is for internal FDA purposes or for FDA and nongovernmental entities. In addition, FDA will provide a questionnaire to participants to obtain their opinions on the value of the videoconferencing facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons interested in obtaining information concerning the policies and procedures, which are continuing to evolve at this time, for using FDA's videoconferencing facility, as well as a listing of public videoconferencing rooms, should notify the contact person listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael R.

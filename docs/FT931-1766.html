			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / NRG to quit general reinsurance NEDERLANDSE Reassurantie Groep, one the world's top 15 reinsurance groups, yesterday announced it intended to withdraw from general reinsurance, signalling further contraction in a market hard hit by recent losses. The move is an embarrassing one for the group, part of the Amsterdam-based Internationale Nederlande Groepe (ING), which radically increased its involvement in reinsurance in 1990 when it bought Victory Re for Pounds 120m from Legal &amp; General, the UK insurance company. Mr Willem Dikland, chief executive, said reinsurance 'doesn't offer us a sufficient return on capital. Catastrophes are getting bigger. You cannot get any retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) protection and original rates, especially in France and Germany, are totally inadequate.' In a separate development Prudential Corporation, the UK's insurance group, reported that its reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile &amp; General Re, had recorded underwriting losses in 1992 of Pounds 187m. Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential group chief executive, said the results were 'dire'. Pru has already radically scaled back its involvement in non-life reinsurance, following the appointment of a new management team last year. Like NRG it will concentrate its efforts on less volatile life reinsurance business. The developments are the latest in a succession of gloomy news for the London reinsurance market, where capacity is shrinking sharply following a string of catastrophe losses. Last month NWRe, a joint venture owned by Winterthur of Switzerland, Chiyoda of Japan and Norwich Union, pulled out of the general reinsurance business after sustaining heavy losses from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. A number of other smaller companies have either closed or reduced their involvement in recent weeks. NRG's latest move marks ING's complete withdrawal from the market for large risks such as ships, aircraft and natural disasters. Last year it effectively closed Orion Insurance, a medium sized player in the battered London insurance market. Lex, Page 22; Pru results, Page 24</p>

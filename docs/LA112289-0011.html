			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EXECUTION OF PRIESTS AND U.S. POLICY;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: CRISTIANI AND BUSH HAVE ALREADY SET UP A PRETENSE OF SEEKING  JUSTICE, AND ONCE AGAIN CONGRESS WILL BE COWED. OR WILL IT?  </P> <P> With the murder of six priests, the Jesuit-nurtured reason that sought to  illuminate the Salvadoran body politic has been extinguished, and El Salvador  is on the brink of another dark spiral of violence.  </P> <P> In Washington, the latest in a series of Salvadoran assassinations provoked the  usual promises of an investigation and threats by liberals in Congress to cut  off the $500 million a year in U.S. aid. But it seems only fair to the memory  of the slain Jesuits, who were among the few in their country with the wisdom  and resources to think about the future, that American policy-makers take this  sad juncture as a mandate to seriously examine their failure.  </P> <P> The six Jesuits targeted by assassins were not simple parish priests. They were  among the few voices of reason and reform not already dead or exiled. Ignacio  Ellacuria, rector of El Salvador's most prestigious university, was a force in  persuading the FMLN to enter into negotiations with the right-wing government  of Alfredo Cristiani. Ignacio Martin-Baro, the vice rector, was El Salvador's  leading pollster. The other four priests also were eminent figures who cannot  be replaced.  </P> <P> To understand the impact that their deaths will have, imagine that the leading  lights of Harvard have just been rounded up, tortured and murdered, their  bodies left in Harvard Yard. The attorney general warns other academics that  they should leave the country if they want to stay alive. He promises an  investigation but puts the police off-limits, although police-issue weapons  were used and witnesses claim that there were 20 to 30 policemen at the scene.  </P> <P> When the authorities kill a country's leading reformist thinkers, what kind of  message does that send about reform, or about thinking itself?  </P> <P> Following a time-tested script, in San Salvador and in Washington everyone is  calling for an investigation; the United States, which has spent $14 million in  the last five years on a so-called Judicial Reform Project, dispatched forensic  specialists. But it is the Salvadoran attorney general who will oversee the  government's investigation, and already he has blamed the FMLN guerrillas for  the killings and urged the country's liberal Catholic bishops to leave (whether  this is a warning or a threat is unclear). President Bush says that he has  urged Cristiani to "get to the bottom of this" -- but he has accepted  Cristiani's assurance that the government wasn't involved, thereby foreclosing  the most promising avenue of inquiry. It was left to the normally cautious  archbishop, Arturo Rivera y Damas, to voice what every honest Salvador-watcher  thinks: the "extremely strong presumption that the assassins . . . are elements  of the armed forces or those intimately tied to them."  </P> <P> Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of the Foreign Relations Committee, one of the leaders  of the half-hearted, just-before-adjournment effort to reduce aid, told David  Brinkley that "the status quo cannot prevail."  </P> <P> But in the coming months, it probably will. The investigation will go nowhere.  Congress will again threaten an aid cut-off. The White House will hint at what  it has known all along: that the Salvadoran military killed the Jesuits. The  Administration will pledge vigilance to ensure that justice is done. Congress  will be temporarily mollified. A breakthrough in the investigation will be  announced; arrests may be made. A few enlisted men may even be convicted. But  sooner or later, as the investigation fails to bag higher-ups and Congress'  complaints accelerate, the White House will resort to red-baiting. The  accusation of "losing El Salvador" has always been enough to discourage  Democratic dissent in Congress.  </P> <P> The problem is that U.S. policy, naively aimed at bolstering the middle in El  Salvador, is being manipulated by the extremes. Building up an army to beat the  guerrillas has only strengthened a military clique whose basic motivation is to  feather its nest and protect its own. The army has shown no willingness to  prosecute officers implicated in criminal activity. And the Administration  cannot threaten the integrity of the army by forcing it to purge itself,  because that would cripple U.S. efforts to eliminate the FMLN. Hard-line  elements of the army see right through U.S. promises on human rights to the  bottom line. The FMLN, meanwhile, strikes hard at this contradiction, knowing  that its own military offensive will harden the army against peace talks and  provoke further acts of barbaric violence against the citizenry.  </P> <P> The Administration has many reasons for wishing the FMLN not to come to power,  and many Salvadorans agree. But events like the murder of the priests should  remind us what the FMLN is fighting for. There have been elections in El  Salvador for several years now, but there is still no justice. As difficult as  it is to stomach the idea of a guerrilla victory, how much longer do we want to  pour millions into a military force that has no intention of reforming itself  or the social order it upholds?  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreign bank creditors of Efim agree compromise Foreign bank creditors of Efim, the former Italian state holding company, have this week been repaid a string of international loans - some 17 months after the company was put into voluntary liquidation in July 1992. However, the settlement of the dispute, which at one stage threatened Italy's standing as an international borrower, still leaves unresolved the position of loans taken out by former Efim subsidiaries which are not 100 per cent owned by the parent company. The deal between Mr Alberto Predieri, Efim's special administrator, and creditor banks covers six international loans in dollars, sterling and Ecu. Creditor banks will receive all the principal due, along with 70 per cent of the interest. The banks' willingness to forgo the remaining interest partly reflected satisfaction at finally being paid after a string of disappointments this year, as reimbursement appeared imminent and was then postponed. The compromise also indicates hopes on the part of the banks that the Italian authorities will now look more favourably on calls for full repayment of loans to Efim subsidiaries which were not wholly owned by the parent company. Such borrowers include Agusta (helicopters), Alumix (aluminium) and Breda (railway equipment). The banks' willingness to compromise on interest was also influenced by resolution of the bitter dispute over outstanding swap contracts taken out by Efim, and then terminated by bank counterparties after the company was deemed to be in default.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / 8,000 Lloyd's Names may face 25% rise in losses LOSSES faced by a number of reinsurance syndicates for 1989 could be at least 25 per cent worse than expected, according to estimates given to Names at the Lloyd's insurance market. The figures are contained in a letter written by the Bankside Members agency to Names whose affairs were formerly managed by the Lime Street underwriting agencies. The total losses of five syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency, now in liquidation, amount to more than Pounds 450m, leaving the 8,000 Names - the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital - with average losses of more than Pounds 54,000 each. Many Names are members of more than one of the Gooda Walker syndicates. Lloyd's as a whole faces its worst-ever results for 1989, and the market's 25,000-plus Names face losses of Pounds 1.35bn - less than 15 per cent of the market's capital. By contrast, one Gooda Walker syndicate is expected to suffer losses equivalent to up to 750 per cent of the capital initially committed by Names. A Name with an initial commitment of Pounds 10,000 to syndicate 387, which specialised in stop-loss insurance - offering reinsurance to Names - would stand to pay Pounds 75,000. Gooda Walker syndicates are among those specialising in spiral reinsurance, in which syndicates reinsure each others' exposure to catastrophe loss. Other spiral syndicates, including those managed by Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire, also face heavy losses. Bankside, which is managing Lime Street's affairs, says in a letter to Lime Street Names: 'We have felt obliged to take a very serious view of the possible losses which may arise from the (Gooda Walker) syndicates.' The agent stresses that the figures are estimates and could be revised before Lloyd's final results for 1989 are published in June. Meanwhile, the House of Lords yesterday ruled in favour of Lloyd's on a preliminary issue in the case brought against it by 33 Names who are members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency. The Names allege that negligence by Lloyd's in failing to close the agency was responsible for their insurance losses of more than Pounds 5m. Yesterday's ruling means that a preliminary issue of whether Lloyd's owes a duty of care to Names can be heard on technical grounds and that the court will not immediately consider the details of the Oakeley Vaughan case itself. Lloyd's said: 'We always said the case should be heard in this way.' No date has yet been set for the hearing. Also yesterday Lloyd's announced it was launching an investigation into cash calls made by syndicates managed by Devonshire Underwriting Agencies, in its seventh review of syndicate losses. The study will cover calls made on members by Devonshire's syndicates 216 and 833/4 in 1989 and 1990. The developments come after Mr Ian Hay Davison, deputy chairman and chief executive of Lloyd's from 1983 to 1986, wrote a letter to The Times arguing that Lloyd's might not survive to the end of the century unless it undertook a series of reforms.</p>

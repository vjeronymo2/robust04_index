			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Ford names president in reshuffle FORD MOTOR yesterday named Mr Alex Trotman president and chief operating officer of its worldwide vehicle operations in a top management reshuffle which left a question mark over the succession to Mr Harold Poling, the US group's chairman and chief executive, who will retire next year. The shake-up stems from yesterday's announcement that Mr Philip Benton, the group's 63-year-old president and chief operating officer, will retire on January 1. No date has been announced for the retirement of Mr Poling, 67, though he said yesterday it would be late in 1993. Mr Benton's title disappears under the shake-up while the top management team - the office of the chief executive - is expanded from four members to six. The reshuffle places 59-year-old Mr Trotman, previously head of North American car operations, in a much stronger position in the succession stakes. Many analysts now expect him to get the top job rather than Mr Allan Gilmour, 58. Mr Poling said yesterday the changes were part of a smooth succession plan and that an heir-apparent had already been selected, though he declined to name him. Mr Trotman rose on the operations side of the automotive business while Mr Gilmour's experience has been mainly financial. Mr Trotman is the only senior Ford executive to have run its vehicles operations in each of the company's main markets - North America, Europe and Asia. He also becomes a member of the board and office of the chief executive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov was told by the  Black Sea Fleet's press center that as a result of talks between  representatives of the fleet command and Ukraine's naval forces,  the arrested Russian officers and civilians were released  yesterday evening. They were seized by Ukrainian special  purpose troops at the fleet's reserve division near Odessa.  However, the division remains under the control of 60 Ukrainian  special purpose commandos who are preventing representatives of  the Black Sea Fleet command from approaching the division's most  important facilities.</p>

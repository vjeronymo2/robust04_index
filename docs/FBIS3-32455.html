			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] One day before the State Council has the last word  on the controversial presence of U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco,  President Cesar Gaviria admitted that a blunder occurred but  that he will not back down.    The president this afternoon said that the soldiers building  a school in Juanchaco will leave by the end of the month, when  they will have completed their work, unless the State Council  decides otherwise. Gaviria believes that his arguments are  sound, however, because for over 40 years the presence of  foreign military members for this or similar type of work have  been based on international treaties, which the Congress  approved in due course.    [Begin Gaviria recording] These are engineers who train by  assisting in the construction of river outposts. We have been  of the opinion that this work is useful. Our rivers have been  neglected in the past for lack of control and operational  capability. The Defense Ministry has always regarded the work  of these types of engineers as useful. [end recording]    Gaviria admits that the country has been misinformed about  this work and that the Defense Ministry failed to inform him.    [Begin Gaviria recording] In the future, this type of  decision should be made by the president of the Republic, not so  much from the legal standpoint, on which I think we are  relatively safe, but for the practical benefit derived thereof.  [end recording]    Gaviria denied the Juanchaco mission conceals a  counternarcotics operation.</p>

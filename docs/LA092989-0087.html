			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: GOVERNMENT BY FIVE SOLOISTS  </P> <P> One reason the Los Angeles County supervisors aren't accomplishing much these  days is that they can't stand each other.  </P> <P> You sense the unfriendly atmosphere even before you enter the supervisorial  meeting room on the third floor of the Hall of Administration.  </P> <P> It's not just the metal detector visitors must pass through. Nor is it the  glass barrier and locked door recently added to the waist-high wooden barrier  separating the public from the supervisors. These are perilous times and only  the irresponsible would criticize a public official for taking precautions.  </P> <P> The sour atmosphere emanates from the supervisors themselves. As soon as the  meeting starts, it's clear these five are not friends.  </P> <P> The supervisors, seated on a raised dais, seldom talk to each other. They give  speeches to the audience, which is usually small. Bureaucrats sit on the right  side of the room, lobbyists on the left. Both groups have heard the speeches  many times before. The vast center section is empty, unless people have come  for an organized protest.  </P> <P> Up on the dais, the atmosphere is tense. Although the public may imagine some  kind of ideological unity, the three conservative members of the board -- Mike  Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- have not formed any kind of a  permanent bloc.  </P> <P> Schabarum does not like Antonovich. When Antonovich is making one of his  speeches to the empty chamber on a pet cause -- health foods and the government  of Taiwan are among his favorites -- Schabarum visibly cringes. Once, during an  Antonovich speech, he eased over to a reporter and made a slighting remark  about Antonovich's intelligence. But Antonovich is so single-minded about his  notions that he is insensitive to Schabarum's anger. Antonovich's insensitivity  makes Schabarum even madder.  </P> <P> Few are fond of Schabarum. That is because he visibly and regularly sneers at  his colleagues and county department heads during the meetings. Schabarum and  Antonovich act as if they don't respect Dana, as if he were some sort of wimp  or a closet moderate because he occasionally tries to compromise with county  bureaucrats. Dana, whose first impulse is to get along with everybody, now  frequently disagrees with Antonovich and Schabarum on public health issues.  </P> <P> All three act contemptuous of the two liberals, Kenny Hahn and Ed Edelman,  rolling their eyes upward or making condescending remarks at their speeches.  Hahn, an old FDR man, hates the conservatives as much as Roosevelt hated Dewey.  The conservatives return the feeling, always refusing to elect him chairman, an  honor that is supposed to be rotated yearly.  </P> <P> Edelman is the liberal Dana, wanting to be a friend to the world. That has not  worked. For several years, Schabarum and Edelman maintained a thin bond of  civility by playing tennis, but Edelman said they rarely play now.  </P> <P> Hahn and Edelman have never talked much, even before Hahn was disabled by a  stroke. Hahn has a brilliant ability to get his name in the papers or on the  news. He listens to KNX or KFWB on his way to work, alert to a news event that  will provide an opportunity for a Hahn press release.  </P> <P> Edelman, who complains he is ignored by the press, is jealous of this Hahn  talent. Hahn, meanwhile, thinks Edelman is too cautious, too reluctant to join  him in fights for lost liberal causes.  </P> <P> What is the harm in all this? Actors and actresses have played great romantic  scenes while hating each other. You may dislike the person at the next desk or  in the adjoining office, but you all pull together for the old company.  </P> <P> It's no different in government, especially local government where reductions  in tax revenue, beginning with Proposition 13 in 1978, have forced elected  officials to be creative. To do that, people must work together, exchange ideas  and compromise.  </P> <P> That's especially true of the supervisors, who pass laws and control  departments. But these supervisors don't supervise because they are isolated  from each other and wrapped up in their own rhetoric.  </P> <P> AIDS policy is an illustration. The supervisors are ambivalent about the  disease. Fundamentalist Christian Hahn and political conservatives Schabarum  and Antonovich tend to cast the disease in moral terms and see AIDS as rough  justice. Dana is pragmatic. Edelman is the biggest supporter of AIDS victims.  </P> <P> Even though the supervisors disagree on the issue, normal legislative debate  might produce compromise solutions. But their AIDS deliberations have been  marked more by speeches than an exchange of ideas. Meanwhile, tax-supported  AIDS hospitalization costs are twice as high in Los Angeles County as in San  Francisco because of supervisorial failure to set up enough outpatient clinics  and hospices. San Francisco has had such facilities for years.  </P> <P> Someone ought to tell the supervisors they weren't engaged as soloists. They're  supposed to be playing in an ensemble.  </P></p>

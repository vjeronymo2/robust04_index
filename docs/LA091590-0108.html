			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEREK SPARKS GRANTED ELIGIBILITY, BUT HIS COUSIN LELAND IS DENIED  </P> <P> Running back Derek Sparks has been cleared to play football at Santa Ana Mater  Dei, the school announced Friday.  </P> <P> After reviewing Sparks' official transcripts, CIF Southern Section Commissioner  Stan Thomas said he was academically eligible.  </P> <P> Sparks, one of the Southland's top running backs, left Van Nuys Montclair Prep  last week and enrolled at Mater Dei Monday.  </P> <P> Thomas said transcripts from Montclair Prep indicate Sparks had a grade-point  average last spring semester lower than a 2.0 needed for eligibility. But he  will be able to play because Mater Dei can put him on academic probation and  give him one semester to improve his grades while he plays.  </P> <P> Under Southern Section rules, a student on academic probation has one grading  period to get off probation, and that period won't end until after the football  season.  </P> <P> Thomas said Leland Sparks, Derek's cousin who also transferred from Montclair  Prep to Mater Dei, won't be allowed to play football. His grade-point average  was below a 2.0 for the past two semesters, meaning he didn't qualify for  academic probation.  </P> <P> Leland successfully petitioned the Southern Section for a fifth-year of  eligibility this week. He will be eligible for spring sports if his grades  improve. CHRIS FOSTER  </P></p>

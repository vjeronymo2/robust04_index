			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Credit card users make net repayment in July British consumers repaid a significant proportion of their credit card debts in July, after borrowing heavily on their cards in June, official figures showed yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said there had been a seasonally adjusted net repayment of Pounds 35m on bank credit cards registered with the Visa and Mastercard system in July. This net repayment marked a significant reversal from June, when net borrowing on credit cards had unexpectedly surged to a record level of Pounds 267m. This repayment also contributed to a significant fall in net consumer borrowing in July, the CSO said. Net lending to consumers through finance house agreements, non-mortgage building society loans and bank credit cards operating under Mastercard and Visa - a collective measure known as the 'narrower coverage' - fell to Pounds 296m in July. This was sharply lower than in June, when net lending had reached the record level of Pounds 683m. The figure was also lower than the City had expected, and some analysts yesterday warned that the drop might indicate a slight fall in the level of consumer spending. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at brokers DKB, said: 'My feeling is that tax increases are affecting the economy and there is a slowdown in consumer spending. Today's figures are just the latest sign of this.' The net level of non-mortgage building society loans also fell to Pounds 7m last month, down from Pounds 24m in June. Meanwhile, net lending by finance houses - a category which includes car loans and in-store retail loans - fell to Pounds 324m, down from Pounds 392m in June, but higher than levels seen in April and May. Nevertheless, other analysts argued that the fall was distorted by a record level of consumer borrowing in the previous month, and insisted that the underlying trend remained relatively strong. Measured on a three monthly basis - a figure which is a better guide to the trend than the volatile monthly data - total consumer borrowing was Pounds 1.19bn in the three months to July. This was fractionally below the level of lending in the three months to April, when consumers borrowed Pounds 1.28bn, but well above the levels of lending seen at the same point last year. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'There is nothing in these figures to suggest that consumer spending is slowing. Consumers are borrowing as much now in nominal terms as they did in the 1980s boom.' Measured in terms of new consumer lending, the data showed that the level of new credit advanced in the month fell in all categories last month. New lending on credit cards was Pounds 2.81bn, down from Pounds 2.99bn in June, while new borrowing through finance houses was Pounds 1.86bn in July, down from Pounds 1.95bn in June. Measured in terms of the broad credit coverage - a measure which also includes loans on all credit cards, personal accounts, non-bank credit sources, insurance companies and retailers - the data showed that net lending rose to Pounds 1.36bn in the three months to June, compared with Pounds 872m in the three months to March.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RICE SHOWS HIS ANKLE IS OK; SO ARE HIS HANDS  </P> <P> Was Jerry Rice's gimpy exit from practice at the start of Super Bowl week a  ploy to sucker the Cincinnati Bengals?  </P> <P> If so, it worked. If not, Rice made one heck of a recovery.  </P> <P> He opened Sunday's Super Bowl with a reverse run, then made some spectacular  catches in the San Francisco 49ers' 20-16 victory Sunday over the Cincinnati  Bengals.  </P> <P> Rice, named most valuable player of the game, caught a 14-yard touchdown pass  from Joe Montana early in the fourth quarter and set up John Taylor's winning  touchdown with 34 seconds left by making 3 catches for 42 yards on the drive.  </P> <P> Rice, who had 5 touchdowns in the 49ers' two previous playoff games this year,  finished with a Super Bowl-record 11 catches for 215 yards. Dan Ross of the  Bengals held the record of 10 receptions set in the 1982 game.  </P> <P> "Today is a day I will never forget," Rice said as he held is 18-month-old  daughter, Jaqui, in the 49ers' locker room. "It was just stupendous."  </P> <P> Bengals' Coach Sam Wyche said Rice had "a world championship performance."  </P> <P> The week began with Rice's mysterious departure from practice on Monday. He  caught a pass from Montana but left the field, complaining of a twinge of pain  in his ankle. Rice was bothered by a sprained ankle suffered in October, and  didn't feel fully healthy until mid-December. The injury on Monday, however,  did nothing to slow him down.  </P> <P> Montana said he saw nothing wrong with Rice and said the wide receiver would  play Sunday even if he had to drag him out on the field.  </P> <P> Rice didn't have to be dragged. He said his ankle problem was a bit of  tendinitis that didn't give him any problem.  </P> <P> As if to prove the point, Coach Bill Walsh called for a reverse to Rice on the  first play, and Rice ran it for 5 yards.  </P> <P> Rice didn't run with the ball again, but he soared on pass plays. By the end of  the first half, he 3 three catches for 58 yards.  </P> <P> It was in the second half, though, that Rice really took off.  </P> <P> With the 49ers trailing, 13-6, Rice caught a 31-yard pass from the San  Francisco 15 to start an 85-yard touchdown march. Roger Craig caught a 40-yard  pass and, 1 play later, Rice caught a 14-yard pass near the sideline, and dove  over for the score.  </P> <P> Rice started the 49ers' next drive with a 44-yard pass play, catching the ball  with a magnificent leap over cornerback Lewis Billups.  </P> <P> On the winning drive, Rice contributed catches of 8, 17 and 27 yards before  John Taylor's 10-yard touchdown catch with 34 seconds left.  </P> <P> "I knew the receivers had to make some plays," Rice said. "Whenever Joe put the  ball up in the air, we just tried to go up and fight for it. Joe put the ball  in the right spot and made it easy for me. I really give Joe the MVP."  </P> <P> Rice said Cincinnati "talked all week, but I guess we were the better team  today."  </P> <P> Walsh credited Rice for taking advantage of the Bengals' man-to-man defense.  </P> <P> "They could not stay with him man to man," Walsh said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang Tuesday [25 January] said the government will  respond within two weeks to the US request for lower tariffs in  Taiwan.    The government will initially cut customs duties on certain  products in accordance with the customs tariffs law, under which  tariff reductions are subject to approval by the Legislative  Yuan, Chiang noted.    Chiang pledged that the Executive Branch will seek the  legislature's cooperation in bringing down customs duties in  order to ensure Taiwan's full membership in the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year.    Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based trade regulating body  calls for tariff concession negotiations with GATT contracting  parties. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September  1992.    Meanwhile, Taiwan's bilateral tariff concession talks with  the United States under the GATT framework are likely to be held  as scheduled in February.    Huang Yen-chao, Director general of the Board of Foreign  Trade, made the remark late Monday upon his return from tariff  consultations with US officials in Washington, D.C.    During last week's consultations, Huang said he told the  American side that Taiwan could lower import duties on 70  industrial products in accordance with the customs tariffs law.  But whether the tariffs could be slashed up to 50 percent was  unknown, he added.    The United States demanded in November that Taiwan cut  customs duties on 699 items by up to 50 percent. Of the 699  items, 514 are industrial goods and 185 are agricultural  products.    Though no concrete agreements were reached during the  consultations, Huang pointed out, the two sides have exchanged  views on tariff reductions. "I therefore would not rule out the  possibility of holding GATT tariff negotiations with the United  States next month," he said.    The US originally said it would not talk with Taiwan on  GATT-  related tariff issues until its own tariff-cut request was met.  The United States viewed its request for lower tariffs on the  699 items as separate from the GATT tariff talks.</p>

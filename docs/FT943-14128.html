			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Patience is required in eastern Europe - Alternative investments / Starting in stamps (4) / Although political volatility and related hazards may deter many buyers, the region has the potential to be an interesting collecting field, says Antony Thorncroft in the final article in this series The opening up of eastern Europe should inject some life into what has been one of the more subdued sectors of the global stamp market. It has not happened - yet. There are ingrained problems which could take years to overcome. The communist era created a mistrust in the postal history of these countries among serious collectors - those spending Pounds 1,000 or more a year on stamps. Many forgeries were produced, most of which were printed by the authorities themselves. Sets of stamps were cancelled-by-order for sale overseas, or specially created to celebrate some spurious event in order to attract foreign currency. There were re-prints and re-runs. In addition, the condition of stamps, stretching back to pre-communist days, was not always of the quality taken for granted in the west, which speeded up the deterioration of material and facilitated fakes. There are few specialists in the region, and an overal lack of knowledge. The political volatility there in the past five years has also acted as a deterrent. Serious stamp collectors demand certainty. They are reluctant to enter what could prove a philatelic minefield. Some new collectors have been attracted by the political changes, but, to date, they have been matched by traditional collectors who have seen the end of communism as a natural break at which to disperse their acquisitions. Supply and demand in this sector, always weak, seems to be in balance. So, despite the fact that Russia is regarded as a 'classic' collecting area, you can still accumulate a good holding of 19th century stamps from that country for around 60 per cent of the cost of a comparable gathering of German and French stamps. That said, eastern Europe has the potential to be an interesting collecting field. In pre-war days, Prague and Budapest, along with Vienna, were great stamp-collecting centres. Experts from the main auction houses - Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips - and leading dealers like David Feldman, of Zurich, and Stanley Gibbon have already visited the east to view the albums now re-surfacing after decades in storage. In the main, their visits have proved disappointing, with the albums viewed often littered with fakes. But a stamp-collecting tradition is there, and the philatelic world is well aware of the example of China (covered in January's issue of the Quarterly Review). Increasing prosperity in that country has made its postal history currently the most sought after in the world. If eastern Europe, too, can produce a flow of new millionaires, its stamps might well take off. For it is invariably nationals who create the market for a country's postal history. The poverty in the east has ensured that there have been few significant buyers of Russian stamps, for example, although some emigrees in the US and Germany have maintained an interest in eastern Europe. By chance, the finest and most comprehensive collection of stamps from one of the more interesting east European countries came up for sale at Christie's in Zurich on June 15. Gary Ryan had been collecting the postal history of Hungary for almost 50 years. Its dispersal (another auction is scheduled for next year) should bring in over Pounds 1m. The first part totalled Pounds 535,000, with a top price of Pounds 35,766 paid for the only 1867 50-Kreutzer pair used on a cover sent from Hungary to Count Jean Palffy in France. Another rarity, the 'Magnifient 'Tab' Bisect', the only cover from the town of Tab sold for Pounds 28,616. It is most unusual because of the combination of stamps used to meet the 5Kr postal rate between Tab and Pest, two 2Kr and a half of a 2Kr. For many years Hungary was part of the Austrian Empire, which extends its philatelic appeal to Austrian and German collectors. It also has an interesting early history, and the Ryan collection contains pre-stamp covers dating back to 1752. A good omen was the appearance of more than 20 collectors from Hungary at the auction. Like the other east European countries, interest in Hungarian postal history comes only from committed collectors: this field has totally escaped so far the investment element which played havoc with the stamp market in the late 1970s - a havoc which only now is being laid to rest. Of course, this does mean that there are bargains. You could amass a seriously good collection of east European stamps for Pounds 20,000-plus. For example, an early 20th century Russian stamp with an inverted centre might cost Pounds 1,500. A similar rarity of the period from western Europe might be 10 times that. New buyers can acquire stamps in bulk quite cheaply. At Sotheby's general stamp auction, on July 8, a complete collection of Bulgarian issues from between 1945-1963 sold for less than Pounds 400, and a large Bulgarian collection dating back to 1881 fetched Pounds 500-plus. And Bulgarian postal history, with its ramifications as part of the Ottoman Empire, is one of the more interesting. Anyone of a romantic disposition may warm to eastern European stamps. There are the nations that briefly issued their own postage in the distant past, like Moldavia, which are now issuing them again. Moldavia has, in fact, a classic following, especially for its 'Bull' issue of 1858, stamps that have topped Pounds 10,000. Turkestan, long part of the Russian Empire, and philatelically ignored, could provide interesting items of postal history. The break up of Yugoslavia offers a new collecting field, with links back to Turkish issues of a century ago. Russia could resume its place as a classic postal history, although it will take time for collectors to buy with total confidence. For example, the White Russians briefly isued their own postage in 1918, but around 85 per cent of the stamps that have appeared on the market since are reckoned to be forgeries. East Europe offers the chance of valuable discoveries for the brave, but it will take time for knowledge to grow on the back of prosperity for the full potential of a fascinating postage to become more widely appreciated.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Leading Article: How to target inflation JUDGED BY what the chancellor said over the weekend, lower UK interest rates are not to be expected in the near future. The justification for such caution at a time of the barest whispers of recovery was the need to keep underlying retail price inflation within the target range of 1-4 per cent established after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Is this either the right goal or the best indicator for policy? The case for making control over inflation the principal aim of monetary policy remains strong. This is not just because low inflation is desirable in itself. It is at least as much because of the costs of instability. Attempts to lower inflation may create irreversible economic damage. For this reason, monetary policy must try to keep inflation as stable as possible, rather than permit the wild swings characteristic of the British stop-go cycle. The problem is not with the ultimate aim, but rather with how its achievement is measured. Overdue reliance on the annual change in the RPI suffers from several drawbacks. First, it shines its spotlight on what may turn out to be irrelevant economic history, although the effects of current monetary policy on future inflation ought to be the main concern. Second, pursuit of a target for the RPI is likely to prove economically destabilising, following devaluation. Third, a target for the RPI does not provide wage bargainers with a reference point as clear as the exchange rate. Worrying expectations What should matter to monetary policy is not past inflation, but expectations for the future. As it happens, these expectations are worrying. The Treasury pointed out in last week's Monthly Monetary Report that the gap between returns on conventional and index-linked gilts is not only 5 percentage points at the long end, but is also 0.2 percentage points up on the previous month. Investors doubt the government's integrity, a fact that helps to justify the chancellor's caution. The RPI will also be affected by the devaluation, now 10 per cent since just before September 16. Many seem horrified that devaluation may be passed through into prices. They should not be. A devaluation was needed to increase the incentive to produce tradable goods and services. It does so by raising their relative prices. But the most important relative price is that for labour, which must fall if a devaluation is to work. Blip in inflation If the government responds to the needed blip in inflation following devaluation by tightening monetary policy further, it will destabilise the real economy. What monetary policy must avoid is a rise in earnings in response to the higher retail prices. Particularly in the aftermath of devaluation, the relevant indicators of inflation are pay and earnings, not the RPI. Pay and earnings should in fact be a permanent target. The government - or, better still, an independent Bank of England - should take a leaf out of the Bundesbank's book, by stressing the link between its monetary policy and trends in pay. In so doing, it would be targeting not merely one of many indicators of underlying inflation, but its principal determinant. It would also avoid policies that bring about largely cosmetic improvements in underlying inflation by squeezing profits. Above all, it would give pay-bargainers a clear reference point, something lost when sterling was devalued. As it happens, the evidence on pay and earnings, like that on inflationary expectations, underlines the case for caution. An appropriate target for the annual increase in earnings might be 2-5 per cent. While pay settlements may be easing below 4 per cent, earnings were last reported to be rising at an underlying annual rate of 5 1/2 per cent. Even though the rate has been declining in recent months, it is still not securely within the desired range. The chancellor is right to be cautious, though somewhat lower interest rates may soon be justified. But he is not so obviously right in how he is targeting inflation. The country needs a clear link between changes in monetary policy and in pay, the principal determinant of underlying inflation. The RPI is not a sensible indicator, particularly after a devaluation. The chancellor should carry on fighting, but first he must choose the right targets.</p>

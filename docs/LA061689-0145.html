			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 9 YEARS OFF AND ON PRODUCES A FIRST NOVEL  </P> <P> Newport Beach author Jack Williamson calls his novel "But Not Warriors."  </P> <P> It's about the lame, the hard of hearing and the vision-impaired. They have bad  backs, fallen arches and "debilitating orthopedic mis-alignments."  </P> <P> They are the men of the 575th Military Police Escort Guard Company -- 136  "unfit for combat" World War II draftees from the hills and "hollers" of West  Virginia and Kentucky.  </P> <P> But that doesn't matter to their commanding officer, a combat-hungry World War  I veteran who has never forgiven the Germans for surrendering on the very day  that he set foot in France.  </P> <P> Determined not to miss out on World War II, Capt. Cadwallader Aloysius Maxwell  decides to put his company of "limited service" troops through a  combat-training program. But instead of going overseas, they are assigned to  guard a Japanese-American relocation camp in the Arizona desert.  </P> <P> "It's fiction but based on my experiences in the barracks of World War II,"  said Williamson, 64, who at the age of 18 spent several months on guard duty  outside a Japanese relocation camp in Arizona. (Although a weak right eye gave  him "limited service" status, Williamson later served as a medic in the  Philippines. "I had to memorize an eye chart to get overseas," he says.)  </P> <P> "But Not Warriors" (Lynx Books) is Williamson's first novel.  </P> <P> A former newspaper reporter who worked nearly 10 years for the Oakland Tribune  and shot newsreels for a San Francisco TV station, Williamson spent the next 20  years making training, sales and public relations films for major corporations.  Since 1980, he has been a free-lance writer for trade magazines.  </P> <P> He started writing "But Not Warriors" nine years ago.  </P> <P> "I'd write some and then I'd put it down for a year and pick it up and say,  'That's not bad,' and write some more," said Williamson, who believes "a new  writer really should write from inspiration."  </P> <P> "For any new writer who is not writing professionally, it's foolish for him or  her to look at a blank piece of paper and say, 'I have to write for three hours  today,' or complete six pages. It's better to write when inspiration strikes  you. It will take longer, but at least when you get through, everything you  have written will be the result of inspiration."  </P> <P> "But of course," he added with a laugh, "if you sell one (book) and you're  going to go into that business, then you need discipline in order to turn out  the next one."  </P> <P> Williamson said that although "But Not Warriors" is humorous, it also has  tragic elements.  </P> <P> "The Japanese-American relocation camp was a terrible tragedy, and the book  treats it as such," he said. "Even though the goings-on outside the wire are  humorous, it treats the Japanese very sympathetically."  </P> <P> Williamson said the entire time he was writing his novel, "people were telling  me, 'You can't sell a first novel.' . . . I said that doesn't apply to me. I  thought it was a good book, a good story."  </P> <P> Indeed, Williamson said the book sold in 12 days and earned him a $25,000  advance -- more than double the typical advance for a first novel.  </P> <P> The author, who recently moved to Newport Beach from Riverside, is currently  working on three novels at the same time and, he said, he and his publisher are  discussing a multiple book contract.  </P> <P> National Writers: Author Jack Rowe will discuss writer's block and other  "writing hang-ups" at the meeting of the Southern California chapter of the  National Writers Club at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Irvine Marriott, 18000 Von  Karman Ave. Cost: $10 members; $12 non-members. Rowe's novels include  "Inyo-Sierra Passage," "Brandywine" and "Dominion."

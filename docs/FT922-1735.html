			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Miras on two homes MY HUSBAND and I live in rented housing. I hope to obtain a job several hundred miles away where we intend to buy a house. My husband needs to retain a base in this area for his work, and he intends to buy a small flat near here. Presuming I could get a large enough mortgage on my salary to buy the house in my name alone, could I then claim the Pounds 30,000 Miras tax relief? Could my husband then do the same for his flat? It should be possible for each of you to obtain MIRAS relief so long as there are two separate properties, each occupied by the individual mortgagor in such a way that the property so occupied is his or her main residence. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- A new strong impulse has to  be given to attempts at political settlement in the Dniester  region, Vladilen Vasev, plenipotentiary representative of the  Russian president told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview.    He returned the other day from a two-week-long tour of the  republic of Moldova and Dniester region.    Vasev met with Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, Parliament  Speaker Petru Luchinski, Dniester leader Igor Smirnov and other  officials.    Russia is concerned about the lack of progress at the direct  talks between Moldova and Dniester, which have been going on for  about 18 months, he said.    On the other hand, Moscow praises Moldova and the Dniester  region for their readiness to come to a compromise at settling  the crisis and the fact that they have called on Russia to  mediate at the talks.    Vasev told the Moldovan president and the Dniester leader  about Russia's concept of a special status for the Dniester  region, which could form a basis for holding talks and working  out mutually acceptable decisions.    That was the major aim of my tour. The Russian party aims at  helping to set the dialogue going, since the past talks, in  which "amorphous parliamentary-and-governmental expert groups  participated, were ineffective," he emphasized.    The Moldovan and Dniester presidents now seem likely to  confer wide powers to their respective delegations at the  forthcoming talks, with Russia acting as an intermediary.    "Both parties pay due attention to the issue and look for a  format for a new stage in negotiations," the high-ranking  Russian diplomat said.    "The Republic of Moldova and the Dniester region would like  to give a strong impetus to the new stage in the talks," he said.    Vasev surmised that the two parties will agree upon the  conditions for providing the impetus at an early date.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] We start the news with a communique from the  territorial administration and security minister. [read by  announcer]    A comparative analysis of the number of voters registered  during the 27 September 1992 constitutional referendum and the  upcoming 6 and 20 February legislative elections totally refutes  allegations that the majority of voters who participated in the  constitutional referendum have left the country and have become  refugees in neighboring countries. The number of voters has  increased considerably in all prefectures due to the  registration of young voters who reached the voting age after  the constitutional referendum.    Charity organizations, such as the World Food Program, claim  that more than 400,000 nationals who are exiled in neighboring  countries will not participate in the upcoming elections. The  territorial administration and security minister protests such  allegations, which are not true at all. Togolese citizens who  meet the conditions set out in the Electoral Code have  registered in all the prefectures, particularly in the Maritime  Region. The administrative committees on which all legally  constituted political parties are represented have prepared the  electoral lists, and no political party has complained about the  number of voters registered in the 81 electoral wards.    The majority of Togolese wish to have a peaceful and  tolerant  democracy. They elected the president of the Republic and they  will elect their representatives to the National Assembly in a  peaceful and orderly manner. [passage omitted]</p>

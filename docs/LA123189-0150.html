			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING THE WILD IN WILD-CARD GAMES;  </P> <P> AFC PLAYOFFS: JERRY GLANVILLE AND CHUCK NOLL PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES IN THE  BACKGROUND AS SURPRISING STEELERS RETURN TO POSTSEASON AGAINST OILERS.  </P> <P> In the other wild-card game today, the Houston Oilers can end the season for  the upstart Pittsburgh Steelers, the surprise team of the American Conference.  </P> <P> And with the more experienced quarterback, Warren Moon, the Oilers, who have  been in the playoffs in three successive winters, are widely expected to do  that.  </P> <P> Having already beaten Pittsburgh twice this year, 27-0 and 23-16, they are  favored to ruin quarterback Bubby Brister's postseason debut.  </P> <P> "(Brister) has take-charge potential," Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll said  Saturday. "But this is only his second season as a starter."  </P> <P> The club's other hot prospect, running back Tim Worley, who was drafted first  last April, is younger yet. The Georgia flyer, 23, came on fast after a slow  start in September to run the Steelers into the playoffs.  </P> <P> "(Worley) hasn't touched his potential," Noll said. "He can be a dominating  runner."  </P> <P> So that's why the Steelers are suddenly here -- 10 years after their last Super  Bowl, and five years after their last playoff season.  </P> <P> In Brister, 26, they think they have their best quarterback since Terry  Bradshaw. A scrappy product of Northeast Louisiana, the Steelers' third draft  pick in 1986, Brister has everything it takes to be a pro quarterback but the  upper-body build. He is 6-feet-3 and 210 pounds, but tends to get hurt.  </P> <P> In Worley, the Steelers say flatly, they finally have the running back they've  wanted since Franco Harris retired. At 6-2 and 216, Worley ran the dashes for  his school teams.  </P> <P> By comparison, the Oilers will field a set of running backs today -- starting  with Allen Pinkett and Alonzo Highsmith -- plus one of the NFL's great  quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Moon finished the season as the AFC's second-ranked passer. He had 23  touchdowns to 14 interceptions.  </P> <P> Brister, who started 14 games, had nine touchdowns to 11 interceptions.  </P> <P> This will be Houston Coach Jerry Glanville's first playoff game against one of  his severest critics, Noll, but both men are resisting the urge to add any  combustible elements to the blaze.  </P> <P> "(Beating Glanville) isn't a motive we have trying to get our team ready," Noll  said.  </P> <P> Asked to comment, Glanville, who is 5-3 against Noll, said: "Nobody here is mad  at Chuck."  </P> <P> AFC Notes  </P> <P> Pittsburgh and Houston, both play in the AFC Central, which has put three teams  in the playoffs in each of the last two years. The Oilers beat Cleveland in  last winter's wild card game, 24-23. . . . It has been only a year since Chuck  Noll fired everyone on his defensive staff except the line coach, Mean Joe  Greene. Noll gives much of the credit for Pittsburgh's improvement to his new  defensive coordinator, NFL veteran Rod Rust. . . . Today's opponents, en route  to 9-7 finishes, went through seasons that were much the same -- but in  reverse. The Steelers lost their first two games by a composite 92-10, then won  five of their last six. "I like to think that that's a plus," Noll said. . . .  The Oilers, who lost their last two by a composite 85-27, got to the playoffs  by winning five of the preceding six, including 23-7 over the Raiders. . . . In  the Astrodome with Warren Moon, the Oilers are 6-2 this year and 18-4 in their  last 22.  </P> <P> In possibly the oddest news conference of the season, Noll seemed particularly  ungrateful when informed that Jerry Glanville, in one of his strangest moves  yet, had voted him coach of the year. Asked for his reaction, Noll said: "I  don't know why (Glanville) had a vote." A reporter then asked: "Were you  surprised that he voted for you?" Said Noll: "The thing that upsets me is that  I didn't have a vote."  </P> <P> Houston's best defensive end, Ray Childress, is doubtful. The Steelers have no  serious injuries. . . . Cornerback Dwayne Woodruff is Pittsburgh's only  survivor from the Super Bowl era. . . . The Oilers are one of only five NFL  teams with winning records in each of the last three seasons.  </P></p>

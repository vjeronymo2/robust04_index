			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Expansion fuels German M&amp;A THE DRIVE to expand into the former east Germany led to a boom last year in German mergers and acquisitions. The number of published transactions was up by over a half to 2,172 compared with 1,412 in 1990, according to figures produced by M&amp;A International, a consultancy based in Konigstein. Of the deals, 949 were done in the east, while in the west the number of deals fell by 5 per cent, from 1,296 to 1,223. Despite the surge in the number of deals, the total value of all domestic transactions fell to DM51bn from DM52bn, reflecting the low prices paid for companies in the east. Despite the activity in the east, west German companies made 246 acquisitions overseas last year, up from 186 in 1990. France was the most popular country for German investment - the number of companies bought there rose from 23 to 44 - followed by the UK and the US, where Germans bought 31 and 30 companies respectively. In the other direction, foreign companies made 490 - up from 469  - acquisitions in Germany, of which 149 were in the east. The biggest buyers were the Americans, who bought 88 companies, followed by the Swiss with 78, the French with 71 and the British 63. The number of Japanese purchases fell to 17 from 19 last year. The most active buyers in the former east Germany were the Americans, who made 25 acquisitions there, followed by the Swiss and the French who each made 22 purchases. M&amp;A remarks that 'only very few non-German speaking foreigners were investing directly in that market without using already existing west German subsidiaries'. The Treuhandanstalt, the government agency responsible for privatising east German industry, has recently stepped up its marketing efforts to encourage non-German companies to buy there.</p>

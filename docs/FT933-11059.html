			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Ending of car prefix system urged MOTOR INDUSTRY analysts believe up to 410,000 cars will be registered in August, the fourth-highest volume for a single month in the industry's history. But nearly two thirds of car dealers want to discontinue the yearly registration prefix - L this year - which causes the sales bulge, a survey by Automotive Management, a motor industry management publication, and Esso, the oil group, has found. The prefix system was criticised yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, who holds the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chair in motor-industry economics at Cardiff Business School, and is industry adviser to the Commons trade and industry committee. Prof Rhys warned that the system conflicted with the 'lean' manufacturing and distribution practices which the industry needed to remain competitive, since it required manufacturers and dealers to build up stocks in advance of August 1, the day the registration prefix changed. He said: 'The only party now benefiting from the system are Continental manufacturers, for whom the UK August bulge is a godsend when demand in their own markets has gone seasonally flat.' The police favour the prefix system, saying it helps witnesses remember cars used in crime. Nearly 700 dealers took part in the survey, which found that 62 per cent want to abandon the system and 24 per cent favour it. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, which represents most dealers, is critical of the system. The survey did not consider possible alternatives. The August 'bulge' - which reached a high point of 500,000 in 1989 - has sometimes threatened to overwhelm the trade. A government inquiry into the prefix system towards the end of the 1980s was abandoned when changes could not be agreed. The yearly identifier letter should be abandoned, Prof Rhys said, allowing the market to readjust to seasonal peaks. He added: 'If August goes as expected, it will mean that 23 per cent of the year's sales will have been made in one month. Even the Japanese could not run an inventory-less system with that kind of distortion.'</p>

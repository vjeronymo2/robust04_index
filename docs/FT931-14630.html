			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Many Names 'ready to quit' AS MANY as 20 per cent of Names plan to reduce their involvement in the Lloyd's insurance market and 10 per cent of Names are likely to resign in the next two years, a Mori survey has indicated. The polling organisation interviewed 601 Names - individuals whose capital backs the market - last autumn. The results also suggest that 20 per cent of Names plan to increase their commitments. Some 2,000 of the market's 22,300 Names left at the end of 1992 while only 75 new Names joined.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: Retention of status quo at BBC the only sensible option Sir, David Sawers argues (Personal View, January 6) that the proliferation of TV and radio channels will make it increasingly hard to justify a licence fee to pay for the BBC. Events since New Year suggest quite the opposite is the case. Though we were warned by the FT's unfailingly perceptive television critic in advance of the new ITV regime that more would mean worse, I wonder if any of us really appreciated how worse. The awfulness of GMTV, for example, seems to have surprised even those who listened to the clear warnings of its director of programmes, Lis Howell, not to expect anything 'innovative'. The decision to award franchises on the basis of money rather than quality means that - except for those companies which gambled successfully on having no credible opponents - the new franchise-holders must make big returns quickly. Hence cheap programmes will be preferred to expensive ones: no mission to explain when you can build a tower of toast for the price of a sliced loaf. And in the race to maximise audience share, the Hollywood cliche that no one ever went broke underestimating public taste still holds good. Since there is only so much advertising revenue to go round, the result of having even more channels will inevitably be that standards fall even further. Against this background, there is an overwhelming argument for retaining the BBC at roughly its present size and with its present range of output. This means it must have access to adequate, secure and predictable funds. None of these objectives could be secured by sponsorship, subscription or any of the other models proposed by David Sawers. There is of course an element of rough justice in charging everyone the same, but the sum involved is unbelievably small in relation to the extent and quality of the BBC's output; and the costs of varying the charge according to income or use of BBC services would surely not justify the possible benefits. As Chris Dunkley passionately and correctly argued when the government issued a discussion paper on BBC finances, ministers must constantly be reminded that the status quo is an option. I suggest it is the only sensible one. David Robertson, 18 Shandon Road, London SW4</p>

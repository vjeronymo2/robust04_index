It was  announced that the police are continuing with the investigation,  but so far no one has been detained.    President Demirel and some politicians condemned the bomb  attack. In his turn, DEP leader Hatip Dicle said they will  participate in the elections regardless of all the pressure on  the party.    [Begin recording] [Metin Corabatir] The bomb experts  conducted an investigation at the building where the explosion  took place. The teams, which could not enter the building last  night because of severed power lines, collected evidence in  connection with the explosion.    It is believed that the highly explosive bomb, which was  planted in the building's elevator and which killed one person  and injured 20, was identical in structure to the bomb that was  planted in the building last week and which also caused damage.    A number of German parliamentarians visited DEP headquarters  and expressed their sympathies.    Hatip Dicle, who organized a news conference at DEP  headquarters, held the government responsible for the attack.  Dicle also severely criticized Speaker of Parliament Husamettin  Cindoruk, who opposed the dispatch of observers to the local  elections by the European Parliament    [Dicle] Now, I am asking the esteemed Cindoruk: The day you  wrote a letter to the European Parliament, the counterguerrillas  again bombed our party's headquarters. Now, how can you claim  that under these conditions there could exist a just and free  election atmosphere?    Mr. Mentese made a very unfortunate statement yesterday. He  said the DEP bombed its own building. An interior minister  cannot lower himself to that level, or make such base  statements. [end recording]    Interior Minister Nahit Mentese reacted very strongly when  he  was told that Hatip Dicle used the word base. Mentese accused  Hatip Dicle of being a traitor to the country. Upon being  informed of Hatip Dicle's words used against him, Interior  Minister Mentese said: What else could be expected from a  traitor to the country? The entire nation has risen up against  Hatip. He makes fun of the nation, while young reserve officers  die. Can I ever accept such a man as my counterpart?</p>

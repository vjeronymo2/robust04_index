			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and </F> Aleksandr Kharchenko]    [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Mar TASS -- Major-General Anatoliy  Kuptsov, first deputy security minister of Tajikistan, called  "unfounded and not being in accord with reality" the latest  rumors about allegedly a complex social and political situation  in the former Kurgan-Tyube region and mass conflicts on clan and  inter-ethnic grounds, which led to numerous victims.    The situation in Kurgan-Tyube and the neighboring districts  remains calm and there are no trends for its deterioration, the  major-general told ITAR-TASS today stressing that certain forces  stop at nothing, including spreading various rumors, in an  attempt to destabilize the situation.    According to Anatoliy Kuptsov, several tragic incidents  really occurred in these inhabited localities in the second half  of February this year. For instance, unidentified persons  provoked shooting on the territory of the Sangak Safarov  collective farm in the Bokhtar district. As a result, one of  the officers of a military unit of the Tajikistan Defense  Ministry stationed in Kurgan-Tyube, and three civilians were  killed.    Unidentified bandits also killed a resident of the Bokhtar  district who worked in a local branch of the international  non-governmental organization "Physicians Beyond Borders".    Three people in a car driving from the frontier center of  Pyandzh to Dushanbe came under fire and were killed. Competent  bodies are carefully investigating each criminal case, the first  deputy minister noted.    But already now it is possible to say that all three  incidents are not of a clan or an inter-ethnic nature. They are  purely criminal cases.    It is no secret, the general said, that the general crime  situation in the Republic is very tense, including the former  Kurgan-Tyube region. There are several reasons for the outburst  of criminal actions, one of them being the consequences of the  recent civil war, violations of legal laws, as well as the  availability of large quantities of firearms, which the local  inhabitants still possess despite measures taken by the "power"  structures of the Republic.</p>

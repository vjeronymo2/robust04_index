			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Derwent Valley jumps to Pounds 2.54m Derwent Valley Holdings, the London-focused property investment company, reported a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 896,000 to Pounds 2.54m in 1993, helped by lower interest payments and rising rental income. The company, which announced a Pounds 16.9m placing last July, has seen net asset value per share rise 8.5 per cent to 544p (501p) since the issue, and anticipates further increases in 1994. Mr John Ivey, chairman, said: 'Prospects for 1994 are encouraging. Management will continue to maximise the potential of the portfolio and acquire further properties.' The company has purchased Pounds 23.8m of properties since July. Net revenue from properties amounted to Pounds 7m in 1993, compared with Pounds 6.4m in the previous year. Debt servicing costs fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.5m in 1993, due to falling interest rates, and the fact that purchases were timed towards the end of 1993. Net borrowings, however, climbed Pounds 6m to Pounds 34.7m as a result of acquisitions, representing gearing of 55 per cent. The company's portfolio has remained well let, with void space of 32,000 sq ft at the year end, of which 26,600 sq ft were accounted for by newly refurbished offices. About 85 per cent of Derwent's portfolio is located in the West End of London, and the company said there were already signs of an improvement in the rental market. It has a number of planning consents for developing its portfolio, to enhance its performance in a rising market. Earnings per share more than doubled to 20.8p (10.2p). The directors recommended a final dividend of 6.05p, making a total of 9.1p (8.6p) for the year.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Moscow seeks help to pay cost of industrial conversion: Millions of jobs now depend on turning swords into ploughshares CONVERSION of the former Soviet Union's huge defence industry to civilian output used to be just a slogan until the overthrow of the Soviet system last year. Now it is a means of survival for thousands of factories whose military orders have been slashed by a penniless government committed to market reforms. A chart in the office of Mr Nikolai Bazhanov, chairman of Russia's Conversion Committee, lists the various areas of civilian production he wants defence plants to switch to - ranging from meat processing to business computer systems. The problem is that the state cannot afford to turn swords to ploughshares on its own. That is why his 200-strong committee is also available to match foreign investors with enterprises seeking to convert. At stake is the salvation of Russia as an industrial power, and the livelihood of millions of people employed the sector. A vague law setting out the legal foundations for conversion - such as workers' right to unemployment benefits if they are laid off - passed its first reading in parliament last week. But as Mr Igor Artiukh, one Moscow defence factory manager put it: 'We don't need a piece of paper, we need money.' According to Mr Bazhanov, for every rouble or dollar cut from making missiles or guidance systems, another one and a half needs to be spent on converting such capacity to make refrigerators or television sets. While slashing defence procurement to just 13 per cent of last year's level, the 1992 budget allocates Rbs10bn, or 2 per cent of total spending, to conversion. According to Mr Bazhanov, this is not enough. 'The problem is the government wants a deficit-free budget,' he complains. Mr Artiukh, who also heads Moscow's association of industrialists, warns that 700,000 people out of the 900,000 employed by the defence industry in the capital alone could lose their jobs unless factories find alternative sources of financing to switch production. Prof Alexander Smirnov, from the Rotor group which specialises in missile navigation systems, says it can just about pay its 3,500 scientists a minimal salary of Rbs2,000 (Dollars 20) a month but needs work to keep them busy. This does not mean that managers like him are not already trying to help themselves. They argue with conviction that Russia's cheap but skilled labour force, abundant raw materials, and remarkable technological capabilities need only to be harnessed to outside capital to save an elite industrial and scientific base. Mr Smirnov is discussing with the UK Consumers' Association the possibility of using existing facilities to set up a testing laboratory for consumer products. While dreaming of more sophisticated projects, he would also like to find a foreign partner to develop cash-dispensing machines for the Russian market. Apart from offering advanced technologies using microwave energy, Mr Artiukh's enterprise, Toriy, is looking for a foreign partner to mass-produce microwave ovens. Mr Artiukh says that while South Korea produces 12.5m ovens a year, monthly wages there are Dollars 600; he pays his workers Rbs2,000-Rbs3,000 (Dollars 20-Dollars 30). The list of obstacles on the path to conversion is also familiar: a non-convertible currency, monopolistic domestic suppliers, unpredictable behaviour by the state, not to mention still unfavourable conditions for investors. Most can and must be rectified by the government, which is sorting out conditions for foreigners to take part in privatisation auctions, and other issues such as land ownership. Other problems will require far-sighted goodwill on the part of the international community. The US has announced it will spend Dollars 25m for a job centre for redundant Soviet scientists. But without investment in, and international co-operation, for real projects to occupy these scientists, such goodwill will not go very far.</p>

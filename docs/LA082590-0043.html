			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAZZ TAP IN WESTWOOD  </P> <P> The Jazz Tap Ensemble offers an utterly contemporary program on the club-like  stage at the Westwood Playhouse.  </P> <P> At Thursday's opening, three new works graced an evening of old favorites.  </P> <P> In "Tribute," the dancers re-create the style and steps of film stars,  capturing the mood and allowing rare close-up glimpses of the demanding  choreography. A startling novelty is the group's valentine to the Condos  Brothers: Mark Mendonca and Sam Weber, bare-chested and in feather headdresses,  offering an "Indian Dance."  </P> <P> Weber, known for balletic lightness, here demonstrates that he can also handle  the lower registers of tap-dancing. He and Mendonca pace the opening number, a  new and presumably improvised set of riffs to Dave Brubeck's "In Your Own Sweet  Way." The music, favorite jazz standards executed affectionately by Stacy  Rowles on trumpet and growly vocals, Jerry Kalaf on drums, Jeff Colella on  piano and David Enos on bass, provides familiar ground on which the dancers  build new tap edifices.  </P> <P> Tap master Eddie Brown, a guest of the ensemble who has been in this business  since the '30s, was his usual spry and charming self, but the inventive energy  of the evening was all in the work of Weber, Mendonca and artistic director  Lynn Dally, a good sign in a genre often top-heavy with nostalgia. "Rap Tune,"  created by Kalaf and Weber, is a remarkable rap-without-words that captures  exactly the infectious cadence of the burgeoning genre.  </P> <P> Dally looks better than ever; her posture has improved, and her obvious  pleasure in her work contagious. No bimbos and chorus boys here, only mature  artists -- even 21-year-old Mendonca, dark and brooding, who dances with  suppressed power. If he can talk, he's got a future in the movies.  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / The civvy street campaign: How military skills can be an asset for businesses Seven years ago Captain Carl Hunter and Sergeant Philip Price of the Royal Green Jackets worked together on incorporating the Warrior armoured vehicle into the battle plans of the British army. These days, in a picture-book village in Sussex, they are engaged in a different sort of collaboration, devising strategies for a business founded by Mr Hunter in 1990, now selling nearly Pounds 3m of high-technology gadgets each year, 80 per cent of them abroad. Their small companies - Lidbury, Wylam Hill, and Wylam Hill Security - are a striking, if far-from-typical, instance of what ex-servicemen can do when they hang up their uniforms. It is also the sort of thing the defence ministry holds up as an example when it counsels the 30,000 who leave the armed services every year, and tries to persuade business that military skills are applicable to the world of commerce. Until recently the number of leavers had been projected to fall to about 25,000 a year from 1995, but if - as is widely expected - this month's conclusion of the defence costs study calls for a further reduction of about 14,000 in the size of the armed forces - the current flow will be maintained. The armed forces are already a high-turnover business, and some paths from the forces to civvy street are well trodden - from military to civilian flying, or from prestigious guards regiments to prestigious jobs in the City. But as memories of national service fade civilian businessmen can be downright sceptical of the relevance of the armed forces - with their arcane jargon and exclusive ethos - to their own world. Hence the importance of a business such as Lidbury, which is based almost entirely on skills and relationships built up in the services. Many of its products - devices for fire control, marine safety and military or commercial security - were developed by Mr Hunter's father Eric, whose 20 years as a naval submariner gave him a fascination with sonar technology. Mr Price is technical sales director of the business. Mr Marcus McCaffrey, a fellow Green Jacket officer, is projects manager, responsible for developing new products, and Mr Richard Lyle, formerly of the Welsh Guards, is export director. One product - a device for picking up the sound of human movement at a distance - was thought up by Mr Price. Working in reconnaissance, he realised that most of his equipment was meant to enhance vision rather than hearing. Mr Hunter and his team, who work from a modest old building, have strong ideas about the relevance of the service ethos to civilian business. The military world, they point out, puts a high premium on effective internal communication. Lives can depend on the ability to impart, exchange and distribute information with maximum efficiency. The army also cultivates rigorous planning, with precise formulation of targets and - more than most business schools - a careful evaluation of 'downside' scenarios, given that the battlefield is a more unpredictable place than the boardroom. As Mr Hunter puts it: 'Every plan is a good one until you meet the enemy.' For the past two years the Ministry of Defence has been running a vigorous public relations campaign - Access to Excellence - to persuade employers that the forces are the 'best trained workforce in Britain'. It is stressing that one-third of an average service career is spent in training, that entry requirements are rigorous, that promotion depends on qualifications and performance, and that there is continuous 'culling' of weaker servicemen. As evidence of the campaign's success the defence ministry says 85 per cent of departing servicemen have found work within a year - 50 per cent have fixed up a job before they leave. In presentations to employers and chambers of commerce the ministry has tried to find ways of making service qualifications comprehensible to civilians. An infantry sergeant, for example, is described as a man who is used to overseeing 30 men and maintaining Pounds 1m of equipment. Up to 4,000 of the servicemen affected by the forthcoming redundancies are likely to be air-force engineers, doing jobs to be farmed out to the private sector. Many can expect to be re-employed - in large businesses or the small ones they set up - doing almost the same thing as they were before. Mr Hunter and his friends think that many ex-servicemen go too far in playing down their military background and trying to adapt their language and presentation to the civilian world. He said: 'If you have been in command of something, you should use the word command and not manage. You don't want to make yourself sound as though you've been running a supermarket.' On the other hand many a civilian business-school graduate would be sceptical of the idea that he or she had anything to learn from a product of Sandhurst - at least until encountering the real thing. The past three decades have probably seen a thickening of the cultural barriers between the armed forces and the business world. The continuing flow of skilled personnel from the barracks to the workshop, the laboratory and the boardroom could help break them down again. Ark Royal, Weekend XXIV</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Observer: Via dolorosa Britain's greatest living film-maker, Peter Greenaway, will tonight be musing on how ultimately life imitates art. His 1987 movie The Belly of an Architect was about an artist who visits Rome to mount an exhibition, but who is hopelessly thwarted. Greenaway's plan to stage a son et lumiere in one of Rome's loveliest squares, the Piazza del Popolo, designed by Pope Sixtus V, has just been scotched by contemporary Roman bureaucracy. His 'Cosmology of Piazza del Popolo' was to have been the climax of a British Council programme of British art and theatre. The idea was to compress a 24-hour day into 10 minutes of pyrotechnics, accompanied by music. But he has run foul of the local authorities; despite having performed all the rituals required by the municipality, last-minute objections have dimmed Greenaway's lights. But maybe he's just fallen foul of Italy's new arts minister, the neo-Fascist Domenico Fisichella: 'We accord the status of 'art' only to aesthetic works several centuries old.' So, that takes care of Pasolini, Modigliani, Fellini, Primo Levi . . .</p>

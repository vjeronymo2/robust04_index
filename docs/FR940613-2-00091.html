			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Board, and, in particular, with Sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 15B(b)(2)(C), (G); [15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;4(b)(2)(C), (G)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission received several comments to rule G&hyph;37 recommending that the rule provide an exemption process, based on the dealer's compliance procedures and supervision, for certain inadvertent violations. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The Commission approved the rule and recommended the MSRB separately address these concerns by filing a proposed rule change that provides an exemption process for inadvertent violations. The MSRB's proposal adequately addresses these concerns. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The proposal provides procedures for dealers to obtain exemptive relief from rule G&hyph;37's prohibition on business where, for example, covered persons inadvertently make contributions that slightly exceed the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> exemption provided by the rule. The proposal's exemptive relief is based on the dealers' supervision of covered persons, compliance procedures concerning rule G&hyph;37, and corrective and remedial action concerning inadvertent violations. The Commission expects that dealers will apply for exemptive relief only in certain, limited situations. Thus, the proposal provides an exemptive process to rule G&hyph;37 without providing dealers a ``loop-hole'' that would frustrate the rule's purpose to, among other things, ensure that high standards and integrity of the municipal securities industry are maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Because an exemption to rule G&hyph;37 is appropriate in very limited circumstances, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also clarifies provisions of rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. Amendments to rule G&hyph;37's definitions of ``official of an issuer,'' ``municipal securities business,'' and ``municipal finance professional,'' as well as amendments to rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8 disclosure and recordkeeping requirements will facilitate compliance with the rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Accelerated approval is necessary and appropriate to facilitate compliance with rules G&hyph;37 and G&hyph;8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Zhongyu,  minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, recently  pointed out that state-owned enterprises in China have  experienced some changes in the first quarter of this year, and  one finds that state-owned enterprises are developing in a good  direction if one makes an analysis based on facts.    Wang Zhongyu stressed that the operation of the new  structure  has been basically normal as measures related to the reform of  the financial, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange  structures are gradually being implemented. For a period to  come, it is necessary to devote special efforts to improving  state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to make further  efforts to do a still better job in the transformation of  enterprises operational mechanisms and the establishment of new  mechanisms, conscientiously carry out pilot projects regarding  the introduction of the bankruptcy system, sort out and clear  debts, replenish funds at enterprises' disposal, reduce  production output with a view to cutting stocks, reduce deficits  and increase profits, and strengthen enterprise management so  that state-owned enterprises will improve their conditions.    The State Economic and Trade Commission called its first  overall economic operation coordination meeting a few days ago.  While assessing the country's current economic situation,  officials in charge of more than 10 ministries and commissions  of the Chinese government attending the meeting showed extremely  great concern for the present state of state-owned enterprises.    A report filed here earlier said that China's state-owned  enterprises continued to see increased losses, with losses  increasing by nearly 80 percent from January to March, and as  many as 45 percent of state-owned enterprises operating at a  loss.    Referring to this report, Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this  was due to a misunderstanding. He disclosed that the number of  enterprises in China which had stopped operations or were  operating under capacity accounted for about 10 percent of all  enterprises, and enterprises which have stopped operations made  up about 4 percent. Since state-owned enterprises now practice  the "general rules governing enterprise finance" and "codes for  enterprise accounting" and have introduced production cost  accounting with a view to aligning domestic accounting practices  with accounting systems abroad, some expenses that used to be  chargeable to enterprise profits in the past are now listed as  production costs. This in turn resulted in a decrease in  enterprise profits on the books.    Wang Zhongyu emphasized that state-owned enterprises' actual  profits had increased, and the number of enterprises operating  at a loss had decreased.    During this coordination meeting, Wang Zhongyu suggested  that  the performance of state-owned enterprises should be assessed  from three aspects:    --The state has applied many new policies and measures to  state-owned enterprises over the past few years, and party  committees and governments at all levels, as well as enterprises  themselves, have done a lot of work, and, as a result,  state-owned enterprises have improved their position.    --Some enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in  production and operations which should draw great attention and  should be solved in real earnest. Solutions to these problems  require some mandatory conditions to be fulfilled and this takes  time.    --State-owned enterprises can survive and thrive, and the  government is full of confidence about the reinvigoration of  state-owned enterprises.</p>

Guido Tarqui, leader of the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation]  Commission for Coca Affairs, has stated that despite the  militarization of the coca production zones, the coca growers  are not going to move a finger to make substitutions for or  reduce their coca plantations.

One of them is that the measures in the  Cochabamba tropical region, such as the blocking of highways,  must be implemented because they are in a state of emergency.  But they have decided that this state of emergency will prevail  until the end of the COB congress, during which we are going to  propose declaring a state of emergency in all coca production  zones.

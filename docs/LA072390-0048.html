			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UPHOLDS COUNTY'S RIGHT TO TEST JOB APPLICANTS FOR DRUGS;  </P> <P> WORKER RIGHTS: UNIONS ASKED FOR AN INJUNCTION TO HALT THE NEW PROGRAM. INVOLVED  ARE SENSITIVE AND SAFETY-RELATED POSITIONS SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT.  </P> <P> A major legal hurdle has been cleared in Los Angeles County's efforts to  administer drug tests to applicants for certain "sensitive" jobs in county  government.  </P> <P> A coalition of unions representing 30,000 workers had been seeking a court  order to halt the program. But last week, Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffee  turned down the unions' request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that under  state law the county has the right to test the job applicants without  submitting the issue to union-management negotiations.  </P> <P> "If the county wants to make darn sure that they don't hire a drug user for a  sensitive position, they can do it," Yaffee said.  </P> <P> He ruled that the county could implement the program unilaterally because it is  not directed against present county employees.  </P> <P> The new drug testing program, initiated by county officials July 2, requires  applicants for certain county jobs to submit to drug testing. Among jobs  covered by the new guidelines are public safety positions, such as sheriff's  deputies, lifeguards and firefighters; driver positions, such as chauffeurs and  trash truck operators, and positions that involve significant financial  responsibilities, such as accountants.  </P> <P> County employees who apply for transfers to such jobs are subject to the  testing, as well as applicants from outside the county ranks. So far, county  officials said, only sheriff's deputy trainees have been tested.  </P> <P> The unions sought the preliminary injunction to stop the program until the  County Employee Relations Commission can hear their complaint of unfair  employee relations practices, which was sparked by the county's failure to  bargain with the unions before implementing the guidelines.  </P> <P> "The unions don't condone drug use, but we feel the program should not have  been implemented without union bargaining," said Alexander Cvitan, attorney for  the workers' coalition.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of employers to demand drug tests  for employment applicants or personnel who have been involved in on-the-job  accidents and for those who take periodic physical exams as a condition of  employment. Lawyers who represent labor unions believe that the court has yet  to rule definitively whether purely random tests are constitutional or if they  violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches.  </P> <P> Recently, the California Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that  employers cannot fire or punish workers who refuse to submit to random tests.  The ruling was based on California's constitutional privacy protections.  </P> <P> The county, however, has not implemented random testing.  </P> <P> Locally, the Southern California Rapid Transit District last year began  administering random drug tests to its 7,000 drivers and mechanics, and the Los  Angeles Police Department ordered mandatory random drug testing of its  captains, commanders and deputy chiefs beginning May 1. Those who test positive  for illegal drugs face being fired.  </P> <P> A program that would require 6,000 other city police to be tested randomly once  a year is under negotiation with the police union.  </P></p>

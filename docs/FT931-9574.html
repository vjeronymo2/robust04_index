			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: L'Air Liquide advances to FFr2.64bn L'AIR LIQUIDE, the French industrial gases group, increased net consolidated profits by just over 2 per cent to FFr2.64bn (Dollars 472m) last year, from FFr2.59bn in 1991. The increase reflected continued growth in the group's gas interests. But it suffered a setback in its chemical activities, mainly because of an accident at one of its plants. Consolidated sales fell by 5.9 per cent to FFr29.9bn last year. A big factor in the decline was the fluctuation in exchange rates since September, it said.</p>

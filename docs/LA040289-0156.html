			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSING QUOTES  </P> <P> On the 98-count indictment of financier and "junk bond" king Michael Milken:  </P> <P> "He's being charged with doing something illegal. He got caught with his  fingers in the cookie jar. It's marvelous."  </P> <P>  -- Fred L. Hartley, chairman of Unocal, the Los Angeles petroleum company that  fought off a junk bond-financed takeover attempt in 1985.  </P> <P> "The public needs to know that rich and poor alike, powerful and powerless, are  subject to the same prosecution."  </P> <P>  -- Kirk O. Hanson, a senior lecturer on business ethics at Stanford Graduate  School of Business.  </P> <P> "I don't think there are any great surprises. They were really shooting for  these guys, and this is a heavy indictment with a lot of counts."  </P> <P>  -- Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York defense lawyer and former regional administrator  of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> "Part of his problem was that he was too successful. In fact, he became the  most powerful person on Wall Street since J. P. Morgan."  </P> <P>  -- Richard Riordan, a Los Angeles attorney and venture capitalist.  </P> <P> "It's disgraceful and a sad day in American business history the way he's being  treated. He has given entrepreneurs an opportunity to participate in the great  American game of business."  </P> <P>  -- Charles Sarkis, president of the Westwood Group, which has used junk bonds  to expand operations.  </P> <P> "The pain of this investigation, and the frustration of knowing it is  unwarranted, have been excruciating."  </P> <P>  -- Michael Milken  </P></p>

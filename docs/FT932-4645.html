			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: France plans to launch FFr40bn bond this month THE French government plans to launch its record FFr40bn convertible bond issue before the end of the month. The bond will raise capital for France's economic regeneration programme. A provisional date of June 28 has been set for the issue, to be targeted at private investors who will be able to convert their bonds into shares in newly-privatised French companies or into tax-efficient long-term savings schemes. Mr Edouard Balladur, France's new centre-right prime minister who late last month unveiled proposals for the special bond, is keen to launch it as soon as possible. However, the government will have to wait until the necessary legislation has been passed to authorise the issue and to allow extra time in case of legal challenges. Investors are likely to be given 10 days after the launch to subscribe to the issue. The government has yet to announce whether a special tranche will be reserved for international investors. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, recently abolished the restriction whereby foreign shareholders were not permitted to own more than 20 per cent of the equity of privatised French companies. The names of the lead managers have yet to be disclosed. However, big French banks, such as Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais are expected to dominate the operation.</p>

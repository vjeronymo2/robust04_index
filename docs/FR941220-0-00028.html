			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters stated that arranging for the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed supervisory requirements would impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant burdens and costs associated with scheduling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> travel, and the inefficient allocation of nursing resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters also stated that the joint visits would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of limited value because many patients are reluctant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voice concerns or complaints in the presence of the home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health aide (preferring to speak with the nurse privately in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person or by telephone). These legitimate and practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns have persuaded us that the value to be gained by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed requirements does not merit the burden which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they would impose on HHAs. Because of the progress we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already made in our efforts to ensure the high quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health aide services furnished by Medicare-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHAs, we do not believe that the advantages of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements justify their associated cost and burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this final rule does not contain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters stated that the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisory visit by a registered nurse every 62 days when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the non-Medicare patient is receiving home health aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services but no skilled nursing care or physical, speech, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational therapy is too infrequent. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the required frequency of supervisory visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not provide adequate oversight of home health aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. We believe that these non-Medicare patients who are not receiving skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care, physical or occupational therapy, or speech-language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathology services are not as ill as those who are receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled services and therefore are at less risk of medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems or complications that could occur during the course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of receiving home health aide services. Because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients are less ill, and therefore receiving home health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide care that is likely to be more custodial in nature, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that it is appropriate to require a lower frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of supervision. Due to the lower frequency of these visits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have specifically required them to occur while the aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is furnishing services so that the nurse can assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aide's actual provision of care as well as the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of the patient. Also, we are requiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site supervisory visit (which applies only to non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare patients) at this frequency to conform Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that apply to HHAs that participate in Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the licensure requirements of many States, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enabling many HHAs to meet the administrative requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of two bodies with a single visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Condition of Participation: Clinical Records (&sect;409.48)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirement that discharge summaries be sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending physician will increase the flow of unwanted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paperwork into physicians' offices. One commenter suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we require HHAs to inform the attending physician of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of the discharge summary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We understand the commenters' concern and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have accepted the suggestion. We have revised &sect;484.48 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the HHA to inform the attending physician of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of a discharge summary and send it to him or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her upon request. This requirement will allow physicians to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain informed of the care furnished to their patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while minimizing the amount of unwanted paperwork being sent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to physicians' offices. We would also like to clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discharge summary need not be a separate piece of paper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and could be incorporated into the routine summary reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already furnished to the physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary requirement could not be implemented without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not agree with the commenter. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that HHAs maintain a discharge summary for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient is not new. Section 484.48 has long required the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHA to include a discharge summary in the patient's clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record. This rule does not impose any additional paperwork  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. It only requires the HHA to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge summary (already required under the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of participation) available to the patient's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending physician upon request. Also, as stated above, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not requiring that the discharge summary be a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> piece of paper that is not part of the routine summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports already being submitted to the physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested that we specify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required contents of the discharge summary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are specifically requiring only that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge summary include the patient's medical and health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status at discharge. We are otherwise providing the HHAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flexibility to include whatever additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they consider to be relevant and necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

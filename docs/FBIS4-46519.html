And He Has Come"]    [Text] Every spring there is a new Minister of Defense in  Georgia....    Tengiz Kitovani became head of the military department in  May  1992. The hero of the anti-Gamsakhurdia action and father of  the National Guard immediately declared his intention to  urgently set about building unified armed forces. But in the  wake of the attacks on Russian military units (just take that  one incident -- there were casualties on both sides -- with the  tank regiment in Gori!), the hijacking of automobiles, the  "privatization" of Russian servicemen's apartments, and the  political intrigues, the good intention has remained precisely  that -- a good intention.    What is also indicative is whom Tengiz Kitovani (an  architect  by education; his military experience consists of three years of  draft service in the Belorussian Military District) intended to  build an army with. Tengiz Kalistratovich had as his deputy,  for example, a man who was a complete civilian, although he had  been elevated to general by the former. This was Tamaz  Dumbadze, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Soviet Trade.  And another general, also homegrown, with a diploma from a  Georgian polytechnic institute, is Dzhemal Chumburidze, chief of  the National Guard Main Directorate. He has been Deputy Defense  Minister as of March 1993.    Incidentally, generals were appointed on the basis of  completely farfetched talk to the effect that Georgians were not  given promotions in the Soviet Army. And since that was the  case, Tengiz Kalistratovich evidently decided, yesterday's  colonels, lieutenant colonels, and captains should be raised to  the rank of general. Everyone was rewarded! But was this done  on merit?    Georgiy Karkarashvili. In 1990 he was a captain in the  Soviet Army, chief of staff of an artillery division; and since  14 September 1992 he has also been a general in the Georgian  Armed Forces. Paata Datuashvili. In 1990 he was a lieutenant  colonel and commander of a rocket artillery division in the  Transbaykal Military District. He has become a major general  and Georgian first deputy defense minister.    The list of "wild-growing" generals can be continued. But  are we talking only about generals? The commander of a  detachment of seven or eight men has already called himself  colonel and commander of a battalion. Hence the joke was born:  "In the Georgian Army the first military rank is that of major."    Either there was no one to get involved in army  organizational development or, despite the cunning nature of the  propaganda of the time, no "Soviet generals," even retired ones,  could be found?    But there are some. Colonel General Anatoliy Kamkamidze,  Lieutenant Generals Levan Sharashenidze, Mikhail Elbakidze, and  Robert Tavadze, Major General Panteleymon Georgadze.... They  had served in the Soviet Army for decades, but they nevertheless  did not get the top roles in the Georgian Army. Admittedly,  Levon Sharashenidze spent four months as minister of defense  (January-May 1992), until his first serious conflict with the  leadership of the National Guard. Pantaleymon Georgadze (the  father of Igor Georgadze, the Republic's current security  minister) spent some time in command of Border Guard Troops, but  he did not last long after disagreeing with parliament in his  views concerning the organizational development of the Army.  The other "red generals" became the deputies of yesterday's  captains.    On the other hand, the "armed men" in Georgia felt free  under  Tengiz Kalistratovich to earn their living sometimes by robbery  and sometimes by terror.    Never mind robbery! The fall of 1992. There is war in  Abkhazia and parliament is examining the composition of the new  Cabinet of Ministers in Tbilisi. The deputies refuse to confirm  Tengiz Sigua, Kitovani's comrade-in-arms in the  anti-Gamsakhurdia action, in the post of prime minister. By a  curious coincidence, it was precisely when National Guard troops  started wandering the corridors of parliament (only the  slow-witted did not realize why this should suddenly happen) and  a rumor spread around town that "Kitovani's guys" want to come  to visit for a couple of days from Abkhazia that the deputies  voted as one for Sigua.    Kitovani got his deserts several months later, in May 1993.  The parliamentary deputies suddenly "remembered" that Tengiz  Kalistratovich had not been confirmed in the post of minister of  defense (and, it turned out, this should have been done straight  after the parliamentary elections in fall 1992), and they  rebelled, saying that this was out of order. The issue was put  to the vote and was rejected. But Kitovani's game was already  up by then. The Georgian detachments were suffering defeat  after defeat in Abkhazia; it did not prove possible to tame the  rebellious autonomous formation, as Kitovani had promised;  disagreements with Eduard Shevardnadze intensified, and only one  solution remained: To get out.    Which he did, having spoken to Georgiy Karkarashvili  beforehand. What they talked about is unknown, but  Karkarashvili often repeated afterward that if it had not been  for the parting words of Kitovani, who "made him a man," he  would not have complied with Eduard Shevardnadze's request that  he become minister of defense. One way or another the new  appointment took place -- and, alas, in a form which ensured  continuity of the style of leadership of the Armed Forces:  Reforms were not carried out, and at the front things went  worse then ever. There were ambitions and promises to launch a  large-scale offensive against the Abkhazians (this brought a  skeptical smile to the people who knew the state of the Georgian  Armed Forces). In a word, Karkarashvili was like his teacher,  and observers noted entirely fairly that the former captain was  brave and knew how to fight, but was useless as a commander. In  February 1994, in the wake of the Abkhazian nightmare, Georgiy  Karkarashvili resigned. His relations with Eduard Shevardnadze  appeared to have deteriorated seriously after Karkarashvili,  during a Zviadist offensive in the west of the republic,  repealed an order of the supreme commander in chief and refused  to fight against Loti Lobaliya....    After Karkarashvili, the Georgian parliament prevaricated  for  almost four months over the appointment of a new minister. This  time passed amid reflections about the future of the national  army. Not just reflections, however. A resolution was adopted  on the procedure for awarding military ranks. Given the  complete anarchy of previous years in this respect, the step was  a prudent one. The 300 Georgian officers who did not respond to  the appeal to return from the Russian Army were discussed with  bitterness. Furthermore, reports are coming into the Georgian  Ministry of Defense's personnel organs with a request...to  assist in transfers to the Russian Army: People have gotten fed  up with low pay, the lack of social protection, the lack of any  service prospects. Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze spoke  very emotionally and unexpectedly as follows: "Georgia will be  free when a Russian general summons the leadership of the  Georgian Army and announces to it: 'Congratulations.  Henceforth Georgia is free. I wish you all the best.' And in  response, Georgian servicemen will shout a grateful `Hurrah' and  swear an oath of loyalty to Russia. There is no other way  out...."    The opposition claims: "The Russian general has already  arrived." By "the Russian" they mean Lieutenant General Varden  Nadibaidze, whom parliament confirmed in the post of defense  minister in May of this year. (He was born 31 March 1939 in the  village of Mleta in Georgia's Dushetskiy Rayon. He graduated  from the Ordzhonikidze Military Automobile School and the Rear  Services and Transportation Academy. He has served in the Kiev  Military District, the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, and,  since 1972, in the Transcaucasus, where he rose to deputy  commander for armaments of the Group of Russian Forces in the  Transcaucasus.)    So why "Russian"? Nadibaidze is no arriviste; he is from the  real and true Georgian heartland. Admittedly, during his years  of service he has forgotten the language somewhat, and only  gives interviews to journalists in Russian. And the opposition  holds this against him. Once again, a general who has served in  Russia has been appointed to the post of minister -- and the  opposition has noted this "point" too.    Everything can be corrected: The language can be brought up  to standard, and the transfer (and that will doubtless happen)  to the national army will be officially registered. Something  else is far more important: The military department is not  headed by an architect or a pianist but by a functioning general  who does not represent the interests of any political parties,  clans, or groups (unlike his predecessors). This happens once  in a blue moon....    As for Russia, then, no matter what it might say, its  interest is the same as before: Having for a neighbor a united,  stable state. And if the "Russian" General Nadibaidze  facilitates this, then what is there in this that runs counter  to Georgia's national interests?</p>

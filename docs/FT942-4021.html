			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: Good value fizz - Appetisers Like manufacturing Easter eggs, winemaking is basically a part-time job. A month of frenetic activity punctuates an otherwise relatively tranquil existence. Hence flying winemakers who commute between hemispheres to double their vintage experience, and hence so many winemakers' secret ambitions to experiment with more demanding wine styles such as fortified and sparkling wines, writes Jancis Robinson. It is no surprise, therefore, to come across Maison La Motte, a vivaciously sparkling version of James Herrick's still Chardonnay from his three vineyards in the Languedoc, on sale at Pounds 7.99 at Safeway and Victoria Wine. Given its sparkle in the Loire by the traditional champagne method, it shows that Limoux does not have the southern French monopoly on good value fizz. The Savoie sparkling winemaking business Varichon et Clerc proves the same point, more clumsily but much more cheaply, with its Sparkling Chardonnay on sale at Asda for Pounds 4.99. This is also southern French fruit, but given its sparkle in the Alpine foothills. Much better buys from Asda, however, come from Limoux but are not Limoux's most famous product, Blanquette (soon to be Cremant) de Limoux. The charming, still red Pinot Noir, Vin de Pays 1992 at just Pounds 3.75 is a steal for a lightly oaked, flattering wine designed to be drunk, not too warm, this very day. Also definitively a summer wine is Asda's Blanquette Methode Ancestrale Pounds 3.99, another true bargain from Limoux. This is the most traditional form of sparkling wine - despite the EU's insistence that those made by the champagne method be labelled 'traditional method' - left sweetish and lightly fizzing with, traditionally, the sediment from the second fermentation in bottle still lurking in the bottle. It would be unreasonable to expect a supermarket to live with as frighteningly natural a thing as sediment, so it has been removed, by disgorgement a la champenoise, but the wine would make a genuinely delightful appley aperitif or light pudding wine with something not too sweet such as strawberries. English winemakers are also increasingly putting sparkle in their wines, partly to boost their selling price and partly because the cool summers (and some soils) of England can be remarkably like those of Champagne. Heritage English Sparkling from the Thames valley via Safeway and Victoria Wine at Pounds 7.99 has nice lees-aged aromas, a little bit of bite, and does not have a great deal of gas. The process of ageing sparkling wine on its yeast lees to give it that special character is still far from fully understood, but champagne giants Moet &amp; Chandon have been working on it. Their most communicative winemaker Richard Geoffroy was in London this week to divulge the results. Science backs up our palates in demonstrating that it works best on the classic Champagne grapes Pinot and Chardonnay, if kept on the lees preferably for at least five years, and cannot be used to add class to essentially poor wine. But his real bombshell was the news, after all these years, that champagne bottles are probably best stored upright rather than horizontal. Champagne corks are quite different animals, expected to do a quite different job, from still wine corks, and the less the wine is in contact with them, the better apparently. In this new spirit of openness, Moet &amp; Chandon is launching its new non-vintage Brut Imperial in Britain this month, based on wines from the superb 1990 crop, with a smart back label spelling out this fact, together with percentage of reserve wines (17) and the varietal composition of the blend. Bravo] And the wine itself is a worthy emissary too. Those looking for a more obscure champagne-with-a-story could do worse than Gatinois NV, Pounds 181.80 a case or Pounds 16.80 a bottle from Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark on 071-376 2737. The deputy mayor of Ay sells most of his grapes to Bollinger but produces wines like this powerfully flavoured, Pinot Noir-dominated blend with the rest of the produce from his seven hectares of grand cru vineyards. J. Sainsbury is doing its bit to drain the European wine lake by launching a pair of Sicilian wines, on special offer for the next two weeks at Pounds 1.99 (usual price Pounds 2.69). The red is aquiver with acidity and did not appeal to me as much as the white, a relatively robust, lively blend of Trebbiano with Italy's most planted grape variety, Catarratto. JR Wine collectors are spoilt for choice in London next week with sales at Sotheby's and Christie's. Sotheby's sale on Wednesday includes the cellar from Boulestin's restaurant. Details and catalogue on 071-408 5051. Jill James To clarify last week's item about the private cellar being offered at Christie's (071-839 9060) in London on Thursday. The 1947 Cheval Blanc, mentioned as being of special interest, is expected to fetch Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 per dozen and it is the sale's two super lots which are estimated at Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 300,000 each. There will be mixed lots ranging in estimate from as little as Pounds 80.</p>

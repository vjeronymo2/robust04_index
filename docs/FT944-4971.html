			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Gold The macro-economic fundamentals for gold look dreadful. The costs of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion have risen as interest rates have started to move up. Alternative investments such as bonds appear increasingly attractive. Meanwhile, the potential rewards of holding gold remain few and far between. Precious metals have traditionally been viewed as a hedge against inflation. That rationale may no longer be valid: the general breakdown of international exchange controls allows investors to switch out of depreciating currencies; and the development of sophisticated derivative instruments means there are more effective ways of offsetting inflationary dangers. Fundamentals apart, the current absence of any significant inflation in Europe, Japan or the US provides little incentive to hold the precious metal. Nor does the supply-demand balance give cause for comfort. With the gold price falling to a 16 week low yesterday, Asian and Middle Eastern investors - who generate 55 per cent of demand - have few reasons to buy bullion. Many have already been burned by the depreciation of their dollar-backed assets against their local currencies. On the supply side, any decent price increase tempts mine-owners to raise production or central banks to release gold reserves. For the gold price, the worst of all possible worlds seems to have materialised.</p>

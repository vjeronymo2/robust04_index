			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bell Canada seeks rate rise STIFFENING competition in Canada's telephone market has led Bell Canada, the country's biggest phone company, to apply for the first rise in basic local rates for 10 years, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Bell, which has a monopoly on local services in the key markets of Ontario and Quebec, said the increase is required to make up for a gradual erosion of income from long-distance services. The proposed increase would average 10 per cent for households and 9 per cent for business customers. It must still be approved by a federal regulatory agency. Bell's lucrative long-distance business provided a CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.49bn) subsidy to local services last year. According to Bell, the fee for residential services currently averages CDollars 10 a month, compared with a cost to the company of CDollars 40. The fee covers an unlimited number of local calls.</p>

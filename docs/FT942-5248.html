			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (12): Safety net catches too many - Reform of the social security programme is on the way Canada is a rich country - but the social safety net which successive governments have devised over five decades has become unaffordable. Nearly CDollars 40bn a year is spent by the federal government alone on social programmes ranging from unemployment insurance and welfare benefits to student loans and training for the disabled. The country's 10 provinces and two territories spend billions more. Canadians have become tired of paying high taxes. They also fear the foreign borrowing that has made the spending possible in recent years will become impossible as lenders succumb to concern about high debt levels. What is worse, there is almost universal agreement that many of the country's very expensive social programmes do not work. Ms Judith Maxwell, associate director of the School of Policy Studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, says both the unemployment insurance and welfare (social assistance) programmes were designed for the 1950s and 1960s when there was full employment. 'The original design of unemployment insurance was that it was to help people who were on temporary lay-off and expecting to return to the same job,' she says. 'The intent of social assistance was that it was for people who were unemployable. Now half of the people on social assistance are fully employable.' Ms Maxwell is one of the experts on a social services task force set up by Mr Lloyd Axworthy, the federal human resources minister. The task force is about to come up with reform proposals, from which a parliamentary committee is expected to produce recommendations in the autumn. 'It's especially difficult in Canada,' Ms Maxwell says of the search for reforms to the social safety net. The powers and responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments are clearly set out in the Canadian constitution, and jealously guarded by politicians at each level. For example, the provinces are responsible for education and social security, but unemployment insurance comes under the federal wing. Over the years, however, the federal government has used its taxing powers to entice the provinces into various social programmes such as universal health care and welfare. 'It's very difficult for one level of government to institute reforms without having big spill-over effects on another level of government,' says Ms Maxwell. 'If the federal government makes changes (to unemployment insurance), then it pushes people onto the welfare system, which is provincial jurisdiction, Ms Maxwell says. Conversely, provincial governments will sometimes tailor job-creation programmes to make people eligible for unemployment insurance, which is a federal responsibility. Social assistance has even become a political football between provinces. Recently, British Columbia claimed it was experiencing an influx of welfare claimants after the neighbouring province of Alberta cut its level of benefits. Mr John Richards, an economist in the business faculty at Simon Fraser university in Burnaby, British Columbia, says that Canada has among the most generous unemployment benefits of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But the Canadian insurance scheme 'certainly has a number of perverse incentives'. Mr Richards makes a distinction between 'passive' measures that hand money over to the unemployed, and programmes such as training and mobility grants designed to make people work. 'Canada spends relatively more on the passive than on the active,' he says. Other countries such as Sweden and Germany that spend heavily on social programmes place more emphasis on the active. Ms Maxwell says spending on job creation and training will have to be increased. 'We have to find more efficient ways to do what we do but we also have to fill some glaring holes in the social safety net,' she adds. 'We don't have any kind of adequate system for child care or parental leave.' As social safety reforms are rolled out over the next year or two, training and other programmes may be introduced, but the problems will not be solved without attacking the unemployment insurance and welfare programmes. Unemployment benefits cost about CDollars 19bn a year. The fiction that the system is self-insuring is becoming harder to sustain as Canada experiences a jobless recovery with unemployment stubbornly stuck at about 11 per cent. The fund is now more than CDollars 5bn in the red. The likely solution is that it will become more difficult to claim benefits. The current implicit subsidy to seasonal industries is also likely to be reduced or eliminated. At the moment, an employee in a sector such as fisheries can work as little as 10 weeks a year and claim for the other 42. Social assistance, which was originally supposed to help the most desperate and unemployable, is costing the federal and provincial governments about CDollars 21bn a year. Mr Derek Brackley, an economist with the British Columbia and Yukon branch of the Canadian Ministry of Human Resources Development, says that the biggest change to social assistance in recent years has been in the profile of people collecting benefits. 'The number of single males has gone up astronomically over the past few years,' he says. However, most of these get off welfare fairly quickly, while families tend to collect benefits for a long time. Mr Brackley says the heads of single-parent families find they are better off on social assistance. Minimum-wage jobs do not pay enough to cover such work-related costs as daycare, extra clothing and transportation. Experts expect the system will be redesigned to make it more financially attractive to return to the workforce. 'I think there's a consensus that we need a different incentive system,' Ms Maxwell says. But she warns that governments will have to take care to cushion the blow for the casualties of the adjustments. 'If you start tearing down an existing social structure, you create losers. You can't simply write off the people who are unable to adapt,' she warns.</p>

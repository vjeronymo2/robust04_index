			<p>SUMMARY                                         In several regions local administration heads took advantage of  their ability to set the rules for local elections to promote  executive influence in local legislatures by allowing executive  officials to run for legislative seats and simultaneously retain  their executive branch positions.  Despite official protests over  these attempts--charging that the constitutional principle of  separation of powers is being undermined--the central government  does not appear to have censured or tried to rein in the local  executives involved.  The Yeltsin administration may hope that  the local executives' presence will counterbalance hardline  communist influence in the legislatures, but the administration  may also find that, having won voter mandates and a legislative  seat, these local executives will be in a stronger position to  counterweigh demands from Moscow.                                       END SUMMARY     In the absence of action to set nationwide rules for local  elections from either President Boris Yeltsin or the legislature,  local executives ended up with a very large say in setting  procedures for  the recent local legislative elections in their  regions.  According to Central Electoral Commission (CEC) Deputy  Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko, "the election procedure in the  provinces is determined by the heads of administrations,  according to Article 77 of the [federal] constitution" (See Note  1), and the CEC "has no right to impose rigid standards on the  regions" (Izvestiya, 3 February).  In addition, local executives  may have been prompted to take matters into their own hands at  the failure of the State Duma to flesh out constitutional  provisions regarding the conduct of local elections.  Three State  Duma resolutions on local elections--two calling for presidential  revision of local election procedures and one proposing the  cancellation of local elections--were defeated (Segodnya, 10  February).     (Note 1)  Article 77 of the Russian Federation Constitution  states that "the system of organs of state power of the  republics, krays, oblasts, cities of federal significance, the  autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs is established by the  components of the Russian Federation independently in accordance  with the fundamentals of the constitutional system of the Russian  Federation and the general principles of the organization of  representative and executive organs of state power established by  federal law" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 November 1993).     Executive Branch Invades Legislative     In several regions, local administration heads took advantage of  their ability to set the rules for local elections to attempt to  ensure--in disregard of the constitution's pronouncement in favor  of separation of powers (Article 10)--that administration  officials hold a large share of the seats in those legislatures:     -- In Kursk Oblast, 21 of the 36 deputies elected on 27 March  were rayon administration heads, "meaning that they themselves  will write the local laws as well as executing and monitoring  them," according to Rossiyskaya Gazeta (30 March).     -- In Vologda Oblast, 18 officials from the oblast and rayon  administrations have been registered as candidates for the 15  deputies' seats in the oblast duma, according to a 5 March  Izvestiya article.     -- In Rostov Oblast, "all eight heads of rayon administrations  registered as candidates for the local City Duma" (Rossiyskiye  Vesti, 3 March).  In the 27 March oblast duma election, executive  branch officials won roughly two-thirds of the 45 legislative  seats (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 30, 31 March).     -- In Orenburg Oblast, executive branch officials ran for the  oblast legislature despite an appeal from oblast Head of  Administration V. Yelagin to rayon administration leaders not to  run.  Eleven were subsequently elected to the oblast duma  (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 29 March).     In some cases, the chief executives extended their influence over  local representative bodies more directly, seemingly unwilling to  chance the ballot box.  Vologda Oblast Governor Nikolay Podgornov  issued an electoral decree and statute reportedly allowing the  heads of administration, which he appoints, to chair the Vologda  and Cherepovets city dumas and smaller rayon assemblies  (Izvestiya, 5 March).  Podgornov also reportedly "abolished" city  councils entirely in the cities of Velikiy Ustyug, Totma,  Belozersk, Ustyuzhna, and Kirillov (Izvestiya, 27 January).  A 22  February Komsomolskaya Pravda issue asserted that, in the Tula  Oblast electoral statute, oblast Head of Administration Nikolay  Sevryugin has reserved for himself the power to appoint "a  section" of the deputies to the oblast legislature.     The phenomenon of local executives running for local legislative  seats was widespread and apparently was supported by the voters.  A 1 April Rossiyskiye Vesti analysis of local election results  reported that "a total of 463 [heads of administration] took  part" in local election campaigns, and in some regions they  comprise "up to 40 percent of the representative assemblies."  The analysis lists that "in Voronezh Oblast 18 of the 45 elected  representatives are heads of administration at all levels; in  Irkutsk Oblast--10 out of 45; in Kaluga Oblast--21 out of 45; in  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--14 out of 45; and in Novgorod Oblast--11  out of 27."  An 11 March Trud article reported that following the  30 January elections in Penza Oblast, the 45-member local  legislature consists of 20 heads of administrations or their  deputies.     Silence From the Kremlin     The Yeltsin administration apparently made little effort to  prevent heads of administration from invading the legislatures.  Deputy Chief of the administration's Directorate for Work with  the Territories Sergey Samoylov conceded that, despite Yeltsin's  commitment to the operation of the principle of separation of  powers, virtually all organizational questions regarding local  legislative power are being settled by executive structures.  He  emphasized, however, that normative acts of executives regarding  local elections undergo "mandatory expert analysis" in the  president's administration and are "invariably coordinated" with  the CEC.  Samoylov attributed local executive frequent successes  in the balloting to the voters' taking a greater stake in local  affairs, saying that voters have "entrusted mandates to the  people who control the real levers of power, and who therefore  will be able to do something for them."  He also noted, however,  that some localities--as in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod-  -banned the administration heads from running (Trud, 11 March).     Tacit Approval?     The Yeltsin administration's failure to mount a stronger protest  against the heads of administrations suggests that they may have  viewed the prospect of the administration heads extending their  influence in local legislatures as a desirable counterweight to a  communist or hardline nationalist presence in those bodies.  Rossiyskiye Vesti correspondent Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy wrote  that the electorate has "no alternative" but to choose between  the entrenched bureaucrats and diehard communist opposition in  the regions.  Rostov Oblast Head of Administration Vladimir Chub  defended the registration of all eight heads of rayon  administrations as candidates for the oblast legislature,  reportedly stating that "if the executive is not allowed into the  representative branch, it will indeed be dominated by the  communists."     Checks Unbalanced     Despite the absence of a clear stand by the Yeltsin  administration, some local officials and others objected to the  intrusion into legislative affairs:     -- Vologda Oblast Duma candidate Albert Volkov condemned oblast  administration employees' running for legislative positions as a  violation of the constitutional principle of the separation of  powers.  The oblast prosecutor's office and local leaders of  conservative and reformist parties alike protested Podgornov's  acts subordinating city dumas and rayon assemblies to his  appointed heads of administration, charging that these provisions  contradict the federal constitution.  Podgornov reportedly  "rejected" the oblast prosecutor's protest and has not been  observed to have addressed the concerns of the other complainants  (Izvestiya, 5 March).     -- Rostov Oblast presidential representative Vladimir Zubkov was  reportedly "concerned" at the trend of combining executive and  legislative posts, asserting that when the question of combining  posts was discussed in February by the Public Chamber "virtually  everyone from Sobchak to Zhirinovskiy agreed" that combination  was "inadmissible" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 3 March).     Implications     "Name recognition" will likely continue to carry local executive  branch officials into legislative seats, though this trend at the  same time significantly diminishes, if not snuffs out entirely,  any local system of checks and balances on the executive branch  of local government.  It is still unclear, however, whether local  administration heads will be consistently open toward  implementing the center's reforms.  Although some may be amenable  to reform, many may continue to resist-reform at the local level  in order to soften the effects of reform on their constituents.     The Yeltsin administration's laissez-faire policy toward local  self-government will probably prove costly as local executives  are likely to use their new bases and popular election mandate in  the legislatures to press for greater autonomy from Moscow.     BOX              Heads' of Administration Checkered Background     Although the local heads of administration are appointed by  President Boris Yeltsin, they have a mixed record in supporting  the president and reform policies.  In the months following the  August 1991 coup, many local administration heads began to  distance themselves from Yeltsin by pursuing policies geared more  toward local rather than Yeltsin's interests.  After Yeltsin  threatened a showdown with the old Supreme Soviet in a 20 March  1993 television address, few heads of administration gave him  unequivocal support*.  In like fashion, many regional leaders  took a cautious or negative stance following the Moscow crisis of  October 1993.**  After each incident, Yeltsin replaced a number  of administration heads that did not firmly support his views.     *    See the Trends of 29 March 1993, pages 1-23.     **   See the Trends of 6 October 1993, pages 15-19.

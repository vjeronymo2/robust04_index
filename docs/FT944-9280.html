			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue advances to Pounds 73m - Record banknote production behind better than expected 10% rise Record banknote production helped De La Rue, the security printer, payment and transaction systems group, report better than expected interim profits yesterday. Pre-tax profits increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 72.8m in the six months to September 30, up from Pounds 66.1m a year earlier when profits were boosted by a Pounds 9.5m exceptional profit on the sale of the group's Brazilian operations. In the wake of the announcement analysts upgraded their full-year profits forecasts and the shares closed up 31p at a new high of Pounds 10.34p. The results were underpinned by a 20 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 52.2m on turnover from continuing oper-ations up 21 per cent to Pounds 324m Pre-tax profits were also helped by higher net interest receipts of Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 5.7m) and a significant increase, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 13.7m, in the share of profits of De La Rue Giori, the group's Swiss-based banknote printing equipment associate. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the results, 'demonstrated De La Rue's strengths across all our sectors'. He said banknote production was at a record for a half year with strong demand from a broad range of customers. The security printing continuing operations contributed Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 24.9m) to operating profits on turnover of Pounds 130m (Pounds 89.9m), buoyed by an unusually high volume of 'bonanza' banknote printing undertaken on behalf of countries which had been unable to meet demand from their own state-owned presses. The group also generated sales of Pounds 25m for work completed on state printing works projects, although it said it was taking a conservative approach to recognising profits from this source. The transaction systems division, which made profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 2.5m) on turnover of Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 29.7m), also had 'a very encouraging first half'. Profits from the payment systems operations, which sell cash handling equipment, edged ahead to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 16m) on turnover of Pounds 155m (Pounds 149m). Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 28.1p (24.8p). Excluding non-recurring items, earnings advanced by 32 per cent. The interim dividend is raised by 17 per cent to 7p (6p). COMMENT With the exception of the payments systems division, De La Rue's results were impressive - even though they benefited from a number of atypical factors. Second half growth is unlikely to match that achieved in the first six months, but full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 150m now look possible, producing earnings of about 57.6p. Profits from the mature core businesses should be solid over the next few years, but the group's performance in the longer term looks less certain. Without a large acquisition it could be difficult to maintain the momentum. Such concerns have yet to be reflected in the shares which are trading on a prospective p/e of 18 and have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index by 35 per cent this year.</p>

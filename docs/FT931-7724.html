			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Example of Bophuthatswana should not be ignored in S Africa Sir, Your editorial ('Buthelezi's role', February 15) welcomes the agreement in outline that has now been reached in South Africa, but it should have drawn attention not only to the importance of Chief Buthelezi but to the role of Bophuthatswana. The way to unlock the potential of South Africa's complex multi-ethnic and linguistic society will be via a federal structure. We say such a federation must ensure strong regional freedoms, simply to survive, with power flowing from the bottom up, not from the top down. Bophuthatswana will play a key role. Your Johannesburg correspondent, Patti Waldmeir, gave a useful summary (February 2) of Bophuthatswana's prospects in the 'new South Africa'. Waldmeir points out that economic growth 'has exceeded that in almost every other independent African country', adding, 'on a continent which scarcely distinguishes itself by the quality of economic management, Bophuthatswana clearly excels'. Our inward investors like Pilkington, ICI, BMW, Siemens and a large active community of skilled foreigners speaks for itself. Standard and Poor's on Wall Street has given us its top three-star credit rating - a rare achievement in the developing world. Government revenues have doubled every six years, no less, with rates of taxation coming down. On the political front, President Mangope's elected government has insisted on the right of individuals to decide their own future at the ballot box and not to be coerced by intimidation into supporting ANC 'liberation' politics. The Tswanas have a lot to lose from reincorporation into South Africa, not only in material terms, as your correspondent observed, but quite possibly in political terms too. To them, 'freedom for the people' rhetoric has a hollow ring, since they've lived in their own non-racial democracy for over 15 years. Like their Tswana relatives in Botswana, this is one of the few true democratic societies in Africa. The ANC's none-too-subtle political agenda in Bophuthatswana has been equally clear: to destabilise all official institutions by means of intimidation, violence and arson. The objective: to bring the authorities 'to their knees' (in their words). Anthony McCall-Judson, head of public affairs, Bophuthatswana London Office, 33-37 Regent Street, London SW1</p>

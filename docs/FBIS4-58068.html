			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the Higher Committee of the </F> Yemeni Reform Grouping; place and date not given]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Praised be God who said: And fear the trial which affecteth not  in particular only those of you who do wrong. [koranic verse]  God's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all  his family and companions.    Our people were celebrating the first anniversary of the 27  April 1993 elections -- which were viewed by all as a solution  to the crises and problems witnessed by our country throughout  the transitional period and as the beginning of a new stage of  stability and development -- when evil elements that feed on  crises and problems, that do not wish our country and people  well, and that do not want security and stability moved to sow  sedition among the sons of the one Yemeni people, triggering  violent clashes among the comrades-in-arms in the 'Imran camp.  As a result, a large number of our sons and brothers --  officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces and innocent citizens  -- were martyred or wounded and military vehicles and hardware  were destroyed for no reason except the desire of certain party  leaders to escalate the political crisis that has been going on  for about nine months. This crisis has adversely affected all  the political, economic, and security aspects of life. It harmed  the citizens and gravely affected their lives for the sake of  realizing parochial partisan interests devoid of any sense of  national responsibility or care for the homeland's unity,  sovereignty, and stability.    While expressing its extreme regret, sorrow, and  condemnation  of what happened at the 'Imran camp, the Higher Committee of the  Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to extend its sincere  condolences to the families of the martyrs who fell in this  criminal incident, and to all members of the patient Yemeni  people everywhere who lost brave sons whom they prepared to  defend Yemen and its sovereignty and independence and not to  realize parochial wishes and interests. It also beseeches  Almighty God to encompass them with His grace, grant their  relatives and families patience and consolation, and ensure the  speedy recovery of the wounded.    Out of its religious and national responsibility, out of its  care for the blood of the sons of the one unified Yemen, and out  of its desire to maintain unity, the Higher Committee of the  Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to emphasize what it has  already announced and demanded: The Armed Forces must be away  from party conflicts and the neutrality of this national  institution must be maintained. It must be considers the  property of the entire Yemeni people and not a single party.  The Armed Forces should not be used to achieve partisan aims  and purposes. The Reform Grouping also stresses the need to  rebuild, unite, and merge the Armed Forces according to national  principles so that they become the forces of the one united  Yemeni people and be loyal to God only. Their task should be  that of protecting the homeland and defending its sovereignty,  independence, security, and stability.    The Reform Grouping also calls on the competent quarters to  expedite investigations into what happened, identify those  responsible, and send those parties to the judiciary for  judgment. The results should be announced to the people so that  the truth will be known and the public can be reassured about  the situation. It also calls on every individual and group to  rise up to the level of their responsibility, exercise  self-restraint, resort to reason, spare the Yemeni people's  blood everywhere, adopt dialogue, and avoid the use of force to  resolve conflicts. It appeals to the sons of the Armed Forces  in particular and the Yemeni people in general to be alert and  cautious, not to be dragged in by those who want to implicate  them in armed conflict for personal gains, and to confront  anyone who tries to harm Yemen or threaten its unity.    The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends  its thanks and appreciation to the honorable tribesmen for their  sense of responsibility and their rejection of oneupmanship and  calls aimed at disrupting their unity. Even those whose  difficult circumstances forced them to adopt some wrong  positions soon discovered the plans aimed at embroiling them  into actions in which neither they nor their homeland had any  interest.    Proceeding from its sense of responsibility before God and  out of its loyalty to the people and its concern for Yemeni  unity, and in an effort to spare the blood of the Yemeni people,  the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping calls on the  coalition leadership to meet as soon as possible to examine the  situation, avert further deterioration, achieve security and  stability, maintain the new democratic experiment, respect the  nation's will, and end the suffering of the citizens. It  considers the coalition government leadership primarily  responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the  coalition document and the coalition government program, which  was approved by the House of Representatives. It is also  responsible for the implementation of the pledge and accord  document, which was approved by the Political Forces Dialogue  Committee and signed on 10 Ramadan, 20 February 1994, in Amman.  May God keep Yemen united, ward off any harm to its people,  unite hearts along the path of good and right, and grant us  success. He has power over all things.    [Signed] The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping</p>

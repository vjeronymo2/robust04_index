			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: The high price of social cohesion - Could lower wages for the unskilled speed job creation in Europe Europe's labour market stands accused. The high cost and low flexibility of European workers have, it is alleged, seriously impaired the competitiveness of European business. The charge sheet boils down to two propositions: imports from low-wage developing countries are undercutting the products of high-wage European manufacturers of medium and low-tech goods; while inflexibility and failures in training and education systems are leaving European countries ill-equipped to keep abreast of America and Japan in future high-tech products. The consequences, the argument goes, have been slow employment growth and rising wage inequality, alongside high and persistent unemployment. The underlying fear is European companies will be able to compete in increasingly competitive world markets only by shedding more and more labour, compounding unemployment, or by forcing down European wages and thus living standards. There is some truth in these charges. But some of these trends affect the labour markets of all advanced economies. Barriers to global trade, for example, are continuing to fall for everyone as the technologically sophisticated workforce of the world grows rapidly. There are now no more than 600m literate workers in the world able to operate complex manufacturing equipment, but in the next 20 years the figure could rise to more than 3bn. World adult literacy, says the United Nations, has increased from 15 per cent in 1953 to more than 60 per cent. The effects of this trend, however, can be exaggerated. So far at least, developing country trade is too small to have significant negative effects on wages and employment in developed countries - the formers' exports account for only 3.1 per cent of total manufacturing consumption in developed countries. Only 5 per cent of EU industrial workers are employed in sectors which export more than 40 per cent of their output, and only 7 per cent of European GDP is accounted for by imports. Trade penetration will undoubtedly grow. But, for all advanced economies, more important in undermining the employment of the unskilled is the shift towards more sophisticated technology, leading to the employment in manufacturing of fewer, better educated workers. What matters for the competitiveness of European business and living standards is the speed and ease with which wage-setting behaviour and worker flexibility allow European companies to adjust to changing technology and international competition. Europe's recent record does not inspire confidence in its capacity to change. Over the past 20 years Europe has had higher unemployment and lower private sector job creation than the US and Japan and a poorer record at adapting to external shocks, such as the oil price rises. Labour costs are, on average, higher than in most other parts of the world, though average hourly wage costs are now below Japan (in USDollars terms). Moreover, European wage costs increased by 4 per cent per year in the 1980s against no increase in America and very little in Japan. But the picture is not overwhelmingly gloomy. European labour productivity (output per person-hour) has been rising at 2 per cent a year since 1979 in the economy as a whole. This is slower than Japan's but way ahead of the US where employment creation in the service sector has held productivity growth to  1/2 per cent. In manufacturing, Europe has at least kept pace with the US. Also, in the sophisticated goods that dominate world trade, labour costs can be small. In the UK computer industry, for example, wage costs are only 15 per cent of production costs. And the recent trend has been towards wage restraint in Europe. In Italy the scala mobile, which linked wages to prices, has ended and even Germany is trimming fringe benefits. Companies, especially those in high value-added sectors, often say labour costs are not high on the list of factors affecting European competitiveness. A private report on jobs and competitiveness by a group of mainly US multinationals for the European Commission says companies manufacture in Europe to be close to markets. Job cuts, it adds, are coming from technical advances and organisational change, not primarily because of low-cost competition. Companies opening plants in Asia are doing so for the same reason US multinationals want to be in Europe - to be close to markets. US computer giant IBM even says the move into eastern Europe and Asia will create managerial and logistical jobs in western Europe, at least short-term. What the companies do complain about in Europe is lack of flexibility. Limitations on working time, restrictions on using temporary and part-time workers, and inflexible redundancy laws are the main complaints There has been a general drift towards deregulation in European labour markets over the past 10 years, but Britain is still far ahead in terms of ease of firing and lack of regulation on wage setting, employee consultation and working time. Now the low-wage southern European economies, such as Spain, are trying to loosen up. Some have inherited highly protected product markets which have allowed a jobs-for-life culture, reinforced by the lack of a proper state-funded unemployment benefit system. In Spain nearly 40 per cent of the working population are on temporary contracts because of the difficulty of firing people on standard contracts. Few Europeans want to emulate the US, where about two-thirds of workers are subject to instant dismissal. And there is evidence that short job tenure reduces the likelihood of decent training, while job insecurity reduces workers' commitment. So a balance is needed between flexibility and secure employment, at least for high-skill, high-wage workers. From an employment and a competitiveness point of view the pool of skilled workers must become as large as possible. These 'core' workers need sound basic education and the opportunity to invest and re-invest in relevant workplace skills, if only so as to be able to take them elsewhere. Most European countries' record on basic education and training is superior to the US, and there has been a sharp increase in the numbers staying on at school in Spain, Italy, France and Britain. But European basic education compares far less well with Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. And only about 30 per cent of young Europeans go into higher education, against nearly 70 per cent of young Americans. The problem is that the core will never embrace all workers, and for those outside that core Europe has provided fewer jobs than the US and Japan. In those countries there are more jobs of the sort that anyone can do. This is because their wages are lower and because the wage floor determined by minimum wages and welfare benefits - about 40 per cent of average incomes in most European countries - is less generous. Real wages in Europe have risen in the past decade even for the bottom decile, while in the US they have fallen sharply for the poorest workers. That is one reason why between 1970 and 1992, when the US and EC economies grew by similar percentages, US employment rose 45 per cent and EC employment only 7 per cent. Europe thus faces a dilemma: the fall in the real wages of the unskilled, which the US experience suggests is needed to speed employment creation, would mean wider income inequality than most governments will tolerate in a continent claiming to value social cohesion as well as competitiveness. The challenge is to find ways of supporting low wage households which speed job creation rather than compound the poverty and unemployment traps which already exist in many European countries.</p>

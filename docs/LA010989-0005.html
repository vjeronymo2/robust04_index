			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CUP COMMERCIALIZATION HEADED FOR THE ASHCAN  </P> <P> Dennis Conner won the big boat race, but New Zealander Michael Fay triumphed in  the battle of one-upmanship when Conner's catamaran displayed the Marlboro logo  as one of his corporate sponsors.  </P> <P> Fay countered by hosting a sail on his boat with a huge surgeon-general's  warning. Conner, after all, had done charity work for the American Cancer  Society and poses as an apostle of the healthy life style.  </P> <P> Nasty, nasty words were muttered toward the San Diego skipper -- words like  hypocrite and money-grubber.  </P> <P> It didn't help that the Marlboro logo was also emblazoned on the marking buoys,  the press center, Sail America stationery and clothing and the pontoons of a  large TV screen floating off Seaport Village.  </P> <P> Things have changed.  </P> <P> The agreement announced Friday between the San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail  America Foundation to govern the 1991 America's Cup races off San Diego says  that, unless Marlboro mounts and wins a legal challenge, there will be no ads  for tobacco products on anything under the control of the America's Cup  Organizing Committee, such as the buoys, press center, etc.  </P> <P> The issue of Conner's controversial sail was not addressed directly. But the  agreement says that advertising on sails will be allowed only with the consent  of the ACOC and the challenger.  </P> <P> Inescapable conclusion: The next America's Cup, sails and all, will be  smoke-free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working With a Net  </P> <P> Anne Boe, the Encinitas-based guru of upward mobility, will have her first book  out soon: "Is Your Net-Working?" co-written with Dr. Bettie Youngs of Solana  Beach. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons of New York, available in bookstores  later this month.  </P> <P> Boe, the former placement director at Grossmont College, preaches the gospel of  success through "working smarter, not harder." Sample chapter of her book:  "Quid Pro Quo (Or, How Useful Are You to Someone Else?)"  </P> <P> "You've got to be prepared," Boe says. "You've got to know what. But you've  also got to know who, and what are the power bases, and what are the means of  internal communication."  </P> <P> Along with writing, Boe is also in demand as a keynote speaker. She's spoken  recently to conventions of the Tupperware Jubilees, the multilevel Marketing  International Assn., Meeting Planners International and the Council of  Logistics Management.  </P> <P> "Networking is the business tool of the 1990s if you want to keep the  competitive edge," Boe says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hospital's Liquid Asset  </P> <P> When talk-show hostess Oprah Winfrey went public last November about how she  lost 67 pounds, the phone started to ring at Tri-City Medical Center in  Oceanside. And ring and ring.  </P> <P> "We had hundreds of calls," says hospital official Jennifer Velez. People  wanted the same program as Oprah.  </P> <P> Tri-City is the only North County hospital with the Optifast liquid diet  program used by Oprah. It combines exercise, nutrition education and counseling  to provide the willpower necessary for weight reduction.  </P> <P> The Oprah-boost was so big that Tri-City, starting next week, will offer a  scaled-down version called Optilite, a 16-week, $1,495 program for people who  need to lose 20 to 40 pounds. Officials have also hunkered down for another  siege of phone calls, because Oprah has just gone on the interview circuit --  "PM Magazine," "Entertainment Tonight," etc. -- with her tale of tonnage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep It Brief  </P> <P> The term legal brief is a misnomer. As any judge will tell you, most of them  are anything but brief and instead ramble on for pages and pages, sometimes  through arguments unfathomable to anyone but the author.  </P> <P> So the federal judges in San Diego voted last week to establish a  "less-is-more" policy: No brief in a civil case can exceed 25 pages, without  special consent of the judge. And the reason for requesting an extension had  better be very persuasive. One jurist suggested:  </P> <P> "Maybe we should just tell the attorneys: You can write as long as you want,  but we stop reading after 25 pages."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZONING PROPOSAL IN BELL GARDENS STIRS APARTMENT UPROAR;  </P> <P> PLANNING: CHANGES ARE RECOMMENDED THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY CURB MULTIUNIT  BUILDINGS AND A HAPHAZARD MIX OF COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND RESIDENTIAL USES.  </P> <P> Hundreds of residents are fuming over a city Planning Commission decision to  recommend major zoning changes that could force some property owners eventually  to give up their homes or businesses.  </P> <P> Some residents threatened a bid to recall of the entire City Council unless it  rejects the Planning Commission's recommendation.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, after a raucous six-hour meeting, the five planning  commissioners voted unanimously to recommend adoption of the zoning changes  that would drastically reduce the number of apartment buildings. The changes  also would eradicate the haphazard mix of commercial, industrial and  residential uses in neighborhoods throughout the city.  </P> <P> The final decision must be made by the City Council, which is expected to  discuss the issue sometime in December or January. In the meantime, city  officials are planning to hold several neighborhood meetings to explain the  zoning changes, which would allow property owners 20 to 40 years to comply.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission's decision triggered howls of outrage from the  estimated 400 residents and business owners who packed a city auditorium a week  ago.  </P> <P> "Recall, recall, recall," about 100 people began chanting as they swarmed  toward the stage where the planning commissioners sat.  </P> <P> "I hope this never happens to your grandchildren," a young girl said quietly to  commission Chairwoman Maria Elena Alvarez, as Alvarez gathered her papers and  prepared to leave the auditorium.  </P> <P> City leaders say that, in the long run, the proposed changes will make Bell  Gardens a more desirable place to live -- a city with less people, less  traffic, better shopping areas and better services such as police and fire  protection.  </P> <P> But many residents and business owners say they believe Bell Gardens is fine  the way it is. Residents say the council wants to turn back the clock to a time  when this was a quiet suburb of middle-class property owners even if it means  driving out the current residents to do it.  </P> <P> By the latest census count, about 42,000 people live in Bell Gardens. Most are  renters, and according to county data, the average per capita income is $5,405  a year.  </P> <P> "They don't care about us," said 19-year resident Zandra Juarez. "They are  trying to run the poor people out of here and turn this into a Beverly Hills."  </P> <P> City officials said they are not picking on certain residents and are not  trying to drive anyone out of town. Council members Douglas O'Leary and Robert  Cunningham, as well as Planning Commission Chairwoman Alvarez, would be  affected. Both O'Leary and Cunningham live in high-density areas that would  become low-density areas. Cunningham said he eventually would have to convert  or get rid of one of the houses on his property, and stands to lose $40,000.  Alvarez's residence would be in a commercial zone.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible thing to go through," Alvarez said. "My two children were born  and raised in that home. We own it. We put a lot of money into it. But at the  same time, we have to think of the future of the city. We can't have a home in  a commercial area."  </P> <P> At the meeting last week, Alvarez told a hostile and impatient audience that  the commission members had mulled over the changes thoroughly, and "have been  troubled by it." But residents said they felt that the Planning Commission had  made its decision long before they sat down at the meeting last week.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter what we say," one irate resident shouted at Alvarez. "It's  what you guys want."  </P> <P> City officials have been planning for years to reduce the city's density, and  clean up the mix of houses, businesses and industry in some neighborhoods.  </P> <P> According to the latest statistics from the county Department of Regional  Planning, Bell Gardens is the fifth most crowded city in the county, with  15,700 residents per square mile. The city is approximately 2.4 square miles.  </P> <P> City Manager Claude Booker said the high density leads to more crime and  overcrowded conditions, and strains the city's water and sewer systems.  </P> <P> In 1987, the city amended its General Plan -- its map of what the city should  be like in years to come -- to include goals of reducing density, consolidating  shopping areas, and ending mixed zoning that allowed businesses and homes to  sit side by side, Booker said. According to state law, the city must now bring  its zoning code in line with the General Plan.  </P> <P> Although city officials could change the General Plan, Booker said, "That is  not an option." He said numerous city studies have concluded that density must  be decreased.  </P> <P> People who live in the areas earmarked for zoning revisions would have 20 to 40  years to either move or convert the use of their buildings to comply with the  new code. For example, a homeowner whose property would be changed to a  commercial zone would have to move or convert the home to an office. A resident  whose property would be changed from high density to lower density zoning could  convert a four-apartment complex to two apartments.  </P> <P> "There is a strong misconception that we are going to tear down homes," Booker  said. "Nothing in the zoning change calls for the destruction of a building."  </P> <P> But some residents observed that if their home is in a zone other than  residential, sooner or later they would have to move.  </P> <P> "I was here before your Police Department was here, before your City Hall was  here. . . . Now you tell me I will have to move," said Maria Pena, a 25-year  resident whose home sits on a parcel planned for commercial development.  </P> <P> Many residents who live in areas targeted for zone changes other than  residential complained that they had spent their lives saving money to buy  their homes, and now they will have to give them up without compensation. They  also said they feared their property would decline drastically in value.  </P> <P> Most of the changes would affect high-density housing where there is one unit  per 2,600 square feet. If the changes are adopted, about 70% of these  apartments eventually would be eliminated.  </P> <P> Landlords told the Planning Commission that if they were forced to reduce the  number of apartments on their lots, rents would be raised. Tenants complained  that affordable rental units would disappear in Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> "What happens to the tenants you force me to kick out?" landlord Ken Quon asked  the commission.  </P> <P> "La calle, la calle (the street, the street)," the audience chanted.  </P> <P> Indeed, city officials admit there is a "price to pay" for the turnaround that  they are attempting in their city. They admit that with less density, and neat,  identifiable industrial, commercial and residential blocks, Bell Gardens will  become a more desirable place to live and property values will go up.  </P> <P> Booker said that if the zoning changes are adopted, all industry eventually  would be on the east side of town, all commercial on the west side, and  high-density residential property, such as apartments, along the main streets.  The neighborhoods behind the apartments would be zoned for single-family  residences and two- or three-unit apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> In 1971, Bell Gardens officials approved their first zoning laws that attempted  to create distinct commercial, industrial and residential areas. The effect of  one of those laws, which requires small neighborhood businesses in residential  areas to give way to residences, is just now being felt. Neighborhood business  operators were given 20 years to either convert their properties or move, and  the deadline is January. Some business owners now contend they were never told  about the January deadline. They also say they have invested time and money in  their businesses, but the city does not have to compensate them for any losses.  </P></p>

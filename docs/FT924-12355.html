			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Maxwell paid fund manager Pounds 50,000: Peer rejects claim that his silence had been bought LORD DONOUGHUE, a former director of London and Bishopsgate Investment Management, received Pounds 50,000 from the late Robert Maxwell after promising not to talk to anyone about the company's affairs after his departure in July 1991. The agreement was signed on October 17 1991, just three weeks before Maxwell's death as he tried to stave off the collapse of his empire. Lord Donoughue, appearing yesterday before the House of Commons select committee on social security, was questioned closely by MPs about his role at the Maxwell-owned fund manager, which managed a portion of the missing Maxwell company pension funds. Lord Donoughue had said he became concerned about stock lending activities at LBI and expressed those concerns to Maxwell, asking for the practice to stop. When he learned that it had not by June 1991 he had 'a dust-up' with Maxwell, shortly after which he resigned. He told MPs he had asked that trustees of the pension schemes be notified of the stock lending - a request Maxwell denied. He said his decision to resign was made months earlier and was not connected with stock lending. Lord Donoughue told MPs he did not report his concerns about stock lending to regulators or the trustees of the pension funds whose securities were being loaned because he knew of nothing illegal or improper about the activities. 'I would have gone if I had known of anything illegal or improper,' he said, although he conceded that stock lending at LBI was 'not conventional'. Mr David Shaw MP asked whether Maxwell had bought his silence. 'In effect, you were paid Pounds 50,000 hush money, weren't you?' During his three years at LBI, Lord Donoughue's total remuneration totalled roughly Pounds 1.5m. Lord Donoughue rejected the suggestion that his silence had been bought, saying such confidentiality clauses were routine in the City. Since Maxwell's death, details of the stock lending activities at LBI and Bishopsgate Investment Management have emerged and have caused consternation in the City. Under questioning from MPs, Lord Donoughue insisted that the stock lending at LBI, later disclosed as the route through which pension fund assets were stolen, did not violate any regulations and was not inconsistent with City practice.</p>

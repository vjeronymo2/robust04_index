			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / BA-USAir decision by Christmas US aviation authorities will make a decision before Christmas on whether to let British Airways acquire a Dollars 750m (Pounds 483.8m) stake in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier. Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary, said yesterday the decision-making process would be an open one. He has instigated a formal 'comment' period, which allows interested parties to submit their views by November 27. Comments in response would then be due by December 11 and Mr Card's ruling would be made by December 24. The department has already received considerable correspondence on the issue  -not least from the 'Big Three' US airlines, which oppose the deal. The correspondence will be placed on public file, and the department has ordered both British Airways and USAir to do the same with information they have already provided to it. The department said the deal 'would result in changes in USAir's operations, financial structure and management', and raised the question of whether the airline would 'continue to operate under the control of US citizens'.</p>

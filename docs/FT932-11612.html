			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Taylor bounces out of Arts Foundation - Simon Tait meets the saviour of Palumbo's baby not a suit with muscles to expel belligerent artists, but a mini-trampoline. 'It's great when you get really angry and frustrated,' says Russell Willis Taylor, the Foundation's director. 'A few bounces and you're ready to go again.' Innovation can arouse great passion, especially when money is involved. 'The value, especially in tough times, is in just doing things in a different way, introducing variables,' she says, 'and sometimes it's hard to get that across.' In rescuing Lord Palumbo's Foundation from an embarrassing shambles, Taylor has reshaped it and given it policy, aim and credibility in less than a year, and produced a scheme which might change arts patronage fundamentally. But most frustrating for her is that she will not be around to give out the fruits she has laboured to produce. She leaves the job today and flies to Singapore tomorrow on a posting with her husband, an advertising executive. Her successor was appointed only on Monday. It will be up to Prudence Skeene  -well known in the arts community for her management and fund raising work with the English Shakespeare Company, Ballet Rambert and the National Theatre, and as chairman of the Arts Council's dance panel  - to implement the Taylor system, in which artists nominate the emerging talents for patronage. Two years ago the Arts Foundation, financed by an anonymous bequest of Pounds 1.1m to the Arts Council, was launched by the Council's chairman, Lord Palumbo, to support new art with lavish - and, some said, unseemly - hubris at a party in London's Docklands. The worthy purpose was obscured by the airy flashiness. No need to apply, the Foundation would know where the money was most needed. Pundits unfairly accused Palumbo of hijacking the bequest (made with conditions) and dismissed the Foundation as confused, remote and a slight to the Arts Council. Stephen Bayley, the first director - who had founded the Design Museum for Terence Conran - declared that the Foundation would raise Pounds 20m from private patronage, would revive the salons des refusees with an exhibition of work rejected by establishment institutions, create facilities such as a recording studio and a gallery 'to break the cartel of the art trade', make a television programme about patronage, even found a record label. None of it happened, and very little money was raised by the Foundation, which was run from Bayley's consultancy. Some grants went out, though, for example for the resurrection of a prize for new books about the performing arts. But after six months Bayley went and Palumbo and his trustees took another six months to find Taylor. She had been hugely successful raising money for English National Opera, probably as much as Pounds 3m, and had won ABSA's Garrett Award for it. 'I thought the same as everybody else did about the Foundation, but Peter (Palumbo) changed my mind. He really believes in it, and I wouldn't have dreamed of moving if I hadn't thought it was so damned important to have this working,' says Taylor, American born and educated. 'The process of giving money has become political despite the best efforts of everybody, and it's right we should be outside that system.' What she did from her appointment last June ought to be a case study for every arts management course. The money, she decided, was to be for practising artists, whose need was greatest, not organisations or schemes, and at first anyone could ring up and ask for a grant. There were 200 applications a week, varying from a student who wanted a new violin to a man who wanted to build a concert hall. She spent five months researching the needs, the possible and impossible, and devising strategy. She asked 65 foundations in America what they thought the likely response would be to a series of small advertisements placed in local newspapers inviting applications with a three month deadline: the estimates ranged from 4,000 to 20,000 applications a year, impossible to manage. She decided to foster patronage within the arts community. Now, dotted around the UK are 40-odd voluntary nominators, practising established artists, who will suggest to emergent artists that they apply for a grant. No one else can nominate. Applications are then screened by an advisory committee and the eventual list is passed to the trustees for a final decision. The first fellowships will be announced in November. Last December Taylor took her portfolio to the trustees - Palumbo; Terence Donovan, the photographer; Bill Brown, chairman of the Scottish Arts Council; his Welsh opposite number Mathew Prichard; and Ed Victor, the literary agent. 'It was a long session. They took it apart, put it back together again, and eventually decided it was what they should have been doing from the start.' The Foundation has a modest Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 80,000 a year to spend, depending on interest rates, and this year there will be six fellowships of Pounds 12,500 each. The subjects include sculpture, ceramics, photography, poetry, playwrighting and multi-disciplinary arts as being the most needy areas; next year they will be different, with a new set of nominators. No vigorous fund raising has taken place. 'That's not the most important thing now. What is important is to get the Foundation set up and working properly,' says Taylor. In due course she expects the Foundation to be worth Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m, handing out fellowships up to Pounds 500,000 a year. 'One of the best British gifts is this great tolerance of eccentricity, but somehow you have lost the opportunity to take risks on people,' she says. 'Artists really are struggling to make ends meet and we are trying to buy people time. They will be chosen on the basis of past commitment and future promise. It's not a democratic process, it relies on judgment, taste and risk-taking. I just hate it that someone else is going to do it.'</p>

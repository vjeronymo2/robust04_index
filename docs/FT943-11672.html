			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Nussbaum pressed on Whitewater discussions Former White House legal counsel Mr Bernard Nussbaum denied yesterday that he had tried to persuade Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, not to disqualify himself from jurisdiction over the Arkansas savings and loan institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair. But Mr Nussbaum said he had reminded Mr Altman in February that the Treasury's own lawyers had already determined that there was no 'legal or ethical reason' why Mr Altman should step aside, his longstanding friendship with President Bill Clinton notwithstanding. 'I left it to him to make his own decision,' Mr Nussbaum added. Mr Nussbaum explained that he was particularly concerned about the 'bad precedent' of government officials prematurely excusing themselves from their responsibilities at even the hint of conflict of interest. At precisely the same time, he went on, Ms Ricki Tigert, nominated to run the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was being pressed by Congress to excuse herself from anything even remotely connected with Mr Clinton, whom she had known for years. She has still not been confirmed. The exact nature of the discussions between the White House and Treasury between last September and this February emerged as the focus of Republican questioning during the second day of the House banking committee's hearings on the 'Washington end' of Whitewater, which involves the first family's land and financial dealings in Arkansas. This attention was hardly surprising given a front page article in the New York Times predicting a shake-up in the Treasury high command as a result of internal tensions generated by apparently conflicting recollections of who said what, when and to whom. Mr Altman appears the most vulnerable, though the White House this week expressed confidence in him. But Mr Bentsen, previously above the Whitewater fray, was reported to be displeased with Mr Altman's conduct, while Ms Jean Hansen, the Treasury legal counsel, was portrayed as being increasingly isolated as both Mr Bentsen and Mr Altman disputed her version of contacts between the White House and Treasury. All three are due to testify next week. Mr Nussbaum gave nothing away and repeatedly denied even the suspicions of impropriety. While Democrats on the banking committee, chaired with an iron hand by Congressman Henry Gonzalez, remained supportive, Republicans refined their attacks by the process of having several members yield their allotted five minutes of questioning to Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida, long a leading Whitewater critic. Mr Nussbaum testily denied assertions by Mr McCollum and Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa that he had acted more as the president's personal lawyer than as legal adviser to the office of the presidency. But it would have been a dereliction of the latter duty, he argued, if the White House were not kept abreast of issues which might involve the president, putting it in a better position to respond to inquiries from the media. Thus, last September, it was his duty to know that the affairs of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan, had been referred for possible criminal prosecution to the Justice Department, with at least the chance that Mr Clinton, though not the subject of the referral, could be called as a witness. 'What this involved to me was some possible illegal or improper campaign contributions,' he said. 'Politicians, presidents, congressmen get thousands of contributions. Somebody may have made improper contributions. This is the president and I recognise we may get press inquiries, but this was not. . . a big deal.'</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JARUZELSKI PAYS TRIBUTE TO SLAIN POLES AT KATYN  </P> <P> Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski went to the Katyn Forest on Saturday and  paid tribute to the thousands of Polish army officers killed and buried there  by the Soviet Union's secret police during World War II.  </P> <P> His visit came one day after the Soviet government reversed nearly 50 years of  official denial and admitted committing the massacre. The Soviet Union had long  blamed Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> "The truth was said about Katyn, and the truth is healing the wounds,"  Jaruzelski said in Russian, his voice soft and wavering with emotion.  </P> <P> "Now it will be easier for us to understand each other," he told Soviet  reporters. The Katyn massacre has long been a strain on relations between the  Soviet Union and Poland.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the Polish army at the memorial  site in the forest near the western town of Smolensk as he honored the more  than 4,000 officers killed in 1940 by Stalin's secret police, the Polish PAP  news agency reported.  </P> <P> A "roll call of the dead" was intoned -- a ceremony in which the names of  victims were read, PAP said.  </P> <P> In footage broadcast on Soviet TV's evening newscast "Vremya," Jaruzelski,  wearing a green army overcoat, green scarf and military cap, stood ramrod  straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath of red and white carnations and  laid it in front of a memorial to the dead.  </P> <P> The monument reads in Russian: "To the Polish officers fallen in Katyn."  </P> <P> Polish radio reported Saturday night that the wording on the monument was  changed three days ago, removing the words that blamed Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> PAP added that Jaruzelski wrote in the visitor's book:  </P> <P> "They fought for an independent Poland. They died innocently, far removed from  their families and homeland. They were faithful to Poland and to military honor  until they breathed their last. In tribute and in lasting memory to Polish  officers, victims of the cruel Stalinist crime."  </P> <P> Jaruzelski also went to the town of Lenino in the nearby republic of  Byelorussia and laid wreaths on the graves of Soviet and Polish soldiers at a  memorial there, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union on Friday admitted that the NKVD, Stalin's feared secret  police, was responsible for the murders 49 years ago of the Polish officers who  had been captured at the start of World War II.  </P></p>

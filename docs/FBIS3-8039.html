			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Journalist Martin Leka Sentenced to 18 Months </F> Imprisonment"]    [Text] The newspaper KOHA JONE has paid a costly ransom to  the state. Martin Leka was yesterday sentenced to 18 months  imprisonment, while editor-in-chief Aleksander Frangaj left the  courtroom not guilty. Officer Bashkim Feta's one month in  detention was considered punishment enough and he was released,  while Romeo Licaj, who provided the newspaper with the document  that was considered secret, was sentenced to four years  imprisonment. We have no reason for joy, and can only shed tears  over this insult and humiliation. We have been humiliated  because Martin Leka was pronounced guilty because of the coffees  he drank with the officer Romeo Licaj, because of the car with  the Lezhe license plate that brought the defense minister's  document to the editorial office, and for working in the Lezhe  bank alongside Romeo Licaj's wife.    Martin Leka did not return to the editorial office  yesterday.  He was sent to Tirana prison together with Romeo Licaj as an  accomplice in revealing secrets. The court considered to be a  secret the minister of defense's order for officers to hand in  their personal weapons. According to a decree signed by Adil  Carcani in 1982, the bench considered Safet Zhulali's order to  be a state secret.    Presiding Judge Arben Ristani did not consider the defense's  evidence, but pronounced Martin Leka guilty, considering him as  having encouraged the revelation of a secret. The fact that  Martin Leka drank coffee with Romeo Licaj cannot be either a  legal or a logical argument, still less when Romeo Licaj denied  having talked to Martin Leka about Zhulali's order. They might  have talked about Zhulali's portrait or about NATO membership.  However, the court did not prove this. We therefore say that  Martin Leka was sentenced for unverifiable collaboration on the  basis of speculation. It cannot be proved that Martin Leka  encouraged Romeo Licaj to reveal the secret. We therefore feel  insulted and humiliated by the court's spiteful decision,  because Martin Leka's profession, to which he has devoted his  life and for which he sacrificed his freedom, was ignored. He  was not tried as a journalist. Martin would have agreed to  become a sacrificial lamb for the gods, if he could have  believed that justice would thereby become a god for the  Albanians. However, the facts are otherwise. Martin Leka's  sentences show that for a long time yet the Albanians must mourn  forcibly sacrificed lambs.</p>

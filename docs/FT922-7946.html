			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The TIN market reached 18 1/2 -month highs in the afternoon as the three-months price, having broken Dollars 6,100 a tonne, quickly soared to its next target area above Dollars 6,200. The price reached Dollars 6,240 before dealer selling and profit-taking pared gains. Traders said the rise now appears to have become overdone with punters looking to take profits and the trade keen to hedge at these higher levels. The tightness of nearby delivery dates in ZINC flared again, taking the premium for cash metal over three-month to Dollars 102 a tonne from Dollars 76.25 on Wednesday. New York COTTON futures rallied in active midday dealings. Analysts said that the Russian trade mission had reportedly purchased US cotton for the Moscow area mills. London COCOA ended the day generally easier after the market encountered another batch of origin selling from the Ivory Coast which quickly eroded morning gains. 'The origins can't leave the market alone at the moment, but the problem is many people just aren't buying,' one dealer said. GOLD moved ahead on the London bullion market on early Middle East short-covering and Japanese buying, which drove prices to a high of Dollars 337.75. Compiled from Reuters</p>

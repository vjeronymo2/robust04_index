In their view, Polish-Hungarian friendship can  become an "engine" of cooperation in the Visegrad Group.    After talks today in the Foreign Ministry, Olechowski said  that the excellent Polish-Hungarian political contacts can also  be translated into economic relations. In the near future,  businessmen of both states will prepare a report on  possibilities for expanding economic cooperation.    The Polish and Hungarian foreign ministers also signed an  agreement on cooperation between their departments, including  cooperation between ambassadors of Poland and Hungary in third  countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jon Craig `Exclusive' report on DAILY EXPRESS Poll: "Get </F> Tough On Euro Bullies"]    [Text] Voters want John Major to take a tough stand  against power-hungry Brussels, a DAILY EXPRESS poll reveals  today.    They are looking to the Premier to block Euro moves aimed at  bullying Britain into a single currency and greater integration.    And in a glimmer of light for the Tories, the survey  suggests  they will lose 13 of their 32 Euro-seats on June 9, nothing like  as bad as the party's worst fears.    There is also a personal boost for Mr Major. Fifty-seven per  cent of Conservative supporters want him to stay as Prime  Minister even if the Tories are hammered. Only 38 per cent say  he should go. Labour are on course next month to win 61 seats,  up from 46, and the Liberal Democrats three, their first ever in  Strasbourg.    Voting intentions for the Euro-poll are Labour 46 per cent,  Tory 27 per cent, Liberal Democrats 22 per cent and others five  per cent.    If there was a general election Labour would collect 48 per  cent, the Tories 26 per cent, Lib-Dems 23 per cent And others  four per cent.    The poll, carried out by ICM [International Communications  and Marketing Research] coincides with the launch of election  manifestos by the three main political parties in London today.    Last night Mr Major underlined how polarised they will be in  the campaign, with the Tories increasingly Euro-sceptic and  Labour and the Liberal Democrats pro-federal.    In a letter to voters in key constituencies, he declared:  "Some people say, `Does it matter who runs the European  parliament?' Yes, it does and now more than ever before."    He pointed out MEPs [members of the European Parliament]  would have a say in choosing a successor to Commission president  Jacques Delors and had new powers to make laws. "By voting  Conservative you will be voting for a strong Britain in a strong  Europe," said the Prime Minister. "And what will you be saying  if you vote Labour or Liberal?    "You will be saying you are in favour of a United States of  Europe. You will want more powers to pass to Brussels."    Launching the Lib-Dem manifesto, Paddy Ashdown said: "We  want a Europe which provides practical opportunities or people,  not grand theories for politicians.    "We won't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for  Britain's sake."    His party's document says: "We want a European Union [EU]  which is democratic, decentralised and diverse, a federal Europe  that works for Britain."    Worryingly for the Tories, four out of five voters say  domestic politics rather than Euro issues will influence how  they vote.    Among Conservative voters who want a new leader 46 per cent  favour Michael Heseltine, 24 per cent Kenneth Clarke, 17 per  cent Michael Portillo, seven per cent Virginia Bottomley and six  per cent Michael Howard.    The poll suggests that a new Prime Minister could cut  Labour's 22-point lead over the Tories in a general election to  14 points.    Under a new Tory leader, Labour would poll 46 per cent, the  Tories 32 per cent, Lib-Dems 19 per cent.    The ICM survey was taken among more than 1,019 voters in 52  constituencies last week, after the death of Labour leader John  Smith.    Though it predicts the Conservatives holding only 19 Euro  seats, it suggests they could reduce their losses if they can  get their supporters out during the campain.    Two-thirds of those determined to vote but still undecided,  voted Tory in the 1992 general election and two-thirds of those  live in Conservative-held seats.    But if all the don't knows stay at home or vote Labour or  Lib- Dem, the Tories could be annihilated, holding only 11  seats. Asked what would be the most important influence on how  they would vote, 79 per cent said the political situation in  Britain and only 14 per cent Europe.    When ICM asked voters which party best represents Britain in  the EU, 37 per cent said Labour, 27 per cent Conservative and 15  per cent the Liberal Democrats.    Fifty-nine per cent of all voters want Mr Major replaced if  there is a Tory election disaster next month.    But although 52 per cent said he should regard the polls as  a  verdict on him as Premier, the figure was only 42 per cent among  Tory supporters.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday played down Tory  divisions on Europe and promised a positive manifesto message.    The twofold theme of the Conservative campaign will be Put  Jobs First, highlighting opposition to the social chapter and  Keep The Veto, a pledge to fight Britain's corner in Europe.</p>

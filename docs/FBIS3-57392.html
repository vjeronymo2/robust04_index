He told Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Bishkek  on  Tuesday that a program was being drawn up to stabilize the  position of Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking population, the aim of  which was to reduce Russian speakers' emigration from the  republic. One of the objectives of the program is to prevent  attempts to cut down the teaching of Russian, a language used in  contacts between different CIS states, Akayev said. As an  example of support given to Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking  community, he cited the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, set  up last year. It has 200 students at present and is expected to  have about 1000 in future. The creation of the university  "ought to reassure the Kyrgyz Slavs, whose children can receive  an education in their native language," the president said.    It is only jointly with Russia that Kyrgyzstan is able to  solve the problems of its Russian-speakers, he said. "We can  solve the psychological problems and create a favorable  atmosphere, but it would be difficult for Kyrgyzstan to handle  the economic aspects of the problem on its own," he said.    Akayev said Kyrgyz enterprises were short of raw materials  and components, while the customs barriers and dual taxation  raised the cost of their output tenfold. However, not only  Kyrgyzstan and Russia but also other Commonwealth states needed  goods produced by those enterprises, he said. He expressed the  hope that the visit of Kozyrev, who arrived in Bishkek on  Monday, would help solve some of those problems, which would  have a serious positive effect on Kyrgyzstan's industry, where  many of the republic's Russian speakers are employed.    The president said Kyrgyzstan's former military enterprises  should have the same access to raw materials as such enterprises  in Russia. "This won't be a one-way street. Let Russia own  many of the shares in Kyrgyz enterprises. Thereby we will keep  those enterprises going, providing work for tens of thousands of  people," he said. It will also strengthen "the Slavs'  confidence in their future," he said.    Kozyrev handed over to Akayev a letter from Russian  President  Boris Yeltsin, who expressed support for the comprehensive  stabilization program for Kyrgyzstan's Russian speakers, work on  which was being guided by Akayev. Russia is ready "to continue  helping fraternal Kyrgyzstan economically as much as it can,"  Yeltsin said.    Kozyrev told Akayev Kyrgyzstan was one of Russia's closest  allies. "I've always said that we are not indifferent to each  other, although these days I'm accused of imperialism for such  words. What can be more normal than saying that we are vitally  interested in each other," he said.    "We, the people of Kyrgyzstan, are only too glad to hear  that," Akayev responded.    Kozyrev said Russia's attempts to protect the  Russian-speaking population in other former Soviet republics had  nothing to do with imperialism. But "we cannot remain  indifferent to restrictions put on the rights of Russian  speakers, who are, for example, being ousted from Latvia," he  said.    Akayev said he could trace no imperial ambitions in Russia's  foreign policy. "Eurasia cannot be stable without a powerful and  great Russia," he said.    According to Kyrgyz Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Aitmatov,  the Russian speakers' position in Kyrgyzstan does pose a  problem. "It is a fact that there are certain things the  (ethnic) Russian are concerned about. But at the governmental  level everything is being done to eliminate the causes of that  concern and ensure equal rights for the Russian-speaking  population, as for all other citizens of Kyrgyzstan," he told  INTERFAX.    In his opinion, the dual citizenship issue should be put  before parliament.    However, Akayev, addressing the First Congress of Peoples of  Kyrgyzstan last Saturday, said dual citizenship could be granted  to residents of the republic on the basis of bilateral  agreements and the right to it should not be formalized in the  Constitution. He said all decisions on the issue would be  determined by Russia's role as Kyrgyzstan's "main partner in all  spheres." Earlier Akayev's press service said work on the dual  citizenship problem would be "a constitutional process," not "an  arbitrary decision by the president."</p>

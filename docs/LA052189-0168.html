			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAFFIC SIGNALS TO BE IMPROVED  </P> <P> Traffic signals on one of the busiest stretches of Pacific Coast Highway and  Sepulveda Boulevard in the South Bay will be synchronized and upgraded in a  $1.3-million project scheduled for this fall.  </P> <P> Improvements aimed at relieving congestion along the 2.2-mile segment will be  made from Rosecrans Avenue in Manhattan Beach to Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach.  They include a new double left-turn lane on southbound Sepulveda Boulevard at  Manhattan Beach Boulevard and the installation of a green left-turn arrow on  Sepulveda at 2nd Street in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> In another project approved by the California Transportation Commission last  week, changes will be made in the San Diego Freeway interchange at Rosecrans  Avenue in Hawthorne to reduce congestion and accidents, officials said. The  $412,000 project, scheduled for this fall, will eliminate the off-ramp from the  freeway to westbound Rosecrans and widen the off-ramp to eastbound Rosecrans to  include a left-turn lane onto westbound Rosecrans.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Outsider to run accounts firm Robson Rhodes, the UK's 15th-largest accountancy firm, yesterday appointed a businessman as its chief operating officer. Mr Peter Turnbull, former managing director of Lex Service, the largest UK car distribution and leasing group, will be operational head of the firm. The move is a highly unusual example of the appointment of an outsider to help manage the running of a professional practice. Although Mr Turnbull qualified as an accountant, most senior positions in accountancy firms are filled from within by accountants who have spent their careers in public practice. A number of firms have hired specialist outsiders in areas such as marketing and human resources, but few have made appointments at such a senior level. Robson Rhodes itself hired Mr Ray Pierce, former head of the Mortgage Corporation, as chief executive two years ago. He left last September when he was headhunted to become managing director of Guardian Direct, an insurance subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange. Mr Turnbull qualified as a chartered accountant in 1967 and spent 20 years working for Lex Service as group finance director and chief executive of Volvo Concessionaires before becoming chief executive of APA Group, an automotive consultancy. Robson Rhodes said that Mr Turnbull would be responsible for implementing the firm's strategy to meet its goals.</p>

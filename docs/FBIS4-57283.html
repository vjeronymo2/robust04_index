			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares will retain the  Institutional Protection Service [SPI] and will promote its  professionalization.    As the president-elect sees it, it is important to insist on  a coalition government. This is what he hinted when he learned  of the Arnulfist's decision to reject two ministries he offered  to them.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] My offer was not an  intention to create political slots, but an intention to create  agreements, affinity, and to have the best men and women in the  country for national projects. [end recording]    Perez Balladares said that the Legislative Assembly must  approve the designation of the new comptroller general from a  list of nominees he will submit when he takes over the  government in September.    The president-elect was also asked about the future of the  SPI.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I think that all  presidential offices in all countries must have a protection  service for people and institutions. I think this service must  be professional, apolitical, and capable of fulfilling its  functions. If I find these characteristics in the SPI, it will  continue functioning exactly as it functions now. [end recording]    Perez Balladares said that he has a special office to answer  the grievances of public employees who have been unjustly  dismissed. He flatly rejected the possibility of an Arnulfist  becoming president of the Legislative Assembly in September.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe that the  legislative branch will have to make its own decisions, and I  highly respect that. However, seeing how the Assembly is taking  shape, I think that it will be presided over by the party that  has obtained the most votes, and that is us. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for  the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], said today that the  people will vote en masse for his party, with or without an  alliance against the PRD. Our correspondent Fernando Fernandez  has the report:    [Begin recording] [Fernandez] Ernesto Perez Balladares,  candidate of the United People alliance, toured several  communities in the western part of Panama. He was greeted by a  large group of supporters and persons vying for electoral posts  in Capira District. Addressing the crowd, the presidential  candidate said the country will return to a people-oriented  government, with the support of all the country's productive  forces, and based on the dynamic of private enterprise to find  the solutions demanded by the people.    [Perez Balladares] We will do so united, without hate,  without revenge, without returning to the past, with a vision of  the future, with a commitment to future generations; a free,  independent, sovereign country, a country where all Panamanians,  regardless of race, color, place of birth, or place of residence  can have, as we say, an opportunity to progress with the support  of a friendly government.    [Fernandez] In his speech, Perez sent a message to all the  presidential candidates.    [Perez Balladares] I want to tell all those hatemongers,  that  they can still climb on the winning bandwagon, because with or  without a cassette [reference to the 14 April video shown by  President Endara on a national television network], with or  without Mireya [Mireya Moscosa de Gruber, Arnulfist Party  presidential candidate], with or without unity, with or without  Eddy [Eduardo Vallarino Arjona, Christian Democratic Party  presidential candidate], with or without Chinchorro [Ruben Dario  Carles, MOLIRENA presidential candidate], the people will have  their say. [applause]    [Fernandez] The caravan then headed for Bejuco, where Perez  Balladares was greeted by supporters of that community. The PRD  presidential candidate said he will make every effort, if  elected, to direct his government's attention to the  agricultural sector and to the most pressing social problems of  Panamanians. The tour, which was under tight security, included  the towns of Chame, Cabuya, and San Carlos District. [end  recording]</p>

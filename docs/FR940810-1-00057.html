			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> One effect of cross-referencing in a Federal program is that if a permanent program rule is revised, the corresponding Federal program rule would be similarly revised. However, the notice of proposed rulemaking would invite comments not only on the proposed rule generally, but also on how it might affect a particular Federal program. If certain changes were needed for a Federal program, then a separate provision would be added to the Federal program regulation that is the counterpart to the permanent program rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several provisions of the permanent program rules are already applicable to all Federal programs because they were promulgated for application to all regulatory programs and therefore need not be cross-referenced here. These provisions are 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter P_Protection of Employees; Part 706&hyph;Restrictions on Financial Interests of Federal Employees; Part 769_Petition Process for Designation of Federal Lands Unsuitable for Surface Coal Mining; Subchapter D_Federal Lands Program; Part 955_Certification of Blasters in Federal Program States and on Indian lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 6, 1982, OSM published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a proposed Federal program to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal and non-Indian lands in Arizona (47 FR 44194). During the public comment period, OSM was informed by Arizona officials that all known coal reserves in Arizona are located on Indian lands. Based on this information, OSM determined at that time that a Federal program for Arizona for non-Federal and non-Indian lands was not necessary. Therefore, by notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 4, 1983, OSM withdrew its proposal for a Federal program (48 FR 273). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, OSM has determined that a regulatory program in Arizona is needed in the event that coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations should occur on non-Federal and non-Indian lands in Arizona in the future. The State of Arizona has elected not to pursue primacy under a State program at this time. Consequently, pursuant to &sect;504(a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SMCRA, OSM is once again proposing a Federal program in Arizona to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, when promulgating a Federal program for a State, the Secretary is required by Section 504(a) of SMCRA to take into consideration the nature of the terrain, climate, biological, chemical, and other relevant physical conditions of that State. OSM has reviewed the Arizona laws and regulations to determine whether they suggest that special provisions may be necessary or appropriate based on special terrain or other physical conditions in the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Review of State Law <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with its 1982 proposal, OSM reviewed Arizona State statutes to determine which ones provide regulatory requirements for coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations as defined by SMCRA, and to identify provisions that might be either more stringent than or inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA. The more stringent requirements, whether State or Federal, would be adopted for this program by listing in the proposed rules the Arizona State statutes that set different controls and for which compliance is required in the surface coal mining and reclamation operation. Determining whether the State statutes are more stringent than the Federal regulations was done on a case-by-case basis. Citation in the proposed Federal program of State statutes with which compliance is required is not meant as an adoption of those State statutes and regulations for purposes of enforcement by OSM. Citation of such statutes is intended as an aid to persons who must comply with both the Federal program requirements and State statutes. However, if a State law is cited below as interfering with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA, it would be superseded to the extent that it is less stringent than the Federal program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 30 CFR Part 736, OSM has tentatively identified the following statutes and regulations which, in certain circumstances, impose stricter environmental controls than are provided for under SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Section 903.700(e) of the proposed Federal program for Arizona lists the Arizona laws which OSM has tentatively identified as setting more stringent land use and environmental controls for surface mining. The list set forth below is based in part on the list published on October 6, 1982 (47 FR 44194), and may need to be updated in a final rule adopting an Arizona Federal program. Those more stringent Arizona statutes are described and summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Arizona Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture has authority to abate public nuisances including noxious weed seeds. Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) Section 3&hyph;231 to Section 3&hyph;242. Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It is unlawful to injure any bird or harass any bird upon its nest to remove the nests or eggs of any bird without prior authorization of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. A.R.S. Section 17&hyph;236. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A bridge, dam, dike, or causeway may not be constructed over or in a navigable river or other navigable water without the authorization of the Governor. A.R.S. Section 18&hyph;301. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

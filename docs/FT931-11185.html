			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Italy to cut discount rate THE Bank of Italy is to cut its discount rate today from 12 per cent to 11.5 per cent. The move follows publication yesterday of figures showing inflation last month at 4.3 per cent a year, the lowest in more than five years. The discount rate, last cut on December 23, is now down by 3.5 percentage points from the 15 per cent high during September's currency crisis. Nevertheless, real interest rates remain high by EC standards. The January inflation figure compares with 4.8 per cent a year in December and an average of 5.4 per cent for all of 1992. The latest fall reflects the effects of recession and the success of government policies to keep down prices. Ahead of the rate cut the lira slipped to L1,528.86 from L1,517.18 against the dollar yesterday and was virtually static against the D-Mark at L930.25, compared with L930.50, according to the Bank of Italy's indicative rates. In spite of the lira's fall since floating last September, consumer prices have not so far shown the effects of higher import prices. The rate cut had been widely expected and bankers suggested yesterday the Bank of Italy had merely been awaiting developments in the currency markets following the UK interest rate cuts last week and the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt. The commercial banks meanwhile have been strongly criticised by industry for retaining high margins and high interest rates despite lower inflation. The Bank of Italy itself is in the throes of finalising new regulations for commercial banks, reducing the ratio of deposits to be placed as obligatory reserves with the central bank.</p>

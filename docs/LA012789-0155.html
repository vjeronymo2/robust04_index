			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Another group of old Daum-Johnstown employees has missed all the excitement.  They left in 1983 to start Collins Fuller Corp., a Newport Beach-based  commercial broker.  </P> <P> That company said recently that Michael Collins has moved up to president.  </P> <P> He replaces his father and the firm's founder, James E. Collins, who remains  chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> The two executives and in-law Richard H. Fuller now have offices in Los  Angeles, Orange County and the Inland Empire 5 years after leaving Daum, an  old-line broker of industrial buildings founded in 1904.  </P> <P> Daum was bought in 1984 by Johnstown American in Atlanta, which in turn was  acquired by Southmark on one of its spending sprees.  </P> <P> Collins Fuller is one of about a dozen smaller brokerages in Orange County that  are trying to grab business away from big guys like Coldwell Banker and Grubb  &amp; Ellis.  </P> <P> Just as the old Daum Corp. did, the new brokerage specializes in industrial  real estate.  </P> <P> If you're still following all this, it gets even more complicated.  </P> <P> Collins Fuller recently announced that it had hired Daum-Johnstown's former  president, Joseph J. Sojka, to run its new Gardena office.  </P> <P> Sojka left Daum-Johnstown last fall during the broker stampede under  circumstances that the company would not comment on.  </P></p>

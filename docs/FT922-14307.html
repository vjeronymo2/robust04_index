			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Coats Viyella cuts 566 jobs in N Ireland COATS Viyella announced 566 job losses at two of its Northern Ireland plants yesterday. The company is closing its loss-making Peter England Shirt factory at Magherafelt, county Londonderry with the loss of 516 jobs. A further 50 people will be made redundant at the company's Maydown plant in Derry. Coats Viyella, the province's second-largest manufacturing employer, blamed the recession and an influx of cheap imports exacerbated by the weakness of the dollar. It is the second Northern Ireland shirt-making plant closed by Coats in the past year. Some jobs may be saved. Northern Ireland business interests have signalled that they might want to take over part of the Magherafelt operation. Coats said yesterday, however, that the possibility was remote. Intensive negotiations over the past four months involving Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, and senior Industrial Development Board officials failed to secure a definite reprieve for the plant. The Peter England label is a mid-priced product that has been affected by imports. Coats supplies the same brand from outside the UK, largely in the Far East. It will increase sourcing from there to make up any shortfall. The company said it hoped to return its branded shirt business to 'an acceptable level of profitability'. It still makes the more expensive Van Heusen branded shirts in Northern Ireland. Sir David Alliance, Coats' chairman, said the company remained committed to its investments in Northern Ireland and would continue to employ more than 2,700 people in the province. In the past year it had invested or committed itself to invest more than Pounds 5m and it would continue to back profitable projects.</p>

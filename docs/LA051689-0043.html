			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> With a firm date for deployment of Arab League cease-fire observers in Lebanon  still uncertain, diplomats said that hopes of lasting peace rest on next week's  Arab League summit. Although league envoys, in a week of shuttle diplomacy  between Beirut and Damascus, won agreement from all parties on a truce and the  deployment of a 300-member Arab peacekeeping force, diplomats said the force  can't move in because of continued shelling of Christian ports in Lebanon. "The  last-ditch . . . chance is the summit," one diplomat said. "If they (Lebanon's  warring parties) can't come to some meeting of minds, it is hard to see what  can be done after that."  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Mitsotakis retains key cabinet figures GREECE'S prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, yesterday reappointed his economy and foreign ministers hours after sacking his cabinet to clear the way for a reshuffle, Reuter reports from Athens. He renamed Mr Stephanos Manos national economy and finance minister and Mr Mihalis Papaconstantinou foreign minister. Mr Ioannis Varvitsiotis was also reappointed to the defence portfolio. The only surprise in what had been billed as a 'new beginning' was the elevation of his daughter, Ms Dora Bakoyannis, to full ministerial rank in the Culture Ministry. Mr Mitsotakis, 74, sacked his cabinet earlier in the day after a stormy emergency meeting on Tuesday with conservative party deputies in the 300-seat parliament, where his calls for unity went unheeded. Dissident deputies in his conservative New Democracy party have poured criticism on him for several months, saying his austerity programme and alleged foreign policy bungling were steering the party to defeat in elections in 1994. Mitsotakis, who led the conservatives back to power for the first time in a decade in April 1990, has clung precariously to power with a one-seat absolute majority in parliament. His showdown with rebel deputies came in the week when his 1993 budget is being debated in parliament and when Mr Manos must present his plans for economic convergence with other European Community economies. It also comes just before the EC summit in Edinburgh, starting on December 11, where Greece will once again try to shore up support for its campaign to reject recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. All three issues - budget, convergence and recognition - are vital to the survival of the government and the prime minister obviously felt like taking no chances. Other than his daughter's promotion, the only real change was the advancement of a large group of relatively young deputies to junior ministerial ranks. This appeared to be aimed at promoting unity in view of the constant criticism that Mr Mitsotakis is cut off from much of his party and surrounded by a tight political clique and his family.</p>

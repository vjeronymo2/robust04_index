DEBUT  </P> <P> An under-promoted "Celebration of Modern Flamenco and World Music" -- produced  by the ambitious, home-spun Flamenco and World Music Society -- seems to have  had little impact on the local music consciousness, if the almost endearingly  amateurish finale Monday evening at the Wilshire Ebell Concert Hall was any  indication.  </P> <P> But the central figure of the celebration was Rafael Riqueni, a young Spanish  guitarist of truly phenomenal abilities. Though accomplished in distinctly  minor circumstances, his local debut proved a major event artistically.  </P> <P> Riqueni also demonstrated that flamenco nuevo is not entirely lost to fusion  lures. Though certainly no slave to the past, he showed a healthy respect for  the traditional character of forms such as soleares, siguiriyas, bulerias and  fandangos. Though the name and spirit of Paco de Lucia were frequently invoked,  Riqueni's controlled classicism seems to derive more from the influence of Paco  Pena.  </P> <P> He played with uncommon clarity, and his technique reflected the logic of his  well-ordered creations and adaptations of classically influenced predecessors  such as Ramon Montoya.  </P> <P> Riqueni was quite capable of bravura bursts of rhythmic fire, but he also  played with delicacy and finesse, emphasizing supremely articulate tremolo  throughout two sets. Indeed, pieces like his Garrotin -- an almost  Kreisler-esque fantasy of elegant wit -- would not be out of place on a  classical recital.  </P> <P> Fusion trends were much more apparent in the short introductory sets of Alberto  de Almar, the Flamenco and World Music Society impresario who also took tickets  and set up the stage. His playing, heavy and technically forced at times,  peaked interpretively in a Tarantas. He was at his most inventive, however,  when he reduced his guitar to pure percussion.  </P> <P> The leisurely program ended with a single, extended cuadro flamenco ensemble  number. Lea Santos sang "Come, My Love" in English and a husky, fervent  contralto, while the monomial Lourdes took a few tentative dance steps across  the small crowded stage. That effort died when she knocked a microphone into  Riqueni, whose lightning solo leads drove the piece.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> CURTIS SEEKS INQUIRY INTO RECALL ATTEMPT  </P> <P> After months of accusing the Mission Viejo Co. of being the sole sponsor of a  recall campaign against him, City Councilman Robert A. Curtis this week called  for an investigation of the developer by the state Fair Political Practices  Commission.  </P> <P> Curtis claims that the Mission Viejo Co. was the primary source of the $156,000  raised by the Coalition to Recall Councilman Curtis to finance a successful  petition drive this fall. The councilman will face a recall election Feb. 27.  </P> <P> "The Mission Viejo Co. has been calling all the shots," Curtis said. "Any  decent investigation with subpoena power to interview people and to pull  documents will reveal that."  </P> <P> State law requires that any political campaign group receiving "all or nearly  all of its revenue" from a single source must identify that party as a sponsor,  said FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku.  </P> <P> Michioku confirmed that the agency had received Curtis' complaint but declined  to say whether the FPPC would investigate the allegations.  </P> <P> In his letter to FPPC Chairman John H. Larson, dated Dec. 12, Curtis said that  voters "have a right to know that (the coalition) is sponsored by the Mission  Viejo Co."  </P> <P> Representatives of the company and the coalition denied Curtis' charges.  </P> <P> "This is just another desperate allegation on his part," said Helen Monroe,  leader of the recall group which has accused Curtis of improperly trying to  annex Aegean Hills, a 593-acre development just outside Mission Viejo's  borders.  </P> <P> "He obviously feels that other developers are incapable of making a decision by  themselves," she said. "That's an insult to American business."  </P> <P> Wendy Wetzel, a Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman, said the firm has "scrupulously  complied with all campaign-reporting laws and our attorneys will be happy to  discuss any of our (campaign financial) reports with the FPPC."  </P> <P> "We believe Curtis is politicking again to divert attention from his attempt to  annex Aegean Hills without giving Mission Viejo residents a chance to vote,"  she added.  </P> <P> According to Curtis, the Mission Viejo Co. has forced business partners and  subcontractors to contribute to the recall campaign.  </P> <P> "Their donation just becomes a cost of doing business with the Mission Viejo  Co.," he alleged.  </P> <P> Wetzel denied the charge.  </P> <P> "Individual companies make their own decisions," she said.  </P> <P> The action is the third complaint filed with government political watchdogs  against the recall forces.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office is still investigating separate  complaints of campaign violations against the coalition.  </P> <P> One complaint alleges that the coalition misled voters by using a city seal on  campaign mailers.

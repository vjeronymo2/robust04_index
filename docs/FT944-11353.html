			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Special offers Big savings on classy European hotel rooms are possible this winter for customers who investigate the special offers, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. For example, Meridien is offering winter promotional rates at its 11 European hotels from December 1 to March 31: up to 50 per cent off published tariffs. Promotional rates for a night's stay in a single or twin/double room, including taxes and services, range from Dollars 266 in the private Club President section of the Meridien Etoile in Paris to Dollars 102 in Porto and Dollars 73 in Limassol. In London: Dollars 260. Wise travellers know that hotels often offer a limited number of rooms at promotional rates (as in this case), so advance bookings are essential. But try to haggle. The London Meridien in Piccadilly is offering 15 rooms at the special rate, with free access to Champney's Health Club but breakfast excluded. You could ask, in a penetrating voice, why the deal at Club President in Paris includes a free continental breakfast for virtually the same price as London's breakfastless promo. See where it gets you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan  today invited banks from Japan and other countries to open  subsidiaries in China's capital.    In a meeting with Kuniji Miyazaki, chairman of the Daiichi  Kangyo Bank of Japan, Li said that China was now shifting to a  market economy, so it needed to have a variety of means to raise  money.    He said that through mutual exchanges, overseas business  people would certainly enhance their confidence in investing in  China.    "I am optimistic that Japanese banks will open branches in  Beijing," he told Miyazaki and his party.    Kuniji Miyazaki, who visited Beijing two years ago, said  that  during his current visit he wishes to discuss cooperation with  his Chinese colleagues in banking reform.    He said that his bank plans to hold financial symposiums in  Shanghai and in Dalian, Liaoning Province.    "I am sure that China will score even greater achievements  in  its economic construction," he said.    The Daiichi Kangyo Bank, the largest commercial bank in  Japan, had raised a total of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars for China  by the end of 1993.    It currently has a branch in Shanghai and offices in  Beijing,  Dalian, Xiamen and Guangzhou.</p>

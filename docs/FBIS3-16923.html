			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Aleksandr Rutskoy: I Want To Run </F> for President, and Soon"]    [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese KYODO agency has circulated an  interview with Rutskoy through its channels. As the Japanese  would have it, this is well nigh the first policy utterance by  the amnestied bearded leader since his stay in Lefortovo  [Prison].    Rutskoy informs the Japanese that he is ready for the  struggle for the post of Russian president and does not intend  to leave the political arena. The leader notes without false  modesty here that he has sufficient strength and experience to  successfully conduct an election campaign and then lead Russia.  Rutskoy attributes this uncommon self-confidence to the fact  that he is virtually insured against making major political  mistakes in the future because in the past Yeltsin has taught  him clear lessons in a specific discipline: how not to run the  country.    Having received such a valuable "inoculation," the amnestied  figure gave the Japanese to understand that in order to achieve  his aims he intends to form a powerful united patriotic front,  which will be his mainstay in the election and bring him to  power. Judging from his replies his allies in the struggle will  be communists and other patriotic forces whose potential the  leader has to utilize effectively. Rutskoy also called for the  voluntary reunification of former Soviet republics in a new  union, noting the objective need for such integration.    The recent inmate of Leforotovo inveighs against Yeltsin in  strong and varied terms. In addition, Rutskoy curses the West  and the world community as a whole for the support given to the  present Russian president in October last year. Rutskoy  stresses here that he does not consider himself a criminal. On  the contrary, he calls himself a true defender of the law and  constitution and is puzzled as to how foreign observers -- in  whose eyes "those who shot innocent people" are still reformers  -- were unable to discern this.    The former vice president informed the Japanese that he is  currently very busy finishing off his latest book with the  epoch-making title "Ways of Reforming Russia in All Key Areas."    A scientific-sounding title, but judging from the author's  explanations the book, which is due to come out as early as this  summer, will describe not only the mysteries of reform but also  backstage Kremlin intrigues in 1991-1993. Rutskoy promises to  spill the beans about his relations with Yeltsin and to cite  other juicy details from the life of the political elite.    In a short commentary on Rutskoy's written replies, KYODO  indicates the high probability that a Russian presidential  election should be expected not in 1996, when Yeltsin's term of  office officially expires, but before that -- next year or even  at the end of this year.</p>

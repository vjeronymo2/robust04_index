			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: West Side Story - Theatre To see two West Side Stories within a week, and Annie Get Your Gun in between, prompts some reflections on musicals in general. West Side Story no longer looks like the radical breakthrough it seemed when it was first performed in 1957. Indeed it would be perfectly possible to dismiss it now as another piece of American sentimentalism, or to say that it has none of the inventiveness and originality of a much more recent musical: Assassins. The trouble with the latter argument, however, is that the lyrics for both West Side Story and Assassins are by the same man: Stephen Sondheim. The conclusion I draw is that fashions change, and so they they should, but that the basic pattern remains much the same. What seems daring at the start soon becomes conventional. A musical is theatre with song; at its best, it is a marvellous formula which still has a long way to run. None of that is to disparage the performance of West Side Story at the Leicester Haymarket. Leicester has emerged among the foremost of our regional theatres with an enormous range of productions. It has chosen West Side Story as its Christmas show, and on Saturday evening the theatre was packed. One can see why people like the piece. It has song, dance and drama, a passing similarity to Romeo and Juliet and a sociological theme in the conflict between Puerto Ricans and whites. The direction by Paul Kerryson makes the most of it all. There is an impressive set of tall New York tenement buildings designed by Charles Cusick-Smith, but still plenty of room to display the choreography which came originally from Jerome Robbins. The songs are terrific, of course, and the production worth travelling to. Yet I wonder if Leonard Bernstein's music and the whole set-up really are so much superior than what went before. It just seemed so at the time. With hindsight, there is a lot of Cowboys and Indians in West Side Story and sentimentality is never far away. The other West Side Story, performed by the admirable Pimlico Opera, was at Wandsworth Prison with inmates playing some of the parts. This was a smaller affair, partly no doubt because space is restricted. It had the virtue of drawing more attention to the orchestra and, under the conducting of Wasfi Kani, Bernstein's music sounded better in the prison than at Leicester. The song that went down best was, for understandable reasons, 'Gee, Officer Krupke'. Many of the audience had not seen the show before and it was plainly a great success. I muse about the psychological effect of giving the inmates the excitement of rehearsal and performance then sending them back to their cells until the next show, perhaps in a year's time. They should do it more often. Yet a piece that can serve a prison as well as being the Leicester Christmas show has surely joined the repertorie of established, even old-fashioned musicals.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak turns in flat first-quarter result Eastman Kodak, the struggling US photographic group, yesterday said sales and earnings, excluding special items, were virtually flat in the first three months of the year. Wall Street analysts were mostly disappointed with the results, but the share price closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 41 3/4 . Net income, excluding a Dollars 12m provision associated with the early retirement of debt, came in at Dollars 94m, or 29 cents a share, well short of analysts' mean estimate of 34 cents. The 1993 figure was adjusted to reflect the spin-off last year of the chemicals division and other divestments. The reorganisation was initiated by Mr George Fisher, who took over as chief executive last autumn. The former Motorola chairman departed from the long-standing wisdom on Wall Street that Kodak must slash costs by adding to the 10,000 job cuts it had announced before his appointment. Instead, Mr Fisher adopted a long-term approach, stressing stronger revenue growth and faster product development. In his first full quarter at the helm, sales edged 1 per cent ahead to Dollars 3.59bn, prompting unease among some analysts. 'The combination of these weak results and the likelihood of continued weak results in the upcoming quarters will cause people to start to get a little impatient with Mr Fisher,' said Mr Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. However, operating earnings from Kodak's three main divisions - imaging, information and healthcare - climbed 26 per cent in the quarter, from Dollars 370m to Dollars 294m. Sales in the core imaging business improved 6 per cent, offsetting a 3 per cent decline in health, and a flat performance by the information arm.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Bets off as yields spiral continues WHY not just sit back and enjoy the ride? That is the message from Wall Street in the face of the seemingly unstoppable rise in long-dated Treasury bond prices. Sceptics, punished by spiralling prices for their lack of faith in the long end of the market, are finally throwing in the towel. It is the sort of resigned mood that in the past had signalled the peak of a bull market - although given the momentum that has been building in prices, it would take a pretty strong constitution to short the bond market just now. For weeks, market followers have been lowering their forecasts for long-term yields as rates have plumbed one seemingly improbable depth after another. Fed up with trying to call the bottom - or even a temporary halt to the rise in prices - many have concluded that a 5 1/2 per cent yield on the long bond, or even one as low as 5 per cent, is within sight. Typical of the revisionism in the air is the opening to Friday's weekly market commentary from Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street broker: 'The continued proliferation of weaker-than-anticipated economic data, and of better-than-expected inflation news suggests that our previously defined target of 7 per cent for long bond yields is untenable.' (Unlike many, though, DLJ still clings to the view that the market will fall back slightly by the year-end.) By the end of last week, virtually all the forecasts made as recently as two months ago were looking equally untenable. Halfway through this year, a 7 per cent yield on the long bond by the year-end had been a common prediction. On Friday, the yield on the 30-year benchmark ended at 6.21 per cent - around 15 basis points lower than the previous week's breath-taking low and a full 50 basis points (or half a percentage point) lower than a month before. Each time the market falls back - as it did briefly on Friday - a new surge of buying lifts it again. Fixed income mutual funds - fed by a continuing shift out of bank deposits and money market funds - have been throwing ever bigger piles of cash at the bond market. In the first six months, these funds made Dollars 59.7bn of net new purchases of bonds - as much as they made in the whole of 1991, and two-thirds of the record investment made in the 1992. 'The pressures are still very strong for cash to go into Treasuries - there's no real yield on cash whatsoever,' says Mr Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley. The search for yield elsewhere has led investors to emerging market equities or bonds: markets which are simply too small or illiquid for big US fund managers to provide anything other than a marginal investment. US real estate yields of 8 per cent have provided one alternative (Mr Biggs says Morgan Stanley has taken its holdings from nothing to 9 per cent of assets in less than six months). However, for the big money looking for a liquid market outside equities  - which themselves touched new highs last week, pushing the yield down still further to nearly 2.5 per cent - Treasuries and investment grade corporate paper remain about the only option. There was another reason for last week's run-up in prices: the latest benchmark 30-year bond, the 6 1/4 per cent Treasury due 2023, has added scarcity value given that no new long bonds will be auctioned until next February. That pushed its yield at one stage last week to 20 basis points below that available at the same time on the previous benchmark, the 7 1/8 stock due 2023, suggesting that a large part of the latest rally may be purely technical. Where will it all end? Moderate GDP growth and current inflation at around 3 per cent, and easing, provides the sort of background against which long-term inflation expectations could continue to fall. Why shouldn't real (after-inflation) long-term interest rates fall to the 3 per cent level of the 1950s and 1960s, ask observers like Mr Stephen Slifer of Lehman Brothers. That makes long bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent a real possibility, and soon. A grudging Mr Biggs, who has reduced his bond weighting from 40 per cent at the peak to 27 per cent now, concedes: 'Can yields get to 6 per cent, or even 5 3/4 ? Yes.' But he adds: 'For the bond market, it's late in the game - we're already in the fourth quarter.'</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carried a two-minute video  report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's  destruction of its chemical weapons.    Peslyak began by recapping Russia's international commitment  to destroy its chemical weapons and to discontinue their  production. Archive footage was shown of the international  convention on the destruction of chemical weapons.    He then reported on the debate on this topic in the State  Duma on 24 March. Peslyak said that the main problem was  storage of the weapons until they could be destroyed. The video  showed the Duma being addressed by Major General Yuriy  Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense troops of the  Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand that we  cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves.  Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most  dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have.  That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast."    Peslyak said that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a  billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The  video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov,  deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International  Affairs, identified by caption, who said:    "The means of eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be  decided upon. The sites where the destruction of the chemical  weapons is to take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see  from the hearing, the settling of these matters with local  authorities and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running  into considerable difficulties."    Peslyak then pointed out that a factory in Chapayevsk  equipped with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it  could be used for destroying chemical weapons. Video showed the  exterior and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped  in plastic sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this,  he said. He also said that it was difficult to know just how  much toxic material there was to be destroyed saying there could  be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 tonnes."    In addition to the factory, the video showed personnel in  protective clothing working with munitions in the open, and rows  of charred shells. An assortment of gas masks was also shown.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Media Gp plans review The Guardian Media Group, which owns a 20 per cent in Trans World Communications, the leading UK commercial radio group, confirmed yesterday that it plans to ask for a judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision not to object to Emap's proposed acquistion of TWC. Mr Harry Roche, chairman of Guardian Media, which publishes the Guardian, said 'we do not believe that the Radio Authority's agreement with Emap should go unchallenged.' Emap, which already owns nearly 30 per cent of Trans World, had been seeking a recommended offer at 181p which would value the group at Pounds 70m.</p>

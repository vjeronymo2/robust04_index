			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer condemns 'illegal' trade threats THE EUROPEAN Community will not be bullied into making concessions in world trade talks, Mr John Gummer, the British minister of agriculture and current president of the council of EC farm ministers, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Brussels. 'We are still threatened with illegal action,' he said, referring to Washington's potential retaliation in a long-running dispute with the community over oilseeds. Mr Gummer was speaking after EC agriculture ministers heard Mr Ray MacSharry, the European agriculture commissioner, report on what he saw as highly unsatisfactory negotiations on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks at the Group of Seven summit in Munich earlier this month. Mr Gummer said the US had failed to respond to EC reform concessions relevant to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. The ball was now in Washington's court, he added. Gatt negotiations should have been completed in December 1990, but collapsed over the issue of trade-distorting subsidies, which still has to be resolved. A decision on Italy's demand for a bigger milk quota, the issue that nearly scuppered negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reforms in May, were deferred at yesterday's council session. Italy says it severely underestimated the number of farmers who should have been counted in when quotas were originally set. It has been overproducing, and sees a boost in quotas as the solution. But northern countries that have played by the rules have been aghast at what they see as Italy being rewarded for breaking them. Yesterday's session also saw the beginning of discussions on developing systems for controlling payments to farmers under the reformed CAP. The European Commission proposed that Ecu115m (Pounds 82m) should be provided over three years towards the cost of developing such control systems. Ministers had mixed views on this, ranging from suggestions that there should be no such funding at all, to calls for a big increase. Several ministers had doubts as to whether the system could be implemented on schedule by January 1. On the definition of land parcels for identification and control purposes, those tending to favour an EC-wide definition were pitted against those who supported the right of member states to devise their own systems. There was widespread backing, however, for a single system of animal identification for both veterinary purposes and for payments. Some ministers were opposed to having to make an annual declaration on production and animal numbers. All these issues will be followed up at the farm ministers' September meeting.</p>

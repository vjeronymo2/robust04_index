			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Matina Fietz: ``Fewer Drug-Related Deaths and </F> New Heroin Users; More Take Cocaine'']    [Text] The number of drug-related deaths in Germany is  declining. In the first 11 months of this year, 1,458 people  died as a result of drug consumption. That is a 22-percent drop  compared to the same period of the previous year when 1,870 drug  victims died. This was told to DIE WELT by the parliamentary  state secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Eduard  Lintner (CSU) [Christian Social Union], the Federal Government's  representative in charge of drugs.    The number of first-time users has also dropped--by about 10  percent from 11,892 to 10,724. The largest decline was in heroin  consumption--down 21 percent. By constrast, the authorities  registered an enormous increase in first-time users of  cocaine--up 26 percent. Lintner called this development  ``extremely worrisome.'' The effect of cocaine is often  underestimated. It leads to a strong psychological dependency,  to exaggerated sensations and even to extreme overconfidence. In  addition, cocaine consumption also causes physical  impairments--from sleep disturbances to paralysis and cardiac  arrest.    Cocaine addicts are very difficult to identify, said Lintner  as an explanation for the difficulties in coping with the  problem. Cocaine is primarily consumed by older people already  well-established professionally. They are no longer to be found  only in the upper classes, but increasingly also in the  middle-income groups. They are ``not easily accessible'' to  offers of therapy. Besides that, admits Lintner, so far there is  no specific therapy for cocaine addicts, and especially no  substitute such as methadone for heroin addicts.    Lintner rejected the demand that the state dispense drugs  under medical supervision: ``This practice would mean  continuation of the addiction. That cannot be the intent.'' The  goal must be to enable addicts to live a life without drugs.</p>

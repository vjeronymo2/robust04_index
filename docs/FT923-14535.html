			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minister to 'sell Britain' in Russia MR MICHAEL HESELTINE is to follow his reorganisation of the trade and industry department with a new emphasis on his role as a high-profile salesman for British industry in the former Communist countries of eastern Europe, Philip Stephens writes. The trade and industry secretary plans to visit Moscow in September as part of a drive to increase the access of British companies to the former Soviet Union. He is understood to be anxious to explore whether his department can take a more active role in ensuring that British consortia of manufacturing companies and banks win a bigger share of energy and industrial projects. One suggestion is that the Export Credits Guarantee Department's budget could be used more effectively to secure such contracts.</p>

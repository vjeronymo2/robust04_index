If so, just get hold of the German tour-company Westerhaus Ballena's brochure for holidays in Grand Canary. The numbers - all correct  - appear inside although, in a clear breach of protocol, they are ranked lower in the list than numbers apt to be more immediately required by the company's average customer, such as those of the local German doctor and office of Lufthansa.</p>

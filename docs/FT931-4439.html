			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: National Power to study Pounds 260m Indian venture NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, and Jaiprakesh Industries, an Indian engineering and manufacturing company, yesterday signed an agreement which could lead to the building of a Pounds 260m coal-fired power station in Karnataka, India. The agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a 300MW power station in Mangalore is seen as the first step in setting up a joint venture to build, own and operate the plant. The move is the latest in a diversification programme by the UK company through which it aims to invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the century. Jaiprakesh is planning a steel plant in Karnataka, which the power plant would supply. National Power and Jaiprakesh are seeking a third partner for the project and aim later to allow other Indian investors to acquire shares. Mr Graham Hadley, a National Power executive director, said his company was looking at several opportunities in India but the Karnataka scheme was its lead project. Mr S K Dixit, Jaiprakesh managing director, said the promoters would be putting up Rs3bn (Pounds 65.9m) equity for the Rs12bn venture. Government clearance would be sought after preliminary studies were completed.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bank of America considers acquisitions BANK of America, the leading California bank which last year acquired Security Pacific, yesterday indicated it was considering new acquisitions. The bank said so in a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to Dollars 3bn of new funds. The filing said the proceeds would finance possible future acquisitions, to repay maturing obligations and for general corporate purposes. The bank said the Dollars 3bn might be raised through the issue of debt securities, debt warrants, preferred stock, depository shares, preferred stock warrants, common stock warrants and common stock. Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, has had his eye on a series of out-of-state acquisitions that would broaden the bank's presence nationally. But Wall Street analysts have been sceptical about the bank's ability to make new deals until it has fully integrated the former Security Pacific's operations and absorbed problem loans that came with the acquisition. The bank's stock yesterday closed at Dollars 49 7/8, down Dollars 1 1/8.</p>

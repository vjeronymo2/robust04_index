			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Pits' power bills to rise BRITISH COAL is to pay 5 per cent more for its electricity from next month at the same time as the coal it sells to electricity generators will fall significantly in price. British Coal's deals, concluded after negotiations with a variety of electricity companies, would lead to its annual electricity bill of about Pounds 100m rising by more than Pounds 5m if all its 50 pits stayed open. Some of the corporation's executives are angry about the price rises because they coincide with a 20 per cent reduction in the charges it makes to generators for some coal. Imported coal, used to generate electricity for large consumers, has also been falling in price recently. Disclosure of the deals will add to discontent over electricity tariffs which are traditionally changed on April 1. Many other big users are facing similar increases. In addition domestic and small industrial customers have been promised little, if any, reduction in electricity prices in spite of the reductions in the price of coal. Most of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales that have announced tariffs have said that they are either freezing prices or reducing them by 1 percentage point. Further reductions are likely to be delayed until after the government has published its white paper on coal, almost certainly after the Budget. British Coal's deals are with Northern Electric, which will supply the north-east pits, and PowerGen, which will supply other pits in England and Wales. PowerGen said yesterday that its contracts for next year were cheaper in real terms than its existing deals with British Coal. The company is, however, increasing its number of contracts with the corporation and its new contracts are replacing cheaper deals with other companies. Until now National Power, the other large generator in England and Wales, was British Coal's other main supplier. British Coal would not comment in detail yesterday on the electricity deals, which it said had been conducted in confidence. One executive said, however, it was diabolical that it had been forced to pay so much when it was having to cut up to 30,000 jobs. 'How are we expected to bring our prices down to world prices when one of our main costs is rising so steeply?' The price increases will take the electricity bill of an average pit to above the level paid before the privatisation of the electricity industry. In the year immediately following privatisation British Coal won significant reductions in prices, in common with many other large customers, as electricity companies competed with each other for custom. Since then electricity supply companies have sought to pull out of low-margin or loss-making deals and prices have risen.</p>

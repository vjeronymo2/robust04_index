			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save Few investors have included food retailers' shares on their recent shopping lists. Since the start of the year, the sector has underperformed the market by 11 per cent. Shares have been hit by anxiety attacks about grocers' expansion plans, the proliferation of deep discounters and an increase in price pressures. Kwik Save's interim figures suggest such pessimism is overdone. Kwik Save's 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profits on a 14 per cent sales increase hardly smacks of an industry in crisis. And, although growth will slow in the second half, Kwik Save still seems set to record earnings gains in the high teens for a while to come. The company is adding stores at the rate of one a week. Large areas of the country, such as Scotland, remain untouched. The lack of any price inflation in Kwik Save's sales figures certainly emphasises the tough trading environment. But Kwik Save maintained its competitiveness by improving operating efficiencies rather than sacrificing margin. The launch of cut-price No Frills own-label products offers an alternative means of suppressing fire from deep discounters. That said, investors contemplating a return to the grocery sector are more likely to chase J. Sainsbury or Argyll. The shares of the superstore operators have been sold more aggressively and appear relatively cheaper. Such companies should also benefit more from recovery as shoppers again treat themselves to a little of what they fancy.</p>

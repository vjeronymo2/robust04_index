			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Michailo Markovic, vice chairman </F> of the Socialist Party of Serbia and identified as President  Milosevic's "leading adviser," by Karin Veraart in Belgrade;  date not given: "Greater Serbia Is Not on the Agenda Just Yet  -- Adviser To Milosevic Thinks Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia  Should Go Their Own Way"]    [Text] Belgrade -- Two years ago Serbian philosopher  Michailo Markovic joined President Slobodan Milosevic's SPS  [Socialist Party of Serbia]. Since then Markovic has become  vice chairman and leads the SPS's think-tank. He is the party's  ideologue and regarded as the most important adviser to the  Serbian leader. Now Serbia has to mark time for a while in its  goal of a Greater Serbia, the professor said.    "The time has come for us to turn to the status quo,"  Markovic said. "That meant," he said, ``that Serbia should not  regard uniting areas of Croatia and Bosnia inhabited by a  Serbian majority with the Serbian `motherland' as the highest  priority.    "The Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia and the Srpska  republic in Bosnia, as their leaders have baptised their  unrecognized states, could develop a very good independent  existence," Markovic said. "With economic links with Serbia of  course and also with neighboring counties," he said. "That is  the goal in the first instance. In the end, and that could last  a very long time, a decision must be made about their definitive  political status, or about a possible unification of the Serbian  areas."    As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and the  Committee for National Questions, Markovic is working on a  memorandum "which defines the most important objectives for  Serbian national policies," he said. "My colleague Anton  Razmazic and I have virtually finished the draft version. It is  a sort of guideline, advice to the party leadership for a  national program."    The memorandum lists the fundamental interests of the  Serbian  people. "At present the most important things are peace and the  right to self-determination in the areas where Serbs are in the  majority," Markovic said. "Referendums should be held at a  local level in Bosnia and Krajina," Markovic said, "so that the  people could itself decide whether it wanted to be part of the  Serbian area or preferred to belong elsewhere."    "If Krajina voted for reintegration with Croatia, something  which the international community is pushing for, then Serbia  would not oppose that in any way," Markovic said, but he "was  certain" that Krajina did not want this at all. However, in  recent weeks the leadership of Krajina in Knin have been put  under heavy pressure by the international mediators, the United  States and Russia, but little support has been seen from  Belgrade. Both the SPS and the opposition parties are leaving  their options open. A large flow of rumors has been set off,  according to which the Serbian leader wants to give Krajina to  Croatia in return for the lifting of international sanctions.  The independent papers in Belgrade published photomontages of  Milosevic and Tudjman in bed together this week.    Markovic grinned. "I know these rumors are going round in  the West," he said, rejecting the reference to the Serbian  media. "But you should understand two things," he said. "Point  one: Milosevic is a man of few words, he does not feel such a  strong need to talk to the press. He sees no reason to  endlessly repeat himself. Believe me, Knin knows that it is  guaranteed Serbian support. In recent days I toured villages in  the region and I once again told people that Serbia is behind  them. Should Croatia try to take Krajina using military force,  that would mean war by 10 million Serbs again four million  Croats."    But things would not reach that point, Markovic thought. "In  fact Croatia can never get together enough people who want to  fight," he said. "Should a few extremist groups want to try it  nevertheless, then Krajina can deal with that itself. In that  way Split and Zagreb would be wiped off the map."    But would Milosevic finally bend under the pressure of the  economic sanctions and nevertheless advise Knin to give up the  search for independence? "That is the second point that the  West should now understand," he said. "Serbia will not bend  before sanctions. Unlike Croatia, which has allowed itself to  be forced into that peculiar confederation agreement at the  moment when an embargo was about to be installed because of  involvement in the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Markovic has his own opinion of the latest peace plans --  Germany is behind them. "Germany is the biggest financier of the  Croats, but war is expensive," he said. "Also Croatia did not  have great perspectives in the fighting and Germany wanted to  prevent a Muslim state being founded in Europe. On the other  hand, a plausible solution had to be found for the Muslim  question, because they and their brothers in the rest of the  world represent a great interest for both Europe and the United  States: oil."    "This reasoning was picked up by the United States, which  wanted to show that Europe is not able to solve the conflict in  the Balkans without U.S. intervention," he said. "Result: The  Washington agreement of 18 March, when the Croats and Muslims  decided to form a federation in Bosnia, possibly to be expanded  later into a confederation with Croatia."    "This agreement would never be completed," Markovic said.  "The people do not want to live together at all," he said.  "Heavy fighting is still taking place now. What ever the case,  Serbia still wants to negotiate and make a few territorial  concessions, but there can be no possibility of forming part of  a union with the other parties."    And what would happen if the country which had defended  Serbian interests up to a certain point started to stir?    "Russia will never go so far as to force us into an  agreement  against our will," he said. "Kozyrev might want to do that, but  he could not sell that to his rank and file." Markovic sighed.  "For Serbia it would be better if someone like Rutskoy, for  example, came to power. The present Russian leadership is too  keen on a good understanding with the United States."</p>

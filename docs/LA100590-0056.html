			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ACTS TO END CONTROL OF PRICES;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: HE AUTHORIZES MOST OF THE NATION'S ENTERPRISES TO NEGOTIATE THEIR  OWN WHOLESALE DEALS FOR GOODS TO BE DELIVERED NEXT YEAR.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union on Thursday took a major step toward ending state control of  prices, long a barrier to fundamental economic reform.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, using his new authority to rule by decree,  authorized most of the country's enterprises to negotiate their own wholesale  prices for goods to be delivered next year, freeing the firms from central  government controls that had limited production and discouraged efficiency.  </P> <P> Although regarded as an essential measure for the radical overhaul of the  Soviet economy, price reform has historically been so sensitive that several  attempts at economic restructuring have faltered and failed on this issue  alone, but no other way has been found to make enterprises here respond to  demand and supply.  </P> <P> Gorbachev described the measure as aimed at "broadening the economic  independence and increasing the motivation of enterprises to boost their output  and production efficiency and create conditions to introduce market relations"  as the basis of the country's economy in the future.  </P> <P> The decree, as reported by the official news agency Tass, appears to confirm  the government's broad decision to use the market forces of supply and demand  to force the Soviet Union's state-owned, centrally planned economy into major  changes, although perhaps at a controlled pace.  </P> <P> State officials will be allowed, however, to draw up a list of raw materials  and other products whose wholesale prices will remain fixed, though perhaps at  different levels, and taxes will be imposed on super-profits to discourage  price-gouging.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he was acting even before his overall reform plan is ready  because some elements cannot wait for a consensus to develop; in moving on the  issue of wholesale prices, however, he probably preempted further debate when  the package is introduced in 10 days.  </P> <P> Economists are still struggling, however, to strike a balance between a plan  calling for the radical transformation of the Soviet economy over 500 days and  another urging a gradual transition to a market economy.  </P> <P> Valentin Pavlov, the finance minister, told Soviet television that the measure  is a compromise and aimed primarily at halting the accelerating disintegration  of the country's economy and at increasing the production of consumer goods,  now in extremely short supply.  </P> <P> Pavlov acknowledged that most wholesale prices will rise -- most prices are  based on a list worked out in the 1930s and updated periodically by the State  Price Commission -- but he refused to say whether, when or how they would then  be passed on to consumers.  </P> <P> "Many retail prices will be lower than the new, negotiated wholesale prices,"  he said, "and this will require special consideration."  </P> <P> Pavlov sought to focus attention on the improved supplies of consumer goods  that the government hopes the measure will bring rather than on the inevitable  higher prices.  </P> <P> "It is well known that children's goods do not appear in the shops," he said.  "They are not on sale because enterprises do not want to produce them because  they are unprofitable. Under the new decree, providing for negotiated prices,  they won't be unprofitable products."  </P> <P> The decree says that enterprises can sign contracts with each other for 1991  using negotiated wholesale prices but that they must be based on those outlined  by the government in June, 1988.  </P> <P> Profits that rise above state-set limits will go to the federal and republic  budgets through taxes on any super-profits that result from the negotiated  prices.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The Hualon Group is  unlikely to reverse its plan to open a textile mill in Northern  Ireland due to opposition from some European textile makers, the  group's founder T. M. Weng said Wednesday [1 June].    Weng, a legislator, noted that the investment project in  suburban Belfast, which calls for a total investment of 157  million British pounds (US$235.5 million), has already been  fixed.    Britain, which has offered various financial incentives to  lure foreign companies to make investment, "invited" Hualon to  establish such a mill, he stressed.    Hualon is scheduled to enter into an investment subsidy  agreement with the British Government on June 9, which was  approved by the Executive Commission of the European Union (EU)  in early May, he elaborated.    Under the agreement, he said, the London government will  provide 61 million British pounds (US$91.5 million) in subsidies  to the Hualon project.    The textile mill is expected to create 1,800 jobs in  Northern  Ireland, where unemployment reaches as high as 15 percent.    Weng made the remarks in reaction to news reports that  European textile manufacturers are prepared to bring a complaint  against Hualon,    The dissatisfaction with Hualon might stem from Hualon's  strong competitiveness, Weng said, noting the combined  production of its mills in Taiwan and Malaysia has made Hualon  the world's largest man-made fiber producer.    He pointed out that the Northern Ireland investment plan was  made by the Hualon Corp., a key affiliate of the group. The  company is chaired by his younger brother Weng Yiu-ming.    Meanwhile, a CNA dispatch from London said that the  London-based FINANCIAL TIMES Tuesday reported on the  controversies surrounding the Hualon project.    The EU Executive Commission gave the green light to the  Hualon investment plan after intensive lobbying by British  officials and parliamentarians, the dispatch quoted the paper as  reporting.    The paper also revealed that the two Weng brothers have been  charged with breach of contract in Taiwan, which the CNA  dispatch said has hurt Hualon's reputation.</p>

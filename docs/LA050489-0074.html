			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO-FAULT INSURANCE  </P> <P> Your April 19 headline and story on the passage of the no-fault automobile  insurance legislation (AB 354) suggested that this was just a big win for the  insurance industry ("Panel Approves Insurer-Backed No-Fault Bill," Part I,  April 19). Actually, any benefits to insurance companies should translate into  benefits for the consumer. Proposition 103 enacted strict oversight rules which  will make any cost savings for the insurance companies into lower rates for  consumers.  </P> <P> At the hearing, the companies and the author of the bill (Assemblyman Patrick  Johnston, D-Stockton) pledged to add a strong prior approval regulatory system  to the measure, if the court declares Proposition 103's protections invalid.  (That, in and of itself, was news since the companies have never agreed to  support any strengthening of California's insurance regulatory system.)  </P> <P> Trial lawyers won't benefit from passage of the bill since the measure is  designed to take small cases out of the clogged and costly court system. That's  why the California Trial Lawyers' Assn. is devoting significant resources to  defeating the bill.  </P> <P> Payment of pain and suffering for minor injuries in the average fender-bender  is eliminated under AB 354. That change will put some heavily advertised trial  lawyer firms out of business.  </P> <P> Consumers will benefit. When Consumers Union and Johnston's staff drafted the  bill, we matched it to New York's auto insurance system. There is guaranteed  full and prompt payment for the medical costs and wage loss associated with  most injuries.  </P> <P> Further, the New York system has kept the rates in that state relatively  stable. Rates have only increased about 4% per year there, much less than the  astronomical increases in California in the same time period.  </P> <P> These are all subtle, but important, differences in the usual trial lawyer  versus insurance company battle. The subtleties, though, are what made this  bill pass where all insurance industry versions of no-fault auto insurance have  failed. The news is that the Legislature is acting on a solution for California  drivers.  </P> <P> JUDITH BELL  </P> <P> Director of Special Projects  </P> <P> West Coast Regional Office  </P> <P> Consumers Union  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

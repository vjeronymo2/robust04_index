			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: CREATIVE TOUR IN TORRANCE FINDS ART IN HISTORIC PLACES.  </P> <P> In 1926, the Madrid Market opened as one of the first mom and pop neighborhood  markets in old Torrance. It became famous for its meat department, which drew  customers from a wide area.  </P> <P> By 1969, it had been long vacant and vandalized. That's when artist Connor  Everts spotted the derelict market while driving by one day and thought its  roominess and high ceilings would make it ideal for a studio. He's worked there  ever since.  </P> <P> Several blocks away, a 1930s-era factory building -- the last workshop of  pioneer aircraft designer Edmond R. Doak -- also has become the domain of an  artist. After Doak's death three years ago, stone sculptor Nick Agid took it  over and makes art out of marble and onyx, and is surrounded by the tools,  furnishings and memorabilia of Doak's aviation career.  </P> <P> The two studios are high points on an "Art in Historic Places" tour being  conducted Saturday and Sunday in old downtown Torrance by the Torrance  Historical Society. A third major attraction is Kent Twitchell's  20-foot-by-110-foot outdoor mural saluting six Los Angeles artists. He painted  it 10 years ago on the wall of the Employment Development Department building  on Engracia Avenue.  </P> <P> Tour co-Chairman Janet Payne says she's not about to claim that Torrance is a  booming center of working artists hidden away in old buildings. But, she says,  the city has more of an art life than suggested by its image as a home of  industry, suburban residences and one of the world's biggest shopping malls.  </P> <P> "The point of this tour is to show off a new area of interest, Torrance as an  arts center, and to show that historic buildings are being reused," she said.  In the case of the old market, Everts saved it from destruction because the  dilapidated structure was being eyed by the city as a site for apartments.  </P> <P> The self-guided tour begins at the Torrance Historical Society Museum, which  was originally a 1930s Art Deco-style library. At the museum, visitors will  receive a brochure and map detailing the historic sites, including Irving  Gill's Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge over Torrance Blvd. At 11 a.m.  Saturday, the society will hold a ceremony honoring the bridge's recent listing  in the National Register of Historic Places.  </P> <P> Everts and Agid will be at work in their studios during the tour and Twitchell  will be at his mural Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Twitchell, who has done many highly visible murals around Los Angeles, painted  a group of Otis Art Institute graduates for the Torrance mural. "Somehow," he  said in an earlier interview, "it seems appropriate to put often-unemployed  artists on the side of an employment office." Three of the six, he says, became  quite successful after the mural was painted.  </P> <P> As part of the weekend tour, the historical society museum will highlight  artwork depicting city history. And to lend more flavor and authenticity,  artists from the Torrance Traditional Artists Guild will set up their easels  curbside to do paintings of the old downtown.  </P> <P> Visitors to Everts' studio will get little feel of the old market. Thick  foliage hides the building now, the asphalt parking lot has become a garden,  and Everts added a second story in the back to create living space and a  well-lighted painting space.  </P> <P> "It's ideal for a studio, deserted and quiet," said Everts, who is working on  large new paintings for an upcoming show. They cover a wall of his studio.  </P> <P> Agid's old factory building, on the other hand, retains the echo of aviation  visionary Doak -- a man who employed 6,000 people when his aircraft company  built training planes during World War II and who is most famous for a vertical  takeoff plane he developed in 1958.  </P> <P> Pictures of his planes hang on the walls, along with decades-old group photos  of aircraft executives, and even Doak's rack of pipes sits alongside his old  desk. Alfred Perry, a former Doak employee who still calls his old boss "the  chief," will be on hand this weekend as a guide.  </P> <P> Agid's art space -- which he shares with metal sculptor Orell Christian  Anderson -- is a cavernous room with a curving roof, large white wooden  supports and big doors. He says it makes a good studio: "It has a high ceiling,  the light is quite nice all around."  </P> <P> He has done lighted onyx sculptures that bring out the colors of the stone. His  current art project is a striking adventure in what one museum director called  "stone mail." In an admitted act of self-promotion, Agid turned postal cards  into art, mailing onyx "postcards" to museums and art galleries around the  country. He asked for RSVPs and is at work duplicating the written replies on  large slabs of marble.  </P> <P> Some of the movers and shakers of art who got the stones were amused. But the  post office, Agid said, "was not thrilled." Gerald Faris  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: RELIABLE LIGHT BY MEREDITH STEINBACH (RUTGERS UNIVERSITY  PRESS: $18.95; 160 PP.)  </P> <P> Short stories can be bad, good or, in rare cases, magical. This collection of  seven by Meredith Steinbach consists of five good ones and two that are better  than good; they leave dents in the bumpers of the reader's mind that defy  simple hammering out.  </P> <P> Steinbach also is a novelist ("Zara" and "Here Lies the Water"), and her  stories have a novelistic amplitude. They enfold periods of years, crowds of  characters, generations of families, without obsessive concern that every scene  be immediately relevant or that every unnecessary word be pruned. This is  confident writing.  </P> <P> True, three of the longer stories are, perhaps, too novelistic. A young woman  divines the truth about her enigmatic mother when she returns to the Midwest  for her grandfather's funeral. Another young woman is stunned by loved ones'  deaths and dispirited by the effort of living in a sodden, Seattle-like city  where the sun never shines. Residents of an island in New England watch as a  Vietnam veteran re-creates the kind of tragedy he has spent years trying to  forget. The many virtues of these stories -- a quirkiness, a tenderness, a  solid sense of place -- just don't happen to include perfection.  </P> <P> But one of the shorter stories -- about an immigrant woman trapped with her  lover in a Chicago hotel fire -- is seamless; the fire is both real and a  symbol of her oppression outside, and we are left uncertain that she will  escape.  </P> <P> And then there are the magical ones:  </P> <P> "Soundings in Feet and Fathoms" is told by a black doctor who has moved from  Harlem to a small New England town, only to be trailed by the bloodhounds of  racism. Bigoted parents refuse to let him operate on a boy, who dies; the  doctor is blamed, and his own son is tormented at school. Steinbach has found  this man a voice, recognizably black and male but jarringly unorthodox and  individual, that speaks to his son -- and to us -- with humanity and power.  </P> <P> "Actual Oil" is a comic fable about three women who own a farm. The youngest  runs off with a con man with "electronic eyes" who calls himself Hermes, after  the cunning, silver-tongued herald of the gods. Even after she returns home,  the older women must protect her from his charms. "Where are you anyway?" she  asks when he phones to announce that he has completed a two-day encounter  workshop and been "actualized." "I am here in myself, where I am always at  home," Hermes answers in perfect-pitch psychobabble. "Temporarily I'm in  Nashville." The pitch stays perfect; the story is quietly, steadily, grinningly  funny -- on the road of reading, another fine thing to run into.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 IN VENTURA COUNTY;  </P> <P> YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE DROUGHT;  </P> <P> DOWN TO THE LAST DROPS  </P> <P> As the statewide drought entered its fifth year, its impact in the county  spread from a few cities to virtually every farm and community.  </P> <P> Ventura, which has perhaps the most severe shortage in the county, passed a  mandatory conservation ordinance in May that required major institutions to  reduce use by 20%, smaller businesses by 15%. Single-family residences were  limited to 294 gallons a day and units in multifamily dwellings to 196 gallons.  </P> <P> Compliance has been good, but the drought is still crippling the city.  </P> <P> Some companies have threatened to leave. Ventura High School closed its leaking  swimming pool.  </P> <P> Restrooms and showers at San Buenaventura State Beach have been shut off on  weekdays.  </P> <P> At one point, the city talked about towing in icebergs from polar regions.  Enthusiasm for that idea quickly melted, but Ventura still is considering  building a seawater desalination plant. In the fall, Ventura commissioned a  study on the environmental impact of building an $85-million pipeline to hook  into the state water system at Lake Castaic. But the state system is hurting,  too.  </P> <P> In December, the Metropolitan Water District, which imports water from the  Colorado River and Northern California, imposed restrictions on its customers,  including Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard.  </P> <P> Hardest hit were farmers, who were ordered to reduce consumption by 20%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking Ahead  </P> <P> In Ventura and the Ojai Valley, local rainfall will determine how soon the  drought ends.  </P> <P> In the eastern part of the county, the key factor is how much rain and snow  falls in Northern California.  </P> <P> Without above-normal precipitation this winter, the state predicts that  agriculture will be cut to 35% of normal supplies in 1991, while municipal and  industrial customers get 85%.  </P> <P> If growers have to plant less, they won't need to buy as much fuel or  equipment.  </P> <P> Fewer jobs will be available for farm workers, perhaps resulting in an increase  in welfare payments.  </P> <P> Produce will cost more.  </P></p>

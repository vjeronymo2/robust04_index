			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due FORECASTS vary sharply over the interim results of HSBC Holdings, the parent of Midland Bank, to be announced today. Pre-tax profit estimates range from about Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 1.3bn, both substantially higher than last time's Pounds 521m. Midland has already revealed profits up at Pounds 385m (Pounds 60m) and Hang Seng Bank has weighed in with HKDollars 2.75bn (HKDollars 2.34bn). Some Pounds 200m from a favourable HK dollar exchange rate will also be included. The only possible black cloud could be China's cooling economy. Sun Alliance, the composite insurance company, is expected to post a return to interim pre-tax profits on Thursday of Pounds 30m-Pounds 80m compared with a loss of Pounds 114.1m a year earlier. Rises in premium rates, falling expenses and lower claims frequency are behind the turnround. Sun Alliance's balance sheet should also show a considerable improvement following the strong rise in the UK equity market to which the group is heavily exposed. Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, is expected to announce a strong increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.4m to between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m on Thursday. Much of the rise is likely to be accounted for by the contribution from Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company bought for Dollars 434m earlier this year, although estimates differ of how large this contribution will be. Analysts are hoping for evidence from the company that SCI has been integrated into the group and is performing well. The interim dividend is forecast at 5p, from a restated 4.7p last year. Analysts expect Ladbroke Group to report a fall in pre-tax profits for the first half on Thursday. Last time's profits will be restated under FRS 3 to about Pounds 81.5m to account for estimated hotel disposals and this time forecasts range from about Pounds 68m, if there is a higher interest charge, to around Pounds 74m. The one bright spot should be UK racing. The dividend should be held at 4.92p. Rolls-Royce, also reporting on Thursday, is set to reveal operating profits sharply lower at about Pounds 30m (Pounds 44m), affected by the conditions in the aerospace and industrial power markets. Including exceptionals should result in flattish pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20m. Reckitt &amp; Colman, the mustard-to-lavatory cleaner group, is expected to show an increase in interim pre-tax profits to around Pounds 150m (Pounds 134.2m) when it reports on Thursday. The shares have been poor performers with worries about prices squeezed by retailers, the slowdown in the European economies, and longer term concerns about the value of brands. Burmah Castrol is reporting interim results the same day and is expected to announce net profits of between Pounds 44m and Pounds 46m. The group's German operations, which since April have had a contribution from Tribol, the industrial lubricants bought from ICI for Pounds 31.7m, are going to be watched carefully.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 Jun (MTI) -- The July 1993 law on the  rights of ethnic and national minorities enables Hungary's  twelve national minorities and its Gypsy community to enter  their candidates in the local government elections to be held  this autumn.    Of the 10.3 million in Hungary, approximately one million  people belong to an ethnic or national minority group. The law  covers those groups which have lived for a minimum of one  century in Hungary, and have at least 1,000 citizens declaring  themselves members of a particular minority.    Under the law, national and ethnic minorities in Hungary may  set up their own local bodies of self-administration in  villages, towns and the districts of Budapest, as well as a  national body of self- administration, whose members are to be  elected from local representatives.    The size and scope of authority of a local minority  administration depends on the proportion of minority  representatives in its locality. If over half of the members in  a local administration represent a minority, it can be turned  entirely into a minority government. If at least 30 percent of  the local representatives come from a minority group, they can  form their own minority government within the local one, with  limited authority. If minority representatives make up less than  30 percent of a local government, the minority government has to  be elected separately, at the request of at least 100 citizens  in villages, and of 500 citizens in towns.    Minority local administrations may decide on issues that  directly affect them, and on the allocation of educational and  cultural subsidies. Their consent is needed for the appointment  of leaders for local minority institutions. They may start  businesses, call tenders, grant scholarships, and summon the  competent authorities in cases affecting minorities.    The law also provides for minorities without representatives  to elect a local minority spokesperson.    The local elections due this autumn will be the first to  include minorities, whose national self-administration body is  expected to be established before the end of the year. This  body will make independent decisions on setting up and running  educational and cultural institutions, and the scheduling of  minority programmes on radio and television. It will  participate in the professional supervision of minority  education and assess legal measures that affect minorities.    An ombudsman is expected to be elected in 1994, to represent  the interests of minorities in Parliament.    Of the 12 national minorities, only eight can realize their  right of self-administration, due to the low density of their  population in certain localities. Those obtaining this right  are the Greek, Croatian, German, Romanian, Ruthenian, Serbian,  Slovak and Slovenian minorities.    Of the 600 Hungarian settlements with an option for  establishing some form of local government for minorities, 200  wish to set up their own bodies. (In Hungary, there are 3,100  settlements.) The 220,000-strong German minority, living in over  400 settlements, intends to form 130 representative bodies; the  110,000-strong Slovak minority in only 20-30 of the 105 they  live in; the 70-90,000-strong Croatian community in 10-20 of  their 50 settlements; the 25-40,000-strong Romanian community in  5-10 settlements out of their 30-35; the 5,000-strong Serb  minority in all of its six settlements; the 5,000-strong  Slovenian population in every one of its seven villages; the  3,000-strong Ruthenian minority in one or two out of their ten;  while the 3-5,000-strong Greek community, which is scattered,  has only one village with enough citizens to form a local body.

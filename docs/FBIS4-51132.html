			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (CNS)--Deputy directors of Civil  Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Mr Jiang Zhuping, Mr Li  Zhao, Mr Shen Yuankang and Mr Bao Peide distributed assessment  cards to hundreds of domestic and foreign passengers in the  departure building of the Capital International Airport for  collection of opinion on CAAC service. Such practice is aimed  at helping CAAC improve its service.    The service improvement campaign which began last year  aroused so much concern from various sectors, according to the  spokesman Mr Bao Peide [sentence as received]. As the handling  capacity of CAAC boosted to some extent, problems including  difficulties in buying air tickets as well as serious shortage  of service facilities and equipment had been settled to a  certain degree. Awareness of market competition and of better  service held by various branches of CAAC were strengthened.  Frigid manner in offering service, poor access to information on  flight, poor service seen in irregular flight schedule, delayed  handling of luggage and goods as well as problems concerning  damage to and loss of items and fraudulent claims, however,  still existed which aroused strong dissatisfaction. Mr Bao  added that CAAC was determined to adopt measures to further  solve all these problems in a bid to reverse the poor reputation  for civil aviation service.    It is announced that the measures include inspection on 17  air companies for their civil aviation service and 17 airports  which see a heavy flow of passengers. Quality standard and  regulations of civil aviation service will be closely examined.  Inspectors will be specially hired to achieve this end. The  rating of all these civil aviation establishments will be made  for rewards and punishments.    Distribution of 100,000 assessment cards will be available  in  order to collect opinion on air service. A lucky draw is  possible for the return of the cards. The deputy director of  CAAC Mr Shen Yuankang said that the measures were aimed at  encouraging civil aviation entities to make passengers and the  market their criteria for better service.    The spokesman and deputy director Mr Bao Peide said that  quality of service offered by CAAC would improve year by year in  a bid to enable the aviation establishment in a period of time  between three and five years to reach medium- and even  high-level in the international community in terms of service  offered.</p>

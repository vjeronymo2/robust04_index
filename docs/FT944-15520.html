			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Quality time British Rail travellers be warned: the system is running out of timetables. London's Kings Cross station, for example, no longer stocks timetables for journeys to Bournemouth or Liverpool. 'We haven't had all the timetables since British Rail was split up in April,' says an assistant. Look on the bright side: if there are no timetables, at least you won't be worrying about trains running on time and all that nonsense.</p>

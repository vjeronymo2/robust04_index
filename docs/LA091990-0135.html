			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO SOLVE THE COMPUTER PUZZLE;  </P> <P> TRAINING FACILITIES HUSTLE TO KEEP PACE WITH A GADGET HARD TO BRING TO HEEL  </P> <P> Despite the computer's penetration of our society, only a small percentage of  us have become friendly with the creatures.  </P> <P> Computers have a way of discouraging even the motivated user. "I don't think  there's any other consumable item that people buy that requires so much  training," says Bill Hoffman, co-owner of Hoffman Computer Systems in Anaheim.  "People perceive a computer as a commodity; it's not."  </P> <P> Says Michael Brinda, president of New Horizons Computer Learning Center in  Santa Ana, "You're sold the machine and have an elevated sense of how easy it  will be."  </P> <P> For people at all levels of familiarity with computers, Orange County schools  and businesses offer classes ranging from a few hours to six months that can be  combined in a variety of ways to take you from total ignorance to expertise  without excessive agony.  </P> <P> Hands-on instruction has at least one overwhelming benefit: Procedures that may  take hours to deduce from a manual can be often taught in a few minutes.  </P> <P> An inexpensive route to learning the computer lies in Orange County's community  college system. Semester-long classes walk students through the basics, giving  the student plenty of time to become comfortable with the computer.  </P> <P> At Orange Coast College, which has more than 250 computers for training,  classes fill to capacity every semester.  </P> <P> "We have two missions," says Bob Wilson, dean of the Business Education  Division. "First, to provide education for students going on to a four-year  school. Second, providing technical skills for people to get a job or to  increase knowledge for the job market."  </P> <P> Classes are equally divided between beginners and people coming in for  upgrading and retraining, Wilson says. Courses in such applications as  WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 are extremely popular. He calls "C" programming  "monstrous" right now in its appeal to engineers and aspiring programmers. And  in addition to its IBM PC-compatible computers, Orange Coast College has an  Apple Macintosh lab.  </P> <P> Computers have even infiltrated the typing courses at Orange Coast. "Our typing  classes are taught on IBM PC's. We have no typewriters," Wilson says. "For the  first three minutes, students are panicked, and then they love it. They see  they're learning practical, real-world situations."  </P> <P> The retention rate in the community college's computer classes is almost 70%,  which Wilson notes is extremely good. "We keep a pretty good pulse on what the  business community wants. As business quits using programs, we start phasing  them out."  </P> <P> Similar computer courses are offered at Coastline, Saddleback and the other  county community colleges. Most of the schools also offer short courses ranging  from one day to nine weeks through their community service programs.  </P> <P> A number of private learning centers have sprung up throughout the county to  meet the rising demand for computer training.  </P> <P> * The New Horizons Computer Learning Center, which Michael Brinda started in  1982, offers 640 classes covering roughly 100 different subjects, delivered in  one- and two-day bites. Prices range from $49 to $348. The center also offers a  club program where, for $598, students can take all the classes they want for  six months.  </P> <P> The ages of New Horizons students range across the board, Brinda says. The  common denominator is that they're employed. "Most clients are beginners to an  application, although most are somewhat computer literate," Brinda says. "The  majority of New Horizon clients are from small- and medium-sized companies.  Companies will hire us to do training for them."  </P> <P> New Horizons is an authorized education center for such manufacturers as Apple  Computers and Novell, which distributes a popular local area network. "Novell  classes are growing, growing, growing," Brinda says.  </P> <P> Instructors use not only computers and textbooks, but projectors that show  monitor screens on the wall. The average class size is about 12, though some  have more than 20 students.  </P> <P> New Horizons' classes center largely on applications and operating systems. "We  don't teach programming. You can't teach that in substance in a day or two,"  Brinda says.  </P> <P> New Horizons also provides day-long training courses at such schools as the UC  Irvine, Rio Hondo, Cerritos and Pasadena City College, usually through the  community services division, for $89 a day.  </P> <P> * At the Computer Learning Center in Anaheim, the program is oriented toward  students looking to develop a solid grounding in one of three areas of  specialization. Most students are full time, attending either day or evening  classes for six months, says Al Nederhood, director of the CLC.  </P> <P> Students can choose to focus on programming, computer operations or  microcomputer systems. The most popular concentration is mainframe operations  and management, Nederhood says. Students learn to work on an IBM mainframe  computer similar to what they'll find at many mid-sized and large firms.  </P> <P> The typical student at CLC is looking for salable skills and, often, a new  career. Sixty to 70% of the 200-plus students are working, but they're not  employer sponsored, Nederhood says. "We're looking for the full-time student  who wants more than an introduction. We're more intensive and in-depth. We're  not interested in leading edge. We offer what's going to help our students get  jobs."  </P> <P> CLC maintains a separate department of graduate services, and such employers as  Rockwell, TRW, Hughes and Home Club regularly interview CLC's graduates.  </P> <P> The programming and operations tracks cost $6,150 each, while the microcomputer  systems specialist track is $5,775.  </P> <P> * Someone who has just bought a personal computer may be able to find training  through the store where he or she bought the equipment. This wasn't always true  in the earlier days of the personal computer, when buyers were often left to  fend for themselves, and which is why so many personal computers are gathering  dust.  </P> <P> These days, the personal computer marketplace has grown increasingly  competitive, and training has become a more important factor in selling a  system, says Ralph Cooper, the educational manager at Hoffman Computer Systems  in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The store runs regular classes to train its clients in computers and software,  having found that users often had great difficulty setting up the systems on  their own. "That's where the Macintosh shines; there's not so much jargon, and  the interface is similar from one program to the next," Cooper says.  </P> <P> Hoffman's class sizes range from one-on-one to groups of 20 or 30. Some  students are looking to learn to use what they have just purchased. Others are  seeking to familiarize themselves with applications programs that are widely  used in their fields. "People come in to make themselves more marketable,"  Cooper says.  </P> <P> Mike Soto, Hoffman Computer's sales manager for IBM-compatible systems, teaches  AutoCad, a program for civil engineering. Many of the engineers Soto encounters  have a basic drafting and design background but are not yet computer literate.  </P> <P> Hoffman's instructors have found that if they make training goal-oriented, that  is, orient training sessions to actual projects in which the students are  involved, understanding comes more quickly. "We show them what they want to  see, with their own work," Soto says.  </P> <P> Cooper often finds that people new to computing have trouble distinguishing  between the computer's operation and the job they want done.  </P> <P> In one common scenario, for example, the owner of a new business may be trying  to learn both how to operate the computer and how to handle the accounting for  his business. He doesn't have enough background in either to know where the  computing part ends and the accounting begins.  </P> <P> As Cooper puts it, "The computer will not make an accountant out of you."  </P> <P> To the minimally trained customer, this doesn't seem to make sense. "We were  getting continual calls not on the hardware, not on the software, but about how  to run their businesses."  </P> <P> When any dealer sells a software package, the new user may find himself with a  pile of manuals and absolutely no idea of how to set up the software for his  business. When Hoffman Computers sells a specialized program such as an  accounting package, it recommends consultants who can set up the program, in  essence tuning it to the user's hardware.  </P> <P> While computers will occasionally frustrate their users, the concepts that the  average person needs to use a personal computer for, say, word processing or  spreadsheets, are not especially difficult to grasp. Classes offer shortcuts  through the learning process, reducing the trial-and-error floundering that  makes learning from the manual so tedious. DAN LOGAN  </P></p>

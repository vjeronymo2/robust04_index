			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John von Radowitz and Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> correspondents]    [Text] An elite squad of British SAS [Special Air Service]  troops in Gorazde tonight directed U.S. war planes to bomb Serb  forces threatening the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde. The  seven-strong highly specialised unit gave precise locations of  Serb forces surrounding the enclave. Two U.S. F-16s joined the  NATO attack and destroyed at least two Serb tanks.  Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN  forces in Bosnia, called for the action after Serb forces  reached the outskirts of the town where some 65,000 people have  been holed up by the fighting. Several patrol groups from the  Hereford-based SAS regiment were ordered into a number of Muslim  enclaves following a specific request from Gen Rose, himself a  former SAS officer and commander. Trained to operate in small  self-sufficient patrol teams they are the ideal reconnaissance  troops to feed back information on front line positions and  weapons.    UN military sources in Zagreb said of the SAS soldiers:  "They  were providing information on the ground which would have a  bearing on air support." The decision to mount the attack came  after a crisis meeting in Sarajevo between Gen Rose and his  superior, General Bernard de Lapresle, the commander in charge  of all UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, an United Nations  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said. Gen Rose had earlier  been en route to Brussels but turned back in Split because of  the gravity of the situation.    U.S. planes have engaged Serb air forces over Bosnia in the  past but this was the first premeditated strike of its kind. It  was also the first time NATO had launched air strikes to deter  Serb forces from attacking a UN-declared "safe area" in Bosnia.  The threat of air strikes forced the Serbs to withdraw their  guns from Sarajevo in February.    Major Dacre Holloway, the UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo,  said the airstrike operation was "still on-going" and damage  assessment was under way. He said no British planes had been  involved in the strike. "They are NATO aircraft involved -- we  do not discriminate between them," he added. "Damage assessment  is taking place. The whole operation is on-going at the  moment," he added.</p>

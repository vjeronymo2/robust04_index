The group outlines three forecasts: low growth, in which consumers continue to save at the present rate; high growth, with a sharp swing from saving to spending; and a central case, which it prefers. That, it says, would see growth consistent with government predictions. UK gross domestic product should rise by 1 per cent this year. The report argues that, with the election past, the government's priority is the strength of the recovery rather than its timing. There is therefore no need to cut interest rates quickly. Although that keeps sterling strong, it need not damage exports because labour costs should stay competitive over the next few years. With world trade rising, exports should grow by 4 per cent both this year and next. A National Westminster Bank report at the weekend said the government had room for only a  1/2 -percentage-point cut in rates. Further reductions depended on German rates. The Oxford group's report tempers its confident tone by warning that consumers might continue to cut their debts for the next two or three years. Exporters in tourism, banking and other contributors to invisible earnings are confident that sales will grow this year. A survey of 80 exporters by AT Kearney, the management consultancy, found more than two thirds expecting an improvement in 1992. The Continentis the main market.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Peoples Jewellers enters bankruptcy protection BURDENED by debt and the worst retail conditions in 60 years, Peoples Jewellers, a Canadian jewellery store chain, has entered bankruptcy protection. Peoples, 73 years old and operating 268 jewellery stores across the country, was granted protection from creditors until March 31 by the Ontario Court. It must work out a restructuring programme with creditors by that date. Peoples' problems go back to the 1986 debt-financed acquisition of Zale Corp, the largest US jewellery chain, in partnership with Switzerland's Swarovski family for USDollars 650m. Zale operates under US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Peoples has written-off its Zale investment. Last week, Peoples missed a CDollars 1.2m debenture interest payment. In the six months ended September 30, it lost CDollars 15.2m, or CDollars 1.24 a share.</p>

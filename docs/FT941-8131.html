			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth helps Ashtead leap to Pounds 3.3m Ashtead, the plant and machinery hire group which had a Pounds 20.4m rights issue in November, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 3.26m in the six months to October 31. Although the shares fell 12p to 439p yesterday, they have been rising sharply from the 378p level of a fortnight ago. With organic growth coming from all three divisions, Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said that operational gearing of the business - underpinned by maintained, and even increased, investment across the group throughout the recession - lay behind the sharp profits rise. During the period, capital expenditure rose to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.3m) and is expected to be Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 4m) in the second half. Group turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 16.8m) with volumes up 24 per cent. Mr Lewis said that further volume growth was the short-term aim, though there had been sporadic price increases of between 2 and 3 per cent on some lines since last spring. A-Plant, the core UK plant hire business, raised operating profits to Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 1.47m) on turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 13.4m). Ashtead Technology, the offshore services division, lifted profits to Pounds 603,000 (Pounds 489,000) on turnover lower at Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.37m) after the withdrawal from low margin sales programmes. A Singapore branch was opened in January. Sunbelt, the US plant hire side, increased profits six times to Pounds 442,000 (Pounds 74,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.1m). This year it is spending Pounds 1.3m on plant: next year the figure will be Pounds 3m. Earnings per share more than doubled from 5.2p to 10.9p and the interim dividend is raised to 1.3p (1.133p). COMMENT At this stage in its development, Ashtead leaves the cynic clutching at non-existent straws. There will be fewer billings days in the second half - 115 against the first half's 129 - so volume growth will ease slightly. But even if prices don't firm as they are half-expected to, that will hardly dent the group's progress, as, apart from anything else, interest charges will fall as the rights' Pounds 8m cash pile offsets previous borrowings. The management has steered the group through the recession admirably - investing heavily, not rushing at fences in the US, using profit-sharing schemes well - and they can afford to look a little smug. With Pounds 5.5m pre-tax pencilled in, giving earnings of about 16.5p, the p/e is 26.5. With no profits decelaration likely at least until 1997, the shares are worth staying with.</p>

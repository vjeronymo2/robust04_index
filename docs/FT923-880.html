			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (2): Success in a highly competitive market  -Venturer of the Year Award WHEN THEY first met seven years ago, Adrian Breger (pictured left) was production director of a medical and hygienic disposables company, and Jamie Gibson the finance director of a children's clothing manufacturing company, struggling against low-priced imports. Today, they are the joint managing directors of their own company employing around 310 people in Holywell, Clwyd, with a turnover in 1991-2 of Pounds 24m, making disposable nappies in competition with some of the largest multi-national corporations. They have the satisfaction, too, of being chosen as the third overall winners of the Venturer of the Year Award, sponsored by the Financial Times, Cartier, the jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association. The award, now in its third year, is for the individual who has made the best use of venture capital funds. Disposable nappies have been a fast-growing sector in recent years, replacing terry nappies in all developed markets, including the UK, where the traditional product is now down to 15 per cent. Despite the dominance, however, of groups such as Proctor &amp; Gamble (which is estimated to have about 60 per cent of the UK market through Pampers), and the Swedish group, Molnlycke (which owns the other big brand, Peaudouce), Breger and Gibson were convinced there was a profitable niche for a manufacturer able to supply a high quality product to the own-label market. Their vision was backed with an initial loan of Pounds 225,000 by 3i in Manchester, which recognised the two men's complementary strengths. A further Pounds l7m to finance equipment purchases came from the Christiania Bank of Norway, enabling production to begin in August 1986. By 1989, with the company growing fast, further funding was needed to purchase new production lines and to enlarge the premises. 3i subscribed for nearly Pounds 1m of share capital with a private backer, Michael lnnes, a former school friend of Jamie Gibson, also taking a substantial equity stake, and the role of non-executive chairman. At the same time, loan finance was provided at favourable rates by the ECSC because of the contribution the company could make to employment in a part of north-east Wales hit by steel, textile and other closures. New loans totalling Pounds l84m were provided again last year by Christiania, ECSC, and Hill Samuel, again mainly to finance new machinery. Because of the delicate task it has to perform, the nappy requires continuing high levels of performance, and what appears to have won for the company increasing sales and a growing share of the market, while some other small companies have disappeared, has been its ability to keep up, and, in some cases, surpass the bigger groups in technical innovation. Though basically a cellulose-based pad of fluffed paper, sandwiched between an outer cover of polythene and an inner sheet (or coverstock) of spun-bonded polypropylene, the disposable nappy has been subject to several thousand worldwide patents and to big courtroom confrontations between the big groups over alleged infringements of each other's trade secrets. According to Breger, a 53-year-old South African who came to Britain 20 years ago, Breger Gibson has avoided becoming embroiled in these disputes by using only proprietary technology, developed in conjunction with its suppliers. Innovations include an internal waistband system, a cuff to prevent leakage, and a special design for the different anatomies of boys and girls - a gender specific window in nappyspeak. The company's initial breakthrough in 1986 was a contract to supply a budget chemist private label brand, followed by deals with Toys 'R Us and other stores. Important clients now include Asda, J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Gateway, Safeway, Mothercare, and Aldi, taking the company to around a 40 per cent share of the own label sector and 8 per cent of the market overall. Profits to date, and hence the return to investors, have been relatively modest with the company only managing Pounds l1m profits pre-tax last year. With several years of heavy capital investment and research behind it, however, the company is hoping for improvement over the next few years. When its new fourth line is fully operational shortly, total capacity will be in excess of 5m nappies a week. Development is also nearing completion on an innovation which could be of considerable significance. Space is running out in landfill sites in the US and elsewhere, and the disposable nappy has for some time been under attack from environmentalists because of the numbers involved, the product's bulkiness - and its content. As a result, a race is on among manufacturers to develop a biodegradeable product which will reduce disposal problems. Breger Gibson claims to be well on the way to a solution, and believes this could offer it the opportunity to increase greatly its market share. With the UK market's growth likely to slow as terry substitution ceases, the company is also planning to move into export markets, where its presence has so far been limited - 'we concentrated initially on the home market where import penetration was as high as 70 per cent. Europe now offers excellent opportunities for growth,' 46-year-old Gibson points out. Yet, while the company has been successful to date, there are risks in being a small fish in a big pool. What would happen, as one of the award judges questioned, if P&amp;G decided that Messrs B&amp;G 'were eating their lunch'? Jamie Gibson does not under-estimate the determination or resources which P&amp;G, which has itself built a new nappy factory in Manchester, could throw into a battle with the company. Kimberley Clark, number two in the US, is also building a plant in the northeast of England, possibly prior to entering the European market. Gibson points out, however, that as it presently stands, the British market, is unbalanced and smaller rivals are needed to avoid the creation of a monopoly. P&amp;G, too, has traditionally not supplied Breger Gibson's chosen area, the own label market which research findings suggest will continue to grow at the expense of brands. Breger Gibson itself has a small branded range, but this is unlikely to be developed substantially because of the huge marketing costs. By contrast, because they can achieve a higher mark-up on own-label goods, the big supermarket chains have been happy, according to Gibson, to promote these against rival products, offering Breger Gibson nappies prime positions in-store and supporting them with advertising. The next stage of Breger Gibson's expansion, using a 20-acre site around the existing plant, will be a move into other product areas to lessen dependence on nappies. Though no decisions have yet been made, it is likely the company will turn its attention to the incontinence market - growing as the population of Europe ages - and to feminine hygiene products. In these areas, too, the objective will be to develop proprietary products competing on performance and quality.</p>

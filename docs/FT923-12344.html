			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): An innovative way of raising money - The vogue for securitisation THE global market for asset-backed, or securitised, debt has expanded further this year, but development is being hampered by regulatory roadblocks in nascent markets and by the effects of economic recession in the more mature markets. The year has been marked by a number of innovative deals, such as the first securitisation of Latin American government debt, and GPA Group's ground-breaking Dollars 500m issue backed by aircraft leases. In securitisation, an issuer removes assets from its balance sheet and repackages them as bonds which are then sold to investors. In the US, by far the world's largest market, the decline in consumer credit has led to a decrease in activity in some areas of the asset-backed market. Total asset-backed issuance for the first half of 1992 reached Dollars 22.13bn, 5 per cent below 1991, according CapMac's ABS MarketWatch, a newsletter published by one of the market's specialist insurers. Demand for loans has dropped sharply, and consumer installment credit has been declining as a percentage of income since late 1989. Meanwhile, better access to equity markets has allowed many banks to strengthen their balance sheets, so the drive to meet regulatory capital-to-assets ratios is no longer a key motivation for banks to shed assets. However, the US market still has considerable growth potential. Securitisation of some assets, such as car and boat loans, is on the increase. As a percentage of total installment debt, securitisation is growing steadily. Penetration of the credit card market is substantial and securitisation in the car loan sector represents less than 10 per cent of the total available, according to estimates by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. The lack of supply has boosted demand, as the low interest rate environment in the US encouraged investors to buy securities offering yields above the US Treasury market. In June, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, the Japanese car manufacturer's US financing arm, paid a yield spread only 40 basis points above the comparable US Treasury rate for a Dollars 600m issue of bonds backed by car loans, a full 20 basis points below the previous record low spread. The same week, MBNA, the US bank, set a record low yield spread of 55 basis points on a Dollars 500m issue of credit card-backed bonds. Analysts believe that when the economy begins to heat up, demand for loans will re-emerge, bringing bank liquidity under renewed pressure and fuelling bank demand for capital. At that point, securitisation will again become an attractive alternative source of funds for banks. Meanwhile, the US mortgage-backed market has come through a potentially traumatic period in surprisingly good shape. The Dollars 1,000bn sector has experienced record volume so far this year, after lower interest rates prompted homeowners to prepay existing mortgages and take out new debt at lower rates, triggering early redemption of billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities. Despite the negative impact of prepayment, demand for the surge of fresh paper has remained firm, with high levels of re-investment reported. In addition, the market 'has been a direct beneficiary of new capital requirements', said Mr Michael Waldman, head of mortgage research at Salomon Brothers, since mortgage-backed securities command a low risk weighting, increasing their attractiveness for US banks. Under Basle capital adequacy guidelines, securities backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) carry a 20 per cent risk weighting in the US. In the UK, the most developed market outside the US, the depressed state of the housing market continues to cast a pall over the sterling mortgage-backed sector. Together with the deteriorating credit quality of several UK composite insurers, which provide some credit enhancement, the housing slump has led to a number of downgradings in the Pounds 12bn market. Also, the continued threat that bank investors may have to apply a 100 per cent risk weighting, when capital guidelines come into effect in 1993, has reduced the most important pool of investors in the UK. Increasingly wary of credit quality, investors have been demanding higher yields and tailor-made structures. Although that has kept the market alive, 'attention has been diverted away from the fundamentals of establishing a homogeneous product, considered both dependable and attractive by the investment community,' according to Mr Mark Stadler, head of securitisation at Merrill Lynch in London. Elsewhere in Europe, long-expected moves to create a more friendly environment for securitisation are on the way. France, which introduced its securitisation law in 1988, is set to broaden the types of assets which can be securitised, though credit card receivables are still not likely to be allowed due to fears of a credit card boom. Spain also looks promising, after legislators passed a law allowing the creation of closed-end funds which will act as issuing vehicles; but tax treatment still has to be clarified. In Japan, where banks and other financial institutions short of capital would clearly benefit from being allowed to securitise assets, a long-awaited package of reforms has disappointed market participants. Such restrictions are likely to limit the marketability of such debt in the domestic market, according to analysts. Also, a forbidding range of authorisation from various government departments is still required before companies can proceed, leading Moody's to conclude in a recent report that the easing of Japan's regulations 'is more a signal of regulatory willingness to consider asset securitisation than approval to proceed'.</p>

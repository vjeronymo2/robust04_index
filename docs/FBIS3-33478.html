In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated  that the cease-fire can contribute to the successful conclusion,  in the short-term, of the negotiations under way in Lusaka, the  capital of Zambia, between the Angolan Government and National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) guerrillas.    The note emphasizes that both sides should accept the result  of the elections held in September 1992, in which Angolan  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos emerged as the winner, and  should observe the UN Security Council resolutions calling for a  cease-fire.    The Brazilian Government stated that the aggravation of the  Angolan war in the past few weeks "is more deplorable at a time  in which there were sound hopes for peace on the basis of the  conversations under way in Lusaka."</p>

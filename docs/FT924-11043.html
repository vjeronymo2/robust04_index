			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Delors calls for joint effort to head off slump A CO-ORDINATED economic growth package for Europe to head off a potential 1930s-style slump is being urged on EC leaders by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Amid concern about the deteriorating economic situation in Germany and its impact on faltering Italy and Britain, Mr Delors is pressing leaders to discuss measures to reinforce monetary co-operation, boost investment, and revive confidence. Without such action, he believes, public support for the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union will ebb further, casting doubts on the goal of a single European currency by the end of the century. In a speech yesterday to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Delors called for a debate on growth at the Edinburgh summit in December. He is backed by Mr Henning Christophersen, financial affairs commissioner, who said last week that the worsening situation should be at the 'core' of the summit. So far, however, Mr Delors feels he has been 'muzzled' by EC leaders worried about the impact of comments on the financial markets, according to close colleagues. Britain's cool reaction has also been disappointing, according to a senior Commission official. Mr Delors is understood to share some of Mr John Major's concerns about the functioning of the exchange rate mechanism in the run-up to the withdrawal of sterling and the Italian lira last month. Mr Delors is said to be less impressed with Mr Major's solo effort to kick-start growth, believing that a co-ordinated strategy inside the EC would be far more effective. He has ordered staff, therefore, to prepare an intensive analysis of the ERM crisis as well as new ideas to break the deflationary cycle in Europe, to be presented if possible in Edinburgh. His case for a new growth EC strategy amounts partly to a political comeback after several bitter disappointments. 'He wants to reassert his influence,' said an aide. But his initiative is also a recognition that the Maastricht treaty's economic convergence criteria are leading inexorably toward deflation in Europe, particularly in countries with large budget deficits such as Italy. He is therefore warning fellow commissioners that without compensatory 'cohesion' financing for the poorer EC members, there could be a 'catastrophe'. This financing is the centrepiece of the Delors II package for increasing the EC's budget.</p>

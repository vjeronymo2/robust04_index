			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment 4: Bouncing back - Profile: BNP THE success of Banque Nationale de Paris' privatisation this year was critical to the prospects of the rest of the Balladur government's privatisation programme. The government did everything it could to ensure the issue was a success - from launching a lavish advertising campaign to pricing BNP's shares, at FFr240 each, well below market expectations. To the government's relief, the issue was indeed a roaring success. Michel Pebereau, who was this summer parachuted into the BNP chairman's seat from Credit Commercial de France, now faces the challenge of getting to grips with the management of one of Europe's biggest banks. Analysts are confident that there is lots of scope for improvement. BNP saw net profits fall sharply to FFr552m in the first half of this year after sliding to FFr2.1bn in 1992 from FFr2.6bn in 1991. However, most observers suspect that Mr Pebereau has taken an aggressive stance on provisioning. There is also plenty of potential for cost-cutting and for weeding out the poor performers among BNP's peripheral interests. The consensus is that BNP, aided and abetted by Dresdner Bank, its new German ally, should soon bounce back to profits growth.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BANQUE NATIONALE DE PARIS (BNP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Market capitalisation on issue price         FFr43bn Government stake  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Net banking income           FFr40bn         FFr38bn Net profits                 FFr2.1bn        FFr2.9bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

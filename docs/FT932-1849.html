			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Groping for Trouts in a Peculiar River - Theatre I had forgotten until bombarded by a series of missives from the Sturdy Beggars Company that 'groping for trouts in a peculiar river' is a line from Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. It comes just after Mistress Overdone has lamented: 'Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and what with the poverty, I am custom-shrunk,' the suggestion being that all is not well in the state of England, as indeed around 1604 it wasn't. There was a war with Spain, a plague in London, executions at Winchester, not to speak of a general economic recession. Measure for Measure has always seemed the most complex of Shakespeare's plays and quite different from the rest in that it seeks to pose a genuine moral dilemma. Should Isabella sleep with Angelo in order to gain a pardon for her brother, Claudio, who is about to executed for adultery? Or should Claudio understand that such an act would be a sacrifice too far for a woman who is about to become a nun, and prepare to meet his death? There is also a strongly political content. The old paternalist Duke has departed and ceded power to a man who is expected to clean up the liberal excesses of the ancien regime. It turns out that his appointed deputy, who in this production looks remarkably like an earnest Tory prime minister out of his depth, is not nearly as pure as he seems. So it is not surprising that the Sturdy Beggars, a newish company that combines a lot of the 1970s/80s British left, should have gone in for an up-date. Here is a good half of the original Measure for Measure, plus modern glosses. For example, Marianna, the girl who happily stands in for Isabella in the dreadful deed, turns out to be the daughter of a press baron, Robert Melville. She has known Angelo at Cambridge and is more than willing to return to him. There are many other references spread over history. You will find Mancini, Sergeant Musgrave and Robert Browning listed in the programme, and a heavy police presence all round. Some of it is very well done. I liked the nuns playing scrabble with the letters in what looks like the silver communion cup and taking delicious pleasure from triple word scores. All the original Shakespeare lines are very well-spoken, especially by Richard Attlee as Angelo and Gerard Doyle's Claudio. Even for the most politically-minded, however, translating Measure for Measure into a parable for the British left raises insuperable questions. In so far as it reaches a conclusion at all, Shakespeare's play seems to say three cheers for paternalism. It is rather like the Labour Party singing 'Jerusalem', nostalgia for the past rather than belief in the future. Does the new left really regard benevolent despotism as the last best hope? There is a more practical reservation. Measure for Measure is a complex enough play to start with. It is hard to expect to bring in a new audience by chopping it up. You will have to be quite well read, not only in Shakespeare, to have much of a chance of following it. The very professional direction is by Stephen Jameson who is also responsible for the adaptation. And Groping for Trouts in a Peculiar River is a very good title. Battersea Arts until July 18.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp pre-tax fall at Inchcape Timuran group INCHCAPE Timuran, the Malaysian trading group, has posted a 47 per cent fall in group pre-tax profits to MDollars 13.34 (USDollars 5m) for 1992 from MDollars 25.31m in 1991, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Turnover rose slightly to MDollars 376.32m from MDollars 346.52m. Inchcape said earnings were hit by slower growth in sales of consumer products and high interest rates while exports were hurt by the strengthening of the Malaysian dollar. The company was cautious about 1993, saying an easing of credit restrictions had yet to lift sales of consumer goods. Boustead, the Malaysian conglomerate, unveiled net profits of MDollars 12.74m for the first half to December 31 up 2 per cent from a year earlier, Reuter reports.</p>

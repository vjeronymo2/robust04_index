			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Arm the Whole Army With the Theory of Building Socialism </F> With Chinese Characteristics--Impressions of Leading Comrades  From Some Major Military Units After Studying Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"]    [Text] "Deeply Understanding the Strategic Idea of  Maintaining Stability" by Li Jiulong [2621 0046 7893]    The idea that stability exceeds everything else in  importance  is an extremely important idea which runs right through Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  [Selected Works]. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out  powerfully that stability is the crux for China's development  and strengthening. Studying this idea by Comrade Xiaoping is of  major significance in our doing well in the various aspects of  reform and construction work.    The Selected Works elaborate on the idea that  stability is more important than everything else from many  angles, many sides, and many levels. We can sum up the ideas in  the following points:    Stability is in accord with the highest and greatest  interests of our party, our Army, and the people of all  nationalities in our country. Without a stable political  situation and a stable social environment, there would be no  speedy economic growth, no social development and the people  would not be able to live and work in peace. If we are to  continually consolidate and perfect the socialist system in  practice, we must have a political and social environment which  has long-term stability. Otherwise, the socialist system, which  has been created through the sacrifices and the blood of  millions of people, will not be consolidated and safeguarded and  could even face the danger of dissolution. As Comrade Xiaoping  has pointed out: "A collapse can occur overnight. Collapsing is  easy, construction is very difficult." The 40-plus years of  history since the establishment of New China have powerfully  proven that, with a stable political situation and social  environment, our socialist cause has been able to achieve very  rapid development but, as soon as the situation of stability is  destroyed, our socialist revolution and construction loses its  vigor and vitality. Especially during the 10 years of internal  disorder during the "Cultural Revolution," our socialist economy  was pushed to the point of collapse, resulting in a greater  disparity between our country and the developed countries of the  world. Thus, maintaining stability is in the highest interests  of the party and the state. At the same time, under the  socialist system, stability is also a social goal. If the  country is at peace, the people are at peace. If the people can  live in peace, they are happy in their work. This reflects the  greatest interests of our country's people.    Seek stability through reform, opening up and development.  Comrade Xiaoping's expositions and the practical experiences of  reform and opening up over the more than last 10 years tell us  that in the process of reform and development, there is a need  for a stable political and social environment. Without a stable  environment, nothing else can be even talked about, nothing else  can be achieved, and even the achievements which have already  been scored will be lost. Meanwhile, upholding reform and  opening up is a basic condition for long-term peace and  stability. Only by reforming the ossified structure and  establishing a socialist market economy structure, and  accelerating economic development, will it be possible to  further consolidate the socialist system and thereby essentially  maintain stability. Thus, understanding and grasping well the  internal relationships between stability, reform, and  development are leadership requirements and leadership skills  necessary for leading comrades at all levels and especially  high-level leading comrades.    Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100  years is the political basis for maintaining stability.  Upholding reform and opening up, engaging in economic  construction with one heart and one mind, and taking the  development of the social productive forces as the basic task at  the present stage, will lay down a base for the long-term  stability of the state. The four cardinal principles are the  basic principles on which the state is based. They are the  political orientation and the political principles with which we  must be in accord in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. If the party leaders are able to increase the  cohesion and centripetal force of the people of all  nationalities throughout the country, it will be a basic  political guarantee for maintaining social stability. The  essence of socialism is the liberating and development of the  productive forces, the elimination of exploitation, the removal  of polarization, and the eventual realization of common  prosperity. This superior social system provides system  guarantees for maintaining a stable political order and creates  beneficial social conditions. The people's democratic  dictatorship is a powerful guarantee and weapon for achieving  social stability. Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is a  powerful spiritual motivation and spiritual prop in engaging in  socialist construction and reform. Comrade Xiaoping has fully  affirmed that Mao Zedong Thought is still the guiding ideology  of our party. This has major and deep significance in terms of  maintaining the ideological unity of the whole party, in  unifying to open up a new road for developing the socialist  cause, and in guaranteeing that our party and state can pass the  rigorous tests of the rapidly changing international situation.    In maintaining stability we must take a clear-cut stand in  opposing bourgeois liberalization. On the subject of opposing  bourgeois liberalization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said much.  He astutely pointed out: "If China engages in bourgeois  liberalization, there will certainly be chaos, resulting in our  being unable to achieve anything. Then, the line, principles  and policies, and the three-stage development strategy targets  we have formulated will all fizzle out." In his speeches while  inspecting the south, Comrade Xiaoping also laid stress on this  issue, pointing out: "We must continue to grasp this with both  hands. One hand must grasp reform and opening up and one hand  must strike at various types of economic crimes. We must  maintain a tight grip with both these hands. In striking at  various types of criminal activities and sweeping away various  types of odious activities, we cannot relax our grip." In this  respect, we must maintain an extremely clear mind. In  accordance with the expositions by Comrade Xiaoping, in  maintaining stability we must strengthen the building of a legal  system, punish corruption, and carry out education in ideals,  morality, culture, and discipline for cadres and the masses, to  strengthen the building of spiritual civilization.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has required that "comrades working  in the various work posts must jointly shoulder responsibility  for safeguarding, guaranteeing, and developing this political  situation of unity and stability." The People's Armed Forces,  as an important component part of the state machinery, is even  more duty-bound by this responsibility. This requires that our  armed forces do the following: A. We must grasp the  safeguarding of stability as a long-term political task. B. We  must put efforts into improving the fighting strength and  deterrent power of the armed forces. The stronger the fighting  strength of the armed forces, the greater their deterrent effect  on domestic and foreign enemy forces and the greater will be the  guarantee of the security and stability of the state. Thus, it  is necessary to centralize efforts in training the armed forces  well, in improving the fighting strength of the armed forces,  and in building them into a powerful, civilized, and indomitable  army so that we can take on the glorious task of safeguarding  national security and safeguarding social stability. C.  Increasingly close links must be developed between the army and  the government and between the army and the people, so as to  form iron and steel walls for safeguarding social stability.  Unity between the army and the government and between the army  and the people and the unity of all nationalities are important  safeguards for safeguarding social stability. At all times, we  must breathe as one with the masses and share their fate, and  maintain and bring into play the fine tradition of army-people  unity seen during the revolutionary war years. We must  strengthen the close links with the relevant local departments  so that there is full army-locality cooperation, giving full  effect to the work of maintaining stability.  <H5>  "The Crux Lies in Doing Well in Building Our Party" by Li </H5> Xilin [2621 1585 2651]    In Selected Works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly  warns the whole party: "If problems appear in China, they will  be the result of problems within the CPC"; "We must concentrate  our efforts on building the party"; and "In the end, the crux  lies in handling well the internal relations in our Communist  Party. If there is nothing wrong there, we can relax and sleep  easily." These conclusions by Comrade Xiaoping are a deep  summation of experiences in international and domestic struggle,  demonstrating the importance of strengthening the building of  the party during the new period of reform and opening up. I  will now discuss my understanding of this question:    1. Strengthen study, to raise one's own quality.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out back in 1978:  "Realizing the four modernizations is a great and farreaching  revolution. In this great revolution, we advance through  continually resolving new contradictions. Thus, the comrades of  the whole party must be good at study and be good at studying  anew." Comrade Jiang Zemin has also repeatedly demanded that the  whole party place importance on and strengthen study. Only if  cadres at all levels of the party strengthen their study, will  they be able to be in accord with the demands of international  struggle and international competition, with the demands of  deepening reform and modernization, and in accord with the  higher demands which the new situation places on the leading  groups and leading cadres at various levels. They must  consciously implement the party's basic line, guard against the  principle of exchange at equal value corroding inner-party  political life, and stop corrupt actions whereby power is used  for personal gain and whereby power is exchanged for money, to  maintain the advanced and pure nature of Communist Party members.    If leading cadres are to study well, I feel that the most  important points to stress at present are: A. It is necessary  to recognize the promotional role which study has on work. Some  comrades are always saying that they are busy with work and have  arduous tasks to complete and they have no time to study. In  fact, it is because of the work with which we are busy that we  need to strengthen our study and raise our leadership level and  work efficiency. We also need to do a little specific analysis  of the term "busy." Sometimes comrades are truly busy but, at  other times they are busy to no purpose. Leading cadres should  centralize their energies in grasping major matters, throw off  the fetters of minor tasks, and make time to study. Otherwise,  even if they work harder, they will not be able to get to grips  with the essentials and they will produce no results. B. It is  necessary to overcome being scared of both difficulty and  complacency. Some comrades hold that the socialist market  economy theory is too abstruse, that modern scientific and  technological knowledge is too unfamiliar, and that it is very  difficult to realize any progress. Others believe that Comrade  Xiaoping's works are easy to understand and they can be  understood without too much effort. Thus, they are satisfied  with a smattering of knowledge. There are different forms of  manifestation of these two situations but actually they all  essentially involve having low study standards and lacking a  spirit of arduous investigation and study. C. It is necessary  to seriously resolve psychological problems. The basic reason  why some comrades do not continue studying and make no progress  in their study is that their spirit is not braced and they do  not truly use their mind in their study and work. Thus, leading  cadres must bestir their spirits and bear in mind the great  responsibilities they shoulder, recognize their qualitative  deficiencies, begin by strengthening study, and continually  raise their own abilities and levels.    2. Safeguarding the authority of the central authorities,  strengthening the centralized unity of the party.    Safeguarding and strengthening the authority of the central  authorities is an idea which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always  stressed. In response to the phenomenon whereby "when the upper  levels promulgate a policy, the lower levels implement a  countermeasure," he earnestly pointed out: "If reform is to be  successful, it must be carried out in an ordered and guided  manner. Without this, if everyone rushes in and each does his  own thing, how can anything be achieved?" He also pointed out:  "Without the authority of the Central Committee and the State  Council, it will be impossible to resolve problems. With this  authority, however, even in difficult times, major matters can  be dealt with. We cannot negate authority and, when  centralization is necessary, we must have centralization." At  present, we must pay attention to resolving the following  several questions: A. We must guard against and overcome the  tendency whereby, as the market economy is strengthened, central  authority is being weakened. B. We must guard against and  overcome local protectionism. C. We must guard against and  overcome the phenomenon whereby, using the excuse that there are  special circumstances, localities do not implement the central  policies and regulations.    3. We must firmly oppose corruption and promote a clean  administration, to earn the trust of the people through a clean  image.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping takes the building of clean government  and opposition to corruption as a major matter in handling  matters within the party properly. He has placed the greatest  stress on this and adopts the firmest attitude regarding it. I  believe that at present we must pay attention to three issues.  A. We must further overcome some misunderstandings which have  obstructed the deepening of opposition to corruption. For  example, some people say that "there is no corruption to  combat," others are worried that "opposition to corruption will  affect economic growth," while yet others say that "it is  difficult to avoid corruption," and so on. B. We must ensure  that the activities of party committees and governments at all  levels in opposing corruption are capable of increasing the  people's faith in the anticorruption activities. We must act in  accordance with the guidance by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and  "earnestly do some things to show that we are truly combatting  corruption and are not just playing." Especially in respect to  "major cases," we must not "hesitate to take action" and must  not "give people cause to think that we are shielding  corruption." We must "call a spade a spade and deal with cases  as they deserve to be dealt with, so that we can gain the trust  of the masses," and we must "grasp these matters vigorously and  speedily and advise the masses of the details." C. We must  concern ourselves with the hardships of the masses and truly  help them resolve the difficulties in their lives.    4. In accordance with the standard of requiring personnel to  have both political integrity and skills, we must place stress  on selecting and training successors.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping considers this to be a strategic  question in doing well in work within the Communist Party and a  question of importance to the overall situation. He has pointed  out: "A correct political line needs to be guaranteed by a  correct organizational line. Whether or not China can handle  its affairs well, whether or not socialism and reform and  opening up can be upheld, whether or not the economy can be  developed a little faster, and whether or not our country can  see long-term stability are all questions which, in a certain  sense, depend on people." On the question of selecting and  training successors, I believe that we must especially uphold  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to select personnel in  accordance with the standard that they have both political  integrity and skills and that we firmly oppose improper  practices in selecting and employing people. The first  requirement is a political one. That is to say, these persons  must have a firm faith in socialism and communism; they must  listen to the party and safeguard the authority of the Central  Committee; they must uphold reform and opening up and be able to  develop and push forward; and they must be honest, fair, and  upright and be able to maintain links with the masses. The  other requirement is a professional one. That is to say, they  must have abilities, including knowledge, practical experience,  and organizational and leadership skills. We must uphold the  cadre line of requiring justness and fairness and selecting  persons on the basis of their merits. First, we must seek  suitable personnel from "all corners of the land" and not just  from those who are close to us. Second, we must implement the  principle of party management of cadres and not allow a  situation wherein a few persons or a single person have the say.  Third, we must travel a mass line and not only select people on  the basis of the feelings and perceptions of the leaders.    "Strengthen the Building of Socialist Spiritual  Civilization" by Li Xinliang [2621 2450 5328]    In the great practice of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, material culture and spiritual culture permeate  and promote each other. Both are indispensable elements.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while guiding the whole party to  centralize efforts in developing the productive forces, placed  great stress on the building of socialist spiritual  civilization, making a number of important expositions on this  topic. In studying the Selected Works, we come to  deeply understand that these expositions by and requirements of  Comrade Xiaoping have very great guiding significance in  strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization  in the new situation.    1. Uphold the dialectics of joint development of material  and spiritual civilization.    The degree to which material civilization and spiritual  civilization have been raised are two major indicators of human  social progress. The socialism we want to build is socialism  under which material civilization and spiritual civilization see  joint development. It is because of this that Comrade Xiaoping  has repeatedly stressed that we must uphold the policy of  grasping with two hands and having a firm grip with both. On  this question, for a very long period, we practiced "the  omnipotence of the spiritual" and experienced very great  suffering. After bringing order out of chaos, people detested  empty prattle and respected the seeking of truth; this was  undoubtedly progress. However, some comrades went to the other  extreme and even abandoned lofty revolutionary ideals and the  spirit of devotion. In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions  on grasping with both hands, we have learned that, at the same  time as upholding dialectical materialism and centralizing  strengths in carrying out modernization, we must continually pay  attention to strengthening the building of socialist spiritual  civilization. In particular, in the current situation where we  are establishing and developing a socialist market economy  structure, while building spiritual civilization we must:  Strengthen our initiative and bring it into play in a greater  way; strengthen the building of party work style and clean  government more consciously and firmly punish corruption; employ  noble ideological culture and moral integrity in educating and  guiding the masses; strongly publicize the spirit of  understanding the overall situation, concerning oneself with the  overall situation, and daring to devote oneself to the  prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people; and  we must advocate advanced ideas and actions, such as taking up  cudgels for a just cause and finding pleasure in helping people,  and so on. If we assign a high level of importance to this work  and carry it out in an earnest manner, not only will it promote  the smooth development of reform and economic construction but  on the basis of new practice, we will be able to raise the  building of socialist spiritual civilization to a new level.    2. Grasping the fundamentals, laying down a foundation and  basing ourselves on educating and fostering the people.    The basic task in the building of spiritual civilization  lies  in fostering people. In this respect, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  made a series of penetrating judgements. He proposed that the  basic issue is educating people and that our goal is to produce  people who "have ideals and morality and who are cultured and  disciplined." He noted that we must use Chinese history to  educate young people and stressed that "China's development line  established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee will require great efforts if it is to be upheld and,  in particular, we need to educate the later generations." We  need to seriously implement these ideas by Comrade Xiaoping and  shoulder the work of fostering successors to the socialist cause.    To do well in the work of fostering and educating people,  there are many aspects which need to be seriously improved. For  example, in school education, in some areas, there is a serious  imbalance between the stress placed on educational attainments  and the inculcation of ideological and moral qualities. In some  cases, children are, from an early age, kept in special places  isolated from ordinary laborers. Also, some cultural publishing  houses and mass broadcasting media, in their efforts to gain  money, do not question whether something has socialist values or  capitalist values. Further, guiding the broad number of young  people to study revolutionary traditions and to get close to the  industrial and agricultural masses, going deep into social  practice and tempering themselves, has long been our way.  However, suddenly no one seems to care about it now. If this  situation continues to develop, we will not even be able to  foster up-to-standard citizens, much less train socialist  successors. In accordance with the requirements of Comrade  Xiaoping, we must basically reverse this situation. Seen from  work guidance by our leaders at various levels, the crux lies in  truly overcoming short-term activities in grasping the building  of spiritual civilization. Practice has proven that the period  needed for fostering and educating people is far longer than the  period needed for economic construction and the work is much  more arduous. A cadre who is truly responsible to the party  must, with the spirit of "taking 100 years to foster and educate  people," make due contributions to training successors to the  socialist cause.    3. Better implementing the duties of the armed forces in  the building of spiritual civilization.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always placed his hopes in the  People's Armed Forces. In the new historical period, he has  repeatedly stressed that the Army must bring into play the old  Red Army traditions, uphold the absolute leadership of the party  over the Army, uphold the goal of uniting in heart and mind to  serve the people, and maintain revolutionary ideals,  revolutionary discipline, and the workstyle of arduous struggle.  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, as they have  seriously implemented these important directives by Comrade  Xiaoping, the armed forces' work of building spiritual  civilization has never relaxed. However, we must also soberly  recognize that some of the negative influences in society will  inevitably be reflected in the armed forces. Guiding the armed  forces to maintain and strengthen a correct political  orientation; to consciously obey the party; to safeguard the  line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee; to establish a correct view  of life and correct values; and to guard against corrosion by  capitalism and the various types of decadent ideologies and  cultures, are still major tasks facing us.    In accordance with the new situation, while grasping the  building of spiritual civilization in the armed forces, we must  maintain high standards. Our Army, as an armed group for  implementing revolutionary political tasks, has a sacred mission  to provide security guarantees for reform, opening up and  economic construction. This requires that at all times it must  maintain a high degree of centralized unity. Thus, at the same  time as guiding the armed forces to absorb nutrition through  actively participating in revolutionary practice, we must  clearly stress ideals, convictions, devotion, and opposition to  the worship of money. While establishing a concept of  competition which is in accord with the market economy, and  urging people to be brave in pushing forward, we must strengthen  education regarding the need for the individual to be  subordinated to the organization and for the partial to be  subordinated to the whole. At the same time as respecting  individual material interests and strengthening the concept of  results, we must strongly foster noble moral sentiments,  including the spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion to public  service. We must pay attention to overcoming vulgar  exploitation of connections and establish comrade-style links of  mutual assistance. In brief, the more reform is deepened, the  more we need to use the "five types of revolutionary spirit"  advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character spirit  of innovation and progress" advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin to  educate the troops, so that the armed forces become a university  for spreading the revolutionary spirit in the new period. We  must use firm and strong action and implement the requirements  of the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission in that, in building spiritual civilization,  the armed forces must walk in the front ranks of the whole  society and thereby have the army carry out its due role  properly in the building of socialist spiritual civilization.</p>

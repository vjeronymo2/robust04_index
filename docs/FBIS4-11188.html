			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Embassy  in Mexico has reported that Alfredo Alfonso Guillin Zelaya, an  official of the Cuban Education Ministry, died of a heart attack  during a working visit to Chihuahua State in northern Mexico.    Guillin, who was of Mexican origin, died at the age of 57 on  Friday and his remains will be transferred to Cuba, the embassy  reported in a communique in which they stated they had sent  their condolences to relatives in Cuba and Mexico.    Guillin had come to Mexico two weeks ago at the head of a  three-member delegation from the Cuban Education Ministry. "The  official was due to return to Cuba today (Saturday) at the end  of his mission," an embassy spokesman said.    Guillin was 19 years old in December 1956 when he embarked  on  an expedition aboard a yacht that departed from the Mexican port  of Tuxpan, Veracruz State, bound for Cuba to begin an armed  struggle that ended in January 1959 with the rebel triumph. The  expedition was led by Cuban President Fidel Castro.</p>

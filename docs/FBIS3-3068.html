Last month 30 projects won approval in the zone, involving  an  investment of more than 16.9 million U.S. dollars, according to  Fan Shuming, spokesman for the zone's management committee.  Fourteen of the 30 projects are foreign-funded ones.    During January and February, the zone imported and exported  more than 54.3 million U.S. dollars worth of commodities and  transited 799,000 U.S. dollars worth of goods, Fan said.    In addition, more than 117 million U.S. dollars worth of  products were manufactured and 4.7 million U.S. dollars worth of  goods were stored in the zone, he added.    So far, the bonded zone, which was approved by the Chinese  Government in June 1990 and went into operation last April, has  approved 854 projects, involving an investment of more than 2.1  billion U.S. dollars, handled over 300 million U.S. dollars  worth of import and export commodities, 160 million U.S. dollars  worth of transit goods, 12 million U.S. dollars worth of  manufactured goods and over 200 million U.S. dollars worth of  stored goods.    The bonded zone is planned to develop in an area of 10 sq  km.    The first-phase project covered four sq km and was completed  a year ahead of time. The second-phase project of six sq km has  also started ahead of time, Fan said.</p>

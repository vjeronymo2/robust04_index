The effectiveness of provisions of the ``National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks'' 59 FR 19402 (April 22, 1994) and 59 FR 29196 (June 6, 1994) (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP'' or the ``HON''), for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers is stayed for 3 months pending reconsideration. The EPA is issuing this stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Elsewhere in the Proposed Rules Section of today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the EPA proposes (1) to defer compliance with the HON equipment leak provisions establishing standards for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, and (2) to extend the compliance date for sources affected by today's stay, for as long as is necessary to complete the rulemaking granting this deferral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  October 28, 1994.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (``SOCMI''), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the HON. Subpart H establishes standards for equipment leaks, including standards for compressors (40 CFR 63.164) and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.170). The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning October 24, 1994, for some groups of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(i) and 63.190(e)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A petition for reconsideration has been submitted to the EPA requesting the HON be revised in order for sources to have additional time to comply with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. The petition contains new information demonstrating that compliance by October 24, 1994, with the standards applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, is not possible because at many facilities major equipment modifications or replacements are necessary in order to comply with the standards. This new information, which the EPA did not have prior to the promulgation of the HON, is described more fully in the notice contained in the Proposed Rules section of today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that proposes to defer compliance with the equipment leak provisions of the HON that are applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. For these reasons, the EPA is staying the effectiveness of the provisions of the HON applicable to leaks from compressors and from surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for 3 months in order to respond to the petition for reconsideration and revise the rule as necessary to resolve this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

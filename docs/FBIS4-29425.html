			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporters Yi Yon-hong and Kim Min-pae: "Selections Break </F> New Ground,' Feature Reformist Personages in Their Forties:  Inside and Outside of DLP Appointments of New Chief Organizers"]    [Text] Reshuffles began in the ruling camp as the  Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] yesterday appointed new chief  organizers for 10 of the opposition-dominated districts. In a  nutshell, the announced selections broke new ground. Nine out of  the 10 appointees are from non-political circles. Professional  politicians are shut out, conspicuously; the appointees include  four ex-government officials, three lawyers, a scholar and a  chaeya [reformist camp] figure from an activist  group. No familiar faces, and not many celebrities in their  sectors either. Their average age is 49, 6 years younger than  the average of the present DLP district chairmen, which is 55.  They belong to no factions. There is no to-the-core RDP [former  Reunification Democratic Party] man among them, and none  affiliated with the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party]  faction either. Of the 10, the only professional politician is  Rep. Cho Yong-chik, nominated for Songpa-B, Seoul. A member of  the NDRP (former New Democratic Republican Party) faction, he is  an exceptional case.    The action literally demonstrates a "shift in generation"  and  a "shake-up." Its timing proves it. The ruling camp had kept  putting off the appointments for as long as 5 months, each time  by instructions from Chongwadae awaiting the passage of the  Political Reform Act through the National Assembly. Finally, the  reform act was passed, setting the stage for the next step, the  human reform.  <H5>  Average Age 49, Unaffiliated </H5>   The DLP has served notice that the same principles will be  followed in the nominations for the rest of similar districts,  too. It appears very likely that they will be carried through  into the party endorsement process for candidates in the 14th  general election. After the district-level reshuffles will come  a national-level shake-up. It is the time for those  "influential" incumbents in the National Assembly to worry about  their individual cases of "endorsement."    Meanwhile, some within the ruling camp strongly reacted  against the new party line, particularly members of the DJP  faction, who see it as targeted on them.  <H5>  Picks on "Kim Mun-su's Record" </H5>   Complaints were voiced bluntly at a party executives meeting  held on 8 March. Executive Committee member Yi Chi-ho, DJP,  fired the first bullet, taking issue with the personal record of  Kim Mun-su, appointed to the post of Puchon Sosa District,  Kyonggi Province. Kim Mun-su had served 2 years and 6 months in  prison for leading the 3 May Inchon Upheaval, a key battle in  the 1986 constitutional amendment struggle for direct  presidential election system. He was convicted on charges of  violating the National Security Law.    "Since when has a criminal record been viewed as a credit?"  asked Yi Chi-ho at the session. He raised questions over Kim  Mun-su's rehabilitation and his role in the Chonnohyop [National  Council of Labor Movements]. Secretary General Mun Chong-su  responded, only in theoretical terms.    Where the DJP faction is headed with its resistance is a  matter of concern. It is hardly predictable at the moment,  however. The party leadership seems to take a wait-and-see  attitude. Meanwhile, complaints seem to grow deeper inwardly as  time goes by.  <H5>  For Showdown with the Opposition </H5>   The DJP faction had shown some wayward signs until recently,  which, however, have subsided since the party decided to  postpone its national convention, a development that deprived  the faction of its pretext for agitation. Now, one may say that  it is about to find a new pretext.    Meanwhile, it is known that the process of selecting the new  district-level chief organizers was plagued with backbiting  mirroring that situation. It is said that most difficult were  the decisions on Seoul and Puchon districts. It was because the  opposition maintains an edge in those districts. In the process  of coordinating with Chongwadae on final selections under the  lead of Secretary General Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae,  director of the Basic Research Office, officials reportedly  weighed that fact and decided to bring in reform-oriented,  untainted "new faces" in force for a showdown with the  opposition.  <H5>  Local Tendencies Taken into Account </H5>   Thus came the appointment of Chong Song-chol, a lawyer from  chaeya and presently assistant first minister of  state, for Kangnam-B, Seoul, and that of Kim Hak-won, also a  lawyer and political new face, for Songdong-B, Seoul. The two  satisfied the newly adopted standards, it was explained. Chong  Song-chol -- who is a drawing-card-type chaeya  figure, whose participation in the new government was the result  of "recommendation" by Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong -- had been  designated for the post early on, although informally.    The selection of Kim Mun-su "fueled criticism" through to  the  end. The reason was that he was the leader in the 3 May, 1986,  Inchon Upheaval and served a prison term on conviction for  violations of the National Security Law. Some argued that he  could stir up conservative vs. reformist ideological polemics  within the party. The pros and cons were equally divided, and  eventually party executives decided to "run the risk." Their  decision is said to have taken into consideration the fact that  Puchon Sosa District residents are mostly working people, and  that in the neighboring Kwangmyong District, Son Hak-kyu, a  chaeya-oriented scholar, was elected to the National  Assembly in a recent by-election.    Rumors had it that the decision was also based on the  observation that the Democratic Party [DP] will run either its  party spokesman, Pak Chi- won, or Pae Ki-son, former deputy  chief secretary for the party chairman as its candidate for the  same district, Puchon Sosa, in the next general election. It was  for the same reason that O Song-kye was named to the Puchon  Ojong District post.    The DLP was on the verge of withholding a decision on  Songpa-B, Seoul, when Cho Yong-chik, DLP deputy spokesman, was  finally picked thanks to the "influence" of Chairman Kim  Chong-pil. The RDP faction strongly supported Song Chol-won,  chairman of the Forum of Press Workers Unions. It was a close  contest, they say.  <H5>  Satisfied with the Outcome </H5>   For now, party officials are satisfied with the results of  the open recruiting, saying that they succeeded in obtaining  "fresh candidates." As examples, they cite the cases of Yi  Ki-hyong, staff researcher of the National Land Development  Research Institute and a graduate of University of San Francisco  and doctor of economics, who was named for Sosan-Taean District;  and Kim Kwang-won, former lieutenant governor of North Kyongsang  Province, named for Uljin District.    Kim Kwang-won says that "I responded to the open recruiting  without knowing that there is a recruiting plan that is not open  to the public." It is rumored that he drew strong support from  Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u. It is also said that Kim  Mun-su's "sponsor" was Kim Chong-nam, Chongwadae senior  presidential secretary for educational and cultural affairs.    The nomination of Choe In-ki for Naju District practically  had been predetermined when he was "left out" in the  appointments of vice ministers in late December last year. Yi  Chol-kyu, chief of the Planning and Management Office of the  Kyonggi provincial government, who was named for Sihung-Kunpo  District, was a case of "draft." Yi, former Sihung City mayor,  says that the nomination was a surprise although there had been  a hint from Choe Ki-son, Inchon City mayor and a key member of  the RDP faction, a month ago.  <H5>  "Preference for SNU Graduates" Criticized </H5>   The districts of Seoul's Sodaemun-B, Socho-A, Taegu's  East-B,  and Hwasun of South Cholla Province were placed on the hold  following the principle that the party will look for  best-qualified persons having both the resolve for reform and  local support. Also, Seoul's Kangso-A District -- of which Yi  Won-chong, Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for  political affairs, declined the chairmanship before the start of  the open recruiting -- was taken off the list of open-recruiting  districts from the beginning.    The 10 appointees are made up by nine Seoul National  University [SNU] graduates and one University of San Francisco  graduate. Of the nine SNU graduates, seven are from the law  school.    Responding to criticism of too much importance having been  attached to academic career factors, Secretary General Mun  Chong-su "explained" that "honestly, it was by accident."

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Housing starts lift Japanese gloom HOUSEBUILDING in Japan, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economy, recorded a 12 per cent increase in housing starts in August against a year earlier. It was the third consecutive monthly increase, according to figures published by the Ministry of Construction. August's rise was the biggest since March 1988 when the economy was in the midst of a property boom. However, overall construction orders placed in August fell 5.8 from the year before, led by a 38.7 per cent fall in orders from the private sector, according to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors. The growing role of the public sector in the property and construction markets was underscored by a 56.7 per cent increase in public sector orders. This was mainly due to the way public sector orders were brought forward into the first half of the year by a public spending package announced in March. The upturn in housing starts may also partly reflect additional public money being pumped into the housing market through the public sector housing loan system. However, the upturn in construction activity has not yet fed through into increased demand for consumer durables. Construction of privately owned homes rose by 22.3 per cent from the same month last year, while starts on homes for rent rose by 27 per cent. Despite these rises the property market remains deeply depressed. Construction starts on houses and condominiums for sale fell 26.9 per cent from August last year. It was the 17th consecutive month in which starts on houses and condominiums for sale fell, the longest run of declines on record.</p>

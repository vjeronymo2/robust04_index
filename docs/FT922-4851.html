			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Bush seeks extension of MFN status for China PRESIDENT George Bush announced last night he would seek extension of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status for China in spite of mounting criticism in the US of Beijing's human rights record. The president was obliged by law to act no later than today. Congress now has 90 days in which to block implementation of MFN status, which allows a wide range of Chinese goods to be imported under special preferences. A White House statement issued yesterday evening acknowledged that the decision would be controversial, as it was with the last extension a year ago. The US, the statement said, wanted to elicit a faster pace and a broader scope for human rights improvements in China. Withdrawal of MFN would achieve neither of these objectives. Mr Bush has frequently been criticised for his staunch support of the Chinese regime, especially after the Tiananmen Square massacres three years ago. Further aggravations to bilateral relations have stemmed from Chinese missile sales and nuclear testing, the most recent only last month.</p>

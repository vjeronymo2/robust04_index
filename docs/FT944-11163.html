			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Former ANC fighters sacked Mr Joe Modise, South Africa's defence minister, announced yesterday that over 2,000 former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the African National Congress's armed wing, had been dismissed from the South African National Defence Force for failing to report to duty despite numerous government warnings. The decision marks a new hard line by the ANC-led government on dissent by former guerrillas who have complained of harsh discipline and poor living conditions while being assimilated into the SANDF. About 25,000 former Umkhonto members, and several thousand others from the former homeland armies and the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, are due to join the once white-dominated South African army this year.</p>

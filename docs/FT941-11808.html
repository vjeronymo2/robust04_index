			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MY expands via Insight purchase - Placing and open offer to fund acquisition heralds full listing Shares in MY Holdings climbed 10p to 61p yesterday after the specialist packaging company announced plans to buy Insight, the carton manufacturer, for up to Pounds 21.3m. The acquisition, funded by a Pounds 23m placing and open offer, is expected to promote the company from the USM to the Official List and more than double its market capitalisation to Pounds 45.8m. Under the transaction, MY is acquiring Insight for Pounds 19.3m, pendingpre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in the 12 months to December 31 last year. MY will pay the Kent-based group a further Pounds 2m if its pre-tax profits exceed Pounds 2.5m this year. In the interim period, the balance of Pounds 3.75m raised by the placing and offer will be used as short-term working capital. Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the deal marked the culmination of a two-year search for a substantial acquisition opportunity. Insight, which reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 12.1m in 1992, would broaden MY's customer base and raise its profile in the packaging industry, he said. He predicted that the enlarged group, employing more than 700 workers at10 UK plants, would enjoy a 25 per cent increase in turnover. Shareholders were also promised an interim dividend of at least 0.5p in respect of the year to August 28. As part of the deal, Tawneydown - a wholly owned subsidiary of Malbak, MY's South African parent company - will take up 21.9m of the 44.2m new ordinary shares being issued at the offer price of 52p. The remaining 42.3 per cent on Tawneydown's entitlement, some 16m new ordinary shares, will be placed with institutions by Hambros Bank, which is sponsoring the deal. Once the acquisition and placing have been completed, Malbak's stake in MY will fall from 85.7 per cent to 65 per cent. Existing shareholders would be offered a clawback on the outstanding 6.3m shares, Hambros said. Mr Terry Neill, Insight's managing director and majority shareholder, will retain 2.6m new ordinary shares as part of the transaction.</p>

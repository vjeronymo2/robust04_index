			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Names to be given 10-year help on losses Names on the Lloyd's of London insurance market facing substantial losses may soon be extended a long-term lifeline to help them meet the crippling demands on their assets, it emerged yesterday. Mr Ken Randall, chief executive of Randall Group, the insurance adviser, said that he was close to announcing details of a financing package that would allow repayment of losses over 10 years by Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. The service is one of a number of initiatives being planned by Randall Group following the announcement yesterday that it had sold a substantial minority stake to JO Hambro Magan, the merchant bank. Mr Randall said he had obtained the support of one US and several UK banks towards raising on the Euro-markets at least 'a few hundreds of millions' and possibly more than a billion pounds, which would be used to pay cash calls levied on Names. The package would be structured so that Names would pay only interest on their loans for the first three years, then equal-sized instalments of the capital over seven to 10 years. The announcement could provide welcome relief to many Names considering whether to accept a Pounds 900m out-of-court legal settlement with Lloyd's or pursue litigation. The latest estimates from Chatset, the research group, suggest that Names could face demands for Pounds 8.65bn over the next 20 years. Mr Randall said he had been working on the idea over a number of weeks and had held detailed discussions 'at a very high level' in Lloyd's. He said he was close to resolving a number of 'technical hurdles'. He said that the idea had already been tested, and final arrangements were being made. Names would be approved for the scheme on a case-by-case basis. The idea has been supported with help from Magan, which yesterday announced that it had bought 49 per cent of the shares in Randall Group for an undisclosed sum. The group will in the future concentrate on three areas: insurance consultancy and management, investment management of insurance funds, and introductory and advisory services for investors in the London market. Mr Randall, a former head of regulation at Lloyd's, refused to provide details of the financial position of the company other than to say that its annual turnover was several million pounds.</p>

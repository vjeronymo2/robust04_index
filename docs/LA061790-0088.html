			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUIT WHINING  </P> <P> The privileged yuppies who were so cleverly prepared to argue against a  landfill site in North County (with videos and computer-generated graphics) at  the county Planning Commission meeting June 12, are just more NIMBY (Not In My  Back Yard) whiners. There is no place in North County for a landfill? Give me a  break!  </P> <P> An environmental argument could be made against any place. But those of us who  create trash do harm the environment. Those of us who drive cars or ride buses  pollute the air. This is the lifestyle we inherited and will continue living.  </P> <P> The North County residents tipped their hand when they argued for sending their  trash to Riverside County or South San Diego County. For all their impassioned  environmental arguments, they just don't want it around them.  </P> <P> KEVIN C. CHIARAVALLE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

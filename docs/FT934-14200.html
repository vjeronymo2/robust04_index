			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / The people and the treaty Germany's constitutional court ruling, giving the green light to the Maastricht Treaty of European Union, is a cause of celebration on at least two counts. After nearly two years of cliff-hanging setbacks and delays, the treaty can at last come into force. No one knows any more how this treaty will perform, but at least it has now been brought more or less intact to the starting line. As a result, next week's European Community summit in Brussels should be a jolly party. We can expect plenty of the usual rhetoric from the usual Euro-enthusiasts about the deathless claims of the European ideal; and we can expect John Major to put in his predictable penny's worth, to reassure the Tory faithful that the treaty means even less than it says, thanks to his doughty defence of the national interest. But the second cause of celebration is that the German ruling laid down an important marker for the need for political legitimacy. In the run-up to the decision, there had been widespread apprehension that the red-robed judges in Karlsruhe might tie the treaty in so many legal knots as to bring it crashing to the ground. Some feared the court would rule that the transfer of powers inherent in the treaty would be incompatible with German sovereignty; others that Maastricht was unacceptable because it gave too few powers to the European Parliament. Instead, the judges merely ruled that the Maastricht treaty in particular, and the Community in general, are essentially conditional on the legitimation of popular democracy. And since popular democracy is still primarily expressed through national parliaments, the consequence is that Maastricht cannot be implemented without the support and approval of the German parliament. 'The democracy principle does not prevent Germany joining a supranationally organised community of states,' said the court. 'But a precondition of membership is a guarantee that legitimation and influence by the people are secured within the association of states. 'It is principally the peoples of the member states who must legitimate this through their national parliaments . . . In addition, and increasingly as European nations grow together, democratic legitimation is conveyed by the European Parliament elected by the citizens of member states. 'If, as is currently the case, the peoples convey democratic legitimation through national parliaments, then the democratic principle sets limits on the expansion of the tasks and powers of the European Communities. The German Bundestag must retain tasks and powers of substantial weight.' As a description of political reality, this is an admirably pithy and middle-of-the-road synthesis - as far as it goes. German governments have long been in the forefront of those seeking a strengthening of the Community's political institutions, especially the European Parliament. But the plain fact is that the Community is still essentially a grouping of nation states. As a result, democratic legitimation has to come largely through national parliaments. Unfortunately, the Karlsruhe judgment does not go far enough: it describes reality, but does not offer a solution to the political challenge of Maastricht. It is easy to underline the point that the Community is critically dependent on democratic support; not just because all claims to political legitimacy in Europe hang essentially on popular democracy, but because the Maastricht treaty in particular came within a whisker of being thrown out by the voters. Since power still lies mainly with the Council of Ministers, it is also easy to see that democracy must come mainly through national parliaments; denunciations of the Community as a threatening mega-state are simply the product of delirious fantasy. The problem is that the Community's popular legitimacy has been severely shaken; the challenge facing the 12 is not just working out how to implement a treaty whose practical credibility has been battered by events but, even more important, how to recover popular support for the general objectives of the enterprise. The Karlsruhe prescription is that the Bundestag (and other national parliaments) must exercise a bigger role in the Community process. This is a very proper thought, from a national point of view. But it is not clear how, in operative terms, it can be squared with any reasonably expeditious decision-making process in Brussels. It is the role of parliaments to control initiatives taken by governments. But if all 12 parliaments increase their controlling function, the unstated premise of the prescription is that any or all of them must be able to slow the Community right down, and perhaps even stop it entirely. This could only help restore legitimacy to the Community in a very limited sense, and on the narrow assumption that the voters only want to be reassured that nothing much will be decided in Brussels in future. Moreover, it is not easy to square a systematic increase in the controlling power of national parliaments with majority voting in the Council of Ministers, which will be strengthened by the Maastricht treaty. Moreover, even if the basic rules remain the same, majority voting will be further strengthened if the Community is enlarged, because more members mean more countries can be outvoted. Somehow, the member states have got to come up with some positive answers to the problem of legitimacy. And that means finding ways to ensure that the Community meets the needs of electorates, in terms of prosperity and economic growth, and is seen to do so.</p>

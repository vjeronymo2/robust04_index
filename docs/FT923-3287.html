			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: The good, the bad, the artistically free - Time flies for Nigel Andrews, as a vintage Venice Film Festival moves towards its close IF a large bomb had dropped on Venice's Lido last Sunday, it might have wiped out European cinema. Some 50 famous film-makers converged on the festival island to take part in a talkathon about artistic freedom. All day long, in several languages, they jawed and jawed or earnestly listened: the Rosis, Taverniers, Jordans, Costa-Gavrases; even Sean Penn as Hollywood's envoy, wearing UN-style headphones and a look of dazed mental overload. But artistic freedom, as film festivals teach us, is a mixed blessing even when available. The worst Venice movies, as we approach Golden Lion hour, have been cinema's equivalent of free verse or tennis without a net. Peter Handke's Absence from Germany won the international walkout prize, with its audience-scattering tale of four travellers journeying through a series of enigmatic landscapes and incomprehensible 'poetic' dialogue scenes. Luis Puenzo's The Plague came a close second, with its OTT Camus update, transposing poor Albert to a South America of juntas, rats and overblown co-production dialogue. William Hurt, Sandrine Bonnaire and Robert Duvall are among those going down with the ship, shortly after it is vacated by the rodents. The best films at Venice have been those that stood up, fastened their top shirt-buttons and played by the rules. Daniel Bergman's Sunday's Child, scripted by father Ingmar, is an immaculately-laundered memory trip from the screenwriter who gave us Best Intentions. Time, 1926; hero, an eight-year-old Ingmar already learning about death, feuding with his pastor father and wondering why his older brother Dag's bed shakes shortly after Dag has been looking at artistic photos of nude women. Visually, the film has the summer-kissed beauty of Elvira Madigan and even borrows its star Thommy Berggren to play Ingmar's Dad. But like Best Intentions, it conceals torments inside the nostalgic trappings. The father-son quarrel is emotionally amplified by a daring flash-forward in mid-film - to Papa's deathbed in 1968 - and also by an inspired story within a story about a demon-possessed watchmaker. This eerily symbolic sequence allows Ingmar's own son Daniel, in his feature directing debut, to ape the Master at his grand guignol best. The two other palpable hits at Venice were Sally Potter's Orlando from Britain and Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju from China. The prospect of Potter's film had me quailing. A feminist film-maker hitherto known for such aesthetic torture sessions as The Gold Diggers (Julie Christie going gnomic in the Yukon) here adapts Virginia Woolf's ur-feminist novel about a sex-changing, century-hopping adventurer. But Orlando the movie is so lightfooted that it skates - literally in the early Elizabethan scenes on a frozen Thames - over both the frigid tundras of message cinema and the thin ice of picaresque allegory. Traversing 400 years, we meet Quentin Crisp as Elizabeth I, Ned Sherrin as Dr Johnson, and John Wood, Dudley Sutton and Heathcote Williams as assorted historical crazies; we warm to Tilda Swinton's hero(ine) with her perpetual-sunrise look of intelligent surprise; and we applaud the witty, jewelled, picture-book tableaux, which borrow a leaf or two from the Greenaway book of period recreation. Where Potter's film took Venice by surprise, the entire population of Italy seemed to be in the queue for Zhang Yimou. Trailing prizes and flurries of controversy for Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern (banned in China), Yimou now startles us with a film that seems like a piece of party-line folk propaganda. The Story Of Qiu Ju is the simple, dimpled tale of a peasant woman who seeks justice after her husband is kicked in the testicles (sic) by the village headman. Off she traipses to find that justice, selling more of her modest farm produce (chili peppers) the further she has to go on each expedition (village, town, Beijing). Let us add that she is worthily pregnant; that the film is shot plainly without any of Zhang's subversive camera flourishes; and that the whole thing reeks of Chinese political correctness. Astonishingly it still works. Any sermonising on the virtues of Chinese law or the steadfastness of the country's peasantry is gradually upscreened by the story's comic setbacks and ironies - even legal satisfaction brings fresh mishaps in its wake - plus the uningratiating strength and charm of Gong Li's performance. And if Yimou is on a tight stylistic rein, he still composes like a master. The multi-layer shots place the potentially preachy tale inside a larger, vibrant fresco of human life. In Otar Ioseliani's La Chasse Aux Papillons, a pair of white Russian sisters living in a French chateau are overrun by will-seeking relatives and property-eyeing Japanese. (The medium is the message: a Paris-based Georgian director makes a comedy about the world becoming a diaspora culture). In Ivan Dichovichny's endearingly dotty Moscow On Parade characters keep bursting into song all over 1939 Soviet Russia, as if F. Lehar had been appointed Kremlin composer by J. Stalin. Lots of newsreel-plundered parades set to stirring march tunes; lots of interchangeable male leads warbling at our heroine, a beautiful aristo with an eye patch and a champagne bottle permanently tilted throatwards. I could not work out if this film was meant to be serious. Mind you, it was not the sole contender in the mad hatter stakes. Compare Italy's The Mines Of Sulphur, concerning the sex habits of Sicilian miners, and China's Blood Morning, which is Marques's Chronicle Of A Death Foretold dramatised in multi-decibel Mandarin. There was always America. There always will be America, if Venice's Hollywood-friendly new festival director Gillo Pontecorvo is to be believed. Though none of the US films is a Golden Lion favourite, nearly all set audiences purring. Brian De Palma's riotous thriller Raising Cain I wrote about last week. Keith Gordon's A Midnight Clear sets William Wharton's anti-war tale in a poetically snow-flurried 1944 Ardennes. Don Scardino's Me And Veronica is a tangy, rough-weave comedy about two sisters (Elizabeth McGovern, Patricia Wettig) coping with love and death in the Philadelpia boondocks. And Glengarry Glen Ross is only a filmed play, but what a play (by David Mamet) and what a piece of filming (by James Foley). Jack Lemmon in person took the audience cheers at Venice, for his playing of Mamet's seedy real-estate salesman caught with fingers in till. But the whole cast is a sensation, from Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris in the barnstormer roles to Al Pacino weaving hilarious inflections around Mamet's poker-faced staccato recitative. I looked at my watch at the end, astonished that 100 minutes had gone by. But then I am looking at my watch again now, astonished that a vintage Venice festival has gone by, with only 36 hours, three films and a bunch of prizes to go.</p>

This figure includes collections of income tax and taxes on  liquor, cigarettes, matches, inheritances, and fees, as well as  collections on tax stamps. It indicates an increase of 45.17  percent over tax revenues collected in 1992.    Broken down in detail, tax collections were as follows:     -  Income Tax: 103,511.0 million bolivares, compared to  63,486.0 million bolivares collected in 1992, an increase of  63.04 percent. The 1994 budget has set out an income tax  collection goal of 136,275.0 million bolivares.    -  Alcoholic  beverages: In this category the difference between 1993 and 1992  was not so pronounced. In 1992 13,754.0 million bolivares in  taxes were collected, a figure which was 7.93 percent higher in  1993, when 14,845.0 million bolivares were collected. The tax  collection goal for 1994 is 18,250.0 million bolivares.    -  Tax  stamps: in 1993 13,368.0 million bolivares were collected, or 24  percent more than in 1992 (when 10,771.0 million bolivares were  collected). With the reform of the law on tax stamps it is hoped  to collect at least 27 billion bolivares in 1994, due to the  increase in tax rates.    -  Cigarettes: tax collections in 1993  amounted to 17,104 million bolivares, against almost 14,000  million bolivares in 1992, which was 22.26 percent more in  comparative terms.    -  Taxes on matches: tax income was 40,147.0  million bolivares in 1993, or 11.26 percent more than in 1992.  The report on tax collections states that the goal set by the  Directorate General of Taxes was not completely attained, due to  the effects of smuggling matches, which resulted in a decline in  production.    -  Taxes collected on inheritances, donations, and  other, related taxes brought in 966.0 million bolivares in 1993,  a decline of 17.8 percent, compared to the 1,176.0 million  bolivares collected under this category in 1992. According to  the report, this is the only tax collection area which declined  due to temporary circumstances. The projection for 1994 shows a  decline to 650.0 million bolivares.    -  Finally, 159.0 million  bolivares were collected in fees, or 49.6 percent more than the  106.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992.  The 1994 budget anticipates collection of 128.0 million  bolivares in this category of taxes.    With the exception of income tax, the other, internal taxes  showed a growth of only 16.69 percent in 1993, compared to 1992.    The report on tax collection activity in 1993 also showed  that the activities of the Directorate of Tax Control in Caracas  brought in 55,965.0 million bolivares in income tax. A special  plan was set up for tax collections at the regional level.    Another 35,525.0 million bolivares were collected as a  result  of opening tax cases against 850 taxpayers. This figure broke  down to 14,126.0 million bolivares from taxes, 14,396.0 million  bolivares from fines, and the remaining 7.0 billion bolivares  from interest collections.    Investigations carried out by the Directorate of Tax  Collection on financial, industrial, and commercial companies,  as well as service companies, had the following results.  Reserves set aside amounted to 10,470.0 bolivares, and taxes  plus contingencies resulting from reserves set aside amounted to  8.0 billion bolivares.    Investigations carried out in the petroleum sector brought  the following results: reserves set aside of 21,207.0 million  bolivares and taxes plus contingencies amounting to 29,239.0  million bolivares.    In the mining sector reserves set aside amounted to 643  million bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies amounted to 455  million bolivares.    In 1994, the report states, it is anticipated that a  strategy  will be followed which will extend until 1996 for increasing tax  collection, tax pressure, and a range of tax contingencies, thus  reducing tax evasion, delays in tax payments, and requests for  resource set aside for litigation.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ALI PROMOTES 'GREATEST' COLOGNE  </P> <P> Former heavyweight boxing champ Muhammad Ali believes he can make it to the top  again -- but this time he won't be throwing jabs and counterpunches.  </P> <P> Rather, Ali is traveling to promote a new cologne that bears his name.  </P> <P> "It's the greatest," he said in an appearance here.  </P> <P> The 47-year-old Ali, who was known as much for his wagging tongue as his flying  fists in his younger days, is pulling no punches.  </P> <P> "I predict I'll sell more cologne than anyone else in the world," he said  Monday in an appearance at a department store. "Women love it. Makes 'em chase  men they don't even know."  </P></p>

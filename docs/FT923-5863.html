			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Snow causes massive NZ lamb losses FREAK SPRING snows blanketed much of the South Island to a depth of one metre, causing massive losses among newly born lambs at the start of the lambing season, and serious worries about this year's export trade. The August snows are compounding problems for sheep farmers in both North and South Islands who are struggling through one of the worst winters on record. Farmers have been hit by repeated natural disasters: including drought on the South Island's high country. In the North Island, farmers have had to cope with almost constant rain, making pastures mushy, and bitter winter cold, which has hindered grass growth. The snows - the second freak fall this winter - are having a devastating effect on farmers at the peak of lambing. With drifts up to four feet deep down to the coast, there is little most farmers can do to save stock. While ewes are managing to survive, new-born lambs die almost instantly, and because of the freak drifts, farmers are unable to reach them. For the second time this winter North Island farmers and sending free hay by rail to their South Island counterparts. The stock losses come at a time when export lamb prices are climbing in the most optimistic outlook for sheep farmers for several years. The expected heavy lamb losses are also likely to mean the closure of a more freezing works, already having problems with overcapacity, with thousands of jobs being lost. The bad news follows currency moves, especially against sterling, which have bolstered farm incomes. But demand for New Zealand lamb has also been higher. Prices at Smithfield lambs were the equivalent of NZ5.10 (Pounds 1.39) a kilogram last week, compared with about Dollars NZ3.75 a year ago. However New Zealand is running into quota problems. The New Zealand Meat Board suggested this week that this was already causing buyers who relied on the New Zealand product to bid up prices because of fears of a looming shortage. By the end of July New Zealand had used up 79 per cent of its annual quota of 205,000 tonnes under the voluntary restraint agreement with the European Community. This compares with 66 per cent of the quota this time last year. The meat board says that European demand for lamb has been remarkably buoyant this year, specially for barbecued cuts, and prices have been good. Of the 79 per cent shipped so far this year, 38.3 per cent have been sold to continental Europe (compared with 30.5 per cent at the same time last year) with the rest going to Britain. The EC as a whole normally takes 60 per cent of New Zealand's lamb production with about half this going to Britain. A meat board official said yesterday that New Zealand would have no trouble filling this year's quota: the main concern was that there would not be enough to meet the demand. There was some concern at the country's ability to meet the Christmas trade, because of the effect of the bad weather on lamb numbers. South Island, the main source of supply, was expected to face especially heavy losses. However both exporters and the board official said that while carcasse weights might be lower, the expected leanness of the meat meant quality was likely to be higher than ever.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Water watchdog hits back at 'alarmist' Greenpeace THE National Rivers Auth-ority, the water industry's environmental watchdog, yesterday accused Greenpeace, the campaigning group, of issuing 'alarmist propaganda' over river and sea pollution. It said Greenpeace had tried to 'force the world back through time'. The attack by Lord Crickhowell, the former Cons-ervative cabinet minister who chairs the authority, was a response to a month-long Greenpeace campaign against the authority's system of issuing permits for discharging waste into rivers. Greenpeace calls the system 'legal pollution'. Tomorrow Greenpeace will publish a report called Filthy Fifty, listing what it says are the 50 industrial plants licensed to discharge the most toxic pollution into rivers and estuaries. Lord Crickhowell's remarks also come a week before environment ministers from the UK and 13 other countries meet in Paris to sign a treaty on marine pollution. He accused Greenpeace of treating the authority as an enemy. 'Alarmist propaganda and publicity stunts may grab the headlines, but it is pressure through the pollution-control system that is forcing the industry to clean up its act,' he said. The discharge permits issued by the authority were 'licences to protect' and enabled industry to operate without polluting, he added. The authority has also been attacked by water and sewerage companies that have claimed that some of its standards have been unnecessarily and expensively too high. Ofwat, the water industry's economic watchdog, in last months's report on increases in water bills, also put pressure on the authority to examine whether its interpretation of some environmental legislation is too stringent. Mr Paul Horsman, Greenpeace's waste campaigner, said: 'We are simply calling for the elimination of substances that the Paris Commission (an international conference on discharging waste at sea) called for in 1974. The Thames now supports fish mainly because the removal of sewage has improved the oxygen content, but you still can't eat the fish.'</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Rivlin hawkish on budget ECONOMIST and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Alice M Rivlin, 61, has been nominated as deputy budget director. She is best known in Washington as the founding director of the congressional budget office, established in 1975 to provide independent advice on budgetary matters for Congress. In the late 1960s she was an assistant secretary at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and helped implement Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programmes. Ms Rivlin is a past president of the American Economics Association and a past director of economic studies at Brookings, Washington's premier liberal think-tank. She is a director of several US companies. She has written extensively on the US economy, budget policy and many social issues including health care. Physically diminutive, she has a pithy speaking style and gained a reputation for independence as CBO director. Her realistic forecasts often infuriated both White House and congressional committees. In her latest book, Reviving the American Dream, she argues for a radical rethinking of the roles and financing of federal and state government. She believes states should assume full responsibility for a 'productivity agenda', which would include education, skill training, infrastructure and other policies to improve national competitiveness. As a quid pro quo, federal government would assume responsibility for health care. On the budget policy, she is as hawkish as her boss, Mr Leon Panetta. She has argued strongly for tough action to reduce the deficit.</p>

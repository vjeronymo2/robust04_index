			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Bosnia near to ceasefire deal Bosnia's Moslem-led government appeared to be close to a comprehensive ceasefire with the Bosnian Serbs yesterday, despite a mortar attack that killed two men in Sarajevo. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, said the two sides were 'pretty close to the final agreement' on the text of the ceasefire, brokered this week by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president. The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said yesterday that he had issued an order for his men to cease fire today even if Moslem troops do not withdraw from Mount Igman, overlooking Sarajevo, in time for signing the truce accord. Referring to the Moslem withdrawal, Mr Karadzic said: 'We do not make it a precondition for the start of the ceasefire. We understand the withdrawal of Moslem troops should be completed by tomorrow noon, but if it is technically difficult we will wait one or two days.' Mr Akashi held talks with Mr Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale earlier in the day to discuss the truce and said he was hoping to have an accord signed by Friday afternoon. The earlier mortar attack on the main open market in Sarajevo, where 68 people were killed by a mortar in February in the worst single atrocity of the 32-month war, appeared to come from the Serb-held area of Grbavica, the UN said.</p>

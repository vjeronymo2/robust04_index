			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / British Land buys into Stanhope: George Soros and John Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre British Land has acquired 29.9 per cent of the property company Stanhope, in a deal aimed at giving Mr John Ritblat and Mr George Soros control of the prestigious office development at Broadgate in the City of London. The share price of Stanhope rose 14p, or 50 per cent, to 42p, on the announcement. The Stanhope stake will be transferred to the Pounds 500m British Land Quantum Property Investment fund, the joint venture formed last June between British Land and Mr Soros, the US investor who made massive profits betting against sterling in the 1992 currency crisis. British Land hopes to implement a financial restructuring which would leave the fund with 100 per cent of the Broadgate Centre and the Ludgate office development in the City, which are valued at close to Pounds 1bn, and leave Stanhope as an independently managed company. Stanhope announced in November that it was considering ways to strengthen its balance sheet. In June 1993, it had negative net worth of Pounds 15.8m, and its rental income has remained insufficient to cover its debt financing and overheads. Stanhope's main asset is its half share in the Broadgate development, next to London's Liverpool Street station, which cost Pounds 2bn to build and still carries Pounds 800m debt. Stanhope also holds pre-emption rights over the remaining stake, which is in the hands of the receivers at Rosehaugh, which collapsed in December 1992. The company responded to the announcement with a statement that it intended 'to begin discussions with British Land to seek clarification of its proposals for Stanhope'. Stanhope, which has been working on restructuring plans, has been unenthusiastic about the prospect of selling off its prize assets in their entirety. It said it would 'continue to assess, on their merits, all the alternatives available to Stanhope, including any proposal which British Land may make'. Mr Ritblat, British Land's chairman, said: 'The best case scenario would that we take out the Broadgate and Ludgate complexes from Stanhope and the receivers, and we so organise it that Stanhope is solvent and able to return to doing what it does best.' He wanted Stanhope to remain independent, and British Land would not request board representation. The Stanhope shares were part of Olympia &amp; York's 33 per cent stake, which was taken on by the Bank of Nova Scotia. British Land is paying Pounds 1.64m cash, and issuing 753,562 new shares at 440.5p, valuing the deal at Pounds 4.96m, compared with the Pounds 124m paid by O&amp;Y in 1988. Lex, Page 22</p>

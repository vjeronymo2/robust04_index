			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Chinese warn UK on trade prospects British companies will continue to lose out in competition for business in China unless Hong Kong governor Chris Patten backs down and shelves his democratic reforms, the governor of China's Guangdong province has said, Reuter reports from Guangzhou. 'Patten terminated Sino-British talks by adamantly submitting his political reform bill to the Legislative Council, so of course he has to be held responsible,' Mr Zhu Shenlin told Hong Kong reporters on Saturday, in comments similar to those he has made in the past. 'It needs the one who tied the bell to untie it.' Mr Li Ziliu, Guangzhou's mayor, earlier said most British companies had been excluded from an underground railway project in the town because of the row over Hong Kong. His comments prompted British business officials to warn that by proceeding with this stance China risked damaging its international trading standing. Meanwhile, a fresh row has emerged over a BBC documentary on the life of Mao Tsetung which depicts the late chairman as having a taste for sex with young girls. The Chinese embassy accused the BBC of hostility to China and using 'despicable means to sling mud' at Mao. It said the BBC was 'fully aware of the consequences' if it aired the programme as scheduled today. China will borrow nearly Dollars 1.44bn for 17 big agricultural projects during the next four years, the official China Daily Business Weekly said yesterday. It said the long-term, low-interest loans would come from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHRISHON IS RULED ELIGIBLE;  </P> <P> PREP SPORTS: SOUTHERN SECTION DECIDES THAT MISSION VIEJO HIGH RUNNING BACK CAN  CONTINUE PLAYING. SCHOOL PRESENTS EVIDENCE THAT PLAYER'S MOTHER LIVES IN  ATTENDANCE AREA.  </P> <P> Southern Section administrators ruled Thursday that Mission Viejo High School  running back Marcellus Chrishon is eligible to continue playing football after  school officials presented evidence that they said showed his mother is living  within the school's attendance area.  </P> <P> The ruling was made following a meeting between Southern Section administrators  Dean Crowley and Bill Clark; Robert Metz, Mission Viejo principal, and  representatives of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District.  </P> <P> Chrishon's eligibility was questioned because section officials said they had  failed to receive a transfer-eligibility request or hardship appeal when he  transferred from Temecula Valley in July.  </P> <P> Chrishon was ineligible to play football last fall at Temecula Valley, where he  lived with his aunt after moving from Phoenix. He later competed on the track  team there when his mother, Rose Davis, moved to the Temecula area.  </P> <P> Sometime after the track season, Chrishon's mother granted legal guardianship  of her son to Luis and Nelida Amposta, longtime friends of the family. Crowley  had said Wednesday that no records of the change of guardianship had been filed  with his office and added, "As far as we know, the mother is still living in  Temecula."  </P> <P> Southern Section and school officials declined to discuss details involving  Thursday's meeting and released a statement that read: "The CIF Southern  Section office met and reviewed the material presented by the Mission Viejo  High School principal (Bob Metz) and assistant principal (Morris Hawkins).  </P> <P> "From the information presented, it was determined by the Southern Section  office that the athlete (Chrishon) is eligible under the provisions of the  CIF-SS rules and regulations."  </P> <P> Stan Ford, boys' athletic director at Temecula Valley, said he never received  forms regarding Chrishon's transfer from Temecula Valley to Mission Viejo or a  change in guardianship.  </P> <P> A Southern Section official confirmed again Thursday that no records of  Chrishon's transfer or a request for hardship eligibility is on file at the  section office.  </P> <P> School and section officials were instructed not to comment about the absence  of both forms or how that affected Chrishon's eligibility.  </P> <P> Davis, an unemployed nurse, said she is living with the Amposta family along  with her husband, Chrishon's stepfather, Charles Rivers.  </P> <P> When contacted Thursday, Davis said, "I was living in the Mission Viejo area  before the Ampostas moved here. All this is a bunch of bull."  </P> <P> Rivers said school officials met with his wife and Luis and Nelida Amposta on  Thursday morning before conferring with Southern Section officials.  </P> <P> "We had a big meeting at the house and got everything straightened out," Rivers  said. "The CIF has all the facts. Anything else that you need to know, you'll  have to get from our attorney."  </P> <P> Rivers referred further questions to Hiram deFries, offensive back coach at  Mission Viejo and the family's legal consultant. He was not available for  comment Thursday night.  </P> <P> When interviewed Tuesday for a feature story, Chrishon talked about the  transition of moving into the Amposta's Mission Viejo home and referred to  Nelida as "my second mother."  </P> <P> "It's great living with the Amposta family," Chrishon said. "They treat me just  like one of their own kids. Mrs. Amposta is just like my mother."  </P> <P> Chrishon was pictured with the Amposta family in a featured "Senior Families of  the Week" in Mission Viejo's game program last Saturday. Davis, Chrishon's  mother, is not in the photograph.  </P> <P> Dana Hills Coach Don Douglass said the incident has become commonplace in high  school sports.  </P> <P> "It's a sign of the times," Douglass said. "Parents are shopping around for the  best school for their kids, and a situation like this comes up."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo, the sixth-ranked team in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn.  high school football poll with a 5-1 record, meets host Dana Hills (3-2-1) at  7:30 tonight in South Coast League play.  </P> <P> Bob Johnson, coach at rival El Toro High School, was disappointed when he  learned that Chrishon had been ruled eligible.  </P> <P> "That's a joke," Johnson said. "It's a mockery of high school football. Three  different guardians in the last three years. . . . It just makes a joke out of  high school football."  </P></p>

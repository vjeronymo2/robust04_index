			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Czech Social Democratic  Party (CSSD) Chairman Milos Zeman has started his great  offensive with coming of spring, the left-oriented RUDE PRAVO  writes today.    After having welcomed three former members of the Civic  Movement (OH) to his party on Friday [18 March], Zeman was  already fishing in other waters on Monday [21 March] -- for the  first time he called on former Communists not to create new  parties such as the Democratic Left Party (SDL) or the Left  Block Party (SLB) but to join the Social Democrats, thus  strengthening them.    Zeman has put, however, two conditions -- former Communists  will have to have "clean hands" from the past and they must  "sincerely distance themselves from the communist ideology." It  will apparently be the CSSD local branches who will judge who of  the former Communists have distanced themselves from the  communist ideology and how sincerely and whether or not their  hands are clean, the paper says.    It is thus not surprising that SDL Chairman Josef Mecl  promptly reacted to the proposal, arguing that "he did not want  to let himself be dragged into `screening trap of the Social  Democrats'." SLB deputy chairman Jaroslav Ortman was more  cautious, merely noting that he did want to doubt the  correctness of the SLB as a political party.    However, both Mecl and Ortman made sure that their remarks  about the necessity of cooperation between left-wing parties be  noticed. Ortman said that such cooperation would be untenable  [as received] during the senatorial elections and that leftist  parties should offer a joint slate in the local elections in the  Czech Republic in November. Zeman could therefore be satisfied  with the first reaction of both the SDL and SLB. And as regards  the abolition of the two parties and transfer of their members  to the CSSD, here Zeman is clearly playing for time. The former  Democratic Party of Labor (DSP) opposed a similar fate tooth and  nail and look how active its former deputy chairman and  parliamentary deputy Michal Kraus is in the CSSD now, the paper  writes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The government will use approximately  $160 million from the funds allocated for payment of the foreign  debt to supply the Superior Electoral Court [TSE] with the funds  needed to pay election expenses. The agreement was made  yesterday by Planning Minister Beni Veras, PFL [Liberal Front  Party] senator for Paraiba Raymundo Lyra -- the president of the  Budget Committee of Congress -- and TSE President Sepulveda  Pertence. The government chose this solution because the $160  million that was to have been used for repaying the debt can be  resupplied in August, once the budget bill has been voted on.    "If it needs the funds, the government can submit a message  to Congress asking for inclusion of a supplemental credit in the  budget. The budget will have been voted on by August, and there  will be no problem," Lyra said.</p>

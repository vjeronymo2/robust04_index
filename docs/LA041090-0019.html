			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Rock "Tempest" Honored: A rock 'n' roll version of Shakespeare's "The Tempest"  and a drama about four South London clergymen were named the British theater  season's best musical and play at the Laurence Olivier Awards in London. In a  ceremony Sunday at the Dominion Theatre, Bob Carlton's "Return to the Forbidden  Planet" (the Shakespeare adaptation) unexpectedly beat out the favorite, "Miss  Saigon," in the musical category.  </P> <P> But "Miss Saigon," a lavish Broadway-bound musical about the Vietnam War, won  awards for outstanding musical actor -- Jonathan Pryce -- and musical actress  -- Lea Salonga. David Hare's "Racing Demon" was named best play and also took  best actor prize for Oliver Ford Davies. Irish performer Fiona Shaw was named  actress of the year for performances in three productions -- "As You Like It,"  "Electra" and "The Good Person of Sichuan." The annual awards, named for the  late actor Laurence Olivier, are the equivalent of Broadway's Tony awards. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

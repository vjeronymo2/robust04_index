			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] High-ranking Army, Navy, and Air Force officers  yesterday filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging the  constitutionality of the law temporarily suspending the  political party membership of active duty military and  policemen. The three petitions, presented separately, were  signed by General Lino Oviedo on behalf of the Army, Jose  Cespedes Zarza on behalf of the Air Force, and Vice Admiral  Flavio Abadie on behalf of the Navy. The petitions request  putting a freeze on the effects of the law's articles  temporarily suspending military and police political  affiliations. Politicians yesterday wondered about the issue of  Armed Forces institutionalization if the Supreme Court freezes  the effects of the law.    According to court sources, the petition was signed by the  previously mentioned commanders and by General Eduardo Gonzalez  Petit, Pedro Concepcion Ocampos, Pablo Abadie, and all officers  with the rank of lieutenant colonel and up.    Gen. Oviedo, Gen. Cespedes Zarza, and Vice Admiral Abadie  petitions' legal counsels are the attorneys Marcial Pio Flecha,  Silvino Benitez, and Victor Hugo Ronzwisky respectively.    The petitions asked the Supreme Court to freeze the effects  of the law until it can decide on the law's constitutionality.    Cespedes Zarza (Air Force), Vice Admiral Abadie (Navy), and  Gen. Oviedo (representing the Army) signed the petitions  separately.    According to the attorneys, the three petitions have the  same  content--that is, the same legal argument.    Court sources said the Supreme Court might accept the  petitions and freeze the law's effect temporarily. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Norwegians win DM300m Daimler fuel-system order DYNO INDUSTRIER, the big Norwegian chemicals producer, has been awarded a DM300m (Pounds 104.5m) contract by Daimler-Benz to supply fuel tank systems to a new Mercedes model to be produced in 1993, it said yesterday, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. The contract is seen as a breakthrough for Norwegian vehicle parts makers. Awarded to Dyno's German-based subsidiary Dynoplast Elbatainer, it calls for the company to invest DM20m in new production equipment. Dynoplast expects to make 200,000 fuel systems a year for the new Mercedes. STATOIL has awarded Treasure Prospect, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wilrig, a contract valued at over NKr650m (Pounds 58m) covering drilling and completion for 24 wells on the Loke, Sleipner East, Statfjord North and Statfjord East fields, Karen Fossli reports. The contract includes an option for possible additional work which, if exercised, could take its value up to NKr840m, Wilrig said. Loke and Sleipner East are scheduled to come on stream October 1, 1993, with Statfjord North due to start in April 1994, and Statfjord East the following October.</p>

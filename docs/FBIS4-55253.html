			<p>BFN     [Text] The fact that the Serbian [word indistinct] will  not easily give up their idealistic (?intentions) toward our  country is shown by their recent accumulation of manpower and  weapons in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo, as well as the  entire zone covered by the 1st Corps of the Army of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today they continued bringing volunteers  from Serbia and Montenegro and deploying them to positions held  by local Serbian paramilitary units around Sarajevo. A vehicle  full of the aggressor's soldiers has arrived in the Bosut  Barracks and (?a bus full) of chetniks arrived in Vogosca from  Rajlovac.    Truce violations around Sarajevo continue today also.  Chetniks carry out provocations more and more frequently, but  our fighters are not responding to them most of the time. The  enemy opened [word indistinct] fire from the M-84 submachine gun  on [name indistinct] and (Prokolje). The region of [name  indistinct] was hit by mortar bombs. Apart from mortar bombs,  Stupsko Brdo was exposed to sniper fire as well. One of our  fellow citizens was wounded in Rogaticka Street. In the zone  covered by the 1st Corps -- the Visoko front -- in comparison  with the past several days, the aggressor today increased  provocations with infantry and antiaircraft weapons.    Our units in the regions of (Prijeko), Klis, Ravna Gajina,  Zege, [name indistinct], Kokoska, (Metaljke) are constant  targets of Serbo-Montenegrin criminals [words indistinct].  Around [words indistinct].</p>

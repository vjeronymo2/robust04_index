The French envoy expressed this hope at a reception held  here  this evening by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship  With Foreign Countries (CPAFF) to mark the 30th anniversary of  the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties.    In his speech, Peyrefitte said his country has always held  that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate  Government of China.    After the two countries overcame the recent crisis between  them, the bilateral ties have been thrust back onto a right  track, he said.    "We see with pleasure that the two governments have reached  agreements on the improving of Sino-French ties," said Han Xu,  CPAFF president.    "The clouds over the bilateral ties have been dispelled,"  Han  said, adding that these ties have been brought back to normal  and would be further developed.    "China's reform and opening and its modernization drive have  entered into a new phase of development, which provides bright  prospects for Sino-French cooperation and the friendly contacts  between the two peoples," he said.    Among those present at the reception were Wang Hanbin,  vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National  People's Congress, French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant  and visiting French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby cuts flotation price to 115p Hillsdown has decided at the last minute not to sell its stake in Rugby Estates, the company run by its former property team, because of a significant cut in the flotation price. The pricing for the Rugby flotation was announced on Thursday, and the property company is being valued at Pounds 20.75m, compared with an initial target of up to Pounds 30m. The offer comes in the middle of a glut of property flotations, a sharp reduction in the property sector's premium to asset value, and the recent under-subscription of the public offer for Capital Shopping Centres. These factors forced the company to scale down pricing and the size of the share offer. It is placing 13.24m shares at 115p, which will raise Pounds 14.24m for Rugby, compared with the initial aim of raising Pounds 19.7m from the share offer. The placement amounts to 73 per cent of the enlarged company. The pro-forma net asset value per share is 116.8p and the issue price therefore represents a 13 per cent discount to net asset value, compared with the initial expectation of a premium. As a result of the reduced offer price, Hillsdown is to retain its 13 per cent stake, diluted from 49 per cent, because of the new shares. Mr Andrew Wilson, managing director, said he was pleased with the amount raised by Rugby. The company will have 32 per cent gearing on flotation, but Mr Andrew Wilson, managing director, said he would be happy to reach an average figure of 100 per cent.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / US recovery is under way, indicators show A BATCH of positive economic indicators yesterday provided further evidence that the US economy is recovering from recession. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of consumer confidence rose nearly seven points in March, to 54.0. This was the first rise since last June and the biggest since the Gulf war ended last spring. Separately, the Commerce Department said the composite index of leading indicators - the main gauge of turning points in the economy  - rose 0.8 per cent in February, following a strong 1 per cent gain in January. Regional indices of industrial conditions were also up. Chicago and Detroit purchasing managers' indices both rose, indicating faster expansion in manufacturing industry. The figures were published as the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee met to discuss the monetary outlook. The Fed is not expected to sanction another cut in interest rates unless the incipient recovery appears to flag. Mr Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, said he expected the economy's improvement to continue, but he stopped short of declaring the recession over. The reaction on financial markets was muted as many traders were hedging their bets until the release on Friday of the March employment report. This is seen as giving the best monthly snapshot of economic conditions. Most forecasters believe a mild recovery is under way but confidence remains fragile, partly because a similar recovery last spring ground to a halt in a few months. Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said slow growth of employment would restrain the pace of recovery in coming months. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the level of consumer confidence, while the best since last October, remained 'less than reassuring'. The most encouraging sign was a sharp rise in the component of the index measuring consumers' expectations. People were slightly more optimistic about job prospects but the numbers planning to buy cars or homes had fallen slightly. Seven of 11 indicators contributed to the sharp increase in the index of leading indicators. A longer work-week, followed by faster monetary growth and a jump in building permits, provided the biggest boost. An index of coincident indicators - which measures the current state of the economy - rose 0.7 per cent in February after a 0.6 per cent decline in January, another sign that the economy is turning around.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Dixons For Dixons it is a case of YES as in no. The company has finally got rid of its recently renamed US subsidiary Your Electronic Superstore. YES is better known as Silo, in which guise it has cast a long shadow over Dixons' shareholders. In selling YES/Silo to the Fretter group - whose subsidiaries include the quirkily-named Fred Schmid Appliance &amp; TV Co and Dash Concepts - Dixons is at least capping the losses which have made its detour into the US such a disaster. Since YES is being sold as a going concern, Dixons avoids the large hole that would have been punched in its net worth by the costs of closure. While Dixons loses some assets, the 30 per cent of Fretter's shares which it acquires in return limits the write off to Pounds 19.8m. Fretter's retiring family shareholders get a cash payment equal to the current market value of its shares. Yet since that is less than the net asset value of the company before merger, a combination of the assets put into the enlarged Fretter group give the management a decent chance to make a go of the business. If it works, Dixons' equity stake will give it a chance to make money, but potential further losses are limited to the Dollars 50m holding value of the investment. Much Dixons management time has been wasted in the US trying to find a solution to the problems of Silo. That effort can now be usefully redirected towards the UK. Ironically, Dixons only bought Silo when it failed to get Kingfisher. When Kingfisher failed to get Dixons, it bought Darty in France. But that, of course, is a different story.</p>

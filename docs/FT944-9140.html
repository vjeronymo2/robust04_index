			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Jobs and inflation data give Clarke pre-Budget boost Better than expected figures for UK inflation, unemployment and the public finances yesterday provided Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, with a strong base for a confidence-building Budget in 12 days' time. The data reduced fears that Britain would need to follow Tuesday's 0.75 per cent increase in short-term US interest rates with an early rise in bank base rates from 5.75 per cent. Interviewed on BBC Radio's The World at One, Mr Clarke said yesterday's economic news was 'extremely good'. Making clear that there was no automatic link between US and UK interest rates, he said: 'Our interest rates are going to be determined by my judgment on what British inflationary pressures are or are likely to be 18 months or two years out. At the moment we have things well under control.' In official statistics for October, government departments announced: A sharp 45,800 fall in seasonally adjusted claimant unemployment, cutting the jobless total to 2.52m and the rate to 8.9 per cent, its lowest since December 1991. A 0.1 per cent fall in the index of underlying inflation between September and October, leaving the increase in the retail prices index - excluding mortgage interest payments - unchanged at 2 per cent in the 12 months to October. For the second month running, this was the lowest 12-month rate for underlying inflation since 1967. A surplus of Pounds 558m in the public-sector finances last month, bringing the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 19.2bn in the first seven months of the 1994-95 financial year, some Pounds 7.2bn below the deficit for the same period of last year. Economists said falling unemployment, low inflation and the improvement in the PSBR gave the chancellor a good base for announcing spending cuts and reduced borrowing totals for 1994-95 and subsequent years in his November 29 Budget. Department of Employment figures also pointed to a rise in job vacancies and subdued labour costs in manufacturing. Unit labour costs in the quarter to September were 1.4 per cent lower than in the same period of 1993, the largest fall since records began in 1970. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, warned that earnings growth was still above the inflation figure. 'This is an undesirable situation from the point of view of maximising employment growth,' he said. While the underlying rise in average earnings for the whole economy was unchanged at 3.75 per cent in the year to September, manufacturing and production earnings rose to 4.5 per cent. The retail prices index also crept up 0.1 per cent in the month to October, lifting the 'headline' inflation rate to 2.4 per cent last month from 2.2 per cent in September.

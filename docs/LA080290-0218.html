			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JENSON LEAVES TEXAS SAN ANTONIO FOR PEPPERDINE  </P> <P> Pepperdine basketball Coach Tom Asbury lost the first recruiting battle two  years ago for 6-foot-8 forward Byron Jenson, but on Wednesday Asbury won the  second one when Jenson announced he was transferring to Pepperdine.  </P> <P> Asbury recruited Jenson heavily when he was a senior at Salpointe High School  in Tucson in 1987-88, but Jenson signed with Texas San Antonio.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Jenson started several games, but he played a reserve role last  season, averaging 3.1 points and 3.2 rebounds. This spring Texas San Antonio  changed coaches, hiring Stu Starner to replace third-year coach Ken Burmeister.  </P> <P> Asbury said his opinion of Jenson's ability had not changed.  </P> <P> "You always take a gamble on a kid, but I'm very familiar with his background  and I like what's in it," Asbury said.  </P> <P> "He is a sound, fundamental player, and I anticipate that he will be a major  contributor to our team."  </P> <P> NCAA rules require that Jenson, who contacted Asbury last week when he first  considered transferring, must redshirt this season. He will then have two  seasons of eligibility remaining. ERIC SHEPARD  </P></p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Mail-order launch by ex-Next chief A MAIL-ORDER magazine is to be launched next week by Mr George Davies, former head of the Next clothing chain, in his latest venture in clothing retail, Gary Mead writes. Mr Davies said the publication, which he describes as a 'magalogue', will be a cross between a magazine and a mail-order catalogue. The monthly publication will be given away with some newspapers, and will be sold in retail newsagents Dillons. Mr Davies said yesterday he had been 'impressed by changes in the newspaper industry' and that desktop publishing technologies had made it possible to produce a monthly mail-order magazine. The venture has been funded by Mr Davies and a group of friends with Pounds 10m raised with 'very little' finance from banks. Observer, Page 21 Argos results, Page 23</p>

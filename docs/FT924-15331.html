			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Increasingly popular  -Networks JUST three years ago, 70 per cent of personal computers sold in the UK were intended for standalone use, with the remainder destined to join a network or multi-user system. This year, the numbers have been reversed, with 55 per cent of PCs sold being linked in some way, according to IDC, the market research group. The latest networking technology has made it possible to share data among different types of computer, not just between PCs, minicomputers and mainframes but also between PC-compatibles and Apple hardware, and PCs running different operating systems and applications software. The growth in office PC networks is being driven by two converging trends. Some companies are 'downsizing', replacing the traditional office minicomputer and dumb terminals by networked PCs, while others are linking together standalone PCs for the first time. There are many reasons why office PC networks are increasingly popular. In particular, advocates claim that it only costs half as much to get an application up and running on a personal computer network as on a minicomputer. It is not just software development which costs less; tumbling PC prices mean it is also much cheaper to buy PCs and hook them together in a local area network (Lan). Similarly, linking together a group of PCs offers the potential for sharing not only information and files, but also costly resources such as printers and other devices, even in small offices. A basic peer-to-peer network is little more than a collection of cables and special software. Nevertheless it offers a wide variety of potential benefits. The most obvious benefit is file sharing. All authorised users on a PC network have instant access to the files on other machines. This means shared files can be worked on and updated by a group of people without the need for duplicate files on several machines. Similarly, software applications can also be shared. This means training is simplified, productivity is improved and data management becomes easier. In addition, 'groupware' such as electronic mail or voicemail can be implemented. Perhaps most significantly, network resources such as printers can be shared. This means network users can all be given access to expensive high-speed network laser printers, colour printers, plotters, scanners and fax modems. Instead of several expensive devices, the network links everyone in the office to the device and automatically 'queues' requests when more than one person requires access at the same time. Aside from economy, the appeal of a work group sharing one high-quality printer has several attractions. For example, many people in an office do not generate enough print jobs to warrant a dedicated laser printer but may require very high quality when they do print. An office network also allows the integration of non-compatible computers. Many offices today have a mix of PCs, Apple Macintoshes and perhaps Unix workstations. A network can solve the problem of incompatible hardware and operating systems by translating all data into a form that can be understood and used by different makes of computer in the office. There are many non-standard, low-cost networks - many of which do not even require special network adaptor cards - that will allow you to connect up these modest machines and share files, and sometimes even other devices such as printers, between them. However, more sophisticated PC networking, which enables applications to be 'network aware,' requires a system which conforms to certain industry standards covering, in particular, cabling, network adaptor cards and network operating system software. Among the most popular Lan technologies are Ethernet, originally developed by Xerox for use with co-axial cable and subsequently with 'thin-wire' coax and eventually over unshielded, twisted-pair, telephone-style wiring, and IBM Token Ring which is often used in PC networks and has been gaining market share at the expense of Ethernet. But Fiber Distributed Data interface technology, developed with the support of many vendors, is likely to become the dominant standard for the next generation of Lans. Popular adaptor cards include Token Ring and AppleTalk which allows PC users to connect into Apple Macintosh networks, IBM PCN and others. Many low-cost networks are sold as a single package - containing cabling, network adaptor card and network operating system software. But while starter packs are a convenient way to get a modest new network up and running, the real key to success lies in choosing the right 'network operating system' software. It is the arrival of effective PC networking standards in the past couple of years which has most facilitated the growth in Lans and enabled them to grow much faster than the PC industry as a whole. By far the most popular network operating system is Novell's NetWare which claims more than 70 per cent of the market and is supported by virtually all leading network-aware applications. Other leaders in the market include Banyan's VINES and Microsoft with its Lan Manager (and IBM's variant Lan Server). One remaining uncertainty is which underlying PC operating system will emerge victor in the battle between Microsoft, IBM, and Novell which has acquired Digital Research. Although Microsoft is heavily tipped to win this battle - with a combination of its MS-DOS operating system and its Windows operating environment - IBM is fighting back with OS/2, the operating system originally co-developed by IBM and Microsoft as a successor to MS-DOS. Meanwhile the big software houses have jumped on the network bandwagon, developing personal computer applications, or 'group ware' such as Lotus Notes' communications package, designed specifically for PC networking. According to Datamonitor Analysis, local area internetworking equipment, designed to connect otherwise incompatible systems, is the fastest-growing area of the European data communications market and grew by 63 per cent to Dollars 390m last year. Overall, Datamonitor estimates that the total European Lan hardware market was worth Dollars 1.65bn last year. While many of these new hardware and software products are designed to make it easier to manage the physical network system of plug-in PC cards, cables and connecters, the next generation of networks may not even need these. Wireless networks, using radio or infra-red signals in place of cables, have already begun to appear, as have PCs specifically designed for networking.</p>

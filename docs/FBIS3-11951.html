			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for  the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] intends to rally a great  number of people in front of the Port-au-Prince wharf today to  oppose the unloading of cargo from the French ship. With the  arrival of this French humanitarian ship, the political  organization of Constant-Chambelain sees an attempt to turn the  Republic of Haiti into another Somalia. They made this claim  during a news conference on 24 March. Rothschild Francois filed  a report:    [Francois] We do not want this charity that France wants to  throw at us like a bone thrown at an animal after a beating.  That is the way the FRAPH leader recalled the organization's  opposition to the arrival of the French humanitarian ship, Galis  Bay, on 25 March in Port-au-Prince. Emmanuel Constant compared  this humanitarian aid with an attempt to Somaliize Haiti. It is  a sop for the Haitian people, asserted the top leader of FRAPH.  For Constant, it is out of question for the population to accept  those food products from the French Government. FRAPH attacked  France's policy toward Haiti. Paris has always demanded a total  blockade against Haiti, which leads Emmanuel Constant to say  that France is the leader of the international conspiracy  against Haiti.    In order to make the arrival of the French ship a failure,  FRAPH intends to put all its weight in the balance. Thus, FRAPH  is calling for a rally in front of the APN [National Harbor  Authorities] on 25 March. Emmanuel Constant asserted that FRAPH  is ready to repeat 1804 [the rebellion against France] by  preventing the arrival of the French humanitarian aid ship,  Galis Bay.    [Begin recording in Creole] [Constant] Tomorrow we will hold  a huge demonstration to show the international community that we  do not want the ship to dock. We want another negotiation. We  do not want this kind of aid. It is a situation different from  the Harlan County and is more serious because we do not know  what is on the ship. The French Government has suddenly decided  to send food for children. I believe that it is a national  matter and we are counting on the patriotism of every Haitian so  that the demonstration is even stronger that the one on the  arrival of the Harlan County.    [Francois] What if the ship docks anyway, despite the  demonstration?    [Constant] The 1804 events were not in vain. We will repeat  it. I would be ready to accept it. We do not agree, however, to  accept the shipment from the country that is sending it. This  is a country in distress indeed. It is due to the embargo, not  a hurricane. Thus, we should not all of a sudden receive the  prepositioned disaster relief supplies stocked in Guadeloupe.  For the past three years, they should have said no to the  embargo, just like other countries, who are trying to help.  Brazil is helping us as well as other countries. I do not see  why they do not realize that the embargo is killing the  children. That is where the problem lies. We do not want them  to give us fish. We want to learn how to fish. [end recording]    [Francois] FRAPH has announced that it has sent a letter to  the National Harbor Authorities asking the institution to refuse  all access to the French humanitarian ship, an initiative  supported by other political groups. FRAPH also announced the  start of a large solidarity campaign in favor of the deprived  people in Haiti, an operation consisting in collecting food aid  to benefit the deprived. FRAPH indicated two places for  stocking those food products: at the National Radio station and  the National Television Station. The leaders of the  organization hope for the support of members of all social  classes in the framework of this solidarity movement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of </F> the Kingdom of Cambodia"; read by announcer -- dated 22 April]    [Text] Today, the situation in our Cambodia has  deteriorated to the point that our people and our foreign  friends working in our country cannot even enjoy minimal  security.    The fratricidal war continues to ruin and bleed our nation  white, destroying our Kampuchean motherland. If this disastrous  situation continues, our motherland and race will certainly  perish.    Faced with such a tragic situation, it is my duty to invite  Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the Cambodian People's Party and  of the National Assembly of Cambodia; Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for  an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]  Party and first prime minister of the Royal Government of  Cambodia [RGC]; Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the  RGC; and His Excellency Khieu Samphan, head of the party of  Democratic Kampuchea to a Round Table of Peace and National  Reconciliation to be held under my chairmanship at the Royal  Palace in Phnom Penh capital from 2 to 7 May 1994.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 22 April 1994</p>

Ruling coalition and opposition parties are expected  to agree on the setting up the 20-member joint council at a  meeting Monday night of the House of Representatives steering  committee, they said.    The House of Representatives will approve the establishment  of the panel at a plenary session Tuesday. The council will be  formed by 10 members each from both houses.    The House of Representatives, which approved the bills in  November, will select its 10 members from among those who voted  for them. The House of Councillors will send 10 members from  among those who voted against the bills.    If two-thirds of the joint panel members agree on a  compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once  they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of  both houses of the Diet.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would take  political responsibility if he fails to get the package passed,  will put the bills to a floor vote again at a lower house  plenary session if the joint council ends in failure, coalition  officials said.    Hosokawa explained his strategy during a meeting Monday of  representatives from parties in his ruling coalition. The prime  minister told the session that he is ready to meet Yohei Kono,  president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], if  Kono makes such a call.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning  news conference that both the ruling and opposition camps need  to hold frank talks and work out a compromise.    LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato told  reporters the coalition parties should unify their position and  promise not to take a vote at the lower house plenary session  even if talks at the joint panel fail. Under constitutional  rules, bills which were approved by the lower house but  rejected by the upper chamber can be revived for legislation if  the lower house passes it again by a two-thirds majority.    The upper house voted down the package of four  government-sponsored reform bills which among other things call  for the introduction of a combination of single-seat and  proportional representation districts for lower house general  elections in place of multiseat constituencies. The reform  bills also aim to tighten controls on political fund-raising to  stem graft.    Seventeen legislators of the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  the largest coalition bloc, sided with LDP members to reject the  bills.    At a meeting Monday, leaders of seven parties in the ruling  coalition renewed their resolve to pursue enactment of political  reform by the end of the current Diet session, the officials  said.    The coalition is determined to enact the bills as a package  that encompasses antigraft measures, the officials said. The  political reform bills will only be effective to wipe out  corruption if they are enacted as a package, the officials said.    The 90-day schedule of the present extraordinary Diet  session  was extended for 45 days beyond the initial deadline on December  15 to achieve Hosokawa's pledge to act on political reform bills  during the current parliamentary session. The Diet session ends  Saturday.    Since taking office in August after ousting the LDP from its  38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has staked his political fate on  enacting political reform.    In the wake of Japan's political turbulence, Tokyo stock  prices plunged sharply with the 225-issue Nikkei stock average  plummeting 954.19 points to finish at 18,353.24.</p>

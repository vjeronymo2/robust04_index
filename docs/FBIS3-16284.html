			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have some urgent problems here on Russian TV  today. For example, today the Ministry of Communications is  cutting us off from all channels of transmission of video  material from other cities and countries. Yes, talking  on-screen for 20 minutes is not one of the easiest tasks for a  newscaster. It seems that Russians will have to do without  bright pictures as well as having to do without good-quality  bread. Well, that's enough gloomy news; we do have something to  boast about: We are the national TV station.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Observer: Play it again James Is Lord Hanson, founding chairman of Britain's 10th biggest company, going to lose one of his most cherished possessions - his licence to serenade the citizens of the nation's capital? Melody Radio, one of Hanson's stranger diversification moves, is among the six existing London broadcasters to pop in their licence reapplications yesterday. But, given that there are another 42 applicants bidding for a total of eight licences, it would seem rather unfair if all the existing stations were allowed to hold on to their slots. Why Britain's 10th biggest company needs to own a local radio station has baffled some Hanson-watchers. But Sheila Porritt, Melody's managing director, is unmoved by such ethereal questions. Melody has achieved virtually everything that it promised when it started broadcasting three years ago. Its weekly audience of 1m listeners gives it a market share which is bigger than newcomers Kiss FM and Jazz FM combined, and second only to LBC Talkback. What Melody has not yet done is to struggle out of the red, even though its profit and loss account is being helped through the recession by a spot of Hanson corporate advertising in between m'Lord's favourite tunes. (Suitably balancing dollops of advertising by the company, needless to say, are to be heard on LBC). Sounds as if Lord Hanson, at least, has no intention of letting himself be outbid on this pet venture.</p>

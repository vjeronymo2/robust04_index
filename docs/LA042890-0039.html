			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTING UP FOR PLAYOFFS JUST FINE WITH THE NBA  </P> <P> I don't blame Harry Glickman, president of the Portland Trail Blazers, for  complaining about Pat Riley's action in Sunday's game.  </P> <P> The fans in Portland didn't pay to see Riley's scrub team perform.  </P> <P> But at least they saw the strength in Riley's bench. Larry Drew shooting a  fantastic one for 16 and Cooper and unbelievable one for 14.  </P> <P> MARVIN H. SUSMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Compaq and Digital send mixed messages Wall Street US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range either side of opening values yesterday as the equity markets continued to digest the latest third-quarter corporate earnings news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.78 at 3,645.10. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.14 easier at 466.07, while the American SE composite finished 0.49 firmer at 476.59 and the Nasdaq composite off 0.46 at 768.25. NYSE volume reached 307m shares. After several weeks of steady gains, and two days of heavy profit-taking, the markets appear to be at a crossroads. In the absence of fresh economic news, equity investors struggled to find a new direction yesterday. The bond market was in solid form - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond has dropped to 5.821 per cent - but it failed to provide stocks with much support. Consequently, trading was uninspired and prices hovered around opening values throughout the day. Overnight strength in foreign markets was largely ignored and investors' attention was primarily fixed upon the latest batch of quarterly results. Among those reporting yesterday were two big technology companies, Digital Equipment and Compaq. The former announced a wider than expected quarterly loss, driving its shares down Dollars 1 to Dollars 35 1/8 . Compaq, however, surpassed analysts' forecasts with its own profits announcement, and the stock climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 64 7/8 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 after the group reported net income of Dollars 1.33 a share, a strong recovery from the Dollars 1.32 a share loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. USAir, however, was steady at Dollars 13 3/4 as investors were left unimpressed by its third-quarter loss of Dollars 178m. Bank stocks, hard hit by profit-taking and concern about lower lending rates cutting into profit margins, rebounded handsomely. Citicorp advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 , JP Morgan added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 72 7/8 and Chemical put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 3/8 . BankAmerica eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 after reporting flat third-quarter earnings. Tobacco shares were weaker, undermined by reports that President Bill Clinton has decided upon a 75 cents a pack increase in the cigarette tax. Philip Morris shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , American Brands gave up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 33 5/8 and RJR Nabisco eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 4 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft rose initially and then fell before rallying to end a net Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 81, as investors nervously awaited the third-quarter results, which were due out after the close. Canada TORONTO finished slightly higher after busy trading. The TSE 300 index gained 7.6 at 4,182.2 and rises outnumbered declines by 382 to 359. Volume was 67.7m shares. Despite the index rise, however, 10 of the 14 sub-indices were lower, led by transportation, off 1.5 per cent. Golds climbed 2.7 per cent as the New York bullion price rose USDollars 3.55 to USDollars 372.55 an ounce.</p>

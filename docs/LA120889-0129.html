			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PRO ARTE QUARTET PLAYS AT COUNTY MUSEUM  </P> <P> Extraordinary polish and burning intensity characterized the playing Thursday  at the County Museum of Art Bing Theater, where the Pro Arte Quartet delivered  an unusual program of Beethoven and Bloch.  </P> <P> The evening opened with a rare performance of Beethoven's 1799 Quartet in F,  which a couple of years later became the Opus 18, No. 1. The composer did make  some substantive changes, tightening up development sections to create stronger  harmonic motion, but this early version still has the character and drive of  the familiar opus.  </P> <P> In other words, it is still great music. Having reached that verdict, however,  one must give credit to the skillful advocacy of the Wisconsin-based ensemble,  which infused its performance with boundless vitality, telling drama and  unusual eloquence. Paying close heed to the score's often-sudden dynamic  changes, the four delivered a strikingly bold yet never unwieldy reading.  </P> <P> A Middle Period quartet -- Opus 59, No. 3 -- followed, and the Pro Arte took  its fervent, expressive approach a step further. The players may have traded  subtlety and delicateness for incandescence and power, but as before, the  ensemble remained taut, the intonation accurate and the technique clean.  </P> <P> Following intermission, they turned up the heat still further. Joined by  pianist Howard Karp, violinists Norman Paulu and Jae Kim, violist Richard Blum  and cellist Parry Karp put extraordinary muscle into the driving ostinatos of  Ernest Bloch's First Piano Quintet. Alas, that wasn't enough to redeem this  nearly endless stream of melodically barren, rhythmically repetitious,  thick-textured muck. Moreover, in their zeal for explosive power, the musicians  lost some of the control they had earlier exhibited, and both intonation and  tone quality suffered.  </P> <P> Listening to an automobile horn blare for 30 minutes would have been less  enjoyable, but only slightly.

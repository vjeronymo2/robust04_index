			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1849 GMT on 8 February carries a  program entitled "Behind the Letter of the Law," which is  designed to provide a forum for Sergey Filatov, head of Boris  Yeltsin's administration, to explain the Russian president's  decrees.    In the program, Filatov denies media reports that Georgians  are not satisfied with the results of the Russian president's  recent visit to their country, adding that more than 90 percent  of Georgians welcome the new relations between Georgia and  Russia. Filatov said that 300,000 Russians lived in Georgia and  150,000 have already fled the country; the Russian army and the  Russian border guards there are not defended by any legal  regulations.    Filatov goes on to say that Duma criticism of this visit was  not "ethical," because President Yeltsin did say that the  documents of the visit would not be ratified until political  settlement is reached with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.    Referring to the issue of assistance in the establishment of  the Georgian army, which Filatov describes as a sensitive issue  where Abkhazia is concerned, Sergey Filatov says that "since  Russia agreed with Georgia that we will have, as it were, a  common border protection, both for Georgia and Russia and on the  territory of Georgia, then it follows that we should jointly  take care of the Russian and Georgian security interests alike  and that is why there is an accord to set up three military  bases on the territory of Georgia; it is precisely for this  purpose and not for the purpose of occupation, as many say, but  for the purpose, as it were, of preserving that state's  security, and this includes the preservation of the security of  the Russian state as well."    Filatov then reads out Article Three of the Russian-Georgian  treaty: "The sides will take measures to implement effectively  the agreement concerning the temporary stay of the Russian  Federation military formations on the territory of the Republic  of Georgia and they will also conclude -- and here I stress that  it does not say they have concluded already, but just that they  will conclude -- an agreement to render assistance in the  establishment of the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia."  Filatov says that the Russian press regards this as already  done, alleging that such an agreement had already been signed.  Not so, says Filatov, adding that this agreement also depends  on the resolution of the South Ossetian and Abkhazian problems.    Asked by an unidentified interviewer about the economic  aspects of Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Filatov quotes Yeltsin as  having said that "we would not take any steps which would be  detrimental to Russia," and notes that he has nothing to add to  that.    Asked why former finance minister Fedorov and former first  deputy prime minister Gaydar were not included by Yeltsin in his  decree on the composition of the Security Council, Filatov says  that this consultative body was appointed by the president, and  stresses the consultative nature of the council. By law, people  would join the council by virtue of the posts they held and  neither man could any longer be held to qualify.    In conclusion, Filatov says that he looks forward to the  coming signing of the treaty on demarcation of federal powers  with the Republic of Tatarstan, as part and parcel of the  ongoing decentralization process.</p>

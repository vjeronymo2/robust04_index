			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current regulations, it is often difficult to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if donated food is used to produce meals for the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agency and if the value of the donated food is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in a reduction of the food service management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies' fees to the recipient agencies. Because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies are exempt from the processing regulations, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> little the distributing agency or recipient agency can do to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor commodity inventories. Based on the reasons set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble to the proposed rule and the overwhelming response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from commenters in favor of the proposal, the blanket exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of food service management companies from the State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations is eliminated from the section 250.3 definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``processor'' and &sect;250.30(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thirty-three comments were received regarding the proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the definition of ``processor'' to exempt any commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enterprises which handle, prepare and/or serve products or meals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing donated foods on-site solely for the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agency under contract. Thirty-two commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to this change, primarily as it applied to recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Of this number, twenty-five commenters believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all recipient agencies providing meals to other recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, whether on-site or off-site, should be exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor requirements of Part 250. Several commenters stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the use of commodities could be monitored satisfactorily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through existing food distribution review standards. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that recipient agencies should be exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement if they provide for accountability and value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-through for the donated food. This commenter stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this could be accomplished by ensuring that funds obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meals furnished to other recipient agencies are deposited into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recipient agency's food service account. Other commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the proposed rule defining a school food authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides meals to summer feeding programs, child and adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day care centers, senior citizens and others as a processor is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not practical. One commenter stated that the definition could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrected by adding a sentence to the definition that donated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food recipient agencies which prepare their own meals on-site and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare meals for other recipient agencies at the same location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are also exempt from this definition. One commenter stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schools and child care centers should not be classified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial food service management companies if they are eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for participation as recipient agencies in child nutrition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that many of the commenters' responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were based on the discussion in the preamble of the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which dealt with situations in which one recipient agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares meals for another recipient agency. A recipient agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which prepares meals for other recipient agencies is a food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service management company under the definition in &sect;250.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble stated that the Department believes that where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit recipient agency, such as a school food authority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares products or meals containing donated foods for more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one recipient agency under more than one contract in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility or prepares products or meals for any one recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency off-site, that recipient agency is operating as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial food service management company and must comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing provisions of Part 250 pursuant to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the commenters stated that recipient agencies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare meals for other recipient agencies should be exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being defined as a processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the concerns raised by the commenters, however, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3 of this final rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to provide that recipient agencies which prepare products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or meals containing donated foods for more than one recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency under more that one contract in the same facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare products or meals for any one recipient agency off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are excluded from the definition of ``processor'' if the recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency preparing products or meals can provide accountability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any donated foods received from another recipient agency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with &sect;250.16 of the Food Distribution Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and any funds received as payment for preparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products or meals shall be deposited in the meal account of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agency preparing the products or meals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fee-for-Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.3 of the proposed rule would define the term ``fee-for-service'' and delete the obsolete definition of ``processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee''. Sections 250.30 (d) and (e) of the proposed rule would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reorganized to clarify refund, discount, hybrid and alternate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value pass-through systems and to incorporate procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billing fee-for-service end products. Additionally, under &sect;250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract would require those processors who wished to give credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for by-products via a reduction in the fee-for-service price to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify in the contract the specific dollar value amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in the lowered price. Under &sect;250.30(e)(3) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule, end products containing meat or poultry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with any other donated food, would be prohibited from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being delivered and sold to recipient agencies through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributors under fee-for-service contracts. The proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow end products containing meat or poultry and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional ingredients which are not donated foods, to be sold to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient agencies through distributors under fee-for-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. The proposed rule would also permit end products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing meat or poultry, together with other donated food sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly to recipient agencies by the processor, to be sold under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee-for-service contracts. FCS was particularly interested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and recommendations regarding the impact this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have on any products which were manufactured using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of meat and poultry and other donated food and sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through distributors and possible alternatives to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule on this point. A total of fifteen comments was received on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the above proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters responded to the proposed definition of ``fee-for-service.'' Four of these commenters agreed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition as it was proposed. The remaining four commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the definition needed to be expanded. Three of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters in favor of expansion stated that the fee-for-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price and the free on board (FOB) plant price are the same prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and this should be reflected in the final rule. They stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FOB price is the actual cost of producing the end product,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that this price should be the same for all States; the only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference in price would be the cost of transportation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliver the finished end products back to each State. These same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters said that this concept would mean that each processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would only have to prepare one end product data schedule for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire nation. This action would make the idea of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearinghouse for end product data schedules become a reality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other commenter wanted the definition of fee-for-service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded to clearly state that it is a method of payment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing services and is an alternative to a value pass-through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, in addition to being the price representing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor's cost of ingredients, packaging, and overhead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

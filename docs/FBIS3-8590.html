			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- Pavol Kanis, a  parliamentary deputy for the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left],  confirms in the daily NARODNA OBRODA today that Meciar has  offered him the post of Slovak president during talks between  representatives of the SDL and the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS).    "During the talks important and unimportant things are said.  I understood this offer as Meciar merely tossing out the  possibility," Kanis says.    Asked why he did not put his signature under the proposal  for  a confidence vote in the government, which was signed by the  majority of SDL deputies, Kanis says: "The SDL strategy places  the decision on an early election date above other things, and I  am bound to comply with the party strategy. I am expecting that  others will also behave in harmony with the party's line," he  adds.    Kanis says that the statement by Slovak National Party (SNS)  Chairman Jan Slota that he could leave the government coalition  to the benefit of the peace in the state could be described  without exaggeration as "a statement by a real statesman."

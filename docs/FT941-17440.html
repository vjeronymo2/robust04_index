			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets Little in the way of corporate results is due this week. Instead, attention will once again return to the outlook for lower European interest rates. However, NatWest Securities does not believe that Germany will provide a lead by cutting the Discount rate when the Bundesbank Council holds its first meeting of the new year on Thursday, because of the Epiphany holiday in Catholic Lander. Instead, it believes that January 20 is a better bet. Other continental European markets closed on Thursday will include Athens, Milan, Madrid, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vienna. FRANKFURT November industrial production figures during the week are expected to show a further monthly decline while James Capel forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in November industrial orders, reflecting a seasonal bounce in domestic orders. The broker notes, however, that in underlying terms, only export orders are staging a recovery. PARIS The French government is expected to announce this week its decision on the terms of the sale of the cable operations of Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) cable unit, ComDev, for which Generale des Eaux and France Telecom are said to be in contention. October trade figures on Friday are expected to reveal falling exports and rising imports, resulting in a FFr6bn trade surplus, sharply down from the FFr9.6bn surplus in September. AMSTERDAM The Amsterdam stock exchange has this week adopted the European Options Exchange index of 24 leading Dutch shares. The index, unchanged in content and calculation, will be called the Amsterdam EOE Index (AEX). TOKYO Small-lot buying by investment trust managers and financial institutions will support the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues this first week of 1994. Chart analysts expect Japanese equity prices to trade in a narrow range of 17,000 to 17,700. Brokers predict limited stock gains and moderate trading volume amid an absence of compelling reasons to enter the market. Investors will also be awaiting further details on the timing and content of the government's proposed economic stimulus package.</p>

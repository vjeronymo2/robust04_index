			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is preparing to discuss  again tonight a resolution authorizing France to head a  humanitarian operation in Rwanda. [passage omitted]    This evening the OAU--the Organization of African Unity--is  refusing to support this intervention. In particular, the OAU  is raising the dangers that such an operation could entail.  Ghislaine Dupont has just spoken on the telephone to Pascal  Gayana, deputy secretary general of the organization:    [Begin Gayana recording] The OAU is expressing a position as  a continental organization. On the whole, it was surprised to  see that a member of the United Nations had initiated an  individual action at a time when the pan-African organization  had embarked upon an action at the Tunis summit for which it  hoped to get the support of the members of the international  community--including France, of course. It is something of a  surprise for us. We think this is a surprise, given that the  African states had committed themselves to supplying troops in  accordance with the relevant resolution of the United Nations on  Unamir and were waiting for the members of the international  community and of the Security Council, in particular, to supply  as agreed the necessary means.    We understand, in a general way, the motives as they have  been set forth by France, but we are sorry that this was not  done in a concerted framework. [end recording] [passage omitted]    On the French side--despite the various fears and  controversies-- there is still an obvious determination to act,  but Prime Minister Edouard Balladur did, nevertheless, tone down  his speech to the deputies this afternoon. He named five [as  heard] conditions that appear to limit the scope of the  intervention. Bernard Pons, chairman of the Rally for the  Republic group in the Assembly, listed them:    [Begin Pons recording] The first is that the intervention  should be done with the authorization of the United Nations.    The second is that all precautions should be taken in order  to set a time limit for this operation.    The third is that there should under no circumstances be any  operations in the heart of Rwandan territory, but the bases for  the intervention should be in a neighboring country, at the  borders of a neighboring country, in Zairean territory.    Balladur also pointed out that other countries must take  part  in the operation. I think as far as Europe is concerned he has  agreement from Italy, and a certain number of African countries  have given their agreement. I do not yet know how they will  participate.    So there are some conditions that the prime minister regards  as essential. A number of deputies have expressed, not  reservations, but concerns. The prime minister has told them  that he quite understood these concerns, and this was why he  believed there were a number of conditions that it was essential  to respect.

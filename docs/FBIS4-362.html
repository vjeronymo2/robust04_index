			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's  advisers and assistants today worked with the troika of  observers in Lusaka. The National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] says, however, that it will  present no one for the National Electoral Council, CNE, adding  that that is one issue still to be discussed. Pedro Manuel, our  correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports:    Some technical issues pertaining to the UN Angola  Verification Mission-2's mandate and the second round of  presidential elections were discussed during the meeting. The  negotiating teams remained in the warmth of their hotels.    UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has left for Geneva  to  discuss the process of negotiation with UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Beye is only expected back on 8 or 9  April. Until then, there will be no work for the negotiating  teams. In fact, some people say that the proceedings will only  resume on 11 April.    There was talk yesterday that UNITA was proposing changes to  the CNE's organizational and functional framework. Things were  made clearer today: UNITA believes that competing parties  should enjoy parity representation on the CNE. What is more,  Jonas Savimbi's organization also says that public figures in  the CNE must not be picked by the president of the Republic  alone. UNITA has described these as necessary changes to some  points contained in the Electoral Law.    Nothing is known about the government's reaction to that  UNITA proposal. If we think back, however, we will realize that  the government has always said that legal issues can only be  dealt with in Parliament.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thames TV shares fall 33p on provision news THAMES TELEVISION, the independent production company, yesterday announced it was making provisions totalling between Pounds 35m and Pounds 42m on property and on Reeves, its US production arm. The provisions were considerably larger than the City expected and the shares fell 33p to 188p following their relisting yesterday. The shares had been suspended partly because of the pending announcement on provisions and partly because of a report in the Financial Times that Pearson, the publishing, banking and oil services group which owns the FT, was in exploratory talks to buy Thorn EMI's near-60 per cent stake in Thames. Yesterday Thames confirmed that it had been informed by Thorn that it was in talks with Pearson, but that they were at a preliminary stage. The provisions will be taken as extraordinary items. The company said that pre-tax profits for 1992 were expected to be about Pounds 45m in line with City expectations. A formal results announcement is expected in three weeks. As a result of the provisions, mainly flowing from revaluations of central London property and the Reeves library of programmes, there will be an attributable loss. Thames admitted that the interim dividend paid in September was a technical breach of the Companies Act because full interim accounts had not been submitted at the time. It was considering how to address the problem. Early action by Pearson is not expected and there may now be a pause to see how the Thames share price settles down following yesterday's disclosure. If Pearson does decide to bid for Thorn's holding it will have to make a general offer for all the shares of Thames.</p>

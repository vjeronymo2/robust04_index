			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Water softener Yesterday's missive from the water regulator will add to his reputation as a reasonable sort. Mr Ian Byatt is committed to medium-term regulation and allowing water companies to keep the fruits of efficiency. That was just what the market wanted to hear. Still, the document offers little to help the market make even an educated guess at the outcome of the 1994 review. The next fight will be over how to value the industry, from which appropriate return on capital will be calculated. This could still be anything from Pounds 11bn, which is the market capitalisation of the sector once net debt is added back, up to Pounds 100bn, the replacement value of water assets. On the basis of last year's figures, the industry's return on capital could be anywhere between 10 per cent and 1 per cent depending which approach is used. Equally, the regulator has still not indicated what levels of dividend growth and interest cover he thinks are necessary for water companies to fund capital investment. Anglian's interim results were a timely reminder that some companies are more of a hostage to the regulator than others. With few interests outside the regulated business and a capital expenditure programme weighted heavily towards the second half of the decade, Anglian badly needs a favourable pricing formula post-1995. On a favourable reading of yesterday's document, though, the company may have got the measure of the regulator. Efficiency and high standards of service in the core business will evidently be rewarded. Whether the rewards will be enough to maintain dividend growth remains an open question.</p>

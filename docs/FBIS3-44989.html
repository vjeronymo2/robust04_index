			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Xiao: "Experts Stress Enforcement"] </F>   [Text] It is encouraging that China is pulling out all the  stops to reform the banking sector, government finance and  State-owned enterprises this year.    While the reform packages are designed to support a market  economy, it may be hard to carry them out smoothly.    Since this year's reforms are vital, economists have warned  the central government about possible problems that may emerge.  Some departments may misunderstand the reform messages and  others may fail to carry out changes to safeguard their vested  interests.    Economists said these actions could ruin the central  government's reform plan.    Also, an eye should be kept on the economy to prevent it  from  overheating, which will lead to high inflation.    Chinese entrepreneurs and overseas experts are apparently  more optimistic about China's reforms. They say changes are  inevitable.    Their view is based on the past 15 years of reform  experience. Each time reform steps were taken, many people,  particularly economists, were worried. But in the end the  packages turned out basically well.    "We have longed for such audacious reforms (of 1994) for  years and the programme looks good," economist Wu Jinglian told  China Daily over the weekend. Wu is a senior researcher with  the Development and Research Centre, a major think tank of the  State Council.    But Wu warned about possible problems: "Reforms in some  fields are being undertaken by the same people and organizations  that are accustomed to the planned economy.    "As there is no model for them to copy to create a socialist  market economy, they could distort the reforms in practice," he  said.    Another problem is some people who are opposed to reform.  Although they do not openly voice their dissatisfaction, they  try to slow the reform process down in every possible way, Wu  said.    More dangerous, however, are those who flaunt the banner of  reform while sabotaging or illegally profiting from programmes.    "They have taken advantage of loopholes of reform at its  initial stage," Wu said. "They are setting and seeking rents to  pocket money by using their administrative powers in the  immature market."    These people hope the market does not open wider and refuse  to support laws and regulations governing market activities.    Wu said such types of people could be found last year in the  banking and real estate sectors.    "It is hoped that new laws which have been issued, or are to  be announced, will prevent such loopholes," Wu said.    At the same time, the relationship between the central and  local governments should be improved because further reforms,  especially financial ones, focus on re-distributing money  between them.    If localities resent sending the central government more  money, the reforms will fail.    In fact, central authorities, to avoid friction, have  promised that this year's financial reform will not dampen  regional interests.    Observers say the announcement will console local officials  and decrease the cost of reform.    "No matter how difficult it will be, reforms in finance and  taxation must be pushed ahead," said Ding Ningning, an economist  with the Development and Research Centre.    Most economists agree with Wu that the success of reforms,  no  matter how cleverly devised, depends on enforcement.    Fan Hengshan, of the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economic System, said "risks co-exist with success since this  year's reform steps are the biggest.    "There is the possibility that things may go contrary to our  wishes when enforcement is carried out. This requires subtle  handling."    Another possible problem is that an overheated economy may  upset a calm reform environment.    This year's plan has set the fastest pace ever for China's  growth and reforms.    It requires the central government to keep control over the  economy and a vigilant eye on inflation.    Ding believes it will be difficult to achieve this goal.    Control of the money supply has been relaxed since last  September, when most State-owned enterprises were crying for  funds.    According to the State Statistics Bureau, banks increased  69.8 billion yuan ($8.0 billion) of loans as working capital to  industrial enterprises between September and November last year.  During the same period in 1992, the figure was only 25.2 billion  yuan ($2.9 billion).    With the increase in lending, industry grew 29.8 percent  last  December as against the same month of 1992. This was the second  highest monthly growth rate registered in 1993.    Industrial analysts say this is not great news because  growth  is too high for a period of economic readjustment.    The readjustment programme started last July when the  central  government issued a package of measures to cool down the  overheating economy.    Finally, rapid growth fueled by huge investments may  translate into high inflation.    "Unwanted high inflation may emerge around the third quarter  of this year if the central government fails to control the  economy effectively," said Wu Jinglian.    Meanwhile, the elimination of the two-tiered foreign  exchange  rate system has raised the likelihood of inflation.    If prices run out of control, the central government will  have to shift its attention and efforts from reform to fighting  inflation.    This may strand reforms.    China experienced this in the late 1980s. At that time, the  central government tightened control of the economy, which was  then followed by a slow growth rate and a delay in further  reforms.    "It seems that the central government has drawn a lesson  from  this as it reaffirmed it would continue to enhance its macro  control over the economy," said Fan Hengshan.</p>

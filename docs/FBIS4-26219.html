			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Industry Toils for a Competitive Edge"] </F>   [Text] Liu Lihua, a slim young woman in her 30s, has been  selling hot noodles every day in Beijing streets for three years.    Even in the teeth of wintry winds she doesn't give up the  work. The reason is simple: It earns her much more than she  makes in her other job at a cotton-spinning factory, which is  choking on its debts.    As a vendor, she earns about 1,000 yuan ($115) a month, 10  times what she gets from the factory.    "I just idle time away in my factory because I have little  to  do. Our products do not sell well, and the inventory is big,"  she said. "Many of us workers try to get extra pay from  moonlighting."    Liu is one of the millions of textile workers feeling the  squeeze of quasi-unemployment. They stay at work even though  there's little to do. They draw pay that is extremely humble,  and getting even worse as inflation continues to spiral upward.    More than 15 million workers are employed in China's 50,000  textile enterprises. But in 39 major cities about half of the  State textile factories are running in the red.    According to the most recent statistics, these enterprises  lost 1.58 billion yuan ($182 million) in the first 10 months of  1993.    Manufacturing is so decayed that the China National Textile  Council, which governs the industry, has had to lease out some  of its vacant offices in its Beijing headquarters to flourishing  companies, both Chinese and foreign, that are engaged in  healthier trades.    Many industry officials who once cherished their  administrative power have "jumped into the sea"--plunged into  the bracing waters of free enterprise.    Du Yuzhou, vice-chairman of the ministerial-level China  Council of Textile Industry, admitted that efficiency and  exports are slipping.    Exports grew by 6 per cent last year to $22 billion, but  were  offset by a flood of imported--and expensive--raw materials.  This left net export income of only $10.7 billion.    The torpor of the industry belies the fact that China's 1.2  billion people constitute the world's largest textile market.  Its textile exports account for one-seventh of the world's  total, and are the country's leading spinner of foreign exchange.    Nevertheless, the industry is facing harsh competition from  abroad. Chinese textiles (including dyeing products) must cope  with rising costs and outdated technology.    China lags behind such fast-growing powers as Hong Kong and  South Korea. In addition, the emergence of a bundle of export  processing zones in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,  Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand offers  international consumers cheaper alternatives to China [sentence  as published].    "Backward processing technology such as printing and dyeing  has hurt the quality of China's textile products," said Zhou  Xiang, a specialist at the China Textile Institute.    This conclusion is shared by at least one European fashion  designer who sells her silk products in China. Although the raw  materials and workers come from China, she points out that the  printing is done elsewhere.    To prevent being squeezed out of the international market.  the China National Textile Council has drawn up a blueprint for  the industry's future.    Cutting production capacity and modernizing technology are  considered the keys to a revival.    The industry plans to reduce capacity by one-quarter to  improve efficiency and raise quality. By cutting back  production at inefficient plants, the government can invest the  savings in competitive ones.    The blueprint also calls for fostering more technology- and  capital-intensive projects to make enterprises more competitive  against foreign manufacturers.    Top exporters will receive more financial support in  expanding sales.    The government is also encouraging companies to issue stock  to raise badly needed investment capital . The country already  has 69 standard joint-stock textile companies, of which 22 are  listed on stock markets.    Some cities will lease out or auction off small and  medium-sized State enterprises to help them restructure.    At the same time, township enterprises will have more  chances  to develop as demand grows from rural consumers with more money  to spend. In 1992, the country's 190,000 township textile  enterprises produced more than 97 billion yuan ($11 billion)  worth of goods.    Output of the more than 380,000 village-level textile  enterprises, meanwhile, amounted to 63.4 billion yuan ($7.3  billion).    Reinvigorating the textile industry will also depend on the  fast-growing domestic market, which is now learning the value of  marketing as well as production.    Many factories that used to rely on wholesalers are opening  their own sales outlets across the country. In addition, half  of the 8.5 million self-employed Chinese are engaged in selling  garments and textile products .    Authorities also encourage foreign participation in  resuscitating the manufacture of textiles. According to  incomplete statistics from the National Textile Council, the  industry has more than 10.000 joint ventures, representing  investment of more than $7 billion.    The investors include multinational corporations such as the  DuPont Co. of the United States, BASF AG and W. Schlafhorstag  &amp;  Co. of Germany, and TPL of Italy.    Foreign capital has also come from government loans,  international commercial loans and leasing operations.</p>

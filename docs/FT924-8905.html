			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Businesses criticise fees of advisers MANY solicitors, accountants and banks overcharge their corporate clients and provide an inadequate service, a survey of large and medium-sized UK companies has found. The survey of 200 senior executives by Gallup for Eversheds, the national law firm, showed that 25 per cent had recently considered or were considering changing their professional advisers. Banks were the most heavily criticised. Only 12 per cent of the executives said their banks had provided better service than solicitors and accountants over the past year. Complaints about advisers focused on overcharging, repeated mistakes and lack of personal contact. Only just over half of the companies felt they were being charged reasonable fees. Accountants were considered to be overcharging by more than 40 per cent of the sample, banks by 47 per cent and solicitors by 48 per cent. A third of the companies surveyed have changed their solicitors in the past. Companies thinking of changing their lawyers most frequently cited poor advice or inefficient service and high and rising costs as reasons. The survey found that executives felt regional law firms provided the best value for money, the most efficient service and the best working relationships. Only 6 per cent felt London law firms provided the best value for money.</p>

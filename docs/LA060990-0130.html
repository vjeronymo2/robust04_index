			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLS WIFE'S STEPBROTHER DURING BREAK-IN;  </P> <P> SLAYING: THE VICTIM WAS THE CAUSE OF A SERIES OF FAMILY SQUABBLES, CAUSING  OFFICERS TO COME TO THE HOME A NUMBER OF TIMES, NEIGHBORS SAID.  </P> <P> A homeowner shot and killed his wife's stepbrother early Friday morning while  the man was reportedly attempting to break into the family's home, ending a  long string of violent outbursts that disrupted the neighborhood, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Although sheriff's investigators declined to name the shooting victim, he was  identified by neighbors and court records as Alfred J. LeBrun, 25, who had  acquired a reputation as a violent and unpredictable man who repeatedly  attacked and threatened various family members for years.  </P> <P> LeBrun was killed almost instantly by a single shotgun blast to the chest,  investigators said.  </P> <P> The shotgun was fired at point-blank range by Jeffrey S. Alix, 33, the husband  of LeBrun's stepsister, according to investigators. He told deputies that he  accidentally shot his stepbrother after he was awakened in the middle of the  night by what sounded like a prowler, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt.  Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> "I feel numb," Alix said as stood in the living room of his one-story,  single-family home at the end of a cul de sac near the Laguna Hills Golf  Course. "I can't believe it happened."  </P> <P> Alix, an employee of Hughes Corp. in Newport Beach, and his wife, Lynn, 32,  declined further comment.  </P> <P> Alix was not charged in the shooting, Olson said. Once all evidence is gathered  and all interviews are completed, sheriff's homicide detectives will turn the  case over to the Orange County district attorney's office for review, probably  by next week.  </P> <P> LeBrun was under an April 17, 1989, court order to stay away from the couple,  their two young children and Lynn Alix's father, Charles Audette.  </P> <P> Lynn Alix had obtained the court order after she ended a separation from her  husband in March, 1989, Olson said. While separated, she lived with LeBrun,  court records show.  </P> <P> In filing for the restraining order, Lynn Alix said that her stepbrother  repeatedly beat her and her father, Audette, who is LeBrun's stepfather. At  least twice last year, LeBrun "punched and strangled" both Lynn Alix and  Audette, cutting and bruising them, according to the court order.  </P> <P> The 1:58 a.m. shooting occurred when Alix, who had just gone to bed shortly  after returning home from work, heard the front door rattling, Olson said.  </P> <P> "(Alix) goes out in the front room, and at that point, he hears a gate at the  side of the house swing open," Olson said.  </P> <P> Alix grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and walked out of the house. Approaching the  darkened back yard, Alix spotted the silhouette of a man who he thought was  trying to break through the glass door to the kitchen, Olson said.  </P> <P> Alix shouted, and when the intruder turned and lunged at him, Alix fired once,  Olson said.  </P> <P> Lynn Alix, hearing the blast, came running outside, Alix told investigators.  After she flipped on the kitchen light, the couple discovered that the shooting  victim was her stepbrother.  </P> <P> The incident was the latest in a number of attempts by LeBrun to contact his  stepsister since she obtained the court order, which was due to lapse in April,  1992, court records show. LeBrun ignored the order to stay at least 150 yards  from the Alix house on at least six occasions, according to court records. He  was also ordered to stay away from the home of his stepfather and the  elementary school where the Alix children were enrolled.  </P> <P> On July 23, 1989, LeBrun was arrested by sheriff's deputies after Lynn Alix  filed for a citizen's arrest, court records show. She called deputies after he  went to the house and became violent, according to records.  </P> <P> Other records in Municipal Court show a complaint charging LeBrun with assault  and battery and ignoring the court order. The complaint covered dates between  March, 27, 1989, and July, 24, 1989.  </P> <P> A $10,000 bench warrant was issued after LeBrun failed to show up for a court  appearance in Laguna Niguel, a court clerk said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's investigators were trying to piece together how the long-lasting feud  between the relatives began or why it continued, Olson said.  </P> <P> Most residents of picturesque Torino Street were reluctant to speak publicly  but confirmed privately that LeBrun continued to visit the Alix home since the  court order was issued. They said that for years, LeBrun had disrupted their  lives with outbursts that sometimes drew deputies to the Alix home.  </P> <P> For hours after the shooting, curious residents stood on their immaculate lawns  watching homicide detectives collect evidence in the back yard. While  investigators worked, eight squad cars and a fire truck remained parked along  the narrow residential street.  </P> <P> LeBrun had recently been seen around the house by neighbors, performing chores  such as mowing the lawn. He seemed peaceful at the time, neighbors said.  </P> <P> One neighbor said that police had been to the Alix residence several times in  recent years to arrest LeBrun.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of strange things going on at that place," said the neighbor,  who declined to give his name.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 17 -- The efficiency of Vietnamese  investors has played a decisive role in the successful  implementation of joint ventures with foreign partners in  Vietnam, the chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and  Investment (SCCI) told a two-day conference last week.    Cabinet Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan was addressing the conference  aimed at reviewing the implementation of the law on foreign  investment.    Now, there are about 3,000 Vietnamese entrepreneurs working  in foreign-invested enterprises, especially in joint venture  enterprises.    According to SCCI, over the past six years the Vietnamese  investors had done their best to overcome difficulties and  accumulated much experience in investment management.  Vietnamese investors drew many foreign partners with a volume  of high investment capital aimed at promoting production and  commerce, thus creating effective cooperation for mutual  benefits, Xuan told the conference.    Over the past six years, the foreign investment enterprises  earned USD 780 million through their goods production and  service, Xuan said.    However, some of Vietnamese investors involved in management  had poor knowledge of the investment law and business practices.  Foreign partners, on the other hand, were very experienced and  able to overcome difficulties as they arose.    Up to March 1994, SCCI has granted licenses to 900 foreign-  invested projects with a total registered capital of USD 8.5  million.    Vietnamese investors said one of the greatest difficulties  in  executing foreign investment projects was the small contribution  of the Vietnamese partner compared with the foreign party.    On average, the Vietnam's contribution to the total capital  usually amounts to no more than 30 per cent.    SCCI made known that Vietnamese investors will be granted  training courses covering basic knowledge of investment  cooperation. In the future the joint venture enterprises expect  to receive officially-educated cadres.    SCCI will issue management policies, thus creating better  conditions for the Vietnamese investors to become involved in  running foreign-invested enterprises. It intends to set up a  club for the Vietnamese investors.    Minister Dau Ngoc Xuan said that in the past six years,  Vietnam had established a foothold in foreign markets by drawing  on the capital of the 500 foreign investor companies from 40  countries.    The government is determined in 1994 to make investment  procedures simple, clear-cut and strict so as to make the  investment environment in Vietnam more attractive, Minister Dau  Ngoc Xuan added.</p>

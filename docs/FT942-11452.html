			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Clinton names Schapiro as new chief of CFTC President Bill Clinton this week ended a two-year-old game of musical chairs at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by saying he intends to nominate Ms Mary Schapiro as Chair and Commissioner. The agency has primary oversight over derivatives trading in the US. Ms Schapiro's candidacy, which had been expected, was supported by the futures industry, which believes her broad experience with the CFTC and with the Securities and Exchange Commission will benefit the inter-agency co-operation now critical for derivatives regulation. The CFTC has been without a permanent chairperson since Mr Clinton took office, and during that period has had three acting Chairs.</p>

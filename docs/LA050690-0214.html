			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLAIN MARINE FEARED POST IN PHILIPPINES, HIS BROTHER SAYS  </P> <P> The brother of a U.S. Marine from El Toro who was killed by a shot to the head  in the Philippines said Saturday his family is outraged, and he labeled the  Buena Park man's death an act of terrorism.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy identified the slain American as Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette,  34. Fredette was attached to the 323rd Marine Fighter Squadron based in El Toro  and had been on temporary duty at Subic Bay Naval Base for one month.  </P> <P> "It's cold-blooded murder. Terrorism, call it whatever you want," said Mark  Fredette from the family's home in Chicopee, Mass. "This happened for nothing.  It tore out the heart of a lot of people around here."  </P> <P> This was his brother's second trip to the Philippines, and he expressed concern  to his family about returning there, Mark Fredette said.  </P> <P> "He told our mother that he didn't want to go. But the job required his  expertise," the brother said. "He knew what was going on there."  </P> <P> Philippine police said Fredette was killed by a single bullet in the back of  his head while he was walking at 11:30 p.m. Friday in the liberty city of  Olongapo, 50 miles northwest of Manila.  </P> <P> In Manila, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt "expressed shock and sorrow at the  cowardly murder" of Fredette, an embassy statement said. It said U.S. officials  were in touch with Philippine authorities regarding the investigation of the  case.  </P> <P> No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but police suspected  Communist guerrillas. Fredette would be the ninth U.S. victim of a rebel terror  strike since October, 1987 and the first in Olongapo.  </P> <P> Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukree said Fredette was shot by "an unknown assailant"  and refused to elaborate. But Philippine police officials believed the  Communist New People's Army was behind the killing.  </P> <P> Family members said Fredette was last seen at a bar just outside the base. His  body was found in a nearby alley, Mark Fredette said.  </P> <P> "He wouldn't fight. He was too smart for that," he said. "He was the kind of  person who would help someone who was in need. A real gentle giant. . . .  </P> <P> "We're all very angry. We just hope the people responsible are brought to  justice," he said. "We do it for drug dealers, we have to do for a man who  served his country for so long."  </P> <P> Fredette enlisted in the Marines at age 18 and rose to gunnery sergeant, one of  the highest-ranking enlisted positions, family members said. He served in the  Marines for 13 years, 10 of them at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> In 1986, he managed the on-deck electronics system aboard the aircraft carrier  Coral Sea when fighter jets from the ship bombed Libya, his brother said.  </P> <P> It was his expertise in electronics that led Fredette to be dispatched with  other members of the squadron to Subic Bay, where he was repairing airplanes,  family members said.  </P> <P> Fredette left the United States in April, serving briefly in Japan and Hawaii  before moving to the Philippines, his brother said.  </P> <P> "He loved his job," Mark Fredette said. "He joined the Marines right out of  high school with a buddy. He just liked what he was doing there. . . ."  </P> <P> Mukree said off-base travel for the 40,000 military and defense department  employees and their dependents was restricted after the shooting.  </P> <P> "There's a very somber mood here. We truly feel the anguish that the family  must be going through," Mukree said. "The Marine Corps is going to be behind  them."  </P> <P> In addition to his wife Julie, Fredette is survived by his parents, Augustine  and Armand Fredette of Chicopee, and eight brothers and sisters.  </P> <P> Family members said Fredette will be buried in Chicopee two weeks after  investigators in Manila release his body.  </P> <P> The attack came nine days before the start of exploratory talks on the future  of six U.S. facilities in the Philippines, including the giant Clark Air Base  and the Subic Bay Naval Base. The leases expire next year, and there is  considerable sentiment in the Philippines not to renew them.  </P> <P> Eight Americans have been killed in the Philippines since October, 1987, in  attacks blamed on Communist guerrillas. Among them was Army Col. James Rowe, a  decorated veteran of the Vietnam War and former prisoner of war.  </P></p>

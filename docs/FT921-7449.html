			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: Performance-related pay should be a prerequisite for managers Sir, Your leader, 'The rewards of failure' (February 19), is timely. We have long sought better disclosure of remuneration information, as a way of 'concentrating management's mind'. A more performance-related approach to remuneration, based on targets linked to corporate objectives, is a prerequisite at management levels. Yet far too few companies have a rigorous appraisal system at senior levels. Often their idea of performance-related pay is the use of a discretionary share option scheme. As you rightly say, this entails no risk. Incentive without risk is like heaven without hell. It is an upside-down logic that encourages greater risk for employees through company-wide Save-As-You-Earn option schemes than for senior management with discretionary schemes. Are you likely to be in a position to write a leader in two years' time entitled 'Justified rewards of success'? Sadly, I doubt it. James Cane, Greenly's, 39 Thames Street, Windsor, Berks SL4 1PR</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Steve Ball in Shenzhen and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpts] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng has given  Shenzhen a shot in the arm by endorsing its free-market reforms.  The supportive statements of the senior cadre who will  officiate at the opening of the Daya Bay nuclear plant tomorrow,  were partly responsible for the 5.74 percent jump in the  Shenzhen stock index yesterday.    Mr. Li arrived at the special economic zone early yesterday  morning after a five-day inspection of neighboring Zhuhai.  Security was extremely tight with police armed with sub-machine  guns and assault rifles stationed on every road junction, while  others patrolled in unmarked pick-up trucks. Mr. Li's motorcade  had more than 30 motorcycle outriders and half a dozen station  wagons with heavily armed escorts.    Sources in Shenzhen said Mr. Li, who has visited Shenzhen  annually in the past few years, headed straight to the local  bourse. "Li heaped praise on the stock exchange as a vehicle for  raising capital and restructuring the state enterprise system,"  an informed source said. "The premier expressed confidence  Shenzhen economy could cross a new threshold once every few  years."    "However, the premier also told bourse staff that progress  of  the 'stocks system' must match the pace of development in the  entire country." The source said his brief remarks were  interpreted by brokers and investors as a pat on the back for  Shenzhen and the Guangdong coast in general.    The Credit Lyonnais index for Shenzhen's A shares shot up  98.09 points yesterday to close at the 1,807.18 mark.    During a previous visit to the Shenzhen bourse, the premier  issued a stern warning against "speculationary activities" and  insisted that the facility remained a "socialist stock exchange".    "Li listened to reports about Shenzhen's economic  development  the whole afternoon," a local journalist said last night. It is  understood the premier gave instructions to a few cadres who  would shortly take over leadership positions in the economic  zone.    Local sources said Mr. Li would today tour major  infrastructure projects in Shenzhen, including the new airport.  Shenzhen officials said Mr. Li had shown "great personal  concern" for the Daya Bay facility. [passage omitted]    Cadres in Shenzhen said yesterday at a time when hundreds of  China's open cities had been granted "preferential policies"  akin to those of the special economic zones, Mr. Li's remarks in  the two zones were a great cause for reassurance.    As is the custom with the provincial tours of senior cadres,  Mr. Li's presence in Shenzhen or Zhuhai was not recorded by  local papers or TV stations. When told that it was Mr. Li who  was in town, local residents expressed wishes he could use his  authority for the benefit of the zone. One driver suggested  that the premier take a good look at Shenzhen's roads. "The  city Government never thought the place would develop this  quickly," he said. "The cars and lorries are all over the  place. It's a real mess."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- ANC premier designate  for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region Tokyo  Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] called for the resignation of the  head of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] on the East Rand.    Addressing about 1,000 township residents in the vernacular  in Thokoza's Khumalo Street he said the NPKF's East Rand chief  issued ineffectual orders and he usually sent only a handful of  troops to handle extremely tense situations.    Mr Sexwale added the ANC was going to ask for members of the  SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF] to return to the East  Rand and act and operate in conjunction with the NPKF. Mr  Sexwale's comments came against a background of running battles  Monday and Tuesday between opposing hostel residents and  township dwellers.    On Tuesday, SAPA reporters in the township saw at least half  a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit Hospital.  Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at least 40  wounded in the violence.    The ANC leader's comments also follow demands by the Inkatha  Freedom Party -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- that  the NPKF withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on  Tuesday. The IFP also demanded the immediate return of the SADF  to the East Rand.    SAPA reporters in Thokoza said it also appeared as if SADF  troops were returning to the township to restore order.    By 2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower  Khumalo  Street by what appeared to be defence force troops. A spokesman  for the SADF's Wit Command told SAPA the army was lending  "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request of the  NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to the East  Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits Command.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Panel to force bid disclosure earlier The Takeover Panel said it is prepared to force companies planning a bid to make a public announcement immediately it notices sharp rises in the share price of the target company. In its annual report for the period ended March 31 1994, the Panel said: 'In some cases the requirement to make an announcement of a possible offer may upset detailed planning and may even lead to abandonment of the offer.' However, even if forcing disclosure would jeopardise the bid, the Panel is prepared to do so 'in the interests of fairness to the market'. Recent instances where the Panel has compelled public announcement of a bid were Enterprise Oil's offer for Lasmo and De La Rue's offer for Portals. Concern about cases where pre-offer bid speculation leads to sharp share price increases remains a Panel priority. Mr William Staple, director general said 'the golden rule' is that a 10 per cent rise in a target company's share price would prompt the Panel to force disclosure of a planned bid, but extenuating circumstances were taken into consideration. In its annual report, the Panel said that in order to reduce the chances of pre-bid information leaks, an advisory organisation should not be included in talks until the latest possible moment and that the number of individuals involved should be kept to 'an absolute minimum'. Separately, Mr Staple said that the Panel would review its current rules regarding cash offers for shares in the midst of an all-paper bid. The move stems from widespread complaints about Enterprise Oil's purchase of Lasmo shares during its bid at a price far above that prevailing in the marketplace. Several of the Panel's non-executive directors have said they wished to see the rule reviewed. In its accounts, the Panel said it was halving the fee it charges the Stock Exchange to Pounds 1 on equity transactions over Pounds 10,000. The Panel has already accumulated a surplus of Pounds 4.6m which it deems sufficient for current operations.</p>

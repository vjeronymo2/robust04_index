			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Australian investment recovers A recovery in Australian business investment finally got under way in the second quarter of 1994, with new capital expenditure for the three-month period showing a rise of 7.7 per cent in constant price terms. This was higher than most analysts had predicted (most forecasts were around the 5 per cent mark) and follows a fall of more than 5 per cent in the first quarter. Spending on plant and equipment rose 14.4 per cent in real terms, while spending on buildings was down 5.4 per cent. The better-than-expected figures have come as a big relief to the federal government.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Observer: Unfathomable Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator in charge of Ofwat, seems to have sunk the industry's finest with his outfit's latest missive, which attempts to set a benchmark for operating efficiency. 'We have whole teams of technicians working on this and even they don't understand it,' wails one water company chief executive. Ofwat wants the companies to apply tests for something called 'heteroscedasticity', using models of the 'stochastic cost frontier'. Boffins are stumped and even Ofwat hints that these are deep waters. Its letter adds: 'The bottom line is that the estimated decompositions of the error variance for the models. . . are very different and hence not too much reliance should be placed on them.' Sure thing.</p>

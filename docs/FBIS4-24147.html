			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 23 SAPA -- Fiscal discipline had  to be balanced against the country's needs rather than the  International Monetary Fund's prescriptions, the Congress of  South African Trade Unions [COSATU] said on Thursday [23 June].  Reacting to Wednesday's budget, COSATU said in a statement the  emphasis on fiscal discipline was one-sided.    "Fiscal discipline had been repeatedly raised as a virtue in  itself, without the assurances that this would not be done at  the expense of economic development or social justice," the  statement said.    COSATU welcomed "without reservation" the five per cent  transition levy saying it was "the first truly progressive  taxation measure" which contributed to the aim of the  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    On military spending, COSATU said it was difficult to accept  that defence spending should increase from R9.3 billion [rand]  to R10.6 billion in a reconstruction and development budget.  "While we understand that certain costs have been incurred by  the process of integration, a democratic South Africa which is  at peace with the world cannot justify spending such huge sums  on the military, including R1.5 billion on fighter aircraft.    "We are further alarmed to see that vast sums are being  spent  on para-military expenditure for the police. In a period when  the emphasis should be shifting to community policing it is  difficult to understand why half a billion rand has been  allocated to buying armoured vehicles for the police."    COSATU added it supported the call for an urgent defence  review, involving all sectors of society, to be completed before  next year's budget.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Companies reject Major's view UK companies blame their recent difficulties on the domestic economy rather than the worldwide recession or high exchange rates, a survey claims. It says they do not share Mr John Major's view that the wordwide recession is to blame for Britain's woes. The chief failings in the UK economy are cited in the survey as low consumer confidence and high interest rates. The survey of more than 600 companies was conducted last spring by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business School. 'Although the prime minister and the former chancellor (Mr Norman Lamont) have repeatedly blamed Britain's woes on the worldwide recession,' it says, 'the results suggest that the view from the front was focused primarily on their domestic origins'. More than half of the companies - mostly large manufacturing groups - said they had been severely affected by the recession, and almost half expected it to last for at least another year. Companies blamed their problems mainly on economic factors rather than their own actions, though a significant minority blamed the merger boom of the late 1980s and excessive expansion on their own part. Actions taken in response to the downturn largely depended on how badly companies had been damaged, the survey says. The worst affected were most likely to take financial steps such as disposing of assets, cutting dividends or raising fresh capital. The report says the findings offer little comfort to those who believe recessions help industry by making it leaner and fitter. 'There has been a major retardation in the rate of investment in plant and equipment and there has been widespread disruption to normal methods of labour-force organisation,' it says. The public remains uneasy about the strength of the recovery according to a Gallup survey of consumer confidence conducted on behalf of the European Commission, Emma Tucker writes. Although expectations have not dropped significantly from October's sharply lower levels of confidence, only a quarter of respondents expected the general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months.</p>

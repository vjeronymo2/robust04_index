			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] A new crisis has developed in Tehran-London ties  following London's unfounded claims that Iran is backing the  Irish Republican Army, IRA. The crisis in Iran-Britain  diplomatic ties assumed a wider dimension when the Iranian  Foreign Ministry -- in response to the accusations levelled by  certain London officials against Iran -- handed over a protest  note to the British charge d'affaires in Tehran, Geoffrey James.    In other sharp reactions, the Foreign Ministry's director  general for Western Europe, Mr. 'Ali Ahani, and the Iranian  charge d'affaires in Britain, Mr. Gholam Reza Ansari, while  rejecting Britain's claims in this connection, considered as  irresponsible that country's action, which has no evidence.    Tehran-London ties have always undergone fluctuations during  the 15-year period since the victory of the Islamic revolution  in Iran. As the record of these relations indicate, though  Iran-Britain ties have been quite widespread on the economic  front, such ties on the political dimension and within the  diplomatic framework have always been influenced by various  factors. Britain's constant siding with the U.S. in countering  the Islamic revolution and pursuing policies aimed at isolating  Iran on the international scene, as well as Britain's support  for Salman Rushdie, the apostate writer of the blasphemous book  "The Satanic Verses," are all factors worth pondering in this  regard.    At present, too, it seems that by resorting to the old  tactics in a new shape, under the title of concern over Iran's  covert links with the IRA, British officials are trying to  (experience) a new cold wave in the two countries' ties.  Despite this, political observers believe that, though the  outcome of the present crisis in Tehran-London ties is not  predictable, it is possible that the London officials'  insistence on continuing irresponsible conduct may neutralize  the efforts that the two countries have made in opening a new  phase in relations since last fall.    Tehran officials undoubtedly consider the recent act of  British officials as being devoid of any logical justification  and unacceptable, because, before reflecting London's concern  over Tehran-IRA ties, it is considered as a reflection of  Britain's domestic policy considerations and can only please  those who want to benefit from the two countries' differences.  This is a point not missed by the British press and several  analysts have described the recent British act as a tool for  justifying its defeat in the Northern Ireland peace talks.  According to these analysts, British officials are now trying  to link Ireland's republicans to a foreign country in order to  deviate public opinion and prepare the ground for the success of  the next round of the peace talks.</p>

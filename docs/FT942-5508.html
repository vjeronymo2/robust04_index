			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Bentsen to press for Japan boost Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, (pictured left) yesterday signalled the US would continue to press Japan to boost its economy with the aim of lowering its trade surplus. Speaking ahead of next week's talks among leading industrialised countries at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, Mr Bentsen said he would like to see Japan cut its income tax soon, then at a later stage move to raise consumption taxes. 'Hopefully that would further stimulate their economy and help in the balance of trade,' he told a Confederation of British Industry lunch in London. Mr Bentsen stressed the US was pressing Japan to open markets for the benefit of all nations. Emphasising US determination to encourage global recovery, he said the adminstration was committed to having Uruguay Round trade liberalisation measures in effect as quickly as possible and 'well before the European Union ratification is complete'. Mr Bentsen said US Treasury economists calculated the Uruguay Round would have the same effect as tax cuts of Dollars 975bn (Pounds 645bn) in industrialised countries between 1995 and 2004. Including developing nations, the Round would yield a 'global tax cut' of Dollars 1,500bn-Dollars 2,000bn over a decade. He gave an upbeat appraisal of the US economy. The recent rise in US long term interest rates was not a major constraint, although there was a 'modest lessening' of activity in the housing sector. The increases in employment, highlighted by yesterday's new payroll figures, had not caused inflationary pressures. The US economy had accommodated the rise in employment through increases in productivity and capital expenditure. 'Inflation does not seem to be a factor now. It looks like it will stay that way for some time.' Nearly 3m new jobs had been created since the Clinton administration took office and it was 'well on the way to the 8m' target set for the four-year presidential term. 'The fundamentals of our economy are in great shape. I haven't seen it this good for 20 years,' he said. Mr Bentsen said he was encouraged by economic developments in the UK and the rest of Europe. Britain had resumed its position as the biggest foreign direct investor in the US last year, he disclosed. 'The preliminary numbers show that UK investment in the US is up by nearly Dollars 10bn for 1993, with total investment of well over Dollars 104bn, again exceeding Japan,' he said.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Commodities - a stake in the real world / If you're bored with equities, why not invest in natural products? Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton examine the prospects Forget stocks and shares: the latest investment theme is real products that you can eat, burn, or make things with. Fund managers are saying that the world economic recovery will increase the demand for commodities - mining and agricultural products as diverse as zinc, oil, gas, rubber, soya beans, sugar and pork bellies - and drive prices higher. The other big idea is that because the prices of commodities are inversely correlated with equity and bond prices - so that commodity prices rise when equity and bond prices are falling, and vice-versa - the overall volatility of a portfolio should be reduced. A commodity element in a portfolio is supposed to act as a hedge against inflation, too. This is not just because prices of real assets like commodities tend to rise in line with inflation; in fact, rising commodity prices are a factor in generating inflation. The worry about investing in commodities now is that the prices of several major commodities - particularly coffee and copper - have had spectacular increases already this year. Cynical investors might wonder if, once again, they are being invited to board the bandwagon near the top of the hill just in time to start heading down. But Ronald Gould, of BZW Investment Management, argues that while a few individual commodity prices may have raced ahead, commodities as a whole are up only 5 per cent so far this year. Indeed, if you take a 12-month view, they are actually down slightly. Investment trusts Until now, there have been few investment trusts offering the private investor exposure to commodities. The nearest is Julian Baring's Mercury World Mining trust, launched about a year ago. But two London investment managers are hoping to catch the growing interest in commodities by launching new investment vehicles. Fleming is in the early stages of launching a natural resources investment trust, while BZW is a little further ahead with its commodities trust (while this actually is a Jersey incorporated investment company, it will be listed on the London stock exchange and behave just like a normal investment trust). Institutional investors have committed themselves to buy shares worth just under Pounds 70m in this fund; the offer for private investors closes later this month. Neither Fleming nor BZW will invest in physical commodities - no warehouses piled high with coffee beans or tankers full of oil. That apart, the two funds will take very different approaches to the sector. BZW's strategy is based on using derivative products to gain exposure and it aims to beat the Goldman Sachs commodity index. While some risk-averse investors may be alarmed by the very word 'derivatives', Gould stresses that BZW will not use these to gear up the fund. Instead, the managers will buy mainly loan notes, where the return is linked directly to the price of an individual commodity or index; or commodity-linked swaps, which are more speculative except that BZW will back them with cash in short-term money market instruments. The fund's model portfolio will have just over half its assets linked to oil and gas, with smaller amounts in livestock, agricultural commodities, industrial and precious metals. The asset allocation is similar to, but not identical with, Goldman Sachs' proportions. Fleming, on the other hand, is planning to get exposure to commodities by buying shares in companies around the world which are involved in extracting, cultivating and processing natural resources. The managers will have an industrial bias, concentrating on oil, gas and non-precious metals rather than the more glamorous gold and platinum. The idea is to ride the commodities cycle, so the fund will have a limited life of between three and seven years. This allows the managers to sell up at the most opportune moment. BZW's minimum investment level has been set at Pounds 5,000 in order to exclude small-scale or novice investors. The fund is aimed at institutions or sophisticated private investors looking for diversification opportunities. The prospectus states quite clearly that the trust 'should be seen as complementary to existing investments in a wide spread of other financial assets, and should not form a major part of an investment portfolio'. The Fleming trust is more open to smaller investors. Its minimum investment has not yet been set but is likely to be around Pounds 2,500. The same risk warnings apply, however: consider this fund only if you have a broad spread of equity investments. Unit trusts Private investors have always had a far wider choice of commodity and energy unit trusts than investment trusts. The composition of the funds varies considerable, with some concentrating on a single commodity such as oil or gold while others have a broad spread. The table lists the funds and their performance to October 1. The best performer has been Mercury Gold &amp; General, managed by Julian Baring. This outperformance, combined with the recent fashion for commodities, has seen it grow from Pounds 26m at the beginning of last year to just under Pounds 400m - far larger than the sum of all the other trusts in the sector. Is this a good time to invest in commodities? David Hutchins, manager of M&amp;G's two funds dealing in them, believes the recent interest indicates that the sector is nearer its top than the bottom. He adds: 'A lot of money has already been made. For example, base metals have moved up by 40 to 60 per cent since last September. However, in previous cycles, metal prices have increased by as much as 300 per cent, which suggests that there is still more to go, particularly since the cycle usually lasts two to three years, not just one.' Mark Lawson-Statham of Fleming, who manages S&amp;P's Energy Industries fund (which is over 90 per cent invested in oil stocks) also is hopeful about prospects despite the fact that oil is cheaper today, in real terms, than in 1986 when there was a price crash. He says: 'When capacity utilisation (production divided by the capacity to produce) goes above 90 per cent, you get a price explosion. It is now over 90 per cent and will remain high, probably at over 95 per cent, to the end of the decade. Oil demand has grown every year since 1986 despite the recession.' The driving force is demand from the Far East (plus the cheapness of oil). And since the amount of oil consumed per capita in Asia is only one-tenth of that consumed in the west, it is likely this demand will continue to increase. 'We have a cyclical commodity pattern backed by a stong structural picture,' adds Lawson-Statham. The chart shows that, historically, shares have outperformed commodities (measured by the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index). Thus, while good returns may be had periodically from commodities, private investors should take only a small punt.</p>

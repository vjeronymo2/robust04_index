			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Any steps taken by any country  of the Caspian Sea Basin with a view to get an advantage in  terms of the sea's natural resources are at variance with the  interests of the rest of the countries of the Caspian region.    This is how Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian  Foreign Ministry, answered to a question concerning memorandum  on cooperation in the field of power engineering, which Britain  and Azerbaijan signed earlier, at a Moscow briefing on Thursday.    According to Karasin, the memorandum provides for holding  talks for the purpose of working out agreements on cooperation  in the field of prospecting for and extracting gas and oil in  various areas including the so-called Azeri sector of the  Caspian Sea.    After the memorandum was signed, the Russian Foreign  Ministry  handed in a note to the British embassy, Karasin said.    According to him, Russia pointed out in the note that the  bottom of the Caspian sea is not divided into sectors, because  the sea is by nature a sole reservoir with a united ecological  system and represents an object for a joint use. Therefore, all  the countries of the Caspian Sea region must be involved in  making decisions with regard of all activities, including  development, prospecting for and making use of the relevant  natural resources.</p>

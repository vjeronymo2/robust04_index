			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Investor Confidence index slips again The Pearl Investor Confidence index fell by two points during June, reversing the trend set by a steep rise in May. The index has now fallen during five of the six months in 1994 so far. The index measures how many people think the stock market is likely or very likely to rise in the next six months to one year. The index was set at 100 in March 1991, and has now fallen to 88.3. The highest point since it started was reached at the time of the general election in 1992. When the June figures are broken down into political affiliations, they show that confidence fell among all groups except Labour voters, whose confidence grew by 4 per cent.</p>

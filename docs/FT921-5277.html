			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Japanese companies to reduce capital spending JAPANESE companies plan to reduce capital spending by 4 per cent during the financial year beginning next month, suggesting that the weakness in the economy will continue, according to a survey by the Industrial Bank of Japan. The planned fall in investment follows an expected 5.4 per cent increase in the current year and double-digit growth in the three previous years, and highlights industry's expectation of slower domestic demand and a faint international recovery. Manufacturing companies told the bank that capital spending for the coming year is likely to fall by 10.7 per cent, while non-manufacturing industry expects a 3.1 per cent drop. Electric power companies expect a 6 per cent rise. The bank said that the investment decline forecast by manufacturing companies was the largest reported in its surveys since 1978, while the fall in the non-manufacturing sector is the first in two decades. Capital spending has also been slowed by turmoil on Japan's financial markets as companies had tapped the stock market for low-cost funds in the late 1980s to expand capacity and introduce labour-saving technology to cope with the country's labour shortage. The predicted falls follow years of rapid growth and reflect a readjustment of inventory that the Bank of Japan argues is to be expected for an economy returning to more normal rates of expansion. Electrical machinery companies, some expecting a loss this year, are planning to cut capital spending by 19.9 per cent. The car industry, which has experienced eight consecutive months of lower domestic sales, is predicting an 8.5 per cent fall. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, called for the Bank of Japan to lower the official discount rate (ODR) as soon as possible. He also urged Japanese workers to exercise restraint in forthcoming spring wage negotiations.</p>

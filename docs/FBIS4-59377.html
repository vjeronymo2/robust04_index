			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- In a new development, today  Israel postponed the entry of the third batch of the Palestinian  police force through the Rafah land border after they had  crossed from the Egyptian side. Israel has allowed 99 policemen  to enter of the total of 450 individuals who were supposed to  enter. The rest were returned to the Egyptian side after they  had left the Egyptian borders.    Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of  the Palestinian police force, stated that it was previously  agreed upon that 450 members of the Palestinian police force  would enter. Israel approved this, but the rest of the group has  been turned back, and a postponement for technical reasons has  been requested.    The commander of the forces said the Palestinian forces are  completely ready and prepared to enter immediately once  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat issues his instructions in  accordance with Israel's approval. However, now this entry is  being prevented and there are attempts to hamper the entry  process.    Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq praised Egypt's efforts and the  facilities the government is providing to support the cause and  facilitate the entry of the forces into the autonomy areas in  Gaza and Jericho.</p>

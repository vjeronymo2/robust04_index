			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Licence for sleeping pill revoked HALCION, the controversial sleeping pill, yesterday had its licence revoked by the UK licensing authority. The drug remains on the market in the US and other countries. While Halcion sales have been banned in Britain since October 1991, other countries recently returned the drug to their markets following scientific reviews. Upjohn, the US company which makes Halcion, had hoped the drug would enjoy a similar reprieve in Britain. Mr Ley Smith, Upjohn's president and chief operating officer, said the company was 'outraged that the findings of two independent review bodies have been ignored and that patients are being deprived of this treatment option for short-term insomnia'. Halcion was banned in the UK after Upjohn refused to withdraw it voluntarily. The drug has faced international scrutiny since August 1991, when, in the US, a Salt Lake City woman claimed she had killed her mother in a Halcion-induced rage and sued the company. The case was settled out of court. In the US it remains on the market in smaller doses with stricter labelling in the wake of the controversy, while a new generation of sleeping pills has reduced reliance on Halcion. Although a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee found the drug safe and effective when used as recommended, FDA staff said Halcion patients suffered from higher rates of anxiety and memory impairment. Mr Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the regulatory discrepancy between the US and UK indicated a grey area in Halcion's safety. He said: 'The FDA has chosen to let the marketplace take care of the problem. One of the key reasons why the FDA kept the drug on the US market was the active campaign to reduce the usage of Halcion.' According to Upjohn the UK licensing authority ignored a report by the appointed persons panel, a government-appointed committee of scientific and legal experts, which concluded that Halcion should be available in the UK. Upjohn said the medicines commission also recommended Halcion's return to the UK market.</p>

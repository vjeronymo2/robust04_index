			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Business advice shops to open TEN pilot 'one-stop shops' will be set up next year to co-ordinate advice to businesses, Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, announced yesterday. The 10 will be the first of a national network of 200 to be set up over the next few years. So many organisations offered services to business that the owner or manager did not know where to start, Baroness Denton said at an Anglo-German Chambers of Commerce conference in Bonn.</p>

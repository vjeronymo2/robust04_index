Kirchenstein, Riga; UDC 575.224.232.4]    [Abstract] The limitation on the practical implementation  of saccharose inversion by the Zymomonas mobilis  culture in order to obtain such valuable products as fructose,  glucose, alcohol, etc., and the urgency of developing ``soft''  micro-organism cell immobilization methods without lowering the  cells' functional activity necessitated an attempt to increase  the stability of the biocatalytic system by treating hydrogel  particles on the basis of calcium alginate with Zymomonas  mobilis cells immobilized in them by solutions of cationic  polyelectrolytes capable of cooperatively forming  interpolyelectrolyte complexes with polyanions. The  Zymomonas mobilis 113 cell culture was grown for this  purpose for 24 h in an aqueous nutrient medium. The experimental  procedure and hydrogel production method are outlined. A  schematic diagram of the immobilizing unit is cited, and the  saccharose inversion degree is summarized. In particular, the  effect of the aqueous poly-N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'diallylammonium  chloride (PDMDAAC) solution in the Zymomonas mobilis  cell viability and the effect of the Zymomonas  mobilis culture concentration in the biocatalyst on the  catalytic activity of the system within a 2-16% cell  concentration range are examined. The findings show that  treatment of calcium alginate hydrogel with immobilized  Zymomonas mobilis 113 cells by an aqueous solution of  the PDMDAAC cation polyelectrolyte results in the  polyelectrolyte complex film (PEK) development on the gel  particle surface; the film is polymer cation and anion complex  insoluble in water. The polyelectrolyte complex film has the  properties of a membrane, i.e., is permeable to low-molecular  compounds such as saccharose and monosaccharide. The  polyelectrolyte complex film membrane also prevents the  immobilized cell release to the external solution, thus greatly  increasing the biocatalytic system stability. Diffusion of  saccharose and the reaction products inside the polymer matrix  is the limiting stage of the saccharose inversion by the  immobilized cells into the modified polyalginate hydrogel  matrix.

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIT PAIRINGS;  </P> <P> DEPAUL GETS BID, BUT DOESN'T LIKE IT  </P> <P> DePaul, snubbed by the NCAA tournament, was among the 32-team field selected  for the National Invitation Tournament on Sunday night.  </P> <P> The Blue Demons (18-14) thought they might get picked for the NCAA tournament  after beating Notre Dame for the second time on Saturday.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make sense to me," DePaul Coach Joey Meyer said of the NCAA snub.  "I can't explain why Notre Dame was selected over us. Maybe 14 losses had  something to do with it, but teams with similar records were selected."  </P> <P> The NIT starts Wednesday night with Marquette (15-13) at Penn State (21-8),  Tennessee (15-13) at Memphis State (18-11) and New Orleans (19-10) at James  Madison (20-10).  </P> <P> On Thursday night, Massachusetts (17-13) is at Maryland (18-13), Baylor (16-13)  at Mississippi State (15-13), Louisiana Tech (20-7) at Vanderbilt (16-14),  Wisconsin Green Bay (21-7) at Southern Illinois (26-7), Stanford (18-11) at  Hawaii (23-9), Tulsa (17-12) at Oklahoma State (16-13) and Southern (25-5) at  Fordham (19-12).  </P> <P> The first round concludes Friday night with Holy Cross (24-5) at Rutgers  (16-16), Oregon (15-13) at New Mexico (17-12), Bowling Green (18-10) at  Cincinnati (19-13), Kent State (21-7) at St. Louis (17-11) and Cal State Long  Beach (22-8) at Arizona State (15-15).  </P></p>

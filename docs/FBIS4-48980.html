			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Director-General Sun Chao-  liang of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) resigned  Saturday [30 April] "to comply with legislators' demands" in the  wake of Tuesday's China Airlines (CAL) crash in Nagoya, Japan  which killed 263 of the 271 people aboard.    Sun made the announcement after a joint meeting of the  Legislative Yuan's Transportation and Communications Committee  and Ways and Means Committee resolved Friday that Sun should  resign from his post to take political responsibility for the  crash, the worst in CAL history and the 10th worst in the world.    Sun said he would be pleased to resign, but argued that he  is  in no way responsible for the crash.    Sun refused to admit negligence on his part and refuted  legislators' charges that he has worked for increased profits  for CAL, noting that the airline has paid higher interest rates  for its aircraft since he assumed office 14 months ago.    Sun said that the CAA only plays a judicial role in airline  safety and has no control over the competence of pilots.    "Regulating pilots is the responsibility of the airline  companies," he said.    Minister of Transportation and Communications Liu  Chao-shiuan  did not comment on Sun's resignation, but will have to accept  the resignation for it to become effective.    Meanwhile, compensation for the crash is turning out to be a  thorny issue for CAL.    If human error caused the crash, as many experts speculate,  families of the victims would be eligible for much larger sums  of money from CAL, sources said.    Although initial reports have pointed at human error, the  true cause of the crash will not be known for two to three  months, after an international investigation team completes  analysis of the aircraft's flight and voice recorders.</p>

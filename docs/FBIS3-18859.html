			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jorma Poysa report: "Factional Voices Impede EU </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] Our ability to maintain the confidence of foreign  investors and ensure the start of domestic investments depends  largely on whether Finland becomes a member of the European  Union [EU], says Georg Ehrnroth, chairman of the TT [Central  Federation of Industry and Employers].    TT's new leader also stresses the importance of maintaining  a  steady course in economic policy.    "Predictability and stability are important," he stressed.    George Ehrnroth warns various interest groups against  useless  bullying on the EU issue.    "Declaring that `we will not join unless we get this and  that...' is dangerous. This applies not to only the closest  circle around the MTK [Central Federation of Agricultural  Producers], but also the SAK [Confederation of Finnish Trade  Unions], whose chairman has indicated a special link between the  position on the EU and the general validity of the collective  wage bargaining agreement.    ``Let us now get a good result through negotiations, not  bullying. The people and the parliament can then decide whether  to take it or leave it.    ``All of us surely agree that Finnish agriculture must be  ensured a reasonable basis of existence. The rural districts  must stay populated and we must safeguard our self-sufficiency  in foodstuffs.    ``Agriculture cannot, however, cope better than the economy  as a whole. Industry will prosper if we are in the EU. As a  consequence, the whole economy -- including agriculture -- will  fare better than outside the EU.''  <H5>  EEA Is Only the B League </H5>   ``The choice is not between the past and the EU. What is at  stake is our capacity to adapt inside or outside the EU.  Adaptation within the EU is certainly easier in the long run.''    Ehrnroth said that being part of the single market is an  important prerequisite for attracting investments to Finland.    "The EEA [European Economic Area] agreement provides in  principle good opportunities in this respect. But if the EU is  the A team, the EEA remains just the B team.    ``Industrial enterprises always try to minimize their  risk-taking in investments. As members of the EU we will be  committed to convergence targets (targets of a disciplined  economic policy), in a stronger way than now. This means  greater adherence to the policies of low inflation, stable  currency rates, and other general political objectives, than if  we were members of the EEA,'' he explained.    "This will influence investment decisions among Finnish  enterprises as well as direct foreign investments and purchases  of shares on the Finnish stock market."  <H5>  There Have Been Many Positive Developments </H5>   TT's chairman said that the Finnish economy has shown many  positive developments during the past year. A fundamental one  has been the rapid growth in exports that has created a positive  trade balance and further on a positive payment balance.  Foreign debt, which was approaching a critical limit, has also  turned.    The interest level has also come down and some intelligent  solutions in terms of cost control and flexibility have been  reached on the labor market.    "But the economy is still out of balance," said Ehrnroth,  alluding to the high unemployment rate and the enormous deficit  of the state economy.    ``It is essential that we do not stop and give a sigh of  relief. We must stay on the steady course of restructuring. The  depression is cyclical only in part.''    The improved balance of payments has created a base for  confidence in the Finnish economy. But to maintain this  confidence we must continue our target-oriented financial policy.    "Any emerging doubts regarding the continuation of a dynamic  export strategy will show as a halt in foreign investments. The  crisis in finance may worsen again," Ehrnroth warned.    He gave the reminder that foreign investments on the stock  market alone have reached 30-40 billion markkas in a short time.  Other important direct investments are those of ABB [Asea Brown  Boveri], ICL, and Kvaerner Masa-Yards. We should get more of  these.  <H5>  The Election Budget Is a Big Risk </H5>   Ehrnroth said that historically there has been an  "alarmingly  high" correlation between election years and soft budgets.    "We cannot afford to make that mistake again. We must really  hope that the government has stable ground under its feet."    Ehrnroth pointed out that the state economy contains  concealed deficits over and above this year's 70-billion-markka  national deficit.    "The TEL [Employee Pension System] alone contains a 5  billion  deficit this year."  <H5>  Good Competitiveness Is Needed </H5>   The Ministry of Finance estimates that Finnish price  competitiveness is now about 40 percent above its historical  average. Rapid growth in productivity, moderation in wage  settlements, and the exchange rate of the markka will determine  our competitiveness.    "The markka has strengthened lately. This is understandable  due to the somewhat excessive weakening of the exchange rate.  The growing pressure to force the markka upwards should now be  countered with lower interest rates. A continued re-evaluation  would be harmful to competitiveness and hurt exports, an area  where success is extremely important."    Ehrnroth stresses the importance of maintaining a stable  currency and a low interest rate also on a longer-term basis.  <H5>  The Land of Quality Products </H5>   "Finland should never become a down-market producer because  of a weaker markka. Our nation can only manage by producing  high-quality products with a sufficient R&amp;D content.    ``These products require markets that are considerably  greater than Finland's. To maintain our present standard of  living, we must be able to participate freely in the  international distribution of work, with our proper sectors,  where we can continue to develop.''    Ehrnroth thinks there may be a longer-term risk that the  markka will be revalued if productivity grows rapidly and costs  are kept under control.    "The development of the markka depends to a large extent on  these factors. There is currently no great danger that the  markka will grow stronger."    Ehrnroth pointed out that the total industrial labor costs  in  Finland are about the same as in the Nordic countries, France,  and the Netherlands. They are clearly higher than those of  Spain and Portugal, to say nothing of Poland and the East  European countries.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major Marko Skejo, commander of the Sir </F> Rafael Boban 9th HOS Battalion, by Damir Dukic; place and date  not given: "Honorable and Ready for the Homeland!"]    [Text] At the time when I was appointed commander,  there were the right hind of young people in the battalion, but  also ones who could not adjust at all to the new rules. We drove  those people out of the unit. There are no units like this  within Croatia's AVNOJ [Antifascist Council for the National  Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders, but the extremely good 13th  Battalion is operating in Tomislavgrad. One HOS [Croatian  Defense Forces] battalion is also doing excellent work in  Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated into the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and is fighting against the  chetniks. My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was a  businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary  honor for me to make my contribution to the achievement of the  independent state of Croatia.    Marko Skejo, commander of the 9th HOS Battalion, heads the  only remaining complete unit from the numerous ones that were  organized by the Croatian Rights Party [HSP] at the beginning of  the patriotic war in 1991, under the common name of the HOS. It  is not just that the 9th Battalion, under Skejo's command, has  continued to exist; it has also been restructured and adapted in  such a way that it fit completely into the Croatian Army, as a  regular and highly valued unit. Major Marko Skejo himself has  had a wartime career typical of most volunteers--from the  reserve forces of the Interior Ministry and independent  organizations in local communities, to a real army.    [Skejo] After the chetniks abandoned the Dracevac barracks  in  Split, we were told to go to the battlefield in the rear. I  gathered 22 young volunteers, and as an HOS platoon, we left for  the Drnis battlefield, where we joined the 4th Guards Brigade.  After two months, around Christmas of 1991, the Fourth left that  line, but we joined the 114th Brigade, and have remained with it  to this very day. The four platoons of the 9th Battalion,  however, were attached to the Fourth at its very formation, at  the time when the battalion was commanded by Jozo Radanovic.    [Dukic] Then you were already part of the regular Croatian  Army?    [Skejo] Naturally, the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion, from  its creation to this day, has been under the command of the  Croatian Army's General Staff. We conducted ourselves mostly as  part of the 114th Brigade, but we were not integrated, and  instead we acted in platoons within various Croatian Army  brigades on all the battlefields from Zadar, through Sibenik,  Drnis, and Livno, all the way to Vinkovci, Vukovar, and Nijemac.  A total of about 5,500 fighters passed through the battalion  during that whole period.  <H5>  Croatia in Miniature </H5>   [Dukic] That is a considerable number of people. What is the  reason for that? Was it easy to get into the battalion, and even  easier to get out?    [Skejo] The battalion had three camps for training soldiers.  When the war flared up, people were trained, they left the camps  after one month, and they went to Zenica, Jajce, Travnik,  Bugojno, wherever they were needed.    [Dukic] And where were the battalion's members from?    [Skejo] In the beginning they were primarily from the  Split-Dalmatian parish, but afterwards from all parts of  Croatia. Even now we have people from Varazdin, Osijek, people  from the Sava basin in Bosnia, central Bosnia, Herzegovina, from  Vinkovci, from all over.    [Dukic] When were you appointed the unit's commander?    [Skejo] On 1 July 1992. I immediately came up with the idea  of uniting what had until then been a dispersed battalion. We  came together, and since we were acting as part of the 114th  Brigade, we left for the southern battlefield, complete for the  first time. Some of the members who were used to operating with  other units had doubts. Nevertheless, in that first assembly  there were 130 of us, but afterwards the number increased  significantly and continuously.    [Dukic] It is said that among the members of the battalion  who were a bit wilder, unadjusted, you introduced order and  discipline, disciplining them to an enviable level.    [Skejo] That is true, I demanded discipline and I still do.  At the time when I was appointed commander, there were the right  kind of young men in the battalion, but there were also ones who  could not adjust to the new rules at all. We drove those people  out of the unit, so today, for a considerable time now, we have  had a cadre of fighters, professional soldiers, serious and  familiar people who are honorable and "ready for the homeland."  They are capable of performing their sacred duty of defending  the homeland honorably and completely.  <H5>  Counterintelligence Service Lies </H5>   [Dukic] Is the battalion well organized today?    [Skejo] The unit's organization has been carried out in  accordance with all the rules of the profession, with a  well-developed system and sections consisting of infantry,  artillery, missile launchers, reconnaissance specialists, and  command personnel, and it is all functioning extremely well. We  have also received praise, both individuals and the unit as a  whole, for the missions carried out in the Zadar rear. In any  case our results throughout this war have been great, and  everything that the battalion did was done on the battlefield  and in operation against enemy military targets.    [Dukic] Members of the HOS, and thus also the 9th Battalion,  however, have often been criticized for brutality, action  against civilians, and harsh words have even been heard about  crimes that have been committed.    [Skejo] By no means, not in any case. We have never acted  against civilian targets, and I can substantiate that. It is not  in order to characterize these fighters as undesirables,  extremists, or butchers, because they are real sons of Croatia  who only attacked military targets under orders, and I am proud  of those guys.    [Dukic] All right, but why have you, as a unit, gained that  reputation?    [Skejo] The Counterintelligence Service [KOS] is still  functioning well in all of this; it wants to have a pretext for  Serbian crimes, and furthermore, it wants to portray us and  convince the Croatian Army headquarters and General Staff that  we are damaging to Croatian interests and that we do not deserve  to be called honorable soldiers, all of which is not true. Those  are all lies in the interests of structures that still cannot  accept the existence of the Croatian state.  <H5>  The Typhoon Passes </H5>   [Dukic] Can you say that your battalion has "done" its  wartime job thoroughly?    [Skejo] Yes. When an operation starts, then there is no  haggling like in the marketplace: I'll do this, I won't do that,  and instead it happens, the typhoon passes. It is possible that  some civilian may also suffer in that onslaught, but not  deliberately, but rather because battles are being fought. If  the chetniks are in three houses, who can guarantee that they  are not in a fourth one, and who will review all the details  then? There is no giving up then. Either you fight as you have  to, or you don't start.    [Dukic] During 1992, the HOS units mostly collapsed. Has any  other such unit been preserved besides yours?    [Skejo] There are no longer any such units within Croatia's  AVNOJ borders. The 13th Battalion is operating extremely well in  Tomislavgrad, however. One battalion is also doing excellent  work in Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated  into the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and it is fighting  against the chetniks. There is nothing surprising about that,  because we and the Muslims are capable of defeating our common  enemy and breaking through to our borders. In any case, we have  always adhered to the military hierarchy, instructions, and  orders, being careful not to harm Croatian policy and state  interests.    [Dukic] How many casualties has the unit had during the war?    [Skejo] Since I have been commander, we have lost seven  soldiers, but the battalion has had a total of 43 dead and more  than 200 wounded. Nothing is known yet, however, about some of  our members, especially those who left for Bosnia, and they are  being treated as missing in action. I must say that the status  of the families of the casualties, the wounded, and the other  troops has been effectively resolved within the framework of the  Croatian Army.  <H5>  I Don't Shout "To the Drina" </H5>   [Dukic] It seems that the war is approaching its end. How  will it all be completely resolved?    [Skejo] I think that the chetniks will not withdraw just  like  that. Whatever happens, we are ready to do our job at any time,  whenever it is ordered by the Croatian Army's commander in chief  and the General Staff. Our original enthusiasm has not waned,  and if we are given an order, if we are unleashed, the chetniks  will not know where to flee. We have already asked for that, but  we have not been allowed.    [Dukic] If the war is resumed, then, the chetniks would give  way. What would be the outcome of a clash between the 9th  Battalion and one of the Serbian units that they call special  ones, for example?    [Skejo] I never underestimate the enemy soldiers, but we do  not have any fear of "Captain Dragan's" special forces, or any  of Arkan's or Seselj's people, and so forth. We are always ready  to engage in conflict with anyone. We have been and will always  be eager to encounter those units. They have already had  opportunities to encounter the 9th Battalion, and so they know  quite well who and what we are.    [Dukic] What awaits the members of the 9th Battalion in the  event of a peaceful outcome?    [Skejo] I have been promised that their status will be  completely straightened out; they will be allowed to remain in  the Croatian Army, get further training....    [Dukic] How do you see your own future?    [Skejo] My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was  a businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary  honor for me, however, to make my contribution to achieving the  independent state of Croatia.    [Dukic] Does that mean that with the peaceful integration of  the occupied areas, your dream would be fulfilled?    [Skejo] I am not one of the people who are shouting "To the  Drina" in the present situation, but I still maintain that our  historical borders are much larger than the present ones. Our  leadership, headed by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, has made it possible  for us to fight for our state, however. For the time being I  support liberating the territory up to the AVNOJ borders, and  afterwards, we will see. I would not cross the Drina, but I will  always go up to it.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>   [Skejo] Croatian soldiers who are of the Muslim religion  have  fought in our unit from the first day to this very day, shoulder  to shoulder with the Catholics. They have not been neglected or  belittled at any time because of the conflicts in Herceg-Bosna  between the Croats and Muslims; and the 9th Battalion would  never fight the Muslims, or participate in a battle with them  even if it were by some chance asked to do so.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Break-ins Into Apartments </H5>   [Skejo] About a thousand military apartments have been  broken  into in Split, but a fuss is always raised when a member of the  9th Battalion is involved. That means that someone is carefully  watching us and immediately publicizes every faux pas in order  to slander us. It is well known who is keeping track of that and  who does not like us. They are anti-Croats with a five-pointed  star in their pockets who have been allowed to operate again.  Now they are also slandering real sons of Croatia, serious  invalids, casting their patriotism and morale under their feet.    [Dukic] But isn't the state obligated to protect law and  order?    [Skejo] I ask you--these are cases in which soldiers without  legs or arms or those who have been blinded on the battlefield  enter a chetnik apartment whose owners have bloodied their hands  and are on the opposing side. Such people are being protected  again. You know, we are not skilled in legal and bureaucratic  difficulties; we are more skilled at shooting. The Croatian  Army's real commanders, especially Brigadier Ante Gotovina, know  quite well what kind of soldiers we are, and thanks to him we  have solved many problems. It is time, however, for petty  political games to stop revolving around us; people should start  to tell the truth, sincerely and honestly. I hope that  responsible people will finally realize this and allow us to  straighten out the status and rights that all Croatian soldiers  have. Nothing more! We cannot be illegals in our own country,  while JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers and chetniks enjoy  privileges in the state for which we have died and shed our  blood.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Kaczmarek, Polish minister for </F> ownership transformations, by unidentified announcer; place and  date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] By the end of 1998, there will be no  state enterprises left in Poland. That is the barest possible  summary of the consequences of the commercialization program of  state enterprises that has been adopted by the government. The  most important thing in this is, however, the fact that there  has been sketched out therein an intended model for the shape of  the Polish economy.    [Kaczmarek] The commercialization program is not, certainly,  a conservation of the present arrangement. It is to be a program  that will change the Polish economy. The commercialization  program is, really, to consist of a number of drafts, of  successive programs. The first will be based upon us wishing to  transform the best, good, and large enterprises into the modern  formula of companies with capital. Commercialization will  reduce to the fact they will function upon the basis of the  principles of the Commercial Code. Later they will be subject,  successively, to privatization.    The second program will allow us to separate out from the  group of 5,300 state enterprises still extant, the enterprises  that are the weakest. This is served by a new formula proposed  in the Law on State Enterprise, which will allow for a very, to  put it rather unpleasantly, aggressive repair of these  enterprises through the application of bank reconciliation  procedures, agreed procedures, well, unfortunately bankruptcy  procedures also, or else special programs prepared at the  ministry, such as the stabilization-privatization-restructuring  program. Everything that will serve to repair the enterprises.    The third program associated with commercialization will be  a  program--for we then have the small- and medium-sized  enterprises still left over, and we intend to quickly and  efficiently sell those enterprises [as heard]. The fourth  component, this is a program that I will call the improvement in  the condition of the state public finances and so the  exploitation of state enterprises, thus earlier formed for the  purposes of the creation of pension funds, a health insurance  fund. Then this--when one looks at commercialization in such a  context--can be seen that quite simply this is a quite  considerable operation that is to run its course until the end  of next year, and is later then still to fulfill one fundamental  function.    [Announcer] The point at hand is that the commercialization  program of state enterprises will be fulfilled through the, by  many long expected, Law on the State Treasury.    [Kaczmarek] That which we have proposed and which we passed  to the prime minister on Tuesday is the law on the management of  the state treasury assets. For this purpose we will create  special capital agencies. This will constitute a kind of  identification of the owner, which will allow us to depart from  the sectoral model of economy management, and for the ministry  to fulfill regulative and administrative functions, but not  ownership functions. The commercialization program is, in a  word, I would say, this clearing of the ground for realistic,  further ownership transformations, among which I would include  privatization, restructuring, and the various paths to  privatization, because we wish to maintain these different  privatization paths. Quite simply, we must make up for a  certain amount of lost time.    [Announcer] The transformation of state enterprises into  single entity state treasury companies functioning on the basis  of the Commercial Code must undoubtedly place into question the  model of management of these enterprises hitherto.    [Kaczmarek] There are two factors here. Well, by the very  nature of things the law that speaks of the principles of  management of the finances of state enterprises falls by the  wayside. We are moving away from the philosophy of the popiwek  [the law on taxation of over the norm increases in  remuneration], we are moving away from the philosophy of the  compulsory dividend that was calculated upon the basis of book  balance sheets, in favor of the solutions that are in force in  the Commercial Code. We are changing the method of management  of enterprises in favor of a stronger position for the manager,  through the company board, and also through the body supervising  the functioning of this company in the name of the State  Treasury--this is the Supervisory Board. Well, we will as I say  through the Law on the State Treasury seek to identify the owner  in the form of the capital agencies. We are moving away from  this sectoral model of the economy, and so I affirm that from  the viewpoint of the enterprise, this will be an entity that  will have precisely the opportunity to act on commercial  principles, on the basis of the Commercial Code principles.    This is very important from the viewpoint of the  identification of such an enterprise by a possible investor from  outside. For, please believe me, he comes to Poland, and I have  met him several times [laughs], and says that he cannot  understand institutions such as the state enterprise on the  basis of the laws of 1981. If there are such people who say  that somewhere in the West there are state firms--then they have  precisely the form of capital-based companies, and so they are  based upon the principles of the Commercial Code [as heard]. We  should be moving in that direction.    [Announcer] The adoption of the commercialization program of  state enterprises will cause the minister for ownership  transformations to gain in significance. Is this the end of the  recently continuing dispute between the heads of the economic  ministries over the form of privatization?    [Kaczmarek] Conflicts do not in fact exist. They are  disputes of a certain kind. On the other hand, but, I think  that they are disputes that are capable of being overcome. I  would not wish to argue at all over the so-called rights of the  owner, but rather over the concept for restructuring, over the  programs for these firms. On the other hand, this program has  one more characteristic that is worth mentioning here. It is  precisely moving away from what the present coalition is often  accused of at the moment, that it has a tendency toward the  centralization of power. This program assumes in its philosophy  precisely a decentralization of power, the lowering of these  agencies to the level of the Polish macro-regions. Thus, the  non-engagement of the central administrative offices in the  administration of enterprises. Above all, they will be regional  structures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelara; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] magistrates have  confirmed that the call for the presidential runoff election  will officially be announced on Tuesday. According to Rutilio  Aguilera, no challenge has been received so far against the  final vote tally. If this holds true until the official deadline  expires on Monday, it will allow the TSE to announce the  official call on Tuesday. Aguilera noted that the four principal  shortcomings detected in the 20 March elections will be averted  in the runoff because corrective measures have been taken.    [Begin Aguilera recording, in progress] ...fortunately there  has not been any challenges, and also because of the delay with  which the political institutes, via their representatives, are  conducting them. As for your question, we have clearly seen  that as of last Wednesday -- the date the final vote tally  document was signed -- political groups were given 72 hours to  submit requests to nullify the results. Because no such request  has been presented, as I noted earlier, the TSE will have 48  hours to issue the decree after the deadline expires. The TSE  will first confirm the results. Second, it will issue the  decree calling for a runoff election. [end recording]    For his part, Eduardo Colindres, the Christian Democratic  Party's TSE magistrate, noted that the organization has  initiated a campaign to urge citizens to notify the TSE of any  problems encountered in their electoral districts or any  problems with their electoral identification cards. He also said  plans are being made to prepare identification and electoral  identification cards.    [Begin Colindres recording, in progress] ...the preparation  of the citizens' identification and electoral identification  cards. In other words, these new documents will replace the  electoral identification cards and the people's personal  identification cards. We have implemented an information  campaign to advise citizens where they can vote and how to vote  in an effort to avert problems that occurred in San Salvador. We  will conduct an orientation and information campaign on how and  where to vote. [end recording]    The call for the presidential runoff election will be made  officially on Tuesday, provided the departmental electoral  boards in San Salvador and Cuscatlan turn in the consolidated  results of the 20 March elections for deputies in accordance  with the electoral code.</p>

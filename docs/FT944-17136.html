			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Strong overall trend in MBOs Management buy-out and buy-in activity in the UK was sharply higher in the third quarter of the year compared with the same period last year, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Res-earch at the University of Nottingham. Estimated third quarter activity rose nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 750m after a 15 per cent rise to Pounds 1.75bn in the first half of the year. CMBOR's figures did not include the Pounds 366m buy-out of Nutreco, the animal feeds business bought from BP, which the centre considered an international deal. CMBOR, which is sponsored by Barclays Development Capital and Touche Ross Corporate Finance, said there was a particularly strong jump in management buy-in activity which accounted for more than a third of the value of deals in the first half. Ken Robbie, CMBOR research director, said there had also been a sharp fall in the number of completed MBOs in London and the south-east of England. Correspondingly, there was a sharp increase in the number and value of deals in the Midlands. The strong overall MBO trend was confirmed by KPMG Peat Marwick. The accounting firm said there were 16 MBOs with a deal value of more than Pounds 10m in the third quarter. KPMG forecasts a strong fourth-quarter for MBO activity leading to a five-year record level of deals valued at more than Pounds 3.3bn. Mr Chris Beresford, KPMG's head of MBOs, said there were 'plenty of MBO's being worked on'. But he called on merchant banks with companies to sell to give greater consideration to MBO's in preference to trade sales. 'I feel strongly that sellers should encourage managers, not stifle them,' said Mr Beresford. 'With their intimate knowledge of the company's potential and the current weight of funds available for investment, the MBO team . . . can often be the highest bidder.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "fr": "Money on Exceeding the Limit on the Czech </F> Republic; Slovak Republic Clearing Account Is on the Way"]    [Text] Prague--The Czech National Bank [CNB] has been  notified by the National Bank of the Slovak Republic of the  transfer of 46.1 million ECU's, by which the margin limit on the  mutual trade clearing account (130 million ECU's) was overdrawn  on 31 January 1994, Ondrej Kavacek, from the CNB Press  Department, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. According to the  Treaty on Payments, the debtor must pay this amount by the  middle of the following month at the latest--in this instance,  15 February. The equivalent of 46.1 million ECU's, which  Slovakia owes for January, was remitted at the end of last week  through a foreign mediator, and it is possible that it will be  credited to the CNB account today.    In the past, both the Czech and the Slovak parties have  stated their intention to close the old clearing lot [debts  arising prior to the currency split on 8 February 1993], which  serves to cover claims from the time before the currency split.  Even recently it was the main cause of the imbalance. CNB Vice  Governor Pavel Kysilka yesterday confirmed to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY  that, at present, the impact of the new lot [debts arising after  the currency split] is clearly increasing. It is responsible  for almost half the January deficit, and, according to  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY sources, another approximately 20 million  ECU's have been added to the Slovak deficit since the beginning  of February. As a feasible solution to this problem, the CNB  has proposed to expand the margin for fluctuation of the mutual  exchange rate within the framework of the clearing to twice 10  percent, Kysilka said. This step should be accompanied,  however, by other measures--above all, Slovak measures. "It has  transpired that the deficit is becoming a more permanent affair,  and the Slovak side will have to resort to some unilateral  measure that, in the long run, would eliminate this phenomenon.  I have in mind such a measure--for instance, as a move in the  exchange rate or an import surcharge," the vice governor added.  Finance Minister Kocarnik recently definitely refused an  unofficial proposal by the Slovak side to extend the margin  credit by several dozen million ECU's. At present, the Czech  Republic provides Slovakia from its state budget a credit in  excess of 6 billion korunas by means of clearing.    The closing of the old lot and a modification of the Treaty  on Payments is currently being discussed by expert groups, a  high-ranking official at the Finance Ministry, Milan Galler,  told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. According to him, however,  it has not yet been decided when this work will be concluded in  an agreement. Because of the ongoing talks, Kysilka has not  specified the date when the representatives of the two countries  are to meet concerning the clearing.</p>

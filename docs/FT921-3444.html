			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: Mother of all media efforts - Television reports will be extensive, and intensely scrutinised Early in the 1979 election campaign, a sensibly-shod Mrs Margaret Thatcher strode purposefully across a Suffolk field to embrace a new-born calf. She was not alone. Behind the prime minister-to-be trailed an army of television crews crowding out the small but dapper figure of her public relations chief, Mr (now Sir) Gordon Reece. The stunning impact of this first, wholly gratuitous British photo opportunity is long remembered, leaving the more cynical witnesses to claim: 'The calf died, but the photos lived on.' Television coverage of general elections had come a long way to reach this muddy nadir. Up until 1958, fearful of accusations of bias, the BBC simply did not follow the story at all - a self-denying ordinance that left transmissions exclusively to the parties' election broadcasts. No longer. To the delight of video rental shops and cinemas across the land, election '92 heralds an unprecedented blitzkrieg on all four channels, fuelled for the first time by 24-hour satellite coverage. So far, the three main party leaders have already scheduled four full-length interviews to run over the course of the campaign - one for each channel - with Justices Frost, Day, Walden and Dimbleby presiding. The main evening news broadcasts of ITN and the BBC will be stretched. Channel 4 is promising - 'for true junkies,' as one broadcaster put it  - a nightly two-hour midnight special now the campaign proper is getting under way. And as the dishes of Sky News fill with unedited live coverage of the main parties' morning news conferences, parallels are inevitably being drawn with the Gulf war. 'It will,' sighed one already fatigued programme-maker, 'be the mother of all elections.' Connoisseurs of election news say the three weeks of fly-on-the-wall reports will actually reflect three separate struggles: first, the traditional party conflict; second, the tussle for viewers between the channels; and last, the battle between the party spin doctors and the media over what actually constitutes the news. This, after all, is the first head-on clash between BBC deputy director-general Mr John Birt's interpretative genre of news, dubbed 'the mission to explain', and what politicians like to call 'straight reporting'. In simplified terms, the conflict boils down to not much more than the traditional tug of war over what the producers think is legitimate news and comment versus the parties' wishes to see their 'agendas' delivered, without appropriate health warnings, into the nation's living rooms. Pre-emptive strikes in this endless war of attrition are taking place almost daily. At the Tory party conference in Blackpool in October last year, Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, urged Conservatives to jam switchboards at the slightest sniff of bias on either ITV or the BBC. The same week his own office was doing just that with furious objections to an overly zealous BBC effort to 'balance' health secretary Mr William Waldegrave's platform speech on his National Health Service reforms with material contesting his claims. Nor is Labour shy of making its voice heard. Mr David Hill, the party's communications director, has several times accused television of taking its agenda from the Tory tabloids, above all the Daily Mail. These spats may yet prove mere trailers for truly volcanic rows once the this closely fought election gets fully under way. For Mr Shaun Woodward, the Tories' communications chief and a former BBC producer, the issue centres on the narrow line dividing objective explanation and editorialising. It is, Mr Woodward says, fair to report his party's furiously contested claims that Labour's programme will cost Pounds 37bn above and beyond current public spending levels. But when background 'packages' are prepared at speed on policy issues, objectivity is in peril. 'The problem is that when you get it wrong - even if it is only once every six months - 9m or 10m people pick up a biased story,' Mr Woodward says. Conscious that most national newspapers are hostile, Labour is conversely demanding that television pursue objective truth. 'The real Neil Kinnock emerges on television and radio,' says David Hill. 'We can show that the Tory tabloids' image of him does not hold up.' Labour is also demanding a little coverage of its own claims, such as those of alleged 'Tory plans' for imminent tax rises or spending cuts once the election is over. Noting that ITN's editor-in-chief, Mr Stewart Purvis, has told his staff to avoid calf-hugging opportunities, Mr Hill promises to wait and see. 'If the only way the Tories can get good coverage is to have John Major running around shaking hands, it will be interesting to see whether the Purvis doctrine stands,' he says. One long-time independent television reporter says Mr Hill need not wait long. 'It's nonsense to say the photo opportunity is dead. Good pictures will always be used. What matters is the commentary on top.' Isolated in the third corner, the Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are fighting a lone and largely hopeless battle for the use of the stopwatch to measure the distribution of airtime. Officially, both main parties and the main channels say the stopwatch's days are over. But none of the reporters believes it. 'They will be stopwatching and we will be watching our backs,' one says. For most viewers, agonising about objectivity is not what elections are about. They have a case. Experienced hands such as Sir Robin Day agree that while policies have their place, often the most gripping election moments - if not the election-deciding ones - come from the unexpected. The harrying of Mrs Thatcher by an unknown housewife on the Belgrano affair on the BBC's Election Call phone-in will be remembered longer than the election at which it occurred. But the real story, of course, is the result. For the election night shows themselves, speed and accuracy are of prime importance. Last time, despite the intellectual brilliance of the Kellners, Coles, Crewes and Dimblebys, the BBC slipped up in its opinion polling. It gave the Tories a five-point margin of victory, as against the actual outcome of nearly 12. ITN also claimed it had five out of six results before its rival (by anticipating, Auntie protests, unconfirmed figures). This year, the Beeb has poached Mr Paul McKee, once ITN's exit poll wizard, and hired NOP at a cost not far off Pounds 200,000 to quiz some 14,000 homebound voters. For added glamour, gigantism around the set is back in fashion. The lanky Mr Peter Snow, for example, is to be dwarfed by a 6-by-8-metre computer projection screen on the election night show. As one of the first results may be Cheltenham - forecast by some to be going Liberal Democrat - third-party supporters may yet be treated to a once-in-a-lifetime computer projection of a huge, digitalised House of Commons chamber packed to the gunwales with little yellow men. 'Just,' as Mr Snow is fond of saying, 'for fun.'

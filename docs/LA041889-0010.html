			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration, warning of the danger of botulism food  poisoning, ordered a halt to the manufacture of garlic-in-oil mixes that  require refrigeration but lack proper protective agents. The agency also urged  consumers to discard commercial and homemade garlic-in-oil mixes that contain  little or no acidifying agents such as citric and phosphoric acid. Most garlic  products contain these additives, as disclosed on their labels, the FDA said.  </P></p>

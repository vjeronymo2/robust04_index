			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: 1993 could be a year to crow about Chinese astrological years occur every twelfth year. Roosters are said to be natural leaders, impatient, protective, creative, talented and do not like being bossed around. Hong Kong astrologer Paul Lam says that 1993 will be better than 1992. The US economy will prosper.  China and Britain will mend their fences. The colony's markets will prosper.  European markets will remain volatile.  But don't bet on it.</p>

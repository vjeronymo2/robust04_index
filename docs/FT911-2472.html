			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Advertising decline hurts publishers CANADA'S longest post-war recession and a drastic decline in advertising continue to take a heavy toll on the country's two largest newspaper publishing groups. Southam, with 17 dailies, suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 13.4m (USDollars 11.5m), or 23 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 14.7m, or 26 cents, a year earlier,on revenues of CDollars 412m, against CDollars 432m. There is speculation of further staff cuts and possibly asset sales. The group includes Commercial Printing and a large bookstore chain. Torstar publishes Canada's largest daily, the Toronto Star, and operates Harlequin Books. It earned CDollars 6.1m, or 16 cents a share, down from CDollars 20.9m, or 54 cents. Revenues were CDollars 212m against CDollars 229m. Torstar owns 23 per cent of Southam's common shares and Southam 30 per cent of Torstar's non-voting stock.</p>

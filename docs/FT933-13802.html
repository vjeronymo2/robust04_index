			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Attali quits after damning report: EBRD president will 'waive termination allowance' MR JACQUES ATTALI yesterday resigned as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, two months earlier than expected and only hours after the completion of an official report highly critical of his extravagant expenditure and management style. In an emotive resignation letter, presented to an EBRD board meeting yesterday morning, Mr Attali said he would 'waive the termination allowance (of more than Pounds 147,000 tax-free) to which I am entitled under my employment contract'. He said that the interests of the bank 'are now best served if I leave my pos-ition as president immediately'. The board was also shown the draft reply from Mrs Anne Wibble, Swedish finance minister and chairman of the bank's governors. In it, she offered to waive any claims the bank might have on him arising from its audit committee's inquiry into his conduct and the bank's expenditure. The terms of both letters need approval by the bank's governors, most of whom are finance ministers, before the resignation takes formal effect. Not all the governors support giving Mr Attali immunity against future claims against him by the bank. The audit committee has been working on its report since May 10, after the Financial Times disclosed that the bank had spent Pounds 200m on fitting out its new headquarters and other expenses, more than twice the amount it had lent or invested in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, whose economies it was set up to help. The report is filled with what Mrs Wibble described yesterday as 'serious' criticisms of Mr Attali. It highlights the Pounds 1.4m spent by the bank on flights in private jets on 57 occasions. Of these flights, 48 were arranged with a French-based company, Air Entreprise, and most were authorised by Mr Attali's office. The audit committee said: 'The Bank's frequent use of chartered aircraft for travel to destinations well served by scheduled airlines is inappropriate given its status as a publicly funded development institution.' It continues: 'The selection of Air Entreprise as provider of most of the charter flights taken before January 1993 did not result from a competitive tendering process and was in nearly every case more expensive than other charter airlines. This represents a regrettable deviation from acceptable practice for a public sector institution.' Mr Attali reimbursed the bank with a cheque for Pounds 41,377 relating to seven flights in private jets in early 1992. His staff told the committee that Mr Attali signed the cheque on or about February 10 1993, but it was mislaid. The report said: 'The cheque was paid into the EBRD bank account on May 4 1993, ie, after the start of the present inquiry.' Despite several requests, it continued, the committee had not been provided with 'adequate' evidence to establish whether these flights were wholly for private purposes and whether the Pounds 41,377 cheque was genuinely mislaid or whether it was drawn at a later date than February 10. The report also attacked Mr Attali for taking possession of three different company cars within a 10-week period beginning in March 1991. 'The large number of cars used by the president in rapid succession creates an impression of extravagance which is inappropriate for the head of a development institution', it said. Mr Attali was also criticised for having charged 'significant amounts of expenditure of a private nature, or for which no supporting invoices have been provided' to the bank on his corporate credit card in 1992 and 1993. The report notes that it was 'only on June 22 1993, ie, since the start of the present inquiry, that the president reimbursed expenses totalling Pounds 30,431 which had been incurred during 1992 and 1993'. It also said that fees received by Mr Attali for making speeches 'appear to be inconsistent with the Code of Conduct of the Bank'. Mr Attali had a contract with Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, which paid him Dollars 20,000 a year for two years plus Dollars 30,000 for making a speech in the spring of last year. Mr Attali's responsibilities have been taken temporarily by Mr Ron Freeman, first vice-president, pending the appointment of a permanent successor. Weighty dossier, Page 2</p>

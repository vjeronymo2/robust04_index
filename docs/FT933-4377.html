			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Smith launches into dangerous waters at Brighton: Kevin Brown asks if Labour's leader could have reopened wounds within his party MR John Smith, the Labour leader, left Brighton yesterday leaving behind a lot more friends than seemed likely when he arrived on Tuesday. His robustly pro-union speech to the TUC conference was warmly welcomed by delegates tired of being treated like dinosaurs by Labour leaders. But Mr Smith is playing a dangerous game. He may have succeeded in rescuing the unions from the graveyard, but the price could be high. At best, he risks giving fresh impetus to Conservative sneers about union influence over Labour's leadership. At worst, he could reignite the fratricidal battle between the party's modernist and traditional wings. Mr Smith's aim was to establish his credentials with the union leaders who will determine the fate of his plans to democratise the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. His plan, already watered down to overcome union resistance, is for candidates to be elected by constituency members on the basis of one-member-one-vote. The unions would lose their right to influence selection, but union members would be able to vote as individuals by paying a reduced party membership fee in the constituency where they live. As Mr Gavin Laird, right-wing leader of the engineering workers' union, put it, the unions are being offered a trade-off: sympathetic treatment by a Labour government in return for a reduction in their influence in party affairs. At the last count, the plan looked like being defeated by the combined block votes of the GMB and TGWU general unions, backed by a host of similarly inclined small unions. However, several critical unions, including Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, and Unison, the public-sector union, have shown signs of switching sides. Others are prepared to accept one-member-one-vote if trade union members of the Labour party exercise their votes through the union structure. But the outcome remains highly uncertain. Usdaw, for example, will not decide until next week how to cast its conference votes. One possibility being canvassed is that both Mr Smith's proposals and a series of amendments by critics will fail to attract a majority vote, leaving a messy impasse. If that happens, the proposals would probably be implemented by Labour's national executive committee, which gave its approval earlier this year. Such a scenario would allow Mr Smith to claim a victory of sorts, but it would undermine his leadership by suggesting that he is unable to exercise effective control. It would also raise questions about Mr Smith's judgment, first in making one-member-one-vote a touchstone of his leadership abilities, and then in refusing to back down in the face of overwhelming odds. This line of argument has already been aired by Mr Alan Tuffin, leader of the UCW postal workers' union, who observed dryly that 'the public are not lying awake at night worrying about how Labour selects candidates'. However, whatever happens on the conference floor, the debate has given renewed impetus to attempts by Labour's traditionalist wing to undermine the modernisers who surround Mr Smith. Leftwing MPs were already saying yesterday that Mr Smith's comments on economic policy, in which he committed the party to full employment, wider employee rights and a minimum wage, spelt the end of the modernist grip on policy development. Mr Smith's friends said that there was no intention to signal a break with Mr Gordon Brown, the modernist shadow chancellor, who has effectively dumped Labour's 1992 'tax and spend' manifesto. It was also being pointed out that the modernists remain in firm control of the NEC and the parliamentary party, while the traditionalists have been marginalised by repeated electoral defeat. Nevertheless, the tone of Mr Smith's remarks sounded closer to traditionalists such as Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow cabinet member, and Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, who have argued strongly for a radical manifesto at the next election. That will hearten traditionalist campaigners like Mr Gould, who has threatened to mount a potentially divisive campaign for the deputy leadership next year unless the party adopts a more radical tone. Mr Smith's view is that one-member-one-vote is an essential first step in the process of making Labour acceptable to middle-class voters, whose support is essential if the party is to win a general election. But his proposals leave intact the unions' conference block votes on the leadership and policy issues, leaving the party open to continued Conservative claims that it remains in thrall to the unions. Mr Gerry Malone, the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, was quick to revive this line of attack yesterday, suggesting that the union link will be a prime target for the government at the next election. Mr Smith's advisers say he draws comfort from the warm response to his speech from union leaders, and he remains convinced that 'people will come round'.</p>

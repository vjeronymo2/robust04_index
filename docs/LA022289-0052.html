			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Auction: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of three-month bills  at an average discount rate of 8.51%, up from 8.49% last week. Another $7.2  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.50%,  down from 8.54% last week. The rates for six-month bills were the lowest since  Jan. 30, when they averaged 8.39%. The rates for three-month bills were the  highest since they averaged 8.57% on Feb. 6. The discount rate reflects the  price discount received when government securities are purchased at less than  face value.  </P></p>

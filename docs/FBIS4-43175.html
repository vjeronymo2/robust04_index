			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ann Svarding: "Japanese Want Swedish `Yes' to EU </F> Membership"]    [Text] Many Japanese companies are on the way to investing  in Sweden. However, before they make their final decisions,  they want to know what the situation is regarding European Union  [EU] membership and the Oresund bridge.    "Swedish membership in the EU is a precondition for  receiving  this Japanese investment," Elisabeth Lindquist, a market  consultant with the Japanese export organization JETRO [Japan  External Trade Organization] in Stockholm, said. "That  membership and the Oresund bridge are the two most important  factors," Carl Henrik Hamrin, economic advisor to the Swedish  Embassy in Tokyo, added.    According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, a total of four Japanese  companies could already make their investment decisions within  the coming months. Some of them will probably make their  decision before the EU referendum in November. It depends on  whether or not they bank on Swedish EU membership.  <H5>  Companies on the Way </H5>   In addition, another 20 or so companies are at various  stages  of planning business start-ups in Sweden.    "There is a whole string of Japanese companies currently  considering going into Sweden. In all cases, Swedish EU  membership is one of the most important preconditions for this,"  Carl Henrik Hamrin said.    "The next most important question is the Oresund bridge. If  I am going to be quoted, then I merely wish to say: `Build the  bridge!' The transport issue is extremely important."  <H5>  "Billions of Kronor" </H5>   According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, the Japanese investment  plans concern "billions of kronor."    "If Sweden says no, then an investment process that is  already under way will be curtailed. Over the last two or three  years, 10 Japanese companies have pumped approximately 200  million kronor into Sweden," Carl Henrik Hamrin said.    He pointed out that many Japanese regard the popular  referendum to be a proper election situation. They do not have  referenda themselves, and therefore regard the upcoming  referendum more as a necessary step in the whole process. Their  opinion, he maintained, is that the important decision was made  when the European Parliament approved Swedish accession in  principle.    The EU issue as a whole is of great concern to Japanese  companies.    "They are tremendously curious about what will happen if the  EU really becomes a trade bloc and if it comes to adopting a  position either in support of or against Japan," Tommy Kullberg,  trade secretary at the Swedish Export Council in Tokyo, said.    Yukio Matsui, CEO of the Mitsui trading house in Sweden,  told  DAGENS INDUSTRI that his company is starting to follow not only  the specific question of Swedish membership, but more  particularly the development of the EU as a whole. Yukio Matsui  sees the EU as a kind of insurance policy for the Swedish people  to reach a larger market.  <H5>  Newly Awakened Interest </H5>   The Japanese interest in Sweden is relatively new. In the  current situation, characterized by a strong yen, an altogether  excessive Japanese trade surplus, and high Japanese labor costs,  Japanese companies are being forced to set up abroad.    "On the plus side, Sweden has low labor costs for a highly  trained work force," Elisabeth Lindquist said.  <H5>  High-Tech Companies </H5>   According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, several of the planned  business start-ups in Sweden concern high-tech companies.    Over the last 12 months, Sweden's exports to Japan have  risen  by 50 percent to reach a level of 10 billion kronor. The  increase in volume over the same period has amounted to 25  percent. The increase is due both to currency advantages and to  a number of new Swedish businesses starting up in Japan.</p>

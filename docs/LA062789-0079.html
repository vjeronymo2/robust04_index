			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> More than 700 Cambodians who fled oppressive conditions and shelling in Khmer  Rouge camps will be returned to Khmer Rouge control under an agreement reached  with Thai officials and non-Communist Cambodians, the New York Times reported,  quoting Western diplomats and aid officials in Bangkok. One aid official said  the leaders of the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, who  operate the camp to which the refugees fled, are afraid of their coalition  partners, the Communist Khmer Rouge. The 700 refugees represent one of the  largest defections from Khmer Rouge control in the last 10 years.  </P></p>

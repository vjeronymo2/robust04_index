			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] When visiting Daxing County to learn about the  its work, Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party  committee, pointed out that townships and villages where  conditions permit in developed plain areas may operate grain  fields on as large a scale as possible in order to raise labor  productivity, improve the comparable efficiency of grain  production, and further stimulate peasants' enthusiasm for  growing grain.    Chen Xitong recently went to Daxing County to visit the  Huangcun satellite city, Liuminying Village of Changziying  Township, and Dongdian Village of Qingyundian Town. He asked in  detail about their agricultural production, small industrial  zones, township enterprises, village and town construction,  greening of plain areas, and life of villagers. He also visited  enterprises and villagers' homes to talk with cadres and the  villagers.    Located in plain area, Daxing County has fairly developed  township enterprises and better conditions for grain production.  When the party branch secretaries of Liuminying and Dongdian  Villages reported that they had achieved better economic  efficiency with less labor input thanks to operation on as large  a scale as possible, Chen Xitong said: In order not to dampen  peasants' enthusiasm for grain production, the state should  provide support from various fields, and the municipality as  well as counties and townships should continue their great  support. In addition to this, developed plain areas may operate  grain fields on as large a scale as possible in a selective and  orderly manner when conditions permit in order to achieve high  output, high quality, and high efficiency through expanding the  scale and then raise labor productivity, increase income, and  stimulate peasants' enthusiasm for grain production. Meanwhile,  the large number of laborers laid off may be transferred to the  secondary and tertiary industries. He pointed out: In  developing agriculture, we should also emphasize accounting and  improvement of labor productivity like enterprises do to make  sure that growing grain can also make money. On the premise  that the collective economy is consolidated and developed, the  methods can be diversified. The method of operation on as large  a scale as possible may be developed in the form of collective  farms. It may also be developed in such a way that grain field  management is contracted out to grain growing experts or large  grain growing households and regular workers are reduced to the  minimum. During busy seasons, temporary workers may be used,  who will leave after work is finished. The fewer workers we  hire, the better the productivity and comparable efficiency of  grain production will be.    At a joint venture in Liuminying Village, a metal structure  plant, Chen Xitong asked about its production and talked  cordially with workers. He said to Wang Yaoping, the county  party secretary, and other comrades: Township enterprises  should be greatly developed because they represent an extremely  important way for rural areas to achieve prosperity. In rural  areas, the number of people engaged in grain production should  be small so that large numbers of peasants can be diverted from  farmland to the secondary and tertiary industries. This is the  way to make peasants affluent and lead a fairly comfortable  life. As has been proven in practice, the better the township  enterprises are developed in townships and villages, the faster  their peasants will become affluent. In addition, the position  of agriculture as the foundation will be safeguarded, and grain  output increased. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT-APPOINTED OVERSEER SEEKS TO OUST 10 VETERAN OFFICERS OF TEAMSTERS UNION  </P> <P> A court-appointed investigator is seeking to remove 10 veteran Teamster Union  officers across the country, largely on grounds that they have been convicted  of receiving kickbacks or have been linked to organized crime figures,  according to federal court records.  </P> <P> The action by attorney Charles M. Carberry, a former federal prosecutor, was  disclosed in papers filed with a Manhattan federal judge who had appointed  Carberry and two others earlier this year to oversee activities of the  Teamsters.  </P> <P> The move is the most far-reaching to be taken by any of the union overseers so  far and appears to serve notice of their intention to remove what the judge has  called "the hideous cloud of corruption" that has hung over the nation's  largest trade union.  </P> <P> Although Carberry has made no public announcement of the charges, officers at  Teamster Union headquarters in Washington said that they had been informed of  them.  </P> <P> The Teamster officers refused to comment except to note that, under terms of a  court agreement, any accused member has 30 days to prepare a defense before  receiving a closed hearing on the charges before Frederick B. Lacey, a  court-appointed administrator.  </P> <P> The court agreement, signed by Teamster lawyers last March to settle a  long-standing federal racketeering suit against the union, specifies that Lacey  -- based on the hearing -- may order removal of any officer for "just cause."  That is a much lighter burden of proof than the standard of "beyond a  reasonable doubt" that applies in ordinary criminal cases.  </P> <P> The 10 Teamster officers being charged are from New York, Chicago, Cleveland,  Miami and Pittsburgh and include two members of the union's national executive  board -- Ted R. Cozza and Harold Friedman.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with Teamster affairs said that others are expected to be  charged by Carberry in the weeks ahead.  </P> <P> Carberry, who prosecuted Wall Street financiers Dennis B. Levine and Ivan F.  Boesky when he was with the Justice Department, "is just as determined in his  new post to clean up the Teamsters Union," according to a close associate.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein, who appointed Carberry and Lacey, has  expressed his determination to make the oversight system work, despite Teamster  animosity. Edelstein named a third attorney, Michael Holland of Chicago, to  oversee the first direct elections of Teamster officers, in 1991.  </P> <P> Cozza, of Pittsburgh, was cited by Carberry for "conducting yourself in a  manner to bring reproach" on the union by "knowingly associating" for 20 years  "with members of organized crime families of La Cosa Nostra" in Pennsylvania,  including John S. LaRocca, Gabriel (Kelly) Mannarino and Michael Genovese.  Cozza long has denied any association with criminal elements.  </P> <P> Friedman, of Cleveland, was cited for his conviction in federal court last  January on charges of conspiracy and embezzlement in a payroll-padding scheme.  The longtime associate of Jackie Presser, the late Teamster president, has been  fighting to keep his high union post in spite of his conviction.  </P> <P> Anthony Hughes, a former Presser bodyguard who was convicted with Friedman, was  similarly cited by Carberry. Hughes has held the title of international  representative.  </P> <P> Charles L. (Chuckie) O'Brien, who was close to former Teamster President James  R. Hoffa, was charged with conduct that could bring reproach on the union for  illegally accepting an automobile as a gift from a Teamster employer, a charge  on which he was convicted in 1976. O'Brien was also cited for a loan fraud  conviction in 1978 and for allegedly associating with mobsters Carlos Marcello  and the late Anthony Provenzano.  </P> <P> O'Brien, whom Hoffa raised from childhood, is an international representative  of the Teamsters Southern conference in Miami. He denied accusations several  years ago that he had helped lead Hoffa to his presumed murder by mob figures  in 1975.  </P> <P> Two New York Teamster officers, Cirino (Charles) Salerno and Edward J.  Martinez, also were charged. Salerno was accused of receiving kickbacks from  firms that employed members of his Local 272 and with consorting with leaders  of the Vito Genovese crime family in New York.  </P> <P> Martinez was accused of bad conduct because he was convicted of misusing $9,000  from the treasury of Local 808, of which he was an officer.  </P> <P> Charges were also filed against four Chicago Teamster officers, including  Joseph (Joey) Glimco Sr., an alleged mobster involved with the union since the  1950s. Glimco was cited as an actual member of the Mafia and for convictions  for receiving labor kickbacks.  </P> <P> Union officers Dominic Senese, James Vincent Cozzo and Joseph Talerico were  similarly accused of associating with Chicago mobsters Joey Aiuppa, Joey  Lombardo and Jackie Cerone.  </P> <P> Aiuppa, Lombardo and Cerone were among six alleged mob leaders convicted of  conspiracy in 1986 in a plot to skim gambling proceeds from Las Vegas casinos  in which they had invested by using loans from the Teamsters Central States  pension fund.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY OF U.S. SPY PLANE USED TO WAGE MALARIA WAR  </P> <P> The same high-flying technology that has enabled governments to spy on each  other's military forces is now being directed against one of mankind's most  deadly and intransigent enemies -- malaria.  </P> <P> Using American and French satellites and a civilian version of the U-2 spy  plane, scientists are developing a method of predicting where and when  malaria-carrying mosquitoes will strike.  </P> <P> The war against the Anopheles mosquito is a critical one: More than half of the  world's population lives in areas where the insects are found. World health  experts expect more than 100 million new cases of the disease and about 1.5  million deaths this year alone.  </P> <P> American scientists are spearheading the high-tech war against the mosquito,  and numerous foreign governments and international agencies, including the U.N.  Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, are watching its progress.  </P> <P> For the last four years, scientists have studied in minute detail aerial photos  taken of about 100 rice fields in California's Sacramento Valley and correlated  the fields' characteristics with the appearance of mosquitoes.  </P> <P> They now say they can predict -- two months in advance and with greater than  83% accuracy -- the exact locations where Anopheles mosquitoes will breed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breed in Limited Areas  </P> <P> The precision is required because researchers long ago discovered that the  insects, which carry the parasite that causes malaria, breed in limited areas.  </P> <P> Of 104 California rice fields studied, only 16 accounted for half of the  mosquito population.  </P> <P> Armed with that knowledge, the scientists think they can develop for every  region of the globe infected with malaria -- mainly those countries near the  Equator -- the means to predict and plan for mosquito infestations.  </P> <P> "We're talking in the first week of May about what's going to happen in the  latter part of July and August," Robert Waschino, one of the project's  scientists, said in a recent telephone interview. "Now, that's real magic."  </P> <P> Waschino, an entomologist at the University of California at Davis and one of  the world's leading experts on the Anopheles mosquito, and his colleagues plan  to start correlating the satellite and aircraft data with insecticide spraying  in California this year.  </P> <P> They are using data gathered by aerospace scientists at Ames Research Center, a  NASA facility at Mountain View, Calif.  </P> <P> A second phase of the fight against malaria already has been started in Mexico.  A third phase, due to start sometime in the 1990s, will be able to cover every  country identified by the World Health Organization as being at high risk for  malaria.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Expand Study Area  </P> <P> Paul Sebasta, a NASA ecologist and the project's manager, said scientists are  now studying a 36-square-mile plot of land near Tapachula, in Mexico's Chiapas  state. Once the hydrology and vegetation of the targeted land is known, the  size of the study area will be enlarged.  </P> <P> By learning myriad details about land and vegetation features, the scientists  said they can predict where the heaviest of the mosquito populations will  emerge. "We are confident we can do this," said Sebasta, "and we want to take  the lessons we've learned here in California and apply them to Mexico."  </P> <P> The conventional method requires that inspectors test rice fields and other  potential breeding grounds first-hand, using small dippers to scoop up water  that is then examined for mosquito larvae. It is a crude, slow and costly  process.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the current means of hunting for the breeding grounds provides  little predictability, said Waschino.  </P> <P> "In a field with a low density of Anopheles, to get the kind of precision you  need you may have to dip a thousand times. And that's just one field," he said.  </P> <P> The scientists hope that in the mid-1990s they will be able to detect mosquito  breeding grounds from a satellite permanently orbiting the Earth.  </P> <P> "Our ultimate goal is to be able to say, for instance, that based on satellite  data, breeding conditions will be perfect in four weeks for certain species of  malaria-bearing mosquitoes," said Sebasta. "We won't really be able say the  disease is there, but we can say the potential is there."  </P></p>

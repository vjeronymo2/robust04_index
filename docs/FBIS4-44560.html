			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Zeng Kun [2582 0981]: "Tarim Oil Field </F> Begins Promoting Development of Bayangol, Formerly Little-Known,  It Is Now World Famous"]    [Text] Now being developed by Tarim oil field, the formerly  little-known Xinjiang's Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture  has in one fell swoop become a hot area in China's economic  development now and is attracting world attention.    Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, located in  southeastern Xinjiang, covers an area of 483,000 square  kilometers. Over one-half of China's large petroliferous basin,  the Tarim Basin, lies within Bayangol Mongol Autonomous  Prefecture. In early April 1989, the China Petroleum and Natural  Gas Corporation established the Tarim Petroleum Exploration and  Development Headquarters at Korla City, which subsequently  opened a major petroleum exploration and development effort  involving over 20,000 petroleum employees. In the past five  years, they have proven six ready oil and gas fields at Lunnan,  Donghetang, Sangtam, Jirak, Jiefang [Liberation] Canal East, and  Central Tarim No. 4, and they have discovered 25 new industrial  oil and gas-bearing structures. During the Eighth 5-Year Plan,  they implemented reserve resources sufficient to build a  production capacity of 5 million tons. This is especially true  of the discovery of the Central Tarim No. 4 100-million-ton oil  field, which has revealed the broad prospects for finding a  cluster of huge oil fields in the central Tarim region. Now, the  five oil fields at Lunnan, Donghetang, Sangtam, Jiefang Canal  East, and Central Tarim Number 4 have formed a yearly crude oil  production capacity of 2.1 million tons, and they have produced  a total of 2.93 million tons over the past five years with a  daily output level of 6,000 tons.    Oil field development has made Bayangol Mongol Autonomous  Prefecture the most direct beneficiary. According to statistics,  during the past five years of oil field development the oil  field headquarters has made direct investments of more than 1  billion yuan in Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture as well as  indirect investments in establishing the materials supplies,  communication and transportation, equipment maintenance,  machinery processing, construction materials and chemical  industry, design and construction, labor services, and other  areas to support the oil field that totalled several billion  yuan. Petroleum development has spurred rapid development of  Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's economy. During the past  five years, Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's GNP has  doubled, its gross value of industrial and agricultural output  has increased two-fold, and its financial income has increased  1.5-fold. Enormous changes have occurred in the autonomous  prefecture's communication, urban construction, posts and  telecommunication, energy resources, and other basic facilities  and it has become one of the few regions in Xinjiang with fully  equipped highways, railroads, pipelines, aviation, and  telecommunications.</p>

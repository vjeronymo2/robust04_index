			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Good prospects for US dollar THE DOLLAR'S pre-Christmas rally against the D-Mark has underlined the view of many analysts that favourable growth in the US will propel the US currency higher in 1993, writes James Blitz. However, in spite of a reduction of tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism in recent days, dealers are still poised to test the strength of the French franc in the new year. The US currency's mini-rally against the D-Mark in recent days has been the result of a growing perception in the markets that Germany will ease short-term interest rates in the new year. When the Bundesbank decided not to ease policy at its council meeting on December 10, the dollar fell as low as DM1.5570 against the D-Mark. But there has been renewed speculation in the last fortnight that Germany will cut rates earlier than anticipated, and the dollar was trading as high as DM1.5940 in Europe on Christmas Eve and rose further to around DM1,6090 yesterday. Analysts also believe that increasing signs of an upturn in the US economy will help to underpin the currency in forthcoming months. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, says: 'US data releases are increasingly pointing to a sustainable recovery there, while the dichotomy in growth performances between the US and Europe is set to intensify.' Inside the ERM, the calm of recent weeks will probably continue up to the new year. On December 24, the central bank of Ireland took advantage of the easier tone to trading by saying that it would cut its overnight support rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent. Dealers said the move reflected the recent steadiness of the punt on the foreign exchanges. Some analysts suggested that the calm could end abruptly in the new year if Ireland removes capital controls as it has promised to do. Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London continues to believe that the Irish punt and the Portuguese escudo will be devalued in the order of 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively next year. Pressures on the French franc abated considerably in the week before Christmas, with the currency momentarily rising above FFr3.41 against the D-Mark, and three-month French francs falling to 11 5/8 per cent from an earlier high point of 12 1/2 per cent. The may have been helped by statements from opposition politicians in France that they would respect the franc fort policy if they win the March parliamentary elections. Mr MacKinnon is gloomy about the franc's prospects. 'Downward pressure on the French franc looks set to intensify,' he says,'and policy settings insidethe ERM are clearly unsustainable.' Mr Chertkow expects speculation against the French franc but believes that Europe's central banks are ready to defend it to the hilt.</p>

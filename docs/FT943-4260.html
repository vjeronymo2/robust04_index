			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins jumps 67% - No sign of slowdown as paper industry pulls out of recession Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper company, reported a 67 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 63m to Pounds 105.1m in the first half of this year, as the paper industry began to pull itself out of a worldwide recession. 'There is no sign of a slowdown: prospects for the second half of the year look extremely good as long as we can struggle to pass on pulp price increases,' said Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive. The company has been hit by wood pulp price increases of 45 per cent this year as the improvement in the market has led to a worldwide shortage of raw material. Mr Soulas indicated that, for coated and carbonless grades of paper, the company had managed to pass on the price rises, but had little success in the fine paper market. In addition, since June there have been two further pulp increases - amounting to Ecu 100 a tonne - which the company must try and pass on in the next couple of months. Mr Soulas said that European paper prices in June had only recovered to the same level as in June last year after dropping in some cases by 25 per cent in the second half of last year. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.43bn) in the period, while sales volume increased by four per cent. Earnings per share were up 50 per cent to 8.1p, from 5.4p last time before exceptional costs. The company held the interim dividend steady at 2.65p. Mr Tim Rothwell, pulp and paper analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London stockbrokers, said: 'The market has under-estimated the upturn in the company and the result turned out above the top range of analysts' forecasts. COMMENT Arjo Wiggins is well placed to take advantage of the cyclical upturn which has improved the fortunes of European paper companies. But without its own integrated pulp production, it is at the mercy of relentlessly rising raw materials costs and must struggle to pass these on to an unreceptive paper market. The company recognises this could lead to a squeeze on margins in the second half, but is nevertheless, optimistic. Paper prices are still 30 per cent lower than the last peak in the market in 1989, suggesting that there is potential for substantial price hikes. British investors may fear that the imminent departure of Mr Tony Isaac, the finance director, may leave their interests unrepresented on a board with no other British executive directors except Mr Cob Stenham, the chairman. Analysts have upgraded their forecasts for the full year on the basis of yesterday's results and expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 175m and Pounds 205m and earnings per share of 16p. Next year, the company is estimated to earn Pounds 290m or 21.5p a share with the figure going up to Pounds 340m in 1996. At 287p the share price is not expensive for investors who want to take a bet on the next peak in the paper cycle.</p>

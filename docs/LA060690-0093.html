			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. DETECTIVE IN SECRET UNIT DEFENDS KILLING BANK ROBBER  </P> <P> Defending his role in a 1982 shooting that left one bank robber dead and  another wounded, an undercover Los Angeles police detective testified in  federal court Tuesday that he fired his shotgun at the robbers because he  believed that they were armed and ready to kill him.  </P> <P> Officer Michael Sirk, a member of the department's Special Investigations  Section, told the jury that bank robbers Jane Berry and John Crumpton refused  to surrender despite orders to do so from him and three other officers, all of  whom were armed with shotguns.  </P> <P> He said he heard Crumpton -- whom he mistakenly thought had a gun -- yell to  Berry, "Don't give up!" Then, he said, he saw Berry reach for her weapon: "She  grabbed the gun with her right hand and withdrew it from her waistband, almost  all the way out. She looked in my direction."  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Victoria Chaney asked Sirk if he was concerned for his  safety.  </P> <P> "Oh, very much so," he replied. "I thought she was going to shoot me. . . . I  redirected my line of fire from Mr. Crumpton to Ms. Berry and I fired my  shotgun twice."  </P> <P> Sirk's testimony came during the second week of an unusual trial in which he  and five other retired and current SIS officers face allegations that they  violated Berry's civil rights when they wounded her and killed Crumpton after  watching the pair rob a Burbank branch of Security Pacific Bank on Sept. 15,  1982.  </P> <P> The SIS is a surveillance squad that gathers evidence against dangerous  criminals, often by watching them commit crimes and attempting to arrest them  afterward. The $10-million civil case is the first time members of the unit,  which was so secret that few knew of its existence until a 1988 Times  investigation, have been brought to trial as a group.  </P> <P> Berry's lawyers maintain that the SIS officers -- who shadowed the couple for  17 days before the robbery -- used excessive force during the shooting and  could have prevented the incident had they arrested the couple before the  robbery on lesser charges, including outstanding warrants.  </P> <P> But retired Lt. Dale Ostrom, former head of the SIS who was responsible for  ordering the surveillance, testified Tuesday that even if he had known Berry  could have been arrested for a parole violation, he would not have done  anything differently.  </P> <P> "It occurred to me," Ostrom said, "that the only way to identify these people  was to get some good eyewitness testimony as to the perpetrators of these  robberies."  </P> <P> During cross-examination by Berry's lawyer, Stephen Yagman, Ostrom disclosed  that SIS officers watched Berry and Crumpton purchase drugs on at least one  occasion before the bank robbery. But rather than arrest them, Ostrom said, the  unit turned the information over to the LAPD's narcotics division.  </P> <P> "It was the aim of this investigation to assist Detective (William) Stewart in  a bank robbery investigation," the lieutenant testified, "and that's what we  did."  </P> <P> Stewart, the robbery-homicide detective who initiated the investigation,  testified Monday that he asked for the help of the SIS because he suspected  Berry and Crumpton of robbing a bank on Glendale Boulevard in Silverlake but  could not prove it because they were disguised in masks and wigs.  </P> <P> He told the jury that he believed Berry and Crumpton had committed three  additional bank robberies on days when the SIS was not watching them.  </P> <P> But under questioning by Chaney, Stewart maintained that he was not certain  that Berry and Crumpton were the robbers he was looking for. "I did not know  for sure," he said. "I had suspicions . . . but I did not know explicitly that  they were the ones."  </P> <P> The trial before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson is expected to conclude  this week.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Unenterprising defence The gap in Enterprise's attack is matched by a gap in Lasmo's defence. There is little point in putting the two oil exploration companies together, but little point in keeping them apart either. Certainly, Lasmo's desperately thin defence document, out yesterday, failed to make the case for retaining its independence. Although Lasmo has improved its finances and management over the past year, there is no room for complacency on either score. Moreover, Lasmo chief executive Mr Joe Darby was hard pressed to identify any special characteristic of the group that would be destroyed if Enterprise won the battle. The bid therefore looks like being decided purely on the money. On this score, Enterprise's offer is weak. The all-paper offer, originally estimated to be worth 150p, has dropped with Enterprise's share price. Lasmo shareholders are also wary of being offered special low-dividend shares and speculative warrants - a mixture Lasmo chairman Mr Rudolph Agnew has dubbed 'second-class paper'. It is all very well for Enterprise to argue that the reduced dividends are no worse than what Lasmo shareholders would have received anyway. But investors naturally want a better deal, not just one that is no worse. The snag is that Enterprise cannot afford to come up with cash from its own resources. That would endanger dividends to existing shareholders, which are at best barely covered as things stand. Underwriting a cash alternative is the obvious option. A dollop of cash would certainly make the offer more palatable but Enterprise's owners will be concerned if it has to pay through the nose for the underwriting.</p>

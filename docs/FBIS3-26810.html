In 1993, Tibet's GNP reached 3.65 billion yuan,  topping that of the preceding year by 8.1 percent; the economy  in agricultural and pastoral areas continued to develop  steadily; and the gross agricultural output topped that of 1992  by 5.3 percent, reaching 2.28 billion yuan. In 1993 the region  had a bumper agricultural harvest for the sixth year in a row  with total grain output reaching 620,000 tonnes, which was a 3.3  percent increase over that a year ago. In animal husbandry,  Tibet was able to maintain the main targets set for 1992.  Township and town enterprises and other economic undertakings  developed quite fast. The per capita income of peasants and  herdsmen was about 515 yuan, or an increase of 5.1 percent over  that of 1992. Industrial and communications enterprises had  noticeably higher returns. Foreign trade and tourism maintained  the good developmental momentum. New progress was achieved in  bringing in outside resources and establishing ties with other  parts of the country. The urban and rural markets became even  more prosperous. All social services developed quite rapidly.  New victories were won in the struggle against splittism. In  1993, Tibet's economy continued to develop, its political  situation was more stable, people of various nationalities are  more united, and new progress was achieved in all fields. The  situation was good as a whole. [passage omitted]    At the tea party, Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub, vice chairman of  the regional CPPCC committee, spoke on bahelf of the regional  CPPCC committee.

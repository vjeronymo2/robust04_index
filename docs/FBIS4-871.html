			<p>BFN     [Text] As you know, four opposition personalities from  Diffa Department, including a deputy, were arrested this morning  at Maine-Soroa, accused of exciting violence and ethnic hatred.  Following these arrests, the prefect of Diffa convened an  extraordinary meeting with department directors, representatives  of political parties, labor unions, and associations. The  meeting was aimed at informing the participants of the reason  for the arrests. Tusla Sadepa reports from (Bougako).    [Begin Sadepa recording] The four local leaders of the  National Movement of the Development Society [MNSD-Nassara],  including a deputy, were arrested this morning at Maine-soroa,  the birthplace of MNSD-Nassara chairman, Tandja Mamadou. They  are accused of inciting violence and ethnic hatred, for they had  planned to attack the subprefecture and kidnap the subprefect.  They therefore armed their activists with arrows, sticks, and  knives. According to the prefect of the department, they were  demanding the release of their party chairman, Tandja Mamadou.  When the regional authorities were informed, they preempted the  attack by arresting the four leaders.    This morning, the activists, who were not yet informed of  the  arrest of their leaders, went to the meeting place but the  organizers were absent. They took hostage two activists of the  Alliance of Forces of Change: the secretary general of the Niger  Party for Democracy and Socialism and the president of the  Democratic and Social Convention Delegation of Maine-Soroa.    According to the department's prefect, the opposition  activists intend to proceed with their hostage-taking operation,  kidnapping supervisory officers and officials appointed by  decree. That is why the prefect, Mr. Ayi Frem, told  participants that the law will be rigorously applied. If there  is bloodletting, we shall all weep, Ayi Frem stated, adding that  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The prefect  reiterated the worst-case scenario must be avoided. He told his  audience that any civil servant who would heed the call for  civil disobedience and yet fold his arms in front of his body  would be punished in accordance with the law.    Finally, it must be noted that in order to preserve social  peace, all public gatherings and demonstrations are strictly  forbidden in the department until further notice. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Random Talk on Economic Life" column: "Strive To Build </F> Market for Production Factors -- Ma Kai, Vice Minister of State  Commission for Restructuring Economy, Answers RENMIN RIBAO  Reporter's Questions"; place, date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] The "decision" of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th party congress has made it clear that in  cultivating a market system, emphasis must be placed on  developing the market for production factors. Will you please  explain why?    [Ma Kai] Allowing production factors to circulate in the  market is an essential requirement and a necessary condition for  giving the market mechanism a fundamental role in the allocation  of resources. When the commodity market system has developed to  a certain extent, the accelerated development of the market for  production factors becomes an urgent need for developing the  socialist market economy.    [Reporter] What fields do you think we should pay special  attention to at the present stage of developing the production  factors market?    [Ma] Of the market system for production factors, the most  important are the markets for funds, land, and labor. In  addition, there are markets for technology, information, and  property rights. Land is a kind of rare and nonrenewable natural  resource, while labor is the most dynamic and active factor  among the productive forces, and the two are the most basic  production factors, as well. Under the market economy as a money  economy, funds are the most important resource. The circulation  of all important factors -- including banknotes, funds, land,  and labor, as well as the supply of banknotes and funds -- is  essential to operation of the market economy as a whole, while  the financial market is the hub of the entire market system.  Therefore, to develop the market for production factors, it is  necessary to focus on developing the financial, land, and labor  markets first and the markets for technology, information, and  property rights later.    [Reporter] Would you mind giving an account of the present  state of China's financial market, and plans for financial  reforms for the next stage?    [Ma] Before the reform, China basically had only unitary  bank  credit [dan yi yin hang xin yong 0830 0001 6892 5887 0207 3938],  and introduced the planned allocation of funds and planned  deposits and loans. Under the planned economy, the bank was a  subsidiary body to the treasury and could hardly play a role in  financing. After the reform, however, China's financial system  and its operating system underwent a change, and a financial  market began to take shape, but all this has a long way to go to  meet the demands of a socialist market economy, the main  problems being the insufficient development of the financial  market and a lack of effective supervision.    The basic goal of cultivating and perfecting the financial  market is to form a unified, open, competitive, orderly, and  strictly managed financial market system. To this end, we must  fulfill the following specific tasks:    First, the money market should develop standard inter-bank  lending so as to turn it into a real money market; it should  promote the development of the bill market and vigorously  develop the bill discount; and it should carry out energetic and  prudent reform of the interest rate formation mechanism so as to  gradually form a market interest rate system based on central  bank interest rate, a system under which the interest rate will  change in accordance with the supply and demand of the funds in  the market.    Second, we must develop stock and bond markets  enthusiastically and prudently. It is necessary to improve the  market for government bonds and to enact laws to stop the  treasury borrowing money from the Central Bank. Financial  deficits must be covered by issuing government bonds.  Policy-lending banks should be allowed to issue financial  bonds. National commercial banks should be allowed to take out  a mortgage on government or financial bonds from the central  bank, and other financial institutions also should be allowed to  take out a mortgage on government and financial bonds from the  banks other than the central bank in order to create conditions  for the Central Bank to set up an open market for funds. It is  essential to improve the stock market and to create conditions  for establishing unified markets for corporate, individual, A,  and B shares.    [Reporter] What will the labor market be like and how will  it  be set up?    [Ma] The new labor market will be a market in which free  labor mobility is allowed; wages are determined mainly by labor  productivity, as well as the supply and demand for labor in the  labor market; and the market mechanism plays a fundamental role  in resource allocation. To this end, we should take the  following specific measures:    1. Speed up reform of the employment system and of the  job-assignment system for graduates, and set up a public service  system. The state no longer will be the main employer,  enterprises will be granted autonomy in hiring workers, and  workers are allowed to choose their jobs so as to form an  employment mechanism for the two-way choice between employing  units and employees, and for rational labor mobility. In the  meantime, reform of the wage system should be stepped up,  remuneration for work should be monetized, and wages should be  determined mainly by productivity and by supply and demand for  labor in the labor market. The minimum wage will be stipulated  by law, and wages will be subject to state adjustment through  taxation. Again, the residence registration system should be  reformed. All these measures are essential for the cultivation  of a labor market.    2. Set up labor markets with different levels and forms  including national-, regional-, urban-, and township-level labor  markets. Ordinary employment service centers, a market for  advanced scientific and technological personnel, and an export  labor market also should be set up.    3. Cultivate employment service centers. Vigorous efforts  should be made to develop intermediary organs and service  entities in the service of the mobility and allocation of labor.  It is also necessary to set up more employment service systems  providing employment services, vocational training, arbitration  services, and so on, as well as a national unified information  network providing information about supply of and demand for  labor.    4. Accelerate housing reform, and establish and improve the  social security system. This provides an important guarantee  for the normal development and operation of the labor market.  And,    5. Set up and improve various labor regulations so the labor  market gradually will be standardized and modernized, and so the  legitimate rights and interests of employees and employers will  be protected.    [Reporter] Will you give me a brief account of the  development of the property market? To what fields should we  mainly direct our efforts in developing the property market in  the future?    [Ma] The key tasks of land reform in urban areas are to  cultivate and develop the land market and to change the system  under which land is provided by the administration without  compensation, without time limits, and without permission for  circulation [wu liu dong 2477 3177 0520], into a system under  which land will be provided with compensation, with time limits,  and with permission for circulation -- in other words, a system  under which the allocation of land will be decided by the market.    The relevant reform began in the 1980's. At the beginning,  we made "a charge" for land use (such as levying a land use tax)  and then allowed land to "circulate," resulting in the formation  of a land market and in the greater role for the market in land  allocation. In the process, however, a number of problems arose  which must not be ignored. 1) The total supply of land is  getting out of control. The situation in which land is granted  by the authorities at various levels or by the authorities  overstepping their power is grave. 2) Laws are being ignored in  the transfer of land-use rights, meaning that transactions for  land are concluded mainly by administrative means, or illegally  or spontaneously. 3) The market mechanism for the formation of  land prices is irrational. Land prices are usually fixed at  random; some localities vie with one another to lower land  prices, and some localities even offer land free, thus giving  illegal businessmen engaged in real estate speculation an  opportunity that can be exploited to their advantage.    In the urban land market system, the primary urban land  market should be monopolized by the state, and the secondary  land market should be free, though state control will continue  to be necessary. The primary land market, meaning the market  where land-use rights are transferred, must be managed by the  state alone, but the method of transferring land should be  reformed. It is necessary to introduce the market mechanism and  put land-use rights on the market so as to expand the area where  the market can play a role in the allocation of land, under the  principle of separating the ownership of land, which must be  retained by the state, and the right to use land. We should  implement a system for the compensated transfer of land-use  rights, with time limits and for particular purposes. With  regard to the sale of land-use rights for commercial purposes  other than for public use, we should change the negotiated-lease  method into one of public auction and bidding. In the secondary  land market, meaning the market for the transfer of land-use  rights, the land transferred by the state should be allowed to  be retransferred, leased out, and mortgaged at a price  determined by the competitive market. The state, however, will  still need to strengthen control over the secondary land market,  for instance, the state must see to it that the land user plans  the use of the land transferred, registers with the relevant  authorities for the land transfer, reports the price at which  the land was transferred, pays the value-added land tax, and so  on, in order to forestall any attempt to illegally "speculate on  land" to reap excessive profits in real estate transactions and  to prevent the loss of state profits.    In the countryside, it is necessary to ensure that the  amount  of cultivated land will not be reduced, preventing land for  agricultural use being turned to nonagricultural purposes.</p>

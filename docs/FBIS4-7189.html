			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The leader of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) described the newly formed cabinet of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata Thursday [28 April] as a pseudo  Liberal Democratic Party government. SDP chairman Tomiichi  Murayama said, "I am worried that (the minority government) will  strengthen its character as a pseudo LDP government."    The leader of the second largest opposition party told  reporters the party will cooperate for passage of the overdue  state budget for fiscal 1994, but judge other bills on their own  merit.    Murayama rejected Hata's last-minute plea to return to the  ruling coalition earlier in the day. The party decided Tuesday  to withdraw from the coalition over an abrupt creation of a  joint parliamentary bloc by coalition groups in the House of  Representatives excluding the SDP.    Asked whether the SDP will force the government to dissolve  the lower house for a snap general election after passage of the  budget, Murayama showed a cautious attitude, saying a political  vacuum should not be created in view of the current economic  situation.</p>

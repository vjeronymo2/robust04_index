			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Row looms over Pounds 1.3bn French aid proposal for Bull A fresh storm over the use of government aid to prop up ailing European companies is likely next week. Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, is expected to recommend approval of payments totalling FFr11bn (Pounds 1.32bn) from the French government to Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group. This will heighten tension between the Commission and private European enterprise amid growing criticism that Brussels is not doing enough to stop governments distorting competition through state-funded rescue plans. This week the UK government and seven European airlines appealed to the European Court of Justice to annul the Commission's decision to allow the French government to grant FFr20bn in fresh subsidies to Air France, the national carrier. The Commission told the French government earlier this year to suspend a capital injection of FFr2.5bn for Bull pledged in February 1993 by a previous administration. At the end of last year, the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur announced a new capitalisation plan of FFr8.6bn of which FFr1.6bn would come from France Telecom, a shareholder in Bull. Mr Van Miert's recommendation is likely to go before his fellow commissioners for approval next week. With only a majority of votes required for authorisation, it is almost certain the French government will win the go-ahead for the capital injection. The Commission is likely to attach conditions to the granting of aid, which will probably stipulate that Groupe Bull stick to its own restructuring proposals and receive no more aid during the restructuring. The French government claims the capital injections are a vital element in a package aimed at restoring the group to profitability after accumulated losses of about FFr20bn since 1989. Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has described the capital injections as a 'one time-last time' injection before the privatisation of the group. The restructuring package, implemented by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman of the computer group last year, involves a sharp cut in overhead costs, the sale of assets, and the reduction of the company's Paris sites from 24 to two. An existing plan to cut 6,500 jobs in 1993 and this year has been accelerated. According to Bull, the restructuring has helped to cut losses in the first half of the year to June were reduced to FFr843m, compared with FFr1.98bn for the comparable period in 1993.</p>

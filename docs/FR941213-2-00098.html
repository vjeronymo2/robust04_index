			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The units requested (limited to 100 or fewer) are needed for family housing to satisfy demands not being met by the section 8 existing or voucher rental assistance programs; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. 85 percent of the PHA's dwelling units (select (1), (2), or (3)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Are maintained in substantial compliance with the section 8 housing quality standards (24 CFR 882.109); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted in good faith under section 14 of the USHA (or a comparable State or local government program), and that there is a reasonable expectation, as determined in writing by HUD, that such application would be approvable; or will be so maintained upon completion of modernization under the Comprehensive Grant program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in Section V.A.2 of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result, is experiencing low levels of demand);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households, or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The shortage of housing is resulting in rent increases exceeding those increases commensurate with rental housing operating costs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A significant number or proportion of section 8 certificate/voucher holders are unable to find adequate housing because of the shortage of rental housing, as evidenced by PHA data showing a lower-than-average percentage of units under lease and a longer-than-average time required to find units (typically, less than 85 percent lease up within 60 days).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

Additional Rating Points <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category 4 (other) applications may obtain additional rating points (see Section IV.E.8 of this NOFA) if the PHA furnishes additional data regarding any of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. ``Partnerships.'' PHAs are encouraged to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative or contractual arrangements with community-based entities for the purpose of developing housing so that the housing fits into the community and is seen as an integral part of it. ``Community-based entities'' include private non-profit or for-profit entities with experience in the development of low and moderate income housing, or that are skilled in the delivery of services to families who are residents of public housing. ``Cooperative or contractual arrangements'' include those that will facilitate development (including management of the units) that will enhance the long-term viability of the development; and those arrangements that the PHA has for the delivery of services (such as child care, education, and economic opportunities) made available to residents of public housing. The PHA should indicate who the entity (or entities) are, the qualifications of the entity and its principals, and the role they play or will play in the development, management, or service delivery process which will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community. Such cooperative arrangements require substantive involvement by the non-PHA partner in at least one of the following areas: design, management, site selection, representation to the community, or service delivery. If the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds to pay an entity for its role in the arrangement, a justification for sole-source contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) must be provided for consideration by HUD. With respect to the delivery of services, costs for such services are not eligible to be paid from public housing development funds. The PHA must also certify that its selection of the cooperative entity (or entities) was in compliance with State and local law. [Note: If State/local procurement requirements cannot be complied with before the application deadline date, the PHA may submit a statement with its application indicating that it is in the processing of arranging such a cooperative relationship and certifying that such a relationship will comply with State and local law. In such case, within 60 days of the date of publication of this NOFA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  the PHA must: (1) identify the entity(ies) proposed to be part of the cooperative relationship; (2) describe the qualifications of the entity(ies) and of its principals, and the role they will play in the development, management, or service delivery process that will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community; (3) submit a justification for sole source contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) (if the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds to pay the entity for its role in the cooperative arrangement), and a certification that the selection of the entity(ies) was in compliance with State and local law.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Mixed Income Development. In order to encourage the development of public housing in metropolitan areas that will be less identifiable as public housing, PHAs are encouraged to develop units whereby public housing would be mixed with market-rate dwellings so that they are indistinguishable. Specifically, in order to receive points for this factor, a PHA must propose to acquire units in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at or above 80 percent of median, or to acquire sites in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at or above 80 percent of median.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Past compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit evidence that over the past five years it has met any commitments made under the provisions of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C., 1701u), as amended from time to time, and the implementing regulations for section 3 at 24 CFR part 135. If the PHA does not have development experience, it may instead submit evidence related to such experience with the modernization program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Proposed compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit its goals for complying with Section 3 employment and training with regards to the public housing development application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Support for local initiatives. If the application proposes a project which, as evidenced by a letter from local officials, actively supports an area of local initiative such as a Community Development Block Grant, urban revitalization, Enterprise Zone, or other similar local activity, or includes a commitment for a donation to the project in the event it is selected for funding, the PHA should describe the activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Resident Initiatives. If the PHA is working with residents to establish and/or foster resident empowerment activities (such as establishing Resident Corporations or Resident Management Corporations), the activities should be described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

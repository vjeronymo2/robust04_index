			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The emerging stars of tomorrow - Philip Coggan, Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton on the high-risk, high-reward markets EMERGING stock markets are potentially one of the most exciting investment areas. They consist of the stock markets of developing countries, mainly in Latin America and south east Asia, which many experts believe may offer higher returns than the developed markets of the UK, US and Europe. The arguments are that developing economies are growing faster than those in the developed world; that their economies are liberalising and encouraging foreign investment; and that they are starting to develop domestic investment institutions (such as pension funds) which will support a flourishing stock market. With these extra returns come extra risks. Some economies are prone to inflation; others to political instability. Traditions such as audited accounts, the idea that companies are run for the benefit of shareholders, not managers, are not so well entrenched. The markets are less liquid making it harder to buy and sell stocks. Private investors can best tap the potential of emerging markets via one of the unit and investment trusts specialising in the area. There are arguments for and against both vehicles. The illiquid nature of emerging markets can prove a problem for unit trusts; the need to obtain cash to meet redemptions may force the manager to sell his best holdings at the wrong time. For an investment trust, emerging markets can go in and out of fashion. When markets are fashionable, trusts often trade at a premium to net assets; that is, investors must pay, say, 105p to buy 100p of assets. But when markets fall from grace, funds can slump to wide discounts, as investors in many of the offshore closed end funds have found. These problems and risks are more acute for single country funds. First time investors would be better off looking at one of the global, or regional, emerging market funds with a diversified portfolio. There are seven emerging markets investment trusts in issue, although John Govett is now launching another and Kleinwort is expected to follow. The largest (and the best performing over the last three years) is Templeton Emerging Markets, with a return of 101.2 per cent over the period (mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested). However, Templeton is trading at a premium, indicating that there is demand for more issues in this area. The Govett fund, sponsored by Hoare Govett Asia, is offering 30m ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants attached on a one for five basis. The costs of the issue are 4.8 per cent and the annual management fee is 1.25 per cent; minimum subscription is Pounds 2,500. Emerging market unit trusts are included in the international equity growth sector. City of London Emerging Markets is top over one year, with growth of 56.9 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested). It is unusual in that it invests not directly in equities, but in other managers' closed end single country funds. Prosperity Emerging Markets is top of the sector over five years, with growth of 187.3 per cent. For those seeking exposure to individual countries, there are a number of single country Asian funds such as Save &amp; Prosper China Dragon and Providence Capitol Thailand. Asia attracts a large proportion of emerging markets investment. Strong economic growth is predicted both this year and next - Govett sees 1994 GNP growth ranging from 3.4 per cent in the Philippines and 6.2 per cent in Indonesia, to 9.5 per cent in China and 8 per cent in Malaysia. Recovery in Japan and the US is expected to boost the export-oriented economies of the region, and interest rates are falling. The boom in China has caused much excitement, but many fund managers now see it as a long-term rather than short-term bet. The expected cooling-off in China could also affect other countries. 'China is the engine driver of the whole region at the moment, but it is so difficult to get exposure to China,' says Qais Zakaria of Save &amp; Prosper. Only a few stocks are listed on the two Chinese exchanges at Shanghai and Shenzhen, and demand is strong. Hong Kong is a popular proxy, but can be volatile in response to news from China. The Taiwanese market's record of boom and bust cycles puts off many investors; the outflow of funds to China has also affected liquidity. A few fund managers see some good prospects by the end of 1994. Zakaria sees Korea and Malaysia as the two markets to watch. Korea should benefit from the improving US economy and the strong yen, which will allow Korean companies to increase their margins a little. He thinks profits could increase by up to 30 per cent. However, there are technical difficulties to investing in Korea: foreign holdings of any stock are limited to 10 per cent, and many have reached that level. Limits are unlikely to be raised for another year. Govett Oriental has done well in Malaysia and other funds are heavily weighted there. 'We like the Malaysian economy, we think it is well run,' says Zakaria, who sees it as a long-term buy. But Ashok Shah of Providence Capitol warns that the Malaysian market is vulnerable to a reasonably sharp correction. 'We would advise caution. At best it is a hold.' Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines also have good growth prospects, but are struggling with structural and political problems. Another area opening up to foreign investment is the Indian sub-continent, where economic reforms based on IMF recommendations are starting to work through in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But some barriers remain. India imposes a capital gains tax of up to 30 per cent on foreigners. 'You have to realise if you are an emerging market that you live in a much more competitive environment. If India puts up barriers, then people say forget it,' says Charles Fowler, of Govett. However, Tristan Clube, a fund manager with Martin Currie, says he has been putting more emphasis on the Indian sub-continent. Latin America has lost its glow after a bull market run which peaked in summer 1992 after a series of economic and political reforms. The markets are very different, ranging from Mexico, the most developed with a market capitalisation of Dollars 150bn, to the small illiquid markets of Colombia and Peru. Brazil is the second largest with a market capitalisation of Dollars 75bn. Although many fund managers are disappointed about the performance of the past year, most are still heavily invested in the region. Templeton Emerging markets investment trust has a 15 per cent holding in Brazil, where the market has risen by 13 per cent in dollar terms in the year to June 1993. Brazilian companies are cheap and have good managers, according to Latin American Securities, but the potential for growth has been hampered by political setbacks in the past year. Fleming Emerging Markets investment trust favours Mexico where it has a 17 per cent weighting. Philippa Armitage, fund manager, says that uncertainty over whether the North American Free Trade Agreement will be supported by Congress has depressed the market. However, she believes that even if Nafta is not resolved, Mexico will be able to generate its own growth. The volatility of this area means that cautious investors should diversify risk via a regional fund rather than a country fund. Latin American Investment Trust, which has Dollars 140m under management, has its heaviest weighting in Mexico and Brazil (53 per cent) but also holds 14 per cent in Chile, where a fall in interest rates is expected to push the market up. Europe: Turkey is flavour of the month due to a spectacular performance in the past year. The market has risen by 61.7 per cent in dollar terms in the year to June, according to Olliff and Partners, a stockbroking firm specialising in investment trusts. The growth has been fuelled by domestic consumption, said Radhika Ajmera, fund manager for the Turkey Trust, the best performing investment trust in the emerging markets sector, with growth of just over 60 per cent in the year to June 1, according to Micropal. Elsewhere in Europe, Olliff and Partners says it feels 'fairly bullish' about Portugal because of its potential for lower interest rates and recovery. Isabel Goiri, manager of Schroders Mediterranean investment trust, which holds roughly half its investments in the European emerging markets and the rest in France, Italy and Spain, says that 'there is a lot of catching up to do by the small European countries in the process of European unification, so the prospects for growth there are higher. Investment in these countries is also a play on deregulation and liberalisation.' Interest in Eastern Europe is focused mainly on Poland and Hungary. Poland's stock market has seen a rise of 200 per cent in dollar terms in the last three months, according to Goiri, but privatisation issues are limited and liquidity is tight.</p>

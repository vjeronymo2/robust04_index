			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Swaps: Europe contributes to buoyant activity ACTIVITY in the international swap market remained buoyant in 1991, according to a survey by the International Swap Dealers Association. The survey of swap dealers, conducted on the ISDA's behalf by Arthur Andersen, shows the notional principal amount of interest rate and currency swaps written in the first half of 1991 totalled Dollars 923bn, a 41 per cent increase over the first half of 1990. Figures for the second half of the year are not yet available. Interest rate swaps accounted for Dollars 762bn and currency swaps for Dollars 161bn (equivalent) of the total, representing increases of 36 per cent and 70 per cent respectively over comparable levels in 1990. Although dollar swaps still represent the largest portion of the market, dealers reported continued growth in other areas, such as Swiss francs and French francs. Italian lira interest rate swap activity increased by 452 per cent, compared with the first half of 1990. Activity in related products - caps, floors, collars and swap options (swaptions) - totalled just under Dollars 200bn, an increase of 44 per cent over the same period in 1990. The World Bank has awarded the mandate to arrange its next global bond offering to Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch. The deal, totalling Dollars 1.5bn, and will have a maturity of 10 years. The bond offering is expected to be launched on Wednesday, for pricing on Thursday. Demand for dollar securities is strong, due to the lack of supply during the market's rally over Christmas. This lack of supply caused Eurobond yield spreads to tighten to historically very narrow levels, despite the price rally in the government bond market. The World Bank's outstanding 8 1/8 per cent bonds due 2001 are currently bid at 22 basis points above the comparable US Treasury, but that deal is trading at a substantial premium to par. The new global deal is expected to be priced at a spread of less than 20 basis points above the Treasury yield curve. Yamaichi International, the London-based arm of the Japanese securities house, plans to make a market in Ecu Eurobonds from today, as part of a programme of expansion of its bond market activities. The latest addition to the ranks of Ecu Eurobond market-makers will bring the total number to 41 dealers. Most houses now see Ecu trading as a key strategic market, and are keen to establish a foothold.</p>

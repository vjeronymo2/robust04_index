			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help lift VNU profits by 32% VNU, the Dutch publishing group, saw net profit rise by 32 per cent to Fl 79m (Dollars 45.2m) in the first half, helped by acquisitions, cost-cutting and economic recovery in some markets. Operating profit rose by 20 per cent to Fl 144m, matching the rate of increase in turnover, which rose to Fl 1.27bn from Fl 1.06bn. Acquisitions, including the purchase of BPI Communications of the US, publisher of Billboard and other magazines, accounted for slightly more than half of the turnover increase. Net profit expanded more sharply than operating profit because of lower interest charges and lower taxes. VNU said its Dutch and Belgian commercial television activities benefited from increased demand for brand advertising. In the UK, where VNU publishes trade and business magazines, the company reported a strong market recovery. The Dutch company took a Fl 20m charge against operating profits at its US business information group to reflect more conservative valuations of both capitalised software and database costs. In January, VNU announced a Dollars 220m US deal giving it control over two 'bibles' of the West Coast entertainment industry, the daily newspaper Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. It also took over 17 other US trade magazines.</p>

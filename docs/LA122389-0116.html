			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYWRIGHT FEASTS ON THE UNDERBELLY OF CORPORATE LIFE;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE AUTHOR OF 'THE DOWNSIDE' DRAWS HIS COMEDY FROM EFFORTS TO HIDE  SAVAGE, PRIMITIVE MOTIVATIONS.  </P> <P> In person, Richard Dresser hardly seems the sort of fellow who would put the  screws to you. Meeting his guest in the pool patio at a Santa Monica hotel, he  makes sure that everyone has had coffee and that no one has to sit in the  blazing sun. His manner is uncalculated, full of a satisfied working man's  casual charm.  </P> <P> Yet there's a devil inside Dresser, which he reserves for the hours he's  writing plays. Then, he puts the nice guy on hold, bringing out every torture  device known to the topical comedy writer and applying it to his characters.  For the Boston Globe's Kevin Kelly, Dresser "is a ferocious playwright . . .  (who) writes with a headlong intensity and a sense of pervasive mystery."  </P> <P> His characters in "The Downside," currently receiving its West Coast premiere  at the Pasadena Playhouse, get hurt tumbling through the corporate hellhole.  </P> <P> Other Dresser characters seem to be in hell, like the fellow tuning in to UFO  radio signals in "Better Days," or the lumpen proletariat couple living in the  shadow of a nightmarish amusement park in "Splitsville." Even when his people  can afford a holiday in the Hamptons ("Alone at the Beach"), they get in  serious trouble.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter, really, that the office in 'The Downside' is swanky and  slick," the 38-year-old New York-based playwright said. "Ultimately, the  comfortable exterior doesn't hide what I'm interested in, which is primitive  motivations. We're never far away from them, and we go to great lengths to hide  them -- this is where the comedy comes from."  </P> <P> Things get fairly savage in the marketing offices of Mark &amp; Maxwell, a  pharmaceutical company preparing a "product launch" of a new anti-stress drug  known as Maxolan-3000. It looks like a winner; a "downside" is the time-line  for the launch -- an impossible four-week free-fire zone of teleconferences,  data surveys and strategy sessions. Another is the drug itself, which may have  serious side effects.  </P> <P> "We all find ourselves in impossible situations we're sure we won't survive,"  Dresser noted. "But the original impulse for writing this wasn't to see how a  group of people handled extreme pressure, what kind of laughs I could get out  of that. It was to observe how we do business in this country right now."  </P> <P> He observed that it's easy to lose the impulse setting a play in motion,  because the often-rough course from filling an empty piece of paper to getting  the play to work on stage can lead the mind astray.  </P> <P> With "The Downside," this was less a problem than usual, since the ways of  American business are something Dresser has experienced closer to the bone,  perhaps, than many playwrights. In the early '80s, before major regional  productions, grants and awards came his way, he free-lanced as a speechwriter  for corporate executives and a writer of industrial films -- often for  pharmaceutical firms.  </P> <P> "I saw how they operated, up close, and I didn't like what I saw," he recalled.  "They eat each other alive. Just as bad is this absurd split that exists for  the employee between the urge to work for The Team and the urge to cover your  rear end. Dave (head of Mark &amp; Maxwell's marketing division) is where he is  because he's been able to reconcile these two seemingly opposite needs. Alan  (Dave's underling) can't, and tests Maxolan-3000 on himself as a moral  decision. Dave's, unlike Alan's, is an unexamined life."  </P> <P> Dresser asserts that he's also tweaking the movie business, from the witless,  fast-lane film maker recording the product launch for the bosses upstairs, to  the whole process of ladder-climbing savagery and non-productivity. The author  knows this world, too: He's writing an ABC TV movie, a segment for the HBO  anthology "Out of the Sixties" (he also did one of the "Vietnam War Stories"  for HBO) and even two screenplays, which won praise at, of all places, the  Eugene O'Neill National Playwrights Conference.  </P> <P> The bright spot in his Hollywood adventures, he admitted, was "when I fell  under the demonic spell of (TV producer) Jay Tarses and started writing, then  story editing, for 'The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.' He also has  (playwrights) Eric Overmyer and Albert Innaurato, so it's like Off-Broadway on  TV."  </P> <P> But since marketing runs show business, "I wanted to do 'The Downside' here in  L.A. In the end, the marketing people don't really make anything. They take  meetings -- and get ahead. But no one in this play is a villain. The villain is  the system. The question is, are you going to be a part of the system?  </P> <P> "I'm not going to tell anyone what my moral perspective on the play is," he  smiled, just as he wasn't comfortable pointing out his writing influences.  "I've got one, but the whole point of being part of a theater audience is  finding that point of view for yourself. My first obligation is to entertain:  to engage the audience."  </P> <P> That may be Dresser's first obligation, but his primary drive seems to be to  get plays out before an audience. His prolific output the past two years --  three full-length works and three one-acts -- is fairly amazing, considering  the slug-like pace of American play production.  </P> <P> "I write fast, but after I got the juices going, I wrote 'The Downside' in a  frenzy -- about a month" -- roughly the same time given the Maxolan marketing  team. It was first produced in 1987 at New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre by  director Kenneth Frankel, who is restaging it here.  </P> <P> "This sudden rush (of visibility) is pretty deceptive though," Dresser added.  "I wrote 'Better Days' five years ago. Now it's getting all this attention by  regional theaters and, now, New York. So it's frustrating, but hopeful  playwrights can't let that bother them. It's hard to develop as a playwright if  you don't finish writing the thing. Then you can find your voice."  </P> <P> But, like a man proud but still puzzled by his trade, Dresser grinned as he  confessed: "To actually sit down and decide that you're going to write a play  isn't the most rational decision in the world."  </P></p>

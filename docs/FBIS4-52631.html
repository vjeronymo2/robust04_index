			<p>BFN     [Text] Xanana Gusmao has returned to the leadership of the  Timorese resistance, according to the Lusa news agency. He is  the leader, even though he is jailed. Luis Nascimento reports.    [Nascimento] This is how the document reelecting Xanana  Gusmao ends: on the mountains of the Maubere [Timorese]  motherland, on 23 March. The document is signed by commander  Konis Santana and Laren Sabalaio, the secretary of the  resistance's clandestine front. It is a solemn declaration that  almost ignores the fact that Gusmao is behind bars. Ramos Horta  [resistance leader abroad], told Lusa that he welcomed this  symbolic reelection because it is justified by the current  political situation. Xanana had been deposed by his comrades  after his arrest. Ma Huno replaced him but was himself captured  shortly thereafter. The resistance said that it had deposed  Xanana because it did not want to create any problems for him  before and after his trial. This reelections points to the idea  that Xanana might be seen as the new Nelson Mandela of the 90's  --a human rights activist jailed by a ferocious dictatorship.</p>

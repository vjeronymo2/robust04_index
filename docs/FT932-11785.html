			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits warning from Tiphook SHARES in UK transport rental group Tiphook fell 22 per cent yesterday after the company issued a profits warning and said its trailer division was losing money. Tiphook said profits in the year to April 31, due to be announced in July, would be about 20 per cent below expectations. UBS, the company's broker, cut its forecast from Pounds 75m to Pounds 55m (Dollars 84.7m). Tiphook's often volatile shares fell from 293p to 170p at one stage, before recovering to 230p. Analysts were surprised at the scale of the downgrade, especially since Mr Robert Montague, chairman, was optimistic about the trading outlook when announcing interim profits in December. 'They misjudged their markets,' one analyst said. Most of the downgrade stemmed from the trailers division, which was hit by downturn in Germany and slower than expected recovery in the UK. Utilisation rates fell from 62 per cent to 56 per cent and analysts expect the division to make a Pounds 10m loss instead of a Pounds 5m profit. The company is cutting its fleet from nearly 34,000 trailers to 24,000 by selling 9,532 trailers back to manufacturers. In return, Tiphook will spend Pounds 387m buying 11,000 new trailers over the next five years. The fleet reduction had been planned for some months and will improve the division's utilisation rates from below 60 per cent to 75 per cent. It will also delay the benefit to Tiphook of any economic recovery in Europe. The cuts follow the bid for the company's main competitor, TIP Europe, from General Electric Capital Corp of the US. GECC plans to increase and upgrade TIP Europe's trailer fleet if its offer succeeds. A Pounds 16m profit from the trailer disposals will be balanced by certain charges totalling Pounds 13m.

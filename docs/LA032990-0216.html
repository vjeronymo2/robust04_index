			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> IRAN HOSTAGE MISSION REPORTED  </P> <P> A newspaper today reported that Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani had  dispatched his brother to Lebanon in a new effort to win the release of Western  hostages.  </P> <P> The conservative Beirut newspaper Ad Diyar said Mahmoud Hashemi, Rafsanjani's  brother, held meetings with leaders of Hezbollah, or Party of God, during a  weeklong, unannounced visit that ended Tuesday.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the envoy also met with Hussein Moussawi, who heads the  Islamic Amal movement based in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The movement forms  the pro-Syrian wing of Hezbollah, Iran's main ally in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Ad-Diyar gave no further details, and a spokesman at the Iranian Embassy, who  declined to be identified, said "we usually do not comment on such reports."  </P> <P> Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for underground Shiite fanatics  holding most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Eight Americans are among  those held.  </P></p>

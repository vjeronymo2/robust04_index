			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Switched on A Hungarian, it's said, is someone who enters a revolving door behind you and comes out in front. A case in point is Miklos Csapody, the Hungarian executive just designated director of technology for the US General Electric's subsidiary, GE Lighting Europe. It is three years since GE acquired Tungsram, the former state-owned Hungarian lightbulb-maker, thus inheriting Csapody who had been with the company since starting work as an electrician. Following the takeover, the westerners gave the instructions, he says. But the positions have been reversed by the shake-up in GE Lighting Europe aimed at integrating Tungsram with the lighting business bought from the UK's Thorn EMI. Csapody has emerged from the revolving door ahead. The self-assured 53-year-old, who learnt English by reading Oscar Wilde at home, becomes responsible for research centres in Leicester and Enfield in the UK, as well as in his native Hungary. His position is probably the highest any native east European has risen within a western multinational. A sheltered east European managerial upbringing can occasionally be a boon. Csapody says he did not quake when he first met Jack Welch, GE's formidable CEO . . .before admitting: 'I didn't know enough about him to be scared.'</p>

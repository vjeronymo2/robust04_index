			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 28, (IRNA) -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday [28 June] praised Tir Seventh  (June 28th) martyrs as "unique personalities and valuable assets  of Islamic system" [punctuation as received]    Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani made the remark in a meeting with  families of the martyrs killed in a bomb explosion at the  headquarters of the Islamic Republic Party. The bomb was  planted by terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) on June  28, 1981.    "You, survivors of 72 martyrs, should never feel that you  have lost anything, rather you should follow the holy path of  the martyrs in your thoughts and deeds and be loyal to them...  This is victory in itself," president told the audience.    He touched on the important role the martyrs played in  promoting Islamic revolution and sovereignty of Islamic Republic  of Iran's system and referred to events in early years of the  Islamic revolution and the efforts spent by deviant and  destructive trends to defeat Iran's Islamic revolution.    He said such deviant political trends as nationalists,  leftists and hypocrites in collaboration with foreign forces  tried to prevent formation of a system based on Quranic  principles and revolutionary Islam.    "Thank's God [as received] that they failed to do so in  light  of people's presence in the (political) scene and under the  leadership of the father of Islamic revolution, the late Imam  Khomeini," said the president.    Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani said the destruction of Islamic  Republic Party headquarters and martyrdom of 72 top persons led  by Ayatollah Dr. Mohammad Hossein Beheshti demolished enemies  from inside and persuaded people and public opinion to further  support officials of the system proceeding on the path of the  late Imam Khomeini.    He said that hypocrites and enemies of Islamic revolution  took their revenge on people, but God destined them to suffer  profound regret for a long time and took back all things from  them, made them hollow men and alienated them from revolution  and the country.    President referred to hypocrites' terrorist operations in  June 28, 1981 as an event similar to that of Mashhad on Ashura  (June 20) and said such crimes unveiled real nature and savage  behavior of the false proponents of democracy and human rights  before the world and Iranian people's public opinion and brought  them notoriety.    Rafsanjani wished Islamic revolution martyrs spiritual  elevation and their bereaved families patience in following Imam  Khomeini's sacred path.</p>

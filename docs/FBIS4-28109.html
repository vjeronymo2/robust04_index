			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry has  revised qualification standards for general contractors taking  part in biddings for public works projects in order to provide  wider access to foreign firms, ministry officials said Tuesday  [7 June].    The step was taken as the ministry prepares to introduce an  open bidding system for large-scale projects in the current  fiscal year that started April 1, the officials said.    They said safety records and measures to promote the welfare  of workers will be added to the existing 17-point screening  process to calculate the quality of bidding firms.    At present, the value of works completed in the past was  given heavy weight in evaluating contractors.    Under the new method, small-scale firms with high  technological standards and management foundations will receive  high marks, the officials said.    As for foreign bidders, the number of engineers they employ  and the length of their service in their home countries will be  taken into account, they said.    The qualifications of general contractors are reviewed every  other year in order to select reliable contractors.    The new evaluation method will be introduced in the next  fiscal year that begins April 1, 1995, the officials said.</p>

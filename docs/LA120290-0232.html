			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE DIVISION II VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CLEMENTS STAYS AROUND TO LEAD LA HABRA SWEEP  </P> <P> Missy Clements wasn't as worried about La Habra High School winning the State  Division II girls' volleyball title as she was about surviving the first game.  </P> <P> Clements, who injured her knee in the first game of last year's final and never  returned, had 14 kills, three blocks and two aces to lead La Habra to a 15-5,  15-1, 15-5 victory over King City in the championship match Saturday night at  Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> "We were standing on the in-line after the first game and I told myself, 'Cool,  you've actually made it to the second game,' " said Clements, a senior middle  blocker. "This was very exciting for me. It meant a lot."  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive title for La Habra (26-0), which extended its  two-year winning streak to 45 matches.  </P> <P> The victory also gave La Habra its seventh three-game sweep in its past eight  matches. Bakersfield Highland pushed the Highlanders to four games in the state  quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "I expected more toughness from (King City)," Clements said. "I don't know if  they came out frozen or what."  </P> <P> Clements caused King City several problems in the first game. She had seven  kills and a block. Zrinka Kristich added four kills and an ace.  </P> <P> La Habra's serving took over in the second game. The Highlanders had six aces,  including three by Zrinka Kristich.  </P> <P> La Habra had 14 aces in the match, including seven by Zrinka Kristich, who had  the flu.  </P> <P> "Zrinka got pretty peppy out there after she got those aces," La Habra Coach  Sandy Blumenthal said. "She had been sick for a few days and missed two days of  practice. Yesterday was the first day she had played.  </P> <P> "I think this match might have helped her get over her sickness."  </P> <P> King City Coach Debbie Hudson said La Habra's serving surprised her players.  </P> <P> "I anticipated they would be powerful and very accurate," Hudson said, "but  their serving was really a surprise.  </P> <P> "A lot of the teams La Habra played this year said they weren't that good. I  said, 'Yeah, right.' "  </P> <P> King City (23-4) led only once, 4-1 in the third game. But La Habra went on a  14-1 run, sparked by Ana Kristich's five kills.  </P> <P> Clements and Zrinka Kristich were named to the all-tournament team along with  La Habra setter Lisa Almanza and Ana Kristich, who had 10 kills. Amy McMahon  had eight kills to lead King City.  </P> <P> "This was a great way for us to end the season," Blumenthal said. "This was the  fewest amount of errors (10) that we've had all year.  </P> <P> "This team is very special. Not many coaches have the opportunity to coach a  team like this."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PENINSULA SCHOOLS ANNEXATION OF EASTVIEW BACKED  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has approved a resolution supporting the  annexation by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District of the  Eastview area of the city, which is now served by the Los Angeles Unified  School District.  </P> <P> About 8,500 residents live in the Eastview area, which was annexed to Rancho  Palos Verdes in 1983. While youngsters living in Eastview attend Los Angeles  district schools, the rest of Rancho Palos Verdes is served by the Palos Verdes  school district. Residents have said they are not dissatisfied with the quality  of education in the Los Angeles district but want to complete the annexation  process.  </P> <P> "What we need is your support," Craig Kelford, an Eastview resident and  co-chairman of Residents for Unified Local Education (RULE), told council  members Tuesday before they voted for the resolution.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school district has opposed the transfer, saying it would harm  integration efforts in the San Pedro-Lomita area by removing a significant  number of Anglo children from the schools.  </P> <P> RULE is putting together a task force of public agencies and Eastview residents  to work on the annexation proposal.  </P></p>

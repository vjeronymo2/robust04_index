			<p>BFN     [Text] The former Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels say  that they are marching on Kigali. Emile Boua Massirabo, one of  the leading officials of this movement, was interviewed by  telephone from Kampala. Dominique de Courcelles asked him why  the RPF had refused to recognize the new government in Kigali  and why it had broken the cease-fire.    [Begin recording] [Massirabo] We did not sign any  cease-fire,  we did not negotiate any cease-fire with anyone.    [Courcelles] You did not even begin?    [Massirabo] No, never. This idea of a cease-fire was put  forward by UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], we do not  accept this, we did not negotiate any cease-fire, this is a lie.  As soon as the massacres began in Kigali, the systematic  massacres of political opponents and Tutsi people, the Arusha  Agreement was violated and the RPF stood idly by while the whole  civilian population in Kigali was being slaughtered. It was our  duty -- and I believe no one can condemn us for that -- to  intervene.    [Courcelles] Was there any hope for an end to massacres with  a new government?    [Massirabo] I would also like to mention this government.  Who is in this government? The government is made up of  members of the MRND [Republican National Movement for  Democracy], of the (?CDR), of the section supporting late  President Habyarimana, of the MDR [Republican Democratic  Movement], of the PL [Liberal Party], it is a product of this  clique that organized these systematic killings in the capital.  It is inconceivable for the RPF to consider this government as  a valid partner. We would have expected the international  community to denounce this government, as well as the Army and  the Presidential Guard, which killed innocent, defenseless  people. I do not believe anyone can condemn us for the  resumption of the war. This government is not a partner for us.    [Courcelles] Therefore, the only solution for you today is  the resumption of war, you rule out any negotiation?    [Massirabo] Negotiations are impossible since we are dealing  with a wild horde systematically killing people.    [Courcelles] Who are you fighting now? Are you fighting the  Presidential Guard and the whole Army, or is part of the Army on  your side?    [Massirabo] You know that there is a part of the Army that  is  not with the murderers. Our main enemy now is the Presidential  Guard, but it goes without saying that all the people who side  with the Presidential Guard are enemies of the country, are  enemies of democracy.    [Courcelles] Do you believe that part of the Army will join  you?    [Massirabo] We called on the Rwandan Army. We called on all  those who are outraged by what is happening in Rwanda to join  us. We hope that part of the Army, as well as most of the  Rwandan population and of the international community will join  us. [end recording]</p>

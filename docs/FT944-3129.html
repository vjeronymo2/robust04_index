			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Newspapers win court action over naming of lottery winner The Pounds 17.9m National Lottery winner, who is married with three sons, lives in a new terraced house in Blackburn, Lancashire, earns Pounds 240 a week in a local chemical plant and is of Asian origin with a taste for curries, will remain anonymous - even though half of Blackburn already knows his identity. National newspapers went to the High Court yesterday and persuaded a judge to lift an injunction preventing publication of the winner's name. Then they decided not to publish it. 'We said we would respect the winner's anonymity on the front page. To go back on that would be sheer hypocrisy,' said Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of The Sun. The paper had gone to court because Camelot, the lottery organiser, 'has no legal right to tell us how to do our job'. The Sun said it would decide the issue on a case by case basis. If Myra Hindley, the Moors murderer, or Prince Edward won the National Lottery, The Sun would know where its duty lay. At The Sun's rival, the Daily Mirror, editor Mr Colin Myler said he had no intention of publishing the winner's name. The Daily Mirror's attitude was praised by Sir John Wood, the High Court judge who heard yesterday's appeal. 'We went to court to protect the right to print or not as opposed to being dictated to by Camelot,' said Mr Myler. 'What, for example, if the Queen wins the lottery?' Last night, Mr Peter Davis, lottery director-general and regulator, said he would review Camelot's efforts to protect the winner's identity following allegations about its conduct. Withholding a winner's name, unless consent was obtained, was a condition of Camelot's licence as lottery operator, he said. Politicians immediately jumped into the row over the winner's right to remain unknown. Blackburn's Labour MP, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, wrote to National Heritage secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell, accusing Camelot of laying 'a trail of clues about the identity of the jackpot winner'. Camelot, which will not appeal yesterday's decision, said it released limited details about the winner with his consent. The vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench media affairs committee, Mr Michael Fabricant, accused newspapers of being more interested in sales than a sense of responsibility. Most readers of The Sun who called the paper thought it should respect the winner's right to privacy. People who rang Camelot were of a similar mind. The Sun says it will continue to offer a reward for information on big winners. Donations to charity will fall by Pounds 172m a year as a result of the introduction of the National Lottery, according to a National Council for Voluntary Organisations survey. The estimated Pounds 136m charities are likely to receive from lottery proceeds will leave them Pounds 36m poorer, it said. Details, Page 7</p>

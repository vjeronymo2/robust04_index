			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Cerus announces FFr858m rights to reduce debt Cerus, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, yesterday announced plans to raise FFr858m (Dollars 146m) through a rights issue aimed at reducing debts and reinforcing its financial structure. The company said that one new share would be offered at FFr100 for every three shares already held. Cerus shares fell sharply, losing FFr7.80 to close at FFr129. The announcement of the share issue comes the day after the group revealed sharply reduced losses of FFr251m for 1993, compared with FFr1.55bn the previous year. Mr Michel Cicurel, deputy chairman, said yesterday that the results for the current year should be around break even. The company also announced a reduction in net debts, from FFr1.45bn at the end of 1992 to FFr108m at the end of last year. 'A holding company should not be indebted,' Mr Cicurel said yesterday, adding that the proceeds of the rights issue would be used solely to strengthen its balance sheet. Cerus, which is 49 per cent controlled by Mr Benedetti's CIR, is now concentrating on its industrial participations, including its 29 per cent holding in Valeo, the automobile components group. Mr Cicurel said yesterday that Cerus planned to sell Dumenil Leble, its loss-making banking operation, by the end of the year. According to Cerus, several companies have expressed interest in buying the private banking activities of Dumenil. A spokesman for the company said, however, that these activities would probably be retained until a sale had been arranged for the bank's portfolio of property loans. According to Cerus, CIR will subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to its current shareholding. The issue will be underwritten by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez. The issue of 8.58m new shares should reduce net assets per share from FFr145.70 to FFr134.30.</p>

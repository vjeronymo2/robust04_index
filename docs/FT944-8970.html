			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hambros halved after Pounds 23m rise in costs Hambros, the merchant bank and financial services group, said it had no plans to lay off staff despite a Pounds 23m increase in costs which contributed to a near-50 per cent fall in interim profits. The company, which warned last month that the outcome would fall below expectations, announced a drop from Pounds 39.5m to Pounds 21.5m in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30. Dealing profits fell Pounds 5m to Pounds 18.1m, but operating income rose from Pounds 200m to Pounds 210m despite market turmoil. Expenses rose from Pounds 145.7m to Pounds 168.4m, but the company said that more than half that amount was accounted for by new activities and acquisitions. All costs were being examined 'with the thoroughness that market conditions demand'. Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman, said expenses had risen by Pounds 15m in the merchant bank, where profits fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 22.6m. However, Pounds 8m of this rise came from investment in new businesses such as a private bank in Zurich. The remaining sum was largely because of a 6 per cent pay rise in April. 'You could say that was a misjudgment, but at the time it looked rather reasonable,' said Sir Chips, who said there were no plans for cuts among the 4,500 staff. Provisions for bad debts rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 7.3m while profits from direct investments rose to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 4.1m), mainly because of a sale of Scotia shares. The interim dividend is held at 4.5p, payable on earnings per share down from 11.7p to 4.8p. The shares closed 13p up at 235p, partly because pre-tax profits were at the upper end of last month's estimate of between Pounds 18m and Pounds 23m. As disclosed in August, Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency chain, incurred a Pounds 750,000 loss compared with a Pounds 1.3m profit. The chain has grown to 750 branches - or 6 per cent of the market - after acquiring Nationwide Estate Agents. Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman, said the chain aimed for a 10 per cent market share. That would be an 'extremely profitable' business if the housing market recovered to an average level of more than 1.3m transactions a year. The bank said the increase in the estate agency network should increase the number of insurance policies underwritten by Hambro Guardian, its insurance arm.</p>

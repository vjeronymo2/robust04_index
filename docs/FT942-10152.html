			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / De-regulation post demands rejected The government last night rejected demands that an opposition MP should head the new Commons committee which is to scrutinise a faster procedure for repealing legislation that imposes unnecessary burdens on commerce and industry. Mr Nick Brown, from the Labour front bench, and Mr Archie Kirkwood, for the Liberal Democrats, maintained that the committee's stature would be enhanced if its chairman were appointed from the opposition benches. The new committee, composed of 16 MPs, will examine proposals by ministers to use powers provided by the de-regulation bill to remove redundant acts from the statute book by parliamentary orders instead of through new primary legislation. Mr Brown said he feared that the de-regulation bill would be used to remove important legislative safeguards ensuring essential safety standards for workers, and promised that it would be repealed by the next Labour government. Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, said the de-regulation scrutiny committee would have sufficient power to alert the Commons if there was any possibility of the new powers provided by the bill being abused. Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, warned that a 'Conservative placeman' would be appointed to chair the new committee, and that the committee would provide no real protection whatever.</p>

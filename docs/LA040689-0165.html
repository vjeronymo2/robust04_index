			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE:: COSTA MESA - WHERE FREEWAYS MEET;  </P> <P> FOCUS;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA'S FREEWAY TRIANGLE: ACCESSIBILITY WITH A CAPITAL A  </P> <P> For those people who rank freeway access high on their list of life's most  important ingredients, a triangular area of Costa Mesa bordered by the San  Diego, Corona del Mar and Costa Mesa freeways could well be Shangri-La.  </P> <P> Located just south of the shopping bustle of South Coast Plaza, this triangular  piece of real estate is home to a variety of establishments catering to the  hectic life styles of young professionals who live or work in the area. A  myriad of businesses including fast-food restaurants, drive-through cleaners  and convenience stores cram the busier streets of Bristol and Baker.  Flat-topped buildings housing light industrial or service companies face each  other across quiet side streets.  </P> <P> For business travelers in search of lodging close to clients, shopping and, of  course, the freeway on-ramp, the area is about as centrally located as it is  possible to get. A number of hotels, including the 486-room Red Lion Inn and  the 227-room Holiday Inn, rim the area near its northernmost edge.  </P> <P> Hemmed in by three freeways, the potential for commercial sprawl in this wedge  of land is naturally restricted, but this has not impeded the construction of  one of the biggest projects in the area.  </P> <P> South Coast Corporate Center, a 362,000-square-foot, tri-tower complex will be  completed in late April. Asking rents for the brick-skinned structures are  between $1.85 and $2.05 per square foot -- at least 8% higher than commercial  rents in other sectors of the city. And, according to one commercial real  estate market executive, the difference is largely due to (what else?) freeway  accessibility.  </P> <P> So it was that in the late afternoon of a recent weekday, the on-ramps of the  San Diego, Costa Mesa and Corona del Mar freeways filled again with masses of  harried motorists, while all around, the dull and ever-present roar of traffic  filled the air.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.): 4,449  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +15%  </P> <P> Median Age: 31.7  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino), 83%; Latino, 8%; Black, 1%; Other, 8%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 32.5 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 30.9 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $24,878  </P> <P> Median household: $48,552  </P> <P> Average household: $53,066  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 19%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 33%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 26%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 22%  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> When Jeff Price turns a human torso into a bronze sack strung up like a desert  water gourd, he stretches the form into new, sometimes disturbing realms of  sculptural and psychological investigation. Akin to Peter Shelton's formalized,  objectified human forms, Price's transmogrified body parts are more sexual and  visceral.  </P> <P> Somewhat haphazardly this exhibit traces Price's evolution of organic forms  through various stages of development. From piece to piece dangling  scrotum-like forms become stretched, weighted bags that wind up suggesting  female lower torsos. The impact of this transformation is felt most keenly in  the rough, massive bronze sculpture "Census," a wall-pinned phallus that hangs  from a steel peg like a gigantic, heat-warped bottle opener with buns. Next to  this kind of overwhelming physicality Price's paintings retreat into soft  peddled intellectualizations. The drawings feel more immediate but substitute  elegant mutation for primal force.

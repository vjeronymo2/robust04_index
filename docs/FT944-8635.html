			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (7): Nationalist parties' appeal increases  -Society / relations with the Russian-speaking minority remain a matter for concern The largest issue in Latvia over the past three years of its independence has been the intertwined themes of its ability to establish independence from the former Soviet Union, the success of its efforts to secure the removal of the remaining Russian divisions from its territory and the construction of a relationship with its large Russian speaking minority, most of whom are not yet full citizens of the state. Many Latvians, especially ministers and leading officials, say they find concern in the western media on this issue alarmist, a view held strongly by, for example, Ms Indra Samite, minister for external resources. A Latvian American who settled in Latvia three years ago, she says she has never been able to square the headlines with the tranquillity of the real situation. This points to a real and important misconception, if not quite the one which Ms Samite and her colleagues have in mind. It is true that, since January 1991 when Soviet special forces opened fire on and killed Latvian protestors in Riga, no blood has been spilled, all demonstrations have become smaller and neither Latvian nationalists nor Russian secessionists make much of a splash on the political scene. The headlines were often overdone but they point to a continuing and potentially tormenting problem for the Latvian state - how a stable state is to be built in a country where a large minority do not speak the majority language, do not share the culture, were part of the colonisation of the country and at least acquiesced in the repressions it suffered after the war, and may constitute a potential 'fifth column' for a future Russian expansionist leader. Although this concern has no present means of expression, it is not to be wished away by reference to the present calm. It will require vigilance and active policies if the calm is to remain. Firstly, if the issue is dormant in Latvia, it has not been in so Russia. Mr Boris Yeltsin has several times raised in international forums the issue of the suppression of ethnic Russians' civil rights in Estonia and Latvia, while Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has talked of 'ethnic cleansing' in these two Baltic states. A survey of attitudes among Russian military officers undertaken earlier this year by the German Friedrich Ebert foundation found that they considered Latvia to be the country most hostile to Russia - including the US, Germany and Turkey. Earlier this month, Mr Sergei Baburin, the strongly nationalist Russian politician, visited Riga to speak to a Russian society. Latvia's independence is officially recognised but, it seems, still resented and its attitude to Russians feared and distrusted. Within Latvia, matters look different. No Latvian city of any size has a Latvian majority - reflecting the huge (in relative terms) shift of Russians to the urban centres of Latvia after the war, when the state was embedded into the Soviet system. In Riga, Russian is heard more often in the streets than Latvian, and although it has been three years since independence, it is the Latvians who are expected to switch to Russian when the need arises, not the reverse. Yet, the Latvian parliament in summer passed a citizenship law which will allow all but those Russians suspected of crimes against the state to seek naturalisation as full citizens over the next five or six years. It seems that the new government - fearful of being excluded from the European Union if it clings to previous legislation restricting the numbers of new citizens to 2,000 a year (ensuring that Russians were naturalised slowly, if ever) - has accepted that the 'occupiers' can be citizens. This causes resentment: the parties of the nationalist right, which appear to be increasing their appeal, still demand the 'three Ds - de-occupation, de-colonisation and de-Bolshevisation', according to Mr Nils Muisnieks, head of an ethnic study centre financed by the Soros Foundation. Mr Lauris Gondars, a leading theatre and film director, says that in the cultural sphere, 'the Latvians and the Russians have their separate worlds and they do not really touch'. However, says Mr Muisnieks, the accord between Russians and Latvians is real. 'There really is a low level of conflict, and the interesting question is why? I think one of the reasons is that the non-Latvians are like many immigrants: they are politically passive, and economic rights are what matter to them. 'Many Russians have benefitted from the growth of the financial sector and the growth of corruption: corruption has mitigated the ethnic problem. If you want to stay and you haven't got a passport you can buy one: if you need a piece of paper saying you are proficient in Latvian, you can buy one. 'The rhetoric is noisy - but look at how many mixed marriages there are (one in five, more than in any other former Soviet republic). Besides, the Latvians are now in government, in culture, in the country: the Russians are in finance and industry - so you don't have economic competition.' Ministers tend to see the issues less cynically. Mr Valdis Birkavs, the foreign minister, says that the Russians now see the country as more pleasant to live in than Russia, while Mr Maris Gailis, the prime minister, points to the lack of ethnic-based politics as a triumph of Latvian tolerance and civilisation. Yet, though their pronouncements are much more moderate than the sharpness of some of their Estonian colleagues' relations with the Russians, there remains among ministers and politicians a wariness at official level at least - a wariness which the rise of Russian nationalist politicians in the past year has done everything to sharpen. The best guess is that the calmness in this crucial relationship will hold. If next year sees a steady trickle of Russians being registered as citizens, if the marked trend towards Russian-speaking children being sent to Latvian schools in order to learn the language continues, if Russian rhetoric remains merely words and the Latvian nationalists are likewise satisfied with speeches, then the two communities can probably live in peace, if not in total harmony. Latvia's traditions - as the rich history of Riga shows - are those of a multicultural state, where German, French and Russian were all spoken as much as Latvian in earlier years, before it came in from the country to become the language of the nation. When Latvians have grasped again the reins of state power, they will need to re-fashion that multicultural heritage in new conditions if they are to avoid the communal backlash which other states, less fortunate and less tolerant, have experienced at the end of empire.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 POPULATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1990      1991      1992      1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (million)               2.667     2.667     2.667     2.606 by nationality %:   Latvians                          52.0      52.5      53.5      54.2   Russians                          34.0      34.0      33.5      33.1   Belorussians                       4.5       4.4       4.2       4.1   Ukrainians                         3.5       3.4       3.2       3.1   Poles                              2.3       2.2       2.2       2.2   Others                             3.7       3.5       3.4       3.3 Marriages per 1,000                 23.6      22.3      18.9      14.6 Divorces per 1,000                  10.8      11.1      14.6      10.3 Births                            37,918    34,633    31,569    26,769 Deaths                            34,812    34,749    35,420    39,197 Immigration                       32,285    14,684     6,199     4,114 Emigration                        40,991    25,480    53,130    31,998 Population change                 -5,600   -10,912   -50,782   -40,322 Life expectancy   at birth, total                   69.5      69.5      68.7      67.2   Men                               64.2      63.8      63.3      61.6   Women                             74.6      74.8      74.8      73.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Latvian government  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

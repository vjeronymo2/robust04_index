			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The FT Review of Personal Finance The recession is proving obstinate, because the British economy faces a long process of adjustment to lower inflation and lower levels of private debt. For the moment, the stock market should be treated with caution. But investors can still earn 9 per cent on fixed-income investments, with inflation only 4 per cent and falling slowly. Fixed-interest investments receive special attention in the summer issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with Saturday's. The Review also includes a survey on Personal Pensions.</p>

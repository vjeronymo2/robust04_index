			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Skiing: On the wrong side of the mountain - Arnold Wilson drops down from his habitual Courchevel eyrie and has great fun SOME SKIERS steadfastly refuse to try new resorts: they are perfectly happy to return to Saas Fee, Soll, Flaine or Zermatt every year (their privilege of course). There are skiers who have been going to Wengen all their lives and would be alarmed if they did not know precisely what was round the next corner of all their favourite runs. People also have their favourite areas within a resort, particularly in some of the huge conurbations such as the Trois Vallees, L'Espace Killy and Portes du Soleil. This can mean missing some extremely good skiing. Does it matter? I must confess that I sometimes find myself in this camp: during numerous visits to the Trois Vallees, I have never bothered with Courchevel 1650, which has always seemed to be somewhat out on a limb. Until last winter I had always been preoccupied with skiing what to my rather smug way of thinking was the more 'important' area above Courchevel 1850, such as the Jean Blanc and Jockeys runs, or perhaps picking off some of Courchevel's many skiable couloirs, or slavishly skiing across to Meribel and Val Thorens because that was the thing to do. Indeed, if you are staying at 1850, the idea of starting the day by going down to 1650 seemed rather a wimpish concept. But when Nick Morgan of Le Ski - which claims to have more chalets in Courchevel (most of them in 1650) than any other tour operator - suggested a day's skiing down at 1650 I magnanimously agreed. The day started in brisk fashion with three of us making a kilometre lancee style descent to meet him, thinking ourselves rather grand as we hurtled down from our alpine eyrie to meet the hoi polloi of 1650 which is slightly isolated on the 'wrong side' of a gorge. There is nothing quite like the first fast run of the day, when breakfast is still trying to fuel the system, cobwebs are still clinging to eyelids and the icy cold blast of alpine air forces its way into your lungs causing a mixture of shock and delight. The skiing down from Mont Bel Air is steep motorway - a real scorcher. Eyes water and the heart pounds and then sings - this is when you remember exactly why you return to the mountains year after year. We met Nick and Charlie, the Le Ski guide, just before 10 am for a quick drink at the Signal bar. Then we started the long ascent. Gradually, taking lift after lift, we worked our way to the top of the system. Finally, at Chanrossa, we had run out of uphill transport. It was time to take our skis off and start climbing. We were heading for a classic, but not terribly difficult, off piste itinerary: Les Avals. The climb was quite steep and took us nearly an hour, but in perfect weather and with inspiring scenery, it was almost a picnic, albeit a strenuous one. We could have shortened the journey by 20 minutes or so by putting on skins and walking up on skis. At the top we paused to catch our breath before starting our descent with a leap off a cornice. Nick had brought some chocolate and soft drinks so we had a quick fuel intake while we admired the view. Then, one by one, we dropped off the ridge. For the next hour or so we were greeted with a gently meandering but quite steep valley. We were able to cruise comfortably on top of a mixture of corn snow and wind-packed powder. There was hardly another soul. The mountain we climbed to get to Les Avals was the Roc Merlet (2,735 metres). The Les Avals is between the Col du Fruit and the Petit Mont Blanc. A good insiders' route back from 1650 to 1850 is the Telecabine d'Arionaaz followed by a short ski to the Teleski de la Combe. You can then ski the long testing red, Combe Roc Mugnier. Then you take the Aiguille du Fruit four-person detachable chair where there is usually little queueing. For the final run back to 1850, Morgan prefers the black Suisses run and then the long green Bellecote. You do not have to ski Les Avals to enjoy 1650's skiing - indeed it is very much the minority who do. There is a network of lifts and pistes all the way up to the Col de Chanrossa which would constitute a reasonable-sized ski resort on its own if you did not know about the rest of Courchevel and the three-valley system. The journey from 1850 to 1650, the Les Avals tour and the long and enjoyable return to 1850 had consumed an entire day. It was an extraordinarily satisfying day and one that we would never had experienced had we stuck rigidly to tried and tested terrain. So - for once - let's hear it for unfashionable 1650, and for trying new areas in general. The snow may not always be whiter, but it is often rewarding to investigate. Le Ski is at 25, Holly Terrace, Huddersfield HDI 6JW. Tel: 0484-548996.</p>

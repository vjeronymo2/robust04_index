			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central Committee member, </F> in Amman; date not given: "'Arafat Responsible for Decline of  PLO"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction]    [Text] Amman (AL-SHARQ special)--A prominent Fatah Central  Committee member held Chairman Yasir 'Arafat responsible for the  deterioration of conditions in the PLO. He said that 'Arafat had  gone out of his way to win the world and Israel's approval and  had lost his own people. He said that whoever wants to negotiate  with Rabin must be close to the Palestinian opposition, not  remote from it. 'Abbas Zaki, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ and is  also secretary of the intifadah's Supreme Committee, stated that  all the agreements that 'Arafat had concluded with Israel  "remain for us a truce for another war." He wagered on the  resoluteness of the Palestinian people not to submit. "The  Palestinian leadership," said Zaki, "must again go through the  Jordanian gate, because any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will  protect what remains of the Palestinians and will prevent the  Zionist urge to expand." Here is the text of the interview.    [AL-SHARQ] From your statements we know that you are one of  the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Opponents  have expressed their opposition in various ways, such as  resignation. How have you expressed your opposition?    [Zaki] I am against categorizing everyone who loves his  country and who adheres to his principles and maintains the  values and heritage of militancy as "opposition," because this  will mean that terms will collapse. It will mean that those who  adhere to principles and constants are to be called  "opposition." The legitimate authority has engaged in  concession-making and abandonment and is far from consensus  decisionmaking. The Oslo agreement was a disgraceful agreement  in the life of the Palestinian people. It was a disaster that  took place in circumstances difficult for our people. When we  went to Madrid, our incentive was to stop the cancer of  settlements and land confiscation from spreading in the  Palestinian body. Palestinian speech-making was excellent. Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi outshone Shamir. There was corridor  diplomacy, and a Palestinian avoidance of the political  indecency of abdication that took place in the Oslo agreement.  The latter came by stealth, from behind the backs of the  leadership, the negotiators, and the people. The agreement  emerged from this work in the dark. It has prevented our people  from talking about the resolutions of the legitimate  international authority and about the political authority for  the political process. Syria and Jordan are talking about land  for peace and implementation of 242 and 338. The Palestinians,  on the other hand, cannot talk about land for peace or demand  implementation of 242. So negotiation takes place piecemeal  until one gets 2 percent of Palestinian territory.    Surely, no patriot can accept this agreement, despite all  the  piping and drumming for it. We see its popularity waning and  declining. The unfair conditions accompanying the implementation  of this agreement do not accord with the nature of Palestinian  heroism, Palestinian rights, or the Palestinian role in the  liberation struggle. This became clear for example after the  Davos and Cairo agreements, which accord with the Oslo  agreement, which does not guarantee an Israeli withdrawal.  Settlement-building is continuing. We are a tool in the hand of  the enemy: he has the last word, and any other interpretations  are pure fiction. What's more, the leadership has sold the  agreement as being a national authority, etc. Let 'Arafat go;  let him sign with Peres, not with Rabin, to cancel the national  authority and the free crossing points and demand a halt to  settlement. Jericho will remain as many kilometers as they  approved without any increase. Gaza, too, has been divided into  squares, and new lands have been added to the settlements in  Gaza--more than 30 kilometers. Our language now is not against  or in opposition to the agreement; it is for Palestine. Whoever  isolates himself from his people and national decisions is in  opposition--not we. In another way I have expressed my  conviction that the children, women, old men, and men of the  Palestinian people are innocent of the deal going on. In harmony  with our people and the principles of our movement, I will not  resign. I shall continue to demand that we stay the course to  ward off the corruption, stop the cycle of decline, and realize  some of the aspirations we hoped for.    [AL-SHARQ] In Davos, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres implied  that 'Arafat had abandoned the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state and had decided on a confederation. How true  is this talk, and what is your opinion?    [Zaki] Please don't ask me about the Peres-'Arafat meeting,  because it did not take place by Palestinian decision. It took  place without our knowledge; so we will not defend something we  do not know.    [AL-SHARQ] The 10 opposition groups led by the Islamic  opposition movement, Hamas have arrived among themselves at a  collective leadership that offers itself as an alternative to  the present leadership. Do you think the project will succeed?  What is your position as an opposition figure regarding this  front?    [Zaki] First, people understand things the wrong way around.  Whoever wants to become leader of this people must fight. He  must start from the base. If you want to propose yourself as an  alternative to the leadership, you confirm and elevate your  leadership on the basis of martyrs' skulls, or great  achievements, or defeats inflicted on the enemy, so that you  become uncontested leader. You don't snatch leadership by  competing with a team that you happen to see in this position.  My view is that the Palestinian opposition has not been  successful to date. It is seeking to set up an inverted pyramid.  We have gotten used to lots of grinding noise from the mill  without seeing any flour. The opposition forces must insist on  the need to espouse resolutions from which the Oslo team  retreated, but without exaggeration and suicidal slogans. We  have found that committed militant momentum, along with the  feeling and resources of the people, needs implementation  without slogans. Anyone who wants to deviate from the national  course and constant principles has no place with our people. But  for us to make two fronts in a face-off with each other is a  real disaster. The opposition realizes that the Americans, the  Arabs, and weak-spirited Palestinians and ordinary people are  for the agreement. Confronting the whole world at once yields  nothing. If only the opposition were working for ultimate issues  and struggling for Jerusalem! Jerusalem is being wiped off the  map. In six months there won't be any East Jerusalem. It has an  area of 72 square [sq] km; Palestinians now own 4 sq km. Now  there are Israeli projects like al-Tur and Ra's al-'Amud, in  addition to the razing of 438 houses. The issue is being limited  to praying in Jerusalem. They are granting us a Jerusalem for  prayer, not for sovereignty. Thus, if the opposition works for  Jerusalem, the refugees, security, borders, and the issues  contested with the enemy, it cannot stand still. I challenge  Israel to announce its idea of the scope of the final  settlement; for the solution is open, admitting of all  possibilities, and needs major forces to make [Israel] yield.  With this fragmentation we are serving the plot for a final  settlement with open possibilities. Rabin, too, has not talked  about the final settlement. The 10 groups must therefore work to  alleviate our people's sufferings. Their concern must not become  only the Oslo team. They must talk about Israel. This is the  direction that we in Fatah have taken. In his recent visit to  Jordan, Abu al-Lutf [Faruq al-Qaddumi] expressed this when he  attacked Rabin and said that he does not want peace. This is  what is needed and wanted: instead of attacking a Palestinian  leader, we must attack the Israelis. We must get over our  complexes by being clearly of the PLO or clearly of Fatah or any  other organization, or we shall begin attacking the fighting men  who are in confrontation with the enemy. In that case the people  retreat behind the leaders. The leader is the one who goes in  front of the ranks. The measuring stick for any revolution is  the amount of blood it gives and the martyrs it offers. If Fatah  had not given so many martyrs, people would not have remained  silent until now and unable to speak about Fatah members as  having deviated openly. Whoever wants to become an alternative  needs a large pool of sacrifices, positions, and a role that has  an audience so that he can overcome all the challenges. I send  an open invitation for the opposition to return to weaving the  feelings and emotions of the people into a true front. We  welcome any Palestinian unity, because the keynote of this  period is to give concrete embodiment to democracy. We therefore  consider any unity, whether it looks at us positively or  negatively, as in the interest of our people.    [AL-SHARQ] A number of Palestinian personalities led by  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi have put forward demands for perestroyka in  the PLO. 'Abd-al-Shafi has expressed disappointment at the  results of the talks with the leadership. What is your opinion  about this?    [Zaki] The internal situation is tragic. It does not express  the existence of vision or a point of departure for dealing with  internal conditions. The delegations that have been formed were  from the fabric of the Palestinian leadership, but bad  management and inept performance have made it necessary for it  to raise its voice loudly. Let there be a fight inside the camp  of political harmony. But they are at odds administratively. In  reality, there is no change in method or style or in  performance. We think that if we study the Palestinian situation  deeply, we shall reach the conviction that the decline of  Palestinian institutions must be halted.    [AL-SHARQ] What is the flaw at the present time in the  management of the negotiations and the Palestinian situation?    [Zaki] In Oslo, the Executive Committee and the Central  Committee were kept in the dark for eight months concerning an  important event to sell Palestine. The Cairo-Davos agreement was  signed without our knowledge. A meeting was held to tell us that  the agreement had been signed between Abu-'Ammar and Peres. So  the negotiating delegation had no value, and Palestinian  institutions have likewise become worthless. This requires  serious pondering.    [AL-SHARQ] Many resignations of Fatah cadres have been  submitted in the occupied territories. The Fatah Hawks have  abandoned arms. What do you think is the reason for these  resignations? Are they related to the figure of the chairman?    [Zaki] There is no doubt that Brother Abu-'Ammar is the head  of the PLO. There remains no one with him on the Executive  Committee. Second, he is head of the occupied territory and  therefore of the struggle now raging, until a compromise  leadership arrives and there is a different style. He has  surrounded himself with advisers who have harmed him and  distanced him from popular feeling.    In the occupied territory everyone bears responsibility.  Israel prefers civil war and will not leave Gaza in two years  unless it has set up conditions for civil war. Events  unfortunately are showing that Fatah youth are clashing with  each other in Nablus with an Israeli officer reconciling them.  When Fatah becomes an Israeli demand, the leadership responsible  for the occupied territory must stop and ask itself where it is  going. Abu-'Ammar bears the major responsibility for the present  state of affairs--decline and turning to the enemy to protect  themselves from their own flesh and blood. This is something  critical.    [AL-SHARQ] There are doubts about the role of the  Palestinian  police in the autonomous stage in suppressing the opposition and  therefore that civil war may break out. What is your opinion?    [Zaki] I do not think civil war will break out. The  patriotic  side will be in the Palestinian police, or will be most  prominent. Anyone who wagers that the police will be oriented  toward Israel is wrong. I am confident that civil war will not  take place with the authority. However, the enemy and the  decline in Fatah are working for the premise. The role of the  police is to protect the Palestinian establishment; it is to  serve the people, not to terrorize and pressure the people.    [AL-SHARQ] Some see the Jordanian-Palestinian economic  agreement as cutting off the way to the establishment of a  Palestinian state in the future. What do you think of the idea?    [Zaki] On the contrary, any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement  protects what remains of the Palestinians and also prevents the  Zionist urge to expand. In the past, we were up against Rabin,  who was able to wipe out a military force here or there. Today,  however, we are up against Peres, who wipes out entire peoples  and states by virtue of his economic program. We think there is  a valuable strategic convergence due to factors of interest,  necessity, history, and geography. It demands that we be on the  side of Jordan, not of Israel. This agreement strengthens the  establishment of a Palestinian state. All this depends on the  establishment of a monetary authority, also the establishment of  a Palestinian national authority.    [AL-SHARQ] Many politicians have seen some sort of link  between you and the creation of the Arab Islamic Party (Haqq).  Are these reports true?    [Zaki] First, I am committed to Fatah. I think that Fatah is  the shortest way to Palestine. Fatah's mission will exist as  long as the occupation exists. In other words, it is a national  liberation movement. However, I in Fatah am not against any  reserve force, though one should bear in mind that I have no  contacts with the Arab Islamic Party or knowledge of its  figures. There is no truth to the relationship with it that has  been attributed to me. Let anyone who wants to form any party  leave Fatah. We believe in political pluralism. We welcome any  parties, provided that they are engaged and call for national  unity. We welcome any flower that blooms--but in the independent  Palestinian garden!    [AL-SHARQ] Chairman 'Arafat recently made a visit to Saudi  Arabia. What price did he pay to obtain Saudi support? The  newspapers have informed us that Saudi Arabia is ready to give  aid.    [Zaki] We were unaware that the matter had reached a  conclusion. We have not been informed of the conditions to which  he agreed. We have not heard about anything.    [AL-SHARQ] If peace treaties between the Arab rulers and  Israel are reached, do you expect there to be a historic popular  reconciliation between the Arab peoples and Israel, or just a  truce?    [Zaki] We think there will be a truce for another battle,  because it is not possible for the usurper and the victim to  cooperate with each other. The path of making peace and the  management of the process have not emerged from convictions. The  strong imposes his conditions on the weak. The Gulf war was a  defeat for the Arab nation. Now the strong wants the Arabs to  pay the price of this defeat. So this is all a payment that has  fallen due. Those at work in this field are not men of peace.  They are of different sorts; even if they talk about peace,  inwardly they are something else. The situation is leading to a  truce, rather than peace. Al-Sadat made peace, but the Egyptian  people still reject normalization. The people will never be like  sheep. They will not throw away their land if their leaders  throw it away. We see broad smiles from the negotiators, and at  the same time we see murder and street fighting with knives  every day. They have not been dazzled by the presence of 'Arafat  and the Palestinian leadership in Washington wearing a gold  medal with Israel. This is a people that does not stoop and does  not fear. Its will is strong. God willing, the inevitability of  victory is near. It is revolution until victory.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold market bulls return in force AFTER TAKING a well-earned rest in the early part of this week the international speculators who had driven the gold price ever higher over the past few weeks returned to the market on Thursday refreshed and raring to go. And they quickly made their presence felt. The London bullion market price, which had eased back 65 US cents from the nine-month high reached at the end of last week, ended the day Dollars 12 higher at a 17-month high of Dollars 369.15 a troy ounce. There was an overnight retracement and yesterday's London opening was at Dollars 366.50 an ounce, but by the close it had moved up again to Dollars 367.80. The renewed surge, which took gold's price rise over the past three weeks to nearly Dollars 24, was greeted with little enthusiasm among market professionals. 'The market is explosive. It has lost contact with reality,' was the comment of one dealer. The bullish bug that has infected the gold speculators was contracted three weeks ago after they heard that Mr George Soros, the financier who made a fortune last autumn by betting against sterling and the Italian lira, had bought Dollars 400m worth of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest US gold producer from Sir James Goldsmith, who had used some of the money to purchase options to buy physical gold. It was revealed this week that Sir James had sold another substantial tranche of his Newmont stake. Analysts have pointed out repeatedly that the physical supply/demand situation does not justify the recent advance but their voices have been drowned in the clamour of the chartists. Even before Thursday's leap Ms Rhona O'Connell of Williams de Broe Mining Research was counselling caution. 'The underlying fundamentals should start to bring some order back into proceedings at this level,' she said, '. . .but the fund managers have got the bit between their teeth.' 'It will all end in tears,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. But he conceded that the weight of fund buying and covering by options granters could in the meantime push the gold price 'to virtually any level'. Silver followed gold upwards, ending nine cents up on the week at 444.50 an ounce, but platinum lost Dollars 2.50 on balance at Dollars 382,50 an ounce. Lack of fundamental justification was also a matter for concern among traders on London Metal Exchange copper market this week as they watched prices stage a substantial rally from last week's 5 1/2 -year lows. The three months delivery contract rose Pounds 105 over the first four days (helped by a fall in sterling's value against the US dollar). But when it bounced off resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,870 a tonne yesterday morning consensus was quickly reached that the technical correction was over and sellers piled in. By the close the three months price was down to Pounds 1,164.50 a tonne, up Pounds 35.75 on the week - but most of that rise was attributable to the currency factor. The sudden turnround in the copper prices soured sentiment in other LME markets, notably zinc, which fell Dollars 34.25 on the day in the three months position, which ended the week Dollars 43 down on balance at Dollars 864.50 a tonne. Dealers said the zinc market had already been suffering from a deteriorating technical situation and yesterday's breach of support, first at Dollars 1,115 and then at Dollars 1,000 a tonne, had triggered stop-loss selling and panic liquidation. Nickel prices fell back sharply after the steam was taken out of the market by a warning on Tuesday that the LME was monitoring a developing squeeze situation centred on the end of this year. As the cash position closed yesterday at Dollars 5,687.50 a tonne, down Dollars 312.50 on the week dealers said that talk was circulating that the European trader behind the November/December tightness was unwinding his position. At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices were briefly boosted on Thursday by news that Colombia, the world's second biggest coffee producer had set an effective minimum export price of 60 cents a lb, just above current nearby quotations on the New York coffee market. But most of the London rise had been wiped out by the end of the day as dealers discounted the significance of the news, and New York prices actually finished the day lower. Sentiment improved a little yesterday, however, when the Reuter news agency reported that the Brazilian industry and commerce minister, Mr Jose Eduardo Vieira, on a one-day trip to Colombia on May 23 to hold talks with President Cesar Gaviria and Colombia's National Federation, would be taking with him a proposal by the Inter-African Coffee Association that the Latin Americans and Africans should co-operate in an effort 'to establish minimum coffee prices on an international level'. Brazil had not taken a position itself on the proposal, presented on Wednesday by the organisation's secretary general, Mr Arega Worka, and the Ivory Coast commodities minister, Mr Guy Alain Emmanuel Gauze, an official said. He also said that Mr Vieira had suggested that the African organisation create a fund with contributions from each of the 25 member countries to improve the quality of their coffee and that the African countries should burn their 'low-quality stocks' to improve the overall quality.  -------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Tuesday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------- Aluminium    -150 to 1,791,175 Copper     +3,650 to   407,125 Lead         +600 to   251,625 Nickel       +294 to    92,274 Zinc       +1,400 to   646,175 Tin           -35 to    20,440  --------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: A NEW MILITARY FOR THE POST-COLD WAR ERA  </P> <P> Thanks partly to the Iraq crisis -- and partly to the Cold War's end -- U.S.  military forces will have fewer personnel on active service but more in ready  reserve, and the types of major weapons will be different from what they've  been for the past 45 years.  </P> <P> That's the picture emerging from top-level thinking at the Pentagon and the  negotiations on defense spending at last week's budget summit between Congress  and the Administration.  </P> <P> The specific numbers on defense cuts may not look impressive. Budget  negotiators' projections show an annual defense budget five years from now,  with zero growth after inflation, of $294 billion -- compared to $298 billion  this year.  </P> <P> But, behind the numbers, dramatic changes are going forward. Military forces  will be reduced by 25%, or 500,000 service personnel during the next few years.  Civilian employees of the military will be cut 200,000.  </P> <P> Even so, cutting people won't reduce defense spending all that much. For real  savings, you need to make the hard, politically charged decisions to close  military bases, says Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone. Inevitably,  though, changes in strategy and the military's role will shutter many bases  that are operating today at only 50% of capacity.  </P> <P> Similar long-term changes will cut the defense industry from 3.5 million  employees currently to 1.5 million, says Lawrence Korb, former assistant  secretary of defense and now a fellow of the Brookings Institution. The  reductions will come slowly, to be sure, over 10 years. In the interim, defense  firms will have a chance to adapt to the post-Cold War environment.  </P> <P> The Iraq crisis is a field test for that environment, say military thinkers,  for the kind of military forces and equipment the United States needs now that  its adversary is no longer the Soviet Union and the projected terrain of battle  is no longer the settled infrastructure of Europe.  </P> <P> "In Europe, we have bases and support systems ready to receive more troops in  case of war," explains Michael Rich, a military analyst at RAND Corp., the  Santa Monica research firm. "But in places like the Persian Gulf, we operate  with no fixed infrastructure; everything is mobile."  </P> <P> Right now in the Gulf, the U.S. military's communications and computer systems,  its mobile health-care facilities -- not to mention its ability to deliver  gallons of water to thirsty troops -- are being tested. Lessons learned there  will lead to new or changed products for the military.  </P> <P> In larger weapons programs, too, the Iraq crisis is having an influence.  Transport is in, for example. Delay in getting U.S. tanks to Saudi Arabia has  led to recognition that the Navy, which spent massively on warships in the  1980s, overlooked transport craft and now needs cargo ships. In fact, says a  defense expert, "what is needed is a renewal of our Merchant Marine" -- which  dwindled from 2,000 ships to 400 in the '80s.  </P> <P> The need for air transport ensures support in Congress for McDonnell Douglas'  C-17 cargo plane program, says investment analyst George Shapiro of Salomon  Bros. On the other hand, a big bomber program such as Northrop's B-2 will be  allowed only to "limp along" if Congress doesn't kill it outright.  </P> <P> And that suggests a pattern for the new environment. Sophisticated weapons  systems, designed to counter equally sophisticated Soviet technology, are  likely to be put on hold. (Research won't be cut too sharply, because the  Soviet Union is continuing its military R&amp;D. But the military is no longer  first priority for the Soviets, or for the Americans either.) U.S. weapons that  will be favored are those that can be deployed quickly and confidently.  </P> <P> So the highly sophisticated Advanced Tactical Fighter program -- now in the  prototype stage -- will be delayed indefinitely, say experts. But there will be  several years of additional orders for tried and true fighter planes, such as  McDonnell Douglas' F-15 and General Dynamics' F-16.  </P> <P> The Army doesn't need more tanks, but it wants artillery pieces that can be  dropped by parachute and set up anywhere.  </P> <P> Behind the search for "flexibility," however, lies the hard reality of tighter  defense budgets. With fewer new planes needed, fewer defense contractors will  be needed. So there will be a wave of mergers similar to the 1950s and '60s,  when Martin Aircraft merged with Marietta, North American merged with Rockwell,  and Douglas merged with McDonnell.  </P> <P> The armed services will cope with tight budgets by making more use of reserves,  in much the way businesses use contract labor. The military uses reserves now,  of course, and has called up many in the Iraq crisis. In the future, more  personnel will be kept in reserve, backing up slimmed-down regular forces that  will number about 1 million -- half today's total -- and be organized in  smaller units for speed and flexibility of action.  </P> <P> In no way, however, will the reduced Army or Navy be what the military was  between World Wars I and II or after the Civil War, a force of diminished  capacity and respect. "The U.S. can't go back into isolation," says Lawrence  Korb. "At the end of the 20th Century, it has to take the lead to keep the  world economic system working."  </P> <P> In other words, post-Cold War means more demanding missions for the armed  services and defense industry. May slimming-down keep them in fighting trim.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michel Rosten commentary: "NATO: End of Neutrality"] </F>   [Text] We cannot question the importance of transatlantic  relations which, for West Europe, must remain an absolute  priority. We certainly could not accuse NATO, reduced to merely  carrying out UN orders, of wanting to take all the credit.  Nevertheless, we still find it impossible to subscribe to the  new instant-mix policy drawn up by Washington and registered on  Friday [22 April] at NATO headquarters by the permanent Council  of Ambassadors which drew up an ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs.    It is true that the impact of this strong-arm policy will  please public opinion which was horrified by the Gorazde  massacre, but the impartial observer must point out its inherent  contradictions. The West, which wants to bring the Serbs back  to the negotiating table, has decided, by unusually twisted  thinking, that the fastest way to do this is by carrying out  bombing raids that go beyond simply surgical strikes. The  troops commanded by General Mladic have clearly demonstrated  after the initial strikes that they will not hesitate to take  retaliatory action and, consequently, attack blue helmet  "hostages."    The new strategy currently being implemented risks  escalating  a conflict in which the Americans refuse to participate on the  ground. It has to be one thing or the other: Either Washington  gives a whole new dimension to the Bosnian conflict and sends in  the U.S. infantry or the White House administration sticks to a  stance of cautious reserve to preserve UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] neutrality. There is no getting away from the fact that  a new NATO ultimatum cannot be compared with that issued on 9  February aimed at lifting the siege of Sarajevo. That one was  directed at the irregular Serbian troops and Bosnian Government  forces....    Things have since changed. The whole concept of the  neutrality of the blue helmets is collapsing. While it is  acceptable in the name of human rights to impose an  interventionist force on a country in the throes of civil war,  is it really justified for NATO to take the side of one of the  belligerents simply because it is the weaker? Moreover, insofar  as it does take this decision -- without actually entering the  war itself to assist "its" blue helmets -- will it not merely  have accepted the responsibility for prolonging the war?</p>

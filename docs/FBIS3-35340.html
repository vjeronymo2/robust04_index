Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on this  step. A responsible source told a MENA correspondent that this  recall is routine and does not have other connotations.    However, observers in Kuwait say that the recall of the  Kuwaiti ambassador comes in the wake of tense relations between  the two countries after Qatari Television over the past few days  screened video reports from inside Iraq on the negative effect  of the economic blockade imposed on the Iraqi people.    Observers said Qatari Television on Friday carried an  interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf.  Kuwaiti officials interpreted this action as being tantamount  to Qatar's adoption of the Iraqi viewpoint.    The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned Qatari  Ambassador Ahmad Bin-Ghanim al-Rumayhi and conveyed to him  unfriendly and unofficial criticism of the Qatari stand. The  Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry also expressed apprehension about this  rapprochement between Qatar and Iraq and asked him to explain  the Qatari view on this subject.    Press reports today said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister  Shaykh  Sabah al-Ahmad sent a strongly worded letter to Shaykh Fahim  al-Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council on  the recent rapprochement between Qatar and the Iraqi regime.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Making a marque on the world: GM is using Opel as a springboard for global growth General Motors is using its German subsidiary Opel to spearhead its expansion into international car markets outside the US. While its domestic North American automotive operations have racked up four years of heavy losses, GM has opted to use its healthier European car business as its springboard for geographic expansion. GM Europe's agreement to establish a joint venture in India to assemble the Opel Astra is the latest move by the world's leading vehicle maker to gain a foothold in emerging car markets. Opel products have been in the forefront of GM's effort to set up assembly in Turkey and eastern Europe - the Astra small family car is produced in Hungary and production is due to begin in Poland. They are also leading the drive to build GM's presence in Asia. Assembly of the Opel Astra began in Taiwan last year, small volume production of the Opel Vectra family car will start in Indonesia later this year, to be followed by production of the Astra in India in 1995. Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president of GM's international operations and president of GM Europe, says the group 'has made a strategic decision to further internationalise and expand the Opel name and Opel products around the world'. The world's biggest carmakers all believe the Asia/Pacific region holds the brightest prospects for growth. Car sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years. According to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, GM's rival, 80 per cent of the world's population lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North America and Japan. The number of cars and trucks sold in these regions, however, represents only about 8 per cent of the global total. This view is confirmed by the latest study of world car markets by DRI McGraw-Hill, the London-based analysts, which forecasts that new car sales worldwide will rise from 33.2m last year to 42.5m in 1999, a near 30 per cent jump. The report cites South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe as offering the best growth prospects. For a long time US vehicle makers - as well as the Europeans - neglected Asian markets, allowing them to become largely the preserve of their Japanese rivals. Belatedly they are seeking to regain lost ground. 'We are number two in Europe and in Latin America and our sights are zeroed in on growth in Asia and the Pacific,' Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, told shareholders last week. While Ford has embarked on an ambitious strategy of merging its North American and European operations to try to eliminate duplication and lay the foundations for developing more so-called 'world cars', GM has chosen to lead its international operations from Europe with the aim of integrating its European, Latin American and Australian engineering activities. Most of the products to be sold in these regions, as well as in Asia, will originate from the Opel technical development centre in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt, and will be developed from the European product range. Mr Hughes describes the Opel Corsa supermini as GM's most international car. Already in production in Spain, Germany and Brazil and planned for Mexico, GM is also studying Corsa assembly in China and Russia. Apart from building a network of Opel assembly plants across Asia, GM is also increasing exports of cars from Europe. Opel is being used as the group's main marque in Japan, where GM has set a target of selling 100,000 cars a year by 2000. It has taken advantage of the conflict between the Volkswagen group and Yanase, the VW/Audi importer in Japan, to win over the Yanase dealer network for Opel. Sales of Opel cars in Japan jumped last year to 17,042 from only 1,371 in 1992. By contrast VW/Audi sales plunged to 24,878 from 42,083. 'In the last four to five years Opel has gone from being very much a Europe-oriented carmaker to an international company with global export sales and local assembly and manufacturing,' says Mr Peter Hanenberger, GM Europe vice-president for design, product and manufacturing engineering. Signs are also emerging that GM eventually plans closer co-ordination between Opel and its North American automotive operations. GM Europe is developing a version of its new Opel Omega executive car for sale in North America under the Cadillac brand name. This will be the US carmaker's first substantial export of cars from Europe to North America since the early 1960s, and the first European-produced GM car to be sold under a North American nameplate. The process can also happen in reverse. GM is planning for the first time to export to Europe a version of its next generation US-produced MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Espace. According to Mr Smith, the programme for a European-produced Cadillac is 'one of the most significant international projects GM has undertaken . . . It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GM's 'world cars': Production/assembly of Opel cars in emerging markets:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Corsa:      Astra:                        Vectra: Existing:    Brazil      Hungary, Taiwan, S Africa,    Brazil, Turkey,                          Turkey                        Egypt,                                                        Malaysia Planned:     Mexico,     Poland, India, Thailand,      Indonesia,                          Indonesia,                    Thailand.

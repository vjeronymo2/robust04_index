			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Lira falls in the wake of corruption allegations INVESTORS reacted swiftly to the growing politicial strains in Italy yesterday, with sharp falls in the lira and share prices. Government bond prices also dipped as analysts warned of greater political uncertainty in the wake of new leaks about alleged illegal payments by the security services to government ministers. The allegations, which have been widely reported this week, forced President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to make a surprise television address to the nation on Wednesday night. The President, who has so far remained largely immune to the corruption allegations which have cut through the political establishment, denied any involvement in illegal activities. Leaked testimony from senior members of the security services now helping magistrates with their inquiries suggests that money was illegally channelled to some cabinet ministers over a period of years. Mr Scalfaro is a former head of the interior ministry, which is in charge of Italy's secret service. Senior politicians yesterday rallied round the President in an attempt to shore up one of the few political institutions still commanding widespread respect. However, their action failed to stop heavy share sales and a sharp fall in the value of the lira, which only recovered slightly in the afternoon. The lira fell to L970.63 against the D-Mark and L1,641.14 against the dollar, compared with L965.06 and L1,636.74 respectively on Wednesday. On the Milan stock exchange, share prices dropped by almost two per cent. The latest uncertainty comes at a difficult time for the Ciampi government, which is fighting to win parliamentary approval for the 1994 budget.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Chao, affiliated with the History Institute </F> of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences: "The Early Spread of  Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism in Xinjiang and Yang Zengxin's  Responses"--edited by Qi Qingshun]    [Text] Early this  century Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism were very active  internationally, and Xinjiang was also affected directly or  indirectly. At the time the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism into Xinjiang had already aroused vigilance on the  part of Yang Zengxin, then governor and military commander of  Xinjiang Province. He regarded the infiltration as a potential  threat to stability in Xinjiang, and adopted preventive,  restrictive, and crackdown measures, which played some role in  maintaining social stability in Xinjiang.  <H6>  I </H6>   Pan-Islamism is also translated as Greater Islamism, and was  founded by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. During the middle of last  century, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani began to have Pan-Islamic  ideas. He advocated uniting believers of Islam, reinvigorating  Islam, and resisting Western colonialism's influence on the  politics, economics, and culture of the Islamic countries. At  the time such ideas had some progressive role to play in  opposing the colonialist aggression carried out by Western  powers. However, such supranational, suprastate, and supraclass  narrow religious views were later used by feudal autocratic and  imperialist forces as their ideological tools for carrying out  aggression in the relevant regions.    The most devoted promoter of Pan-Islamism was Abdul Hamid II  of the Ottoman Empire (the predecessor of the Republic of Turkey  and commonly called Ottoman Turkey). He came to power through a  coup in 1876. As the head of government he proclaimed himself  "sultan," and as a religious leader he proclaimed himself  "caliph," practicing theocratic feudal rule. But the size of his  realm was no longer comparable to that in the past. The purpose  of his effort to promote Pan-Islamism was to try to bring  believers of Islam all over the world under the rule of the  sultan and caliph of the Ottoman Empire, so as to relive the  historical experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past which  had stretched across the three continents of Europe, Asia, and  Africa.    Pan-Turkism has often been mistranslated as the doctrine of  Greater Turkey. The ancestor of Turkey was a Turkic tribe which  moved westward during the Middle Ages; the chief of that tribe  was Osman. The Osmani Turks moved from Central Asia to Western  Asia, and gradually became the Turkish nation through  assimilating local peoples. Pan-Turkism advocated that Turkey  unite all turkic-speaking peoples, that is, to establish a great  Turkic empire headed by Turkey, stretching from the Bosporus to  the Altay mountains, or even from the Mediterranean to the  Pacific Ocean; obviously a large part of China's territory,  including Xinjiang, would be included. Pan-Turkism was the same  as Pan-Islamism, and there was no difference in essence between  the two. The aim of Pan-Turkism was also to relive the  experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past.    Ideas of Pan-Turkism originated among the Turkic-speaking  Tatars in tsarist Russia. Ismail Gasprinski was an early  representative figure of the effort to propagate Pan-Turkism. He  founded JOURNAL OF TURKMENISTAN in the Crimea in 1878 and  founded the journal TERCUMAN in 1883, calling on Turkic-speaking  peoples to get united. Each edition of that journal had  5,000-6,000 copies, some of which were brought from Central Asia  to the Xinjiang region.    By early this century propagating Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism had become an important component of the means used  in imperialist aggression. There were then as many as over 200  publications propagating those ideas. In 1909 the Committee of  Union and Progress of Turkey (called the Young Turks by the  Europeans) overthrew Hamid II and organized a new government.  Politically that government advocated constitutional monarchy,  and ideologically it made energetic efforts to promote  Pan-Turkism, allowing Pan-Turkic organizations to operate  openly. After the October Revolution many Pan-Turkic activists  infiltrated the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union. They  distributed tens of thousands of propaganda pamphlets, smuggled  firearms into the region, and tried to incite the  Turkic-speaking peoples to create disturbances; they were also  already having a impact on China's northwestern border  region--Xinjiang.  <H6>  II </H6>   Because of geographical, ethnic, and religious factors,  Xinjiang was all along coveted by Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic  forces around the world.    Shakhmatov and Kireyev, scholars of the Soviet Union, would  argue: Yakub Beg who invaded Xinjiang in 1865 pursued an  "adventurous, naked policy of Greater Islamism," and established  a "feudal khanate."[.sup]1[/] This view warrants debate. In  1865 Pan-Islamism was in its infant stage. It was in the 1890s  that Pan-Islamism came to be given attention and exploited by  Hamid II, sultan of Ottoman Turkey. However by that time Yakub  Beg and his aggressor regime had already been buried by the  Chinese people. It should be said that Yakub Beg exploited Islam  in invading Xinjiang but did not start the effort to promote  Pan-Islamism (i.e., Greater Islamism).    Based on the historical data now available, generally it can  be argued: During the period from the late 19th century to the  early 20th century, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism began  to be propagated in Xinjiang. The main manifestation was that  Gasprinski's Pan-Turkic journal TERCUMAN had reached Xinjiang.  In 1908 Maolamusha Sailami [3029 2139 2607 3097 6357 2139 4717]  of Baicheng, Xinjiang, changed the title of his book A HISTORY  OF ANNING into A HISTORY OF HAMID (the Chinese translation was  YIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF YIMIDE) or HAIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF  HAIMIDE). He wrote in the preface: Hamid II is the leader and  great protector of all Muslims. As shown here, Pan-Islamism had  already had some influence on people of the religious community  in Xinjiang, but cannot be said to have already produced harmful  effects on society. It was during the early years of the  republic after the 1911 Revolution that harmful effects on  social safety in Xinjiang began to be produced.    When Yang Zengxin ruled Xinjiang in the early years of the  republic, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism infiltrated  Xinjiang in a substantial manner. The infiltration was  manifested in the following several ways:    1. Running schools. Under the flag of having a new kind of  school, efforts were made to instill ideas of Pan-islamism and  Pan-Turkism into the minds of adolescents. Ahmad Kamal, a  Turkish subject, run a school in southern Xinjiang, and Masud  Sabri, who had returned home after studying in Turkey, run a  school in Ili. These were two obvious examples.    In March 1914 Ahmad Kamal, 25 years old at the time, came to  Xinjiang on a tourist visa. When teaching at the Ottoman Unity  Force School in Istanbul, Turkey, two years earlier, he had got  acquainted with members of the Committee of Union and Progress,  Fuat Koprulu, Ziya Gokalp, Mehmed Talat, and others, who were  all active promoters of Pan-Turkism. For instance, Ziya Gokalp  later published the book Turkculugun Esaslam (The  Principles of Turkism). Mehmed Talat was a leader of the  Committee of Union and Progress. He led a secret organization,  the task of which was to propagate Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism  outside Turkey.    Toward the end of 1913, during their pilgrimage journey to  Mecca some hajjis from Xinjiang came to Istanbul, Turkey,  travelling in a roundabout fashion, and were received by Mehmed  Talat. At that time a member of the wealthy Husayn Bay family of  Artush, Xinjiang, proposed to hire Turkish teachers to teach in  Xinjiang, so as to improve the cultural and scientific knowledge  of Uighur adolescents. Mehmed Talat immediately realized that  this was a wonderful opportunity to have ideas of Pan-Islamism  and Pan-Turkism infiltrate Xinjiang of China; so he agreed to  the proposal right away and sent Ahmad Kamal to Xinjiang. When  Ahmad Kamal arrived in Artush around mid-February after leaving  Istanbul, he was received by Husayn Bay and Baha al-Din.  According to Buguozhai Wendu [The Correspondence of Yang  Zengxin] by Yang Zengxin, Bawuding [1572 0063 0002] and  Yiming'aili [5902 2494 5337 6849] of the local gentry hired  Ahmad as a teacher at Small Artush Village. The school was  divided into two or three parts which were situated in Beijie  and Genggongci. The scripture was the main subject being taught,  while such subjects as medicine and arithmetics were also  taught. In addition, according to Burhan: Baodingbayi [0545 0002  1572 0181], a wealthy businessman in Kashi hired Ahmad Kamal  from Turkey as a teacher, and built a school in Artush, which  was to exclusively engage in propagating Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism.[.sup]2[/]    On 19 April 1914 Ahmad Kamal opened a normal school in  Artush  with three classes, mainly admitting local elementary school  leavers at the age of 15 or older, including some children from  wealthy families. There was also a special class which admitted  exclusively those students who had learned some Arabic and  Persian from imams. In addition to religion courses there were  also history, geography, art, and gymnastics courses. Teaching  materials consisted entirely of translations of Turkish  textbooks, and printing machines transported here from Istanbul  were used to print them. The journal ULU DIN was also printed.    Ahmad Kamal forced the school to accept the sultan of  Ottoman  Turkey as the leader and to regard the caliph of Ottoman Turkey  as the spiritual father, and only allowed students to sing  Turkish songs.[.sup]3[/] He used the school as a position in  the battle of propagating ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism,  and spread ideological poisons harmful to China and the Chinese  nation with regard to state and national identity, thereby  poisoning the adolescents.    Masud Sabri was from Ili, Xinjiang, and was born to a  wealthy  family in 1887. In 1904 he went to Ottoman Turkey to study  medicine. He came to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism in Istanbul. After returning home in 1915, he,  together with a few Turkish subjects, operated hospitals and  schools in Ili. When speaking to students, they openly advocated  the idea that "our ancestors were Turks" and that "our  motherland is Turkey,"[.sup]4[/] and other ideas, completely  deviating from the fundamental interests of the country and the  nation and thus becoming spokesmen of foreign aggressors.    According to Masud himself: he operated the Turan,  Deernaike,  and Dongmaihailai schools in Ili.[.sup]5[/] The usual  translation of Turan is now "Tulan." The Turkish Pan-Turkic  theorist Ziya Gokalp argued that Turan was the "great  motherland" of all Turks. The intention of using this term as  the name of a school in Xinjiang was very obvious. At that time  Yang Zengxin sent Prefecture Administrator Xu Guozhen to inspect  the counties in Ili. It was found out that schools there were  purely religious in nature, having no teachers of the Chinese  language. It was thus suggested that the situation "be rectified  immediately." According to later statistics: in the 1920s  teaching was carried out completely in Turkish in the eight  schools in Ili, with 28 classes, 68 teachers, and over 2,000  students. Only three of those schools offered Chinese language  courses. Those schools became important places used by Masud and  others for propagating Pan-Turkism.    The instances of foreigners' openly operating schools in  Xinjiang, especially in southern Xinjiang, were not isolated.  For instance, in 1915 Luxierwaner [7120 1585 1422 1354 1422], a  Tatar (customarily called tataer in Xinjiang),  secretly opened a school in Kuche; in 1916 Yakefu [3660 0668  3940] (also translated as Akububoke [7093 1655 1580 0130 0344])  opened a vocational school in Shache. In 1920 Imam Musuer [4476  4790 1422] of Turpan and others hired a Tatar Hasanmihaiyideer  [0761 2718 4717 3189 0044 1779 1422] and others to secretly open  a school; also a Turkish national named Ismail Haqqi was sent by  Ahmad Kamal to open a school in Hetian, etc. In those schools  some domestic and foreign forces propagated ideas of  Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, and selected and trained their  agents.    2. Using religious activities to propagate ideas of  Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism. There were imams teaching the  scripture in all the cities, towns, and villages in Islamic  areas of Xinjiang. Early this century this front was also  exploited by some Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces.    In 1917 Yang Zengxin reported to the Internal Affairs  Ministry that Turkish subjects were conducting rampant fomenting  activities in the name of propagating the scripture, posing an  unimaginable potential threat. The Internal Affairs Ministry  returned a telegram the next year, claiming that it had been  determined that the phenomenon of hiring Turkish subjects to  teach the scripture was widespread across all the counties. It  was also emphasized that "as Turkey and Germany are in an  alliance and as China has declared war on Germany, Turkish  subjects in Xinjiang will unavoidably carry out rampant cryptic  fomenting activities in the name of propagating the  scripture."[.sup]6[/] As shown here, the cryptic fomenting  activities carried out by some forces in the name of religious  activities had already produced some impact, arousing attention  from the central and local authorities.    Without authorization, some mosques and scripture schools  hired foreigners as Islam-propagating imams and teachers. Among  those hired, some abused their forums and cryptically advocated  evil ideas in the name of propagating the scripture and the  Prophet's messages. Many of those who attended the  scripture-propagating activities were seriously poisoned. In  launching a rebellion in Kuche in 1918, Maimaitielihan [6314  6314 6993 0500 3063] and others spread a rumor about the  reincarnation of Mohammed so as to incite the local Muslim  masses to a rebellion. In addition they used the slogan of "get  rid of the Hans,"[.sup]7[/] adopting an open anti-Han stand  and openly trying to evict the Hans. They were intentionally  trying to foment ethnic hatred and to destroy the historical  tradition of hundreds or thousands of years of the Uighur and  Han nationalities's coexistence, coprosperity, and joint efforts  to develop the border areas of the motherland as well as the  profound friendship between the two nationalities.    3. Conducting propagating activities targeted at ordinary  Muslims who went aborad on pilgrimage and who were worshiping at  mosques.    Each year around 10,000 people from Xinjiang went to the  holy  place of Mecca on pilgrimage, travelling there through India or  Central Asia. Some of those people would consciously or  unconsciously come to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism, and bring back various books and journals;  especially, those written in Turkish (the old script used before  the reform) were mostly easily propagated and spread in  Xinjiang. Some people also founded journals and wrote articles  in Xinjiang. The aforementioned Ahmad Kamal first operated  schools and published publications in southern Xinjiang, and  then came to Urumqi where he on the one hand propagated  Gasprinski's TERCUMAN, Jarullah's work Uzun Kunlarda Ruza  (A Young Man in the Long Days) and others, and on the other  hand devoted more energy to publishing the journal YENGI HAYAT,  of which 30 issues were published. Ahmad Kamal himself said that  the journal "has more directly, fervently, and candidly pointed  out the way for Muslims."[.sup]8[/] As reported, at that time  some people also founded the journal TURAN. In Xinjiang where  there was a severe shortage of reading materials in the  languages of the nationalities, the two journals produced  unusual effects on Muslim youths. Also Chief Imam  Abuduojiayidamaola [7093 0008 1122 0502 5902 1129 3029 2139] of  Kashi requested several times for the permission to publish  journals but the requests were rejected. Thus he put up  handwritten propaganda posters in mosques, and read those  posters to the masses, creating a large impact. Efforts were  also made to print and circulate the book A Concise  Biography of the Prophet Mohammed written in 1928 by Sabit  Damullah (who became the prime minister of the illegitimate  "Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan" in 1933).    In addition some foreign institutions and individuals and  consulates of foreign countries in Xinjiang also mailed and sent  propaganda material to some government officials. In 1917  Prefecture Administrator Zhu Ruixi of Kashi received letters and  documents from foreign Islamic leaders, which urged Chinese  Muslims to ally with Germany in the First World War. Surely such  letters and documents were not just sent to Zhu Ruixi alone. In  1918 the British Consulate in Kashi sent to the county  governments copies of the declaration by the governor of Mecca  which called on the Arabs to shake off alien rule and achieve  independence. All this constituted indirect and cryptic  fomenting efforts targeted at the Muslim masses, and the  intention involved was to create division and turmoil so as to  harm the country.  <H6>  III </H6>   The infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into  Xinjiang aroused attention from Yang Zengxin from the very  beginning. In order to maintain social stability in Xinjiang and  safeguard his position as the ruler as well as national  security, he adopted some preventive, restrictive, and punitive  measures, producing some effects.    First, during the First World War, Turkey sided with Germany  and exploited Pan-Turkism in carrying out aggression against  other countries. After China severed her diplomatic relations  with Germany, Yang Zengxin gave even greater attention to the  activities of German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang. He  ordered a check on German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang, and  took different actions on the different cases after facts were  ascertained.    In 1915 Magistrate Xiao Jianzhang of Shufu County reported  that Ahmad Kamal was serving as a teacher at Small Artush  Village. Yang Zengxin immediately checked the person's  background, and at the same time reported to the Foreign  Ministry of the Northern Warlord Government. He argued that as  the European war was now going on, Turkish subjects were enemy  aliens, and that if strict preventive and restrictive measures  were not taken, they would unavoidably try to confuse and poison  the minds of local people. "This will not only have harmful  effects on diplomacy but also unavoidably pose a potential  threat to China."[.sup]9[/] Consequently he ordered the  closing of the elementary school run by Ahmad Kamal, and  imprisoned the people involved. Although the school was later  permitted to operate, it was explicitly stipulated that there be  no manifestations of loyalty to Turkey and that Chinese language  courses be offered. After being imprisoned for two years in  Urumqi, Ahmad Kamal was repatriated to Turkey vie Shanghai in  1919. Those moves undoubtedly dealt a severe blow to the  Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces which had infiltrated Xinjiang.    In August 1916 Magistrate Liu Rentan reported that a Turkish  subject Yakefu established a so-called vocational school, again  arousing vigilance on the part of Yang Zengxin. He issued to his  subordinates an order that Turkish subjects be prohibited from  being hired as teachers and that Turkish subjects be prohibited  from opening schools. As a result the authorities banned all the  schools in such places as Kuche and Turpan which had been found  to be using foreigners to do the teaching.    In February 1917, after learning that the Chinese Government  had severed her diplomatic relations with Germany, Yang Zengxin  immediately ordered a check on Turkish subjects in Xinjiang.  Those who were engaged in legitimate business activities were  given effective protection after the number of people, the  businesses in which they were engaged, and the amount of  property were ascertained; those propagating and teaching the  scripture were prohibited from serving as imams, but were to be  given effective protection, and were barred from leaving the  country for the time being; as it was difficult to make sure  that illegal businessmen and those who had, in an unauthorized  manner, come to Xinjiang without tourist visas were not spies,  strict precautionary measures were to be taken, and when  necessary, it was permitted to detain those people, who would  then be prohibited from leaving the country before their  identities were ascertained. Yang Zengxin reported to the  Internal Affairs Ministry, stating that If not being subjected  to special restrictions, the Turkish subjects hired as imams in  Xinjiang could pose a threat in various ways, and requesting  that the Internal Affairs Ministry approve the continuation of  the ban on Turkish subjects' propagating and teaching the  scripture. The Internal Affairs Ministry returned a telegram to  give its approval, while pointing out: "The matter involves  local public order and is therefore not a light matter. It is  necessary to conduct a check and impose a ban."[.sup]10[/]    In March Yang Zengxin gave his subordinates an order that if  German or Turkish subjects were found in any place in Xinjiang,  facts about them be ascertained, and they be detained on the  spot and prohibited from having contacts with local people. At  the time intelligence reports showed that seven Turkish  subjects, carrying a huge amount of money, were going to travel  from Gansu to Xinjiang in order to establish contact with  Muslims. Yang Zengxin immediately sent telegrams to magistrates  of the counties of Yanqi, Weili, Qiemo, and Ruoqiang, asking  them to check the situation and take precautionary measures; at  the same time he ordered a calvary force led by Company  Commander Zou Weixin to move from Korla to Ruoqiang, so as to  prevent Turkish subjects from secretly travelling to Xinjiang  from Dunhuang.    In April the provincial government instructed each of the  relevant county magistrates in southern Xinjiang to submit a  report on the number of Turkish subjects living in the county.  It was emphasized that Turkish subjects should keep themselves  engaged in their own businesses and be prohibited from  travelling to all the places to get involved in fomenting  activities. Those who had lived in China for many years and who  had not violated the law should be regarded as local residents,  and those who had not gone through the procedure for acquiring  Chinese citizenship should go through such citizenship procedure  now, thereby becoming permanent Chinese citizens.    Yang Zengxin's check on the Turkish subjects who lived  permanently or temporarily in Xinjiang and the Turkish subjects  whose identities were unclear and whose behavior was suspicious  lasted two or three years, resulting in some crackdown and  restrictive effects on the activities of some lawless elements.    Second, Yang Zengxin realized that Xinjiang was in a unique  geographical position, and thus paid great attention to the  influence on Xinjiang exerted by some Central Asian countries  bordering on Xinjiang.    In 1916 Yang Zengxin said in his report to the Northern  Warlord Government: "Xinjiang is alone, situated outside the  Great Wall. It is bordered by Russian territories to the  northeast and British India to the southwest. Without exception,  there are foreign businessmen and residents in each of the 40  counties of Xinjiang. As many foreigners have come, any error in  dealing with them would immediately lead foreign countries to  intervene diplomatically."[.sup]11[/] An increasing number of  foreigners, especially Turkish subjects and people of British  India, entered the country from Afghanistan. In order to  strengthen defense forces, Yang Zengxin decided to send forces  stationed at the provincial capital to provide support. Thus as  ordered, an army calvary force led by Ma Fengzhang and Dou Juxu  moved to Puli County (Tashkurghan), becoming a garrison force  there. With regard to the aforementioned letters and documents  that foreign Islamic leaders had specially asked people to  deliver to the prefecture administrator of Kashi, he ordered  that the delivery people, together with the letters and  documents, be made to leave the country under escort. He also  issued a document to the localities, asking them to try their  best to collect and burn copies of the declaration by the  governor of Mecca that the British had distributed in Xinjiang.    In 1918 Yang Zengxin issued an order, banning unauthorized  establishment of places of worship and prohibiting foreigners  from using religious activities in places of worship for  carrying out sinister plots. At the beginning of the next year  he also issued an order to prohibit foreigners from serving as  imams, describing those Islam-propagating imams as a source of  disturbances. Their activities both had a religious element and  affected local public order. If the activities were not banned,  the potential threats posed by them could not be eliminated.    Third, while precautionary measures were taken against  foreign-originated ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism,  coercive measures were taken against local people who had  induced fomenting and deceptive propaganda from abroad.    In September 1925 Yang Zengxin instructed the prefecture  administrator of Kashi to impose punishments on Bawuding and  Yiming'aili of the local gentry, who had hired the Turkish  subject Ahmad Kamal as a teacher; the next year Masud Sabri was  arrested for operating a school in Ili to propagate splittist  ideas and was sent to the provincial capital Dihua (Urumqi)  under escort. He personally interrogated Masud Sabri three  times; Masud Sabri was released after being detained for one  year. Yang Zengxin used force to put down the rebellion which  Maimaitielihan and others instigated in Kuche through using  religious and ethnic slogans.    By openly resisting domestic and foreign hostile forces'  efforts to carry out, through exploiting Pan-Islamism and  Pan-Turkism, aggression against Xinjiang and activities of  instigating the division of Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin both  maintained his own position as the ruler and contributed to the  unity of the country and unity among the nationalities.  Nevertheless he was just a feudal bureaucratic warlord, and it  was impossible for the measures he adopted to fundamentally  suppress the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into  Xinjiang. After his assassination in 1928, ideas of Pan-Islamism  and Pan-Turkism got propagated in Xinjiang even more extensively  because of the changes in the international situation, quickly  getting Xinjiang caught in even greater turmoil.

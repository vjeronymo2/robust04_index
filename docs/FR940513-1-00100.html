			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Not more than 40 hours in any one week when school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Not more than 8 hours in any day when school is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; except during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour is extended to 9 p.m.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15-year-olds enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school days, and during school hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service establishments, and prohibits their employment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is proposing an exception from the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible hours and time standards for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as attendants in professional sports. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department suspended enforcement of the child labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations as applied to batboys/girls employed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional baseball during the 1993 baseball season, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently extended the policy to attendants in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional sports while reviewing such employment under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the child labor regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1986 and 1987, the Department conducted a study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the request of the Congress <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to determine whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in the permissible hours of employment for batboys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and batgirls would be detrimental to their well-being and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether any changes to existing standards should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. The Department concluded that changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible hours and time standards for batboy/girl work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be detrimental to their health and well-being.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department surveyed 157 professional league baseball  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teams and conducted selected on-site interviews with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents, teachers, team owners, and batboys/girls and found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that youths genuinely enjoyed the experience. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department could find no evidence that school grades were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affected by such work. The Department also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advised the Congress that regulatory modifications, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than legislative change, would be the best vehicle to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the matter of permissible hours for batboys/girls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See section 801, Public Law 99&hyph;425 (September 30, 1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in 1987 to provide advice and guidance in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of possible proposals to change existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, recommended that existing hours and time of work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards be retained for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sports attendants, including batboys/girls; and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work performed in such activity be limited to traditional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duties, i.e., putting out and taking in field equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> running errands for players, and supplying the umpire with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balls. While the Committee's advisory view was taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration, the Department also continued to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other pertinent information, including inquiries received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from interested parties concerning the employment of youth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in sports-related activities, such as scorekeepers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concession stand helpers, ball monitors and sideline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials. One inquiry concerned conforming the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child labor regulations to a State of Wisconsin provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which permits youths under age 14 to be employed by high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schools as ball monitors and sideline officials at football  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> games. Another was received from the Grant County (Kansas)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreation Commission concerning 14- and 15-year-olds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed as scorekeepers and concession stand helpers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer softball, baseball, and other sports programs. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inc. (NAPBL) petitioned <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  the Department in June 1993 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise the regulation to permit the employment of 14- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15-year-olds as batboys for professional baseball clubs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the NAPBL, existing hours and time-of-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards effectively preclude baseball teams from lawfully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employing youth under the age of 16. The NAPBL contended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further that such employment is not adverse to the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and well-being of youth and that the denial of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> batboy/girl experience is inconsistent with the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FLSA's child labor provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 570.38 of the regulations provides that persons desiring revisions of subpart C of part 570 may submit in writing to the Secretary of Labor a petition setting forth the changes desired and the reasons for proposing them. In response, the Secretary may either schedule hearings or make other provision for affording interested parties an opportunity to be heard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

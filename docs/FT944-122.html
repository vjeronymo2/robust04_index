			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Piggy-back race to replace the Topic screens Topic, the London Stock Exchange's 10-year old electronic bulletin board, was turned off last night, allowing fiercely competitive commercial providers to enter the business. The Exchange decided nearly two years ago that it no longer wished to sell screens which would carry the prices of shares and company news announcements. Instead, it announced it would allow two firms to compete to replace its Topic screens. In the end, the battle has pitted one of the world's largest information providers, Reuters, against both of the Exchange's chosen - and much smaller  -successors. Of these two, ICV, a London-based company owned mostly by its management, has emerged as the apparent victor. ICV has secured contracts for 6,000 positions of the 8,500 estimated Topic users, giving it 70 per cent of the Topic screen replacement market. It has placed screens at 80 per cent of UK equity market-making firms and 60 per cent of gilt-edged market-making firms. By contrast, Telekurs, a consortium owned by a group of Swiss banks, has about 1,500 screens. Market users say that it was the relative simplicity and resemblance to the familiar Topic that led them to choose ICV over Telekurs. Telekurs, they said, developed a product which tried to incorporate too many features and which appeared cumbersome. 'One of the things we found out was that a single product would never gain universal acceptance,' said Mr David Joyce of ICV. Instead, ICV has developed two products. One is a Topic lookalike and the other, known as Topic 3, is a more sophisticated offering with the capacity to produce graphics. This competes more directly with a new Reuters product. Officially, the race to succeed the Stock Exchange's Topic screens was not to be a race at all. The Exchange chose two potential providers, each of which was to serve a different end of the market. While ICV was to develop a product catering for smaller, retail-oriented firms such as private client stock-brokers, Telekurs was to cater to the market professionals. But it did not turn out that way. For one thing, Reuters, anxious to expand its share of the equity market information dissemination business, quickly came up with its own product, Equity Focus, capable of competing with both ICV and Telekurs. In addition, all three companies also realised that what was at stake was far larger than simply replacing Stock Exchange screens. That is because the company which leaves the most terminals in brokerages, investment houses and banks across Britain has the best chance of being able to 'piggy-back' other equity information services on top and become the provider of choice for an expanding industry. Mr Carl Kemp, of Telekurs, has stressed that 'Telekurs is in it for the long term'.</p>

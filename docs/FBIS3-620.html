			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Nigerian ministerial delegation led by Deputy  Foreign Minister Anthony Ani is expected in the Bakassi  peninsula, the border area in dispute between Nigeria and  Cameroon. The purpose of the mission is to verify the  Cameroonian assertion that the inhabitants of this 1,000 square  km peninsula, rich in fish and oil, have freely expressed their  desire in 1961 to be Cameroonians. According to the Nigerian  Government, over 90 percent of the inhabitants of this area are  Nigerians of the Efik and Idibo ethnic groups in Cross River and  Akwa-Ibom states. The traditional chiefs of these two states,  contingous to the disputed area, are expected to be part of the  delegation. This visit comes a few days after the visit paid by  the head of the Nigerian Army, General Chris Alli. Cameroonian  Communication Minister Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni spole to us  on the phone.    [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Minister, we have already  spoken to you this morning. Nigeria accuses Cameroon of  receiving French military support on the ground. What is your  response to this accusation?    [Kouomegni] There has always been a permanent Cameroonian  Army presence on the Bakassi Peninsula. This has always been  the situation. There is a Cameroon Navy base at Idabato, not far  from where the first contingent of Nigerian troops landed. At  any rate it cannot be said that Cameroonian troops have  intervened in the peninsula, they have always been there. In  the wake of the arrival of the Nigerian troops, we simply  reinforced the Cameroonian military presence on the Cameroonian  territory of the Bakassi Peninsula. That is clear. There are  not only Cameroonian troops there, but there is also a  Cameroonian administration because the area is part of the Ndian  Division, which has seven subdivisions headed by subprefects.  Three of these subdivisions cover the Bakassi Peninsula.    [Announcer] Mr. Minister, nonetheless, it would appear that  the French military presence has a dissuasive function.    [Kouomegni] That is totally false. So far, the Cameroonian  troops have not needed French help in the Cameroonian peninsula.  Nonetheless, I wish to state that we have a military alliance  with France and we have the right -- and it is our full right--  to call on the French when the need arises. This has, however,  not been the case and I do not understand why there is talk of  French presence in the peninsula. If the French wanted to get  there, it takes only 30 minutes from Yaounde. I think this  discussion on the French presence shows a lack of military  knowlegde about defense of that area.    [Announcer] Some indiscretions reveal that despite official  declarations, Cameroon has the intention of preparing for war  with its neighbor. What is your definite position on this  affair?    [Kouomegni] Our position is a dissuasive one, but it is also  a preparation for any possible action if that becomes necessary  since the French are our defense ally. However, I repeat, and I  am keen to point out, that on the ground so far there are only  Cameroonian forces. [end recording]</p>

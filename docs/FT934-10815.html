			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in the frame The share price of Thorn EMI rocketed for a second session, although both leisure and telecoms specialists continued to be sceptical on press speculation of a possible takeover bid by BT. Many preferred to believe the story from across the Atlantic that a US telecoms group was eyeing Thorn, speculation fuelled by US buying of the group's shares yesterday afternoon. They closed 23 ahead at 987p after turnover of 1.9m. Meanwhile, BT watchers were not discounting an aquisitive move in the near future, with one senior trader predicting that the move would come when BT took receipt of the Dollars 2bn-odd for its stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, due shortly. BT fully-paid shares advanced 4 to 469 1/2 p and the partly-paid 5 1/2 to 220p. The property sector saw a burst of activity as a number of features excited interest. Firstly, MEPC announced it was extending its US retail activities with the purchase of American Property Trust, a property unit trust whose principal assets are two shopping malls in the US, for Pounds 115m. Analysts welcomed the deal, particularly in the extra exposure to the US retail market and at an attractive price. NatWest Securities raised its net asset value forecast for the group to 440p on the back of the deal. MEPC shares jumped on the news but faded to close a penny down at 532p. British Land extended its debt profile through a Pounds 150m bond issue. The shares moved up 3 to 409p. The company, which is known to be on the acquisition trail, was one being mentioned in connection with Stanhope yesterday as speculation increased over the shape of its future financing. Stanhope had confirmed weekend press reports that it is considering a restructuring, and although there were few more details emerging in the market yesterday - other than the attention of an overseas investment group  -there was talk of some burgeoning dissent among shareholders. Under preliminary plans, existing shareholders could see their holding diluted to 20 per cent. Stanhope shares steadied at 36p. Barclays was the outstanding performer in the financials area of the market, with a buyer of 750,000 shares mainly responsible for driving the stock up 14 to 583p. Dealers said news of the US Supreme Court's decision to review California's unitary tax system, which they said mitigates against Barclays in the US, had triggered the upsurge. Legal &amp; General finished 2 firmer at 518p, after 521p, on exceptionally heavy turnover of 7.1m, with interest stimulated by an agency cross of 1.8m shares at 528p. Milk products group Northern Foods gained 4 at 232p amid talk of the unwanted attentions of a European competitor. BSN, the French food group and a frequently named suitor on the UK food scene, was one name being touted by dealers. Strauss Turnbull was also said to be recommending the stock. Northern is currently subject to a strong two-way pull in the market between those cautious ahead of the restructuring of the UK milk industry and those who consider some good opportunities opening up as a result. Leading oil shares showed resilience in the face of a steep decline in crude oil prices. British Petroleum was unaltered on balance at 352 1/2 p, while Shell Transport continued to attract overseas funds and moved up 6 1/2 to 718p on 4.2m traded. Pittencrieff climbed a further 37 to 473p as US investors focused on the US telecoms interests. George Wimpey was said to have suffered a downgrading and shed 6 to 167p. NatWest Securities upgraded its forecast for Ladbroke Group, the broker taking into account the betting and hotel group's share of a Pounds 55m dividend payment from SIS, the satellite service owned by the UK's leading bookmakers. NatWest is now looking for Pounds 153m for this year, an increase of Pounds 10m. The shares steadied at 172p in good turnover of 3.9m. In the face of high-profile sell notes, ICI nevertheless proved a tough customer and mustered a rally, adding 8 at 725p in reasonable volume of 3.6m. US interest was largely credited for the rise. Wellcome began to fight back, moving forward 15 to 690p. Sentiment was boosted by a company presentation at SG Warburg, its broker. Fisons relinquished 3 to 156p as UBS reduced its forecasts, trimming current year expectations by Pounds 10m to Pounds 100m.</p>

An  editorial reporet describing the content of the 12th lecture in  the series was published in the Political &amp; Social section of  the 7 January China DAILY REPORT, page 12.    The 13th lecture, which lasts for 25 minutes, is entitled:  "Further Strengthen Party Building According to the Requirements  of the 14th CPC National Congress," and is given by Dai Zhou,  director of the Propaganda Bureau under the Propaganda  Department of the CPC Central Committee.    The last lecture begins by underlining the important role of  the CPC in leading the Chinese people to establish a socialist  market economy and achieve the second-step strategic goal of  quadrupling the gross national product by the end of this  century. Therefore, Dai maintains, it is imperative to build  the party into a strong core of leadership in the great  undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Discussing measures for strengthening party building, Dai  stresses: Efforts must be made to persistently take Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the basic guideline in strengthening the  building of the party in accordance with its basic line.  Moreover, it is necessary to strictly handle party affairs to  consolidate a high degree of the party's unity organizationally  and in action.    Explaining the significance of party building under the new  situation of reform and opening up, Dai points out that efforts  should be made to improve the party's style of work, promote  clean government, and fight corruption throughout the entire  process of reform and opening the country to the outside world.  At 0830 GMT the lecture concludes by calling for continuously  strengthening and improving party building in the light of new  circumstances and problems as well as newly-acquired experience.</p>

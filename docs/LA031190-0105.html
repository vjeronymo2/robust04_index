			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENTERS ARE SPARED LOAD OF PAPER WORK TO FILL OUT  </P> <P> If your life does not permit ownership right now, you can draw some  satisfaction from ease of renting.  </P> <P> According to the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, the standard paper  work for moving into a rental unit includes two forms.  </P> <P> The application to rent asks for your name, Social Security and driver's  license numbers, address, reason for moving, phone number, references, previous  addresses, names of anyone who will live with you and emergency information.  </P> <P> Usually this serves as your credit application too, authorizing the landlord to  inquire into your employment, bank accounts and credit history. The diligence  with which this is checked varies widely among landlords.  </P> <P> As long as they are not discriminating on the basis of race, sex, etc.,  landlords then have the right to pick a tenant based on credit history. Being  the first to apply does not guarantee you an apartment.  </P> <P> Once your application has been approved, you will sign a month-to-month rental  agreement or a lease. This spells out when your rental term begins, how much  rent and security deposit you pay, when rent is due, what utilities or services  are included, whether pets, water beds or musical instruments are permitted,  and what happens if your rent is late.  </P> <P> Landlords, on the other hand, are expected to document their actions a bit more  rigorously. The association provides them with forms for notifying tenants of  rent increases, intent to enter the unit, house rules, eviction, demand for  rent or "performance" (meaning the tenant is breaking the rules and better  shape up), and other things. The owner has about 30 forms in all to wield --  not all of which are needed for every rental. Eileen Heyes  </P></p>

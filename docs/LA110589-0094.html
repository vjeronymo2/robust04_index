			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY SEEKS TO SAY A HOUSE IS NOT A DORM;  </P> <P> HOUSING: CITY ATTY. JOHN WITT'S OFFICE IS PREPARING A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW  THE CITY TO DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES A SAN DIEGO FAMILY.  </P> <P> Frustrated with ineffectual attempts to control college students who turn  single-family homes into "mini-dorms," City Atty. John Witt's office is  preparing a more drastic measure that would allow the city to decide what  constitutes a San Diego family.  </P> <P> Witt's office has drafted an ordinance that would divide single-family home  dwellers into "traditional" and "non-traditional" families, imposing parking  restrictions on groups of adults not joined by blood, marriage or adoption.  </P> <P> The city's community planning groups have endorsed a separate proposal that  achieves much the same purpose and are preparing to forward that proposal to  City Hall. Both proposals are expected to go before a San Diego City Council  committee Nov. 13.  </P> <P> Either measure, if passed by the San Diego City Council, is expected to spark a  court battle because the restriction on the rights of non-traditional families  flouts a 1980 state Supreme Court decision that specifically prohibits cities  from attempting to limit the number of unrelated adults who may live together.  </P> <P> But that is part of the plan. With the dramatic change in the composition of  the Supreme Court in the past nine years, the thinking at City Hall, and among  some community group leaders, is that now may be an opportune time to directly  challenge the court's ruling in "City of Santa Barbara vs. Beverly Adamson."  </P> <P> "Only (Justice Stanley) Mosk is left from the court that wrote that decision.  All the rest are (Gov. George) Deukmejian's appointees," said Chief Deputy City  Atty. Fred Conrad, who drafted the proposed city ordinance. "In an effort to  protect our sacred single-family zones, we would at least like to hope that the  court's inclination has changed."  </P> <P> The city proposal already has drawn opposition from building industry  representatives who worry that it might prevent groups of unrelated people from  buying homes together and from others who believe it is simply unfair. Even  among residents of neighborhoods plagued by the noise, parking problems and  declining property values caused by the proliferation of homes jammed with  college students, there is some hesitancy to back Conrad's solution.  </P> <P> "We don't live in an 'Ozzie and Harriet' society any more and, particularly in  San Diego, with the cost of housing being a critical issue, we have to create  definitions that allow non-traditional families" in single-family homes, said  Doug Case, chairman of the College Area Community Council, the planning group  for the San Diego State University neighborhood.  </P> <P> "If the issue is density, if the issue is parking, it should not make any  difference what the nature of the relationship between the people in the house  is," he added.  </P> <P> But others, who have lived through a decade of hard-partying students in their  formerly quiet, traffic-free, single-family neighborhoods, are ready to address  the problems with drastic measures.  </P> <P> "What we have now does not work," said Barbara Greene, another College Area  Community Council member, of the city ordinances and programs aimed at  mini-dorm problems. "The mini-dorms are escalating. The problems in this area  are so bad. Property values are going down."  </P> <P> Born of the enrollment boom at SDSU, the mini-dorm controversy is primarily a  clash of cultures between exuberant college students and aging single-family  homeowners who for decades have populated the neighborhoods near the  university.  </P> <P> As on-campus housing grew scarce in the early 1980s, and the residential  population around SDSU began retiring, more of the single-family homes put up  for sale were purchased by investors, many of whom rented the homes to groups  of college students. Today, there are about 500 rental properties in the  college area planning zone, Case said.  </P> <P> With the students came more cars than driveways could handle, and on-street  parking became more difficult to find. Some students simply began parking in  front yards.  </P> <P> Loud parties became more common, and absentee investors did not keep up some of  the properties they rented out. The students, who often lived in a home for a  year or less, were not responsible for maintenance either.  </P> <P> The problems, victims note, are not restricted to the SDSU neighborhood. In Del  Mar Terrace, residents complain that low-cost "Go Homes," five or six  one-person suites clustered around a single kitchen in one building, have  caused some of the same parking and nuisance problems.  </P> <P> "This isn't what you expected to have when you bought into a single-family  neighborhood," said Opal Trueblood, chairman of the Torrey Pines Community  Planning Group.  </P> <P> The city has responded with a battery of ordinances and programs, none of them  effective. In July, 1988, the Single Family Rental Overlay Zone ordinance went  into effect in the College, Del Cerro, Rolando, Navajo, Grantville, Allied  Gardens and San Carlos communities. The ordinance, which applies only to rental  housing, limits the number of people who may occupy a residence based on the  number of bedrooms, bathrooms and off-street parking spaces.  </P> <P> But enforcement of the rules is time-consuming and cumbersome, with a maximum  $1,000 fine allowable only after a court hearing. Overburdened city code  enforcement officers must take complaints, then determine the number of people  living in a home before enforcement proceedings can begin.  </P> <P> In 16 months, the city has corrected about half a dozen problem homes, said  Joseph Schilling, deputy city attorney in charge of code enforcement.  </P> <P> "They make so many trips out there . . . and then the semester changes, and the  kids move out," said Councilwoman Judy McCarty, whose 7th District includes the  College area.  </P> <P> "The whole issue is how do you prove, from a legal standpoint, who is living at  a certain residence," Schilling added. "Whether it's under SFROZ or this new  definition of family, you're going to need a zoning inspector to go out and  determine who lives there, and you can't."  </P> <P> The city followed the zoning ordinance with a civil penalties ordinance  allowing daily fines of $2,500 for flagrant violators; a "second response  ordinance" that establishes fines of as much as $500 against party hosts if  police must respond a second time to complaints of an unruly party; a good  neighbor program; a one-warning policy for loud parties that gives police the  right to shut down parties during the following year based on a single  complaint by a neighbor; and a boom box confiscation ordinance.  </P> <P> Throughout, the city has been hamstrung by the "Adamson" case, a Rose Bird-era  court decision that overturned a Santa Barbara court's injunction prohibiting  12 unrelated people from living together because of a city ordinance that  defined "family" as two or more people related by blood, marriage or legal  adoption.  </P> <P> The court ruled that cities cannot impose arbitrary numbers in family  definitions, stating that such ordinances discriminate against "alternate  families."  </P> <P> "Population density can be regulated by reference to floor space and  facilities," the majority wrote. "Noise and morality can be dealt with by  enforcement of police power ordinances and criminal statutes. Traffic and  parking can be handled by limitations on the number of cars (applied evenly to  all households) and by off-street parking requirements."  </P> <P> This year, the swelling number of complaints about mini-dorms led to a series  of hearings before the Planning Commission and other city officials, followed  by the demand that Witt's office develop a legal solution.  </P> <P> Conrad's simple ordinance change creates two family classifications for single  family homes. A traditional family would be two or more people related by  blood, marriage or adoption, as well as anyone placed in the home by a court or  under legal guardianship. Foster homes with fewer than six children would  qualify.  </P> <P> Non-traditional families would be two or more people who do not qualify under  those rules.  </P> <P> Non-traditional families would be subject to a new parking regulation requiring  an off-street parking space for each adult over 18 beginning Jan. 1, 1990.  Homes occupied by more than one traditional family would be subject to the same  requirement.  </P> <P> Conrad admits that the ordinance sets up non-uniform standards for traditional  and non-traditional families, but claims that it is legal and responds to a  longstanding, valid complaint of single-family homeowners. He acknowledges  that, for example, a traditional family with four teen-age drivers who own  their own cars would not be subject to the same rules as three unrelated  drivers living in the same home.  </P> <P> "We need relief of some kind from a pattern of conduct and living that is  typically that of our college students," he said. "That goes back to lack of  parental supervision (in the mini-dorms), any father figure or mother figure  who keeps the conduct within the bounds of propriety."  </P> <P> Conrad is equally certain the regulations will be tested if they are passed by  the City Council. "It would be naive to think somebody won't," he said.  </P> <P> The Community Planners Committee, a citywide advisory body composed of the  chairmen of the city's 31 community planning groups, has a different  suggestion. The panel last month approved a resolution asking the city simply  to enforce an ordinance still on the books that prohibits more than three  unrelated people from living together in a single-family home in neighborhoods  zoned for single-family use. Non-traditional living arrangements would be  allowable in other zones.  </P> <P> "What we endorsed was the idea of the city going back to the original  definition that was in 'Santa Barbara' and carrying that through to the state  Supreme Court again," said Trueblood, chairman of the Torrey Pines Community  Planning Group.  </P> <P> McCarty is also considering a suggestion to license rental housing like  businesses, forcing investors to conform to parking, noise and landscaping  regulations and face loss of the license if they do not continue to comply. But  McCarty said she would support the new family definitions if they can be  legally enforced.  </P> <P> "We've got to do something," she said. "I think (the ordinance) has  possibilities, but we've got to make sure we are within the spirit of the  Constitution. That means the Constitution, not Rose Bird's interpretation of  the Constitution."  </P></p>

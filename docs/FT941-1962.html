			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sacrificed on the altar of Europhobia Sir, What I have not heard or read about regarding EU enlargement is the unspoken perception in Europe that, if Britain were to succeed in holding the blocking vote at 23, it would later insist that an unalterable precedent had been created when others came to join. Four such applications are in prospect, so Britain would thereby have transformed the EU into a virtual free trade area, an outcome our partners know is the present government's real aim when it speaks of being at the heart of Europe. In that sense, we are a spear that will have to be deflected. We may just be able to delay matters until 1996, but at vast cost in credibility. Whatever happens, we will eventually be forced to have a referendum to determine our future one way or the other. Until we do so, we will have sacrificed what influence we have at present on the altar of Europhobia and be unable to defend any of our real interests.

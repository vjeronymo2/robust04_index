			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Up to speed once again: Volvo, the Swedish vehicle manufacturer, is thriving after the collapse of its alliance plans with Renault A year after the spectacular collapse of its planned merger with Renault, Volvo, the flagship of Swedish industry, appears to be in rude health. Last December, a revolt by Volvo shareholders and senior management over the merger plans led to the abrupt departure of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the man at the top of the company for more than two decades. The company looked isolated with its strategy in tatters and its future unsure. Yet within days, the Volvo share price began to climb and - despite fluctuations - it still stands more than 60 per cent above the level of a year ago. The company has been buoyed by a spectacular recovery in profits, with operating income jumping to SKr6.6bn (Pounds 660m) in the first nine months of 1994, compared with only SKr445m a year ago. It is an unlikely change of fortune for Volvo. The company had spent three-and-a-half years explaining that pressures in the world auto industry  -such as rising development costs, globalisation and overcapacity - meant that it could not survive alone. It needed a partner, said Mr Gyllenhammar, and Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, fitted the bill. The merger plans collapsed because shareholders and managers were concerned that Volvo had been undervalued in the deal, and that the partnership was turning into a takeover by Renault, a company that would still be under French state control. Mr Gyllenhammar condemned the critics of his vision as guilty of 'turning their backs on Europe and the world'. They had 'reduced the probability of Volvo's long-term survival', crushed the organisation and wounded the company, he said. A year on, Mr Gyllenhammar's condemnation of the failure of the merger looks hollow. Volvo has bounced back, energised by what many in Sweden see as an escape from Renault's clutches. The company is setting the pace as the European truck industry emerges unsteadily from recession. Its order book for trucks has doubled in the past 12 months and production of its Volvo brand trucks is running at a level 60 per cent higher than in the depth of the recession in mid-1993. Volvo car sales worldwide were 18 per cent higher in the first nine months of this year, and it has increased both sales and share in most of its markets from Europe to Japan and the US. The Gyllenhammar era was dominated by repeated attempts at diversification and alliances aimed at spreading the risks of operating in as cyclical a sector as the automotive industry. This included ventures into such disparate sectors as oil, food, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Now the focus is almost exclusively automotive, and the decks are being cleared of other interests. Deprived of the Renault option, 'it was not difficult to know that this was the best strategy for Volvo', says Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive. He is, ironically, the man brought in to Volvo in 1992 to head its non-automotive businesses while Mr Gyllenhammar concentrated on the alliance with Renault. Earlier this year, shareholders approved a programme that will: Concentrate on cars and commercial vehicles (it will also retain aero and marine engine activities). Strengthen the balance sheet. Regain control over the strategic operations in cars and trucks. Pursue an aggressive new product development programme, while raising its cost effectiveness and exploiting more fully the strength of the Volvo brand name. Swift progress has already been made on some of these aims. The group's non-automotive interests have been placed in a separate unit, called Fortos, with a divestment programme that should be complete by the end of 1996. Volvo's 44 per cent stake in Cardo, the Swedish investment company, 26 per cent stake in Hertz, the car rental group, and some other activities have already been sold off, raising SKr9.3bn this year. Divestment proceeds could quadruple once the sell-off of other non-core interests is completed. These include BCP, its food and drinks subsidiary, Alfred Berg, the investment bank, and a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies. The group's balance sheet is improving rapidly. Net debt was driven down from SKr14.5bn at the end of last year to SKr700m at the end of September. The group's equity-to-assets ratio has risen from 21 per cent to 30 per cent. Financial strength is crucial, if Volvo is to stand aloof from big alliances and mergers. The formidable cost of developing new vehicles alone has threatened before to be the group's undoing. 'We want to be sure we have the finances available for product programmes with all the options open,' says Mr Gyll. 'And if we want to do joint ventures or deals, financial strength is extremely important.' Over the year Volvo has regained full control of its car and commercial operations. The recent partial privatisation of Renault allowed Volvo to buy back the 45 per cent stake in its truck operations held by the French group. But while dissolving the alliance and launching the divestment programme have gone smoothly, Volvo is only gradually piecing together its new industrial strategy. To prepare its next moves, Volvo has undertaken one of the most ambitious benchmarking studies ever done in the auto industry. This will compare the company's practices with the most efficient among its competitors to bring its standards up to the level of the best. 'We have the challenge of plotting the position we want to be in in the year 2000,' says Mr Mats Ringesten, Volvo senior vice-president for corporate strategy and business development. 'We are going through the business from A to Z' The studies have shown that Volvo's average profitability has been 'OK' over the past two decades, says Mr Ringesten, but its performance has been erratic. The vulnerability has come from the sharp swings in sales volumes in the car business and from the impact of ill-timed and inefficient new product development programmes. For the short term, the outlook is positive. Volvo is benefiting from the tough cost-cutting programmes it was forced to implement during the recession, as well as from an upturn in its main markets and the favourable response to new car and truck products launched in the past two years. For the longer term, the strategies to reduce the vulnerability caused by its size and independence will not be finalised for several months. But a more aggressive direction is becoming clear - particularly in the truck sector, where Volvo has its main strength. The truck operations are poised to embark on a far-reaching expansion in Europe and Asia. The ambitious plans include a new range of trucks to allow Volvo to enter the European light truck market for the first time. The company is planning to establish a joint venture in China, that would add an Asian production centre to its three regional truck manufacturing operations in Europe and North and South America. Asia is Volvo's 'number one priority' in the geographic expansion of truck operations, says Mr Karl-Erling Trogen, chief executive of Volvo Truck. The way forward is more tricky in car manufacturing, where Volvo is one of the smallest producers in the mainstream car industry. 'We have a strong brand name,' says Mr Per-Erik Mohlin, president of Volvo Car, 'and the values of tomorrow are coming closer to Volvo in terms of safety and environmental concerns.' Volvo is strong in the 'family market', he says, but it must broaden its customer base to gain more 'pre-family' and 'post-family' buyers. Mr Mohlin believes this can be done by developing a wider range of products, based on two basic chassis platforms, rather than the three currently in use. 'We know it is possible to develop more cars from a single platform,' he says. 'The trick is to utilise common components but to differentiate the products.' According to Mr Ringesten, Volvo will still seek low-level collaboration with other companies, but without the 'corporate alliances with share swaps' involved in the Renault alliance. There is already one important partnership, a joint venture in the Netherlands with Mitsubishi Motors, to provide Volvo with a replacement for its current 400 medium car range in 1996. Mr Mohlin's task is to plot a cost-effective way of replacing the rest of the Volvo car range towards the end of the decade. It is the key to the group's future success as a focused automotive group - and it has eluded Volvo in the past.</p>

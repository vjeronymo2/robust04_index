			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: The survivalist's unholy Communion - Cinema ALIVE (15) Empire THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD (12) MGM Shaftesbury Ave MEDITERRANEO (15) Curzon Mayfair, Screen on the Green RUBY CAIRO (15) Plaza NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1 (PG) MGMs West End Before 'You are what you eat' there was 'You eat what you are.' The 1972 Andes plane crash brought cannibalism, man's oldest form of nouvelle cuisine, into everyone's sitting-room. Consuming your own kind turned from taboo to talking point; Piers Paul Read's book Alive became a survivalist's guide to anthropophagy; and now the film pours God all over the debate, suggesting that the diet of the 20-odd Uruguayans who crash-landed in an aircraft while flying over snow-topped crags to a rugger match in Chile was a Communion ritual in a world large with divinity. 'It's magnificent] It's God]' cries Nando (Ethan Hawke) from the final mountain peak of his trek to find rescue. God stalks the dialogue and imagery. And we begin with John Malkovich in stubble-bearded close-up as an ageing Andes survivor, purring thoughts of God into camera. We do not need all this nudging to see the miraculous in the story. The group's young saviour, Nando Parrado, came back almost literally from the dead. (He was counted among the corpses immediately after the crash). And what better argument to persuade Catholics to eat meat sliced from their dead friends than to invoke the cannibalistic implications of Communion itself. Alive the movie is thrilling whenever it allows the miraculous to breathe freely and does not strap it to a symbolist life-support machine. The crash itself may be the best ever filmed. You clutch your cinema seat while a crunching, booming soundtrack spins your stomach and the screen is a chaos of screaming bodies, snapping wings, and passenger seats (plus passengers) sucked through the gaping hole where the tail once was. Other visceral moments cling to the memory. An avalanche, complete with ear-splitting rumble and a high-speed tracking-shot that thunders us into the broken plane to overpower the survivors. (Is this the first snow-viewpoint shot in history?) And the camera's final, moving, preposterously inspirational swoop from icy crags to green valley as the team's rescue-trekkers sight salvation. The film itself has lows as well as highs. That Alive the movie would be a play-off between ripping yarn and religious fable we suspected. Co-produced by Disney, its quest for the family audience requires that the eating of human flesh is made to seem decent and even sanctified. Delicate scoops from a frozen buttock yield something resembling smoked turkey slices - even I would eat them - and no other body part is touched. The real survivors, we know, ate everything, including stewed-up brains, organs and intestines. With the lies of omission go lies of commission. Characters hanging off sheer cliff-edges and indulging in death-defying toboggan rides I do not remember from the book. Perhaps their Boy's Own hyperbolism testifies to director Frank Marshall's previous history as a producer/second-unit director for Master Steven Spielberg. Yet the greatness of the story itself keeps jumping up to trounce the trivial. With Marshall's young actors as good as their near-impossible challenge allows (too many characters for any one to be sculpted in depth), the ragged splendour of their ordeal finally becomes as elemental, all-conquering and ugly-beautiful as the landscape around them. We begin by regretting the injections of God and the shortfalls in realism. (No mistings of breath in supposedly sub-zero climes; no sense of vast acoustical space round the post-dubbed voices). We stammer brief protests at the cliffhanging hokum. But by the end the game of resistance is up. Alive has come alive with the sound of a great human story slowly condensing into a great human myth. ***** Charles Dickens left his last novel, The Mystery Of Edwin Drood, unfinished at his death. Enter posterity, bearing sackfuls of surmise. For 120 years the Drood-sleuths have tried to piece together the evidence. Young Edwin - was he murdered? His opium-crazed, jealous-in-love uncle Mr Jasper - did he do it? And what of Durdles and Crisparkle and Grewgious - who knows to what madness men can be driven by the burden of bearing wacky Dickensian names? Writer-director Timothy Forder knows all about wacky names as creator of the TV cartoon series Murun Buchstansangur. His film of Drood is the work of an animator fallen on live action. Actors, being less easily ordered about than sketches, can look helplessly two-dimensional if given the wrong carrots and sticks. Here Robert Powell's gaunt-necked Mr Jasper (a Carrot refugee on a stick), Glyn Houston's one-note, high-coloured Grewgious (looking as if someone should loosen his shirt collar), Jonathan Phillips's Drood (just a pretty face), Andrew Sachs's Durdles (not even that) somnambulate through the dim lighting, tension-free screenplay and mise-en-scene as wooden as the duty-Dickensian exposed timbers. Where are the Gothic frissons? Where the bleak, black sense of a Victorian era riddled with disguise and double-standard? In this wet squib of a film, I most enjoyed Freddie Jones as Mayor Sapsea: an un-dampenable actor here yawing and hamming as if no one has told him that the style du jour is plainspun recitative rather than Droodian grand guignol. Gabriele Salvatore's Mediterraneo won last year's Best Foreign Film Oscar: an honour traditionally conferred on movies whose plot and concept are simple enough for Academy members to grasp with one side of their brain while the other explodes under the unfamiliar impact of subtitles. Here are eight Italian soldiers stranded on a Greek island in the second world war. Helped by a broken radio and a bomb-destroyed battleship, they unwind into hedonism as the years pass. They form relationships with the local women and donkeys. The leader paints frescoes in the church. The squad's shy youngster falls in love with the village prostitute. In short they go native. When 'rescue' finally comes, it is in the shape of what seem to be the same short-trousered British Naval personnel who rescued the children in Lord Of The Flies. It is charming, but is it art? In a year that saw authentically mind-stretching 'foreign' films by Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Jacques Rivette, Bertrand Tavernier, this gentle, photogenic, all-human-life yarn could be an NC Hunter play transplanted to package-hols land. But then in a Hollywood Academician's life perhaps a little is as good as a feast. Anything would be a feast compared with Ruby Cairo. Miss Andie McDowell is going around the world piecing together clues that may lead to the rediscovery of her 'dead' husband (Viggo Mortensen), an international smuggler. But why are we the audience following her? It cannot be for suspense - there is none. It cannot be for comedy - nobody is laughing. And if it is for romance - Miss McDowell meets charity worker Liam Neeson on a wharf and then keeps re-meeting him - why do we need that other husband-hunting plot at all? Short answer: we don't. Long answer: director Graeme Clifford (Frances), writer Robert Dillon (Muscle Beach Party) and Miss McDowell (nothing interesting since sex, lies and videotape) had time on their hands in not-too-busy careers and thought they might knock off all available genres in one movie. Last and least, National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. Here the Lampoon gang, seizing and asset-stripping the Lethal Weapon series, add a '1' as if urging everyone to salivate at the thought of more. Most of us, after 80 minutes of this, will be crying out for less. Emilio Estevez and Samuel L. Jackson are the white cop/black cop heroes; there is many a stalled or tailspinning Airplane-ish gag; and writer-director Gene Quintano is trampled underfoot as the guest stars (William Shatner, Charlie Sheen, sexologist Dr Joyce Brothers, Uncle Tom Cobbley) try to leave the plane by the emergency doors.</p>

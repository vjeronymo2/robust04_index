			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KITCHEN CABINET: A TEMPEST IN TEAKETTLES: TREND IS TO FANCY  </P> <P> Every time I go back to browse through a cookware shop, lo and behold, another  brand-new teakettle has managed to squeeze itself into what appears to be a  parade of mismatched pots. And if I'm lucky I may even get the wonderful  opportunity to listen to the sounds of a whistling kettle, or enjoy a brief  whiff of facial sauna from it as it happily boils away on a demo stove.  </P> <P> On one visit, the leader of the band was a musical teakettle "singing" the  entire tune of, would you believe, "Tea for Two" (Metrokane stainless  teakettle: $130). The teakettle display is often a wildly eclectic collection,  ranging in design from Old English to country to ultra-modern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Teakettles  </P> <P> There's probably a teakettle to suit every taste and personality. In fact, even  when it sits on top of the stove, this hot item is a reflection of its owner.  Not just from the chosen style but whether the kettle has been kept shiny and  bright, or greasy and dull. So watch out, you may soon be judged according to  your teakettle.  </P> <P> Why are we suddenly being besieged by teakettles, or to be more exact, boiling  water kettles? Noted L.A. designer Gary McNatton of Motto company explained,  "Basically there were ugly teakettles, starting with the dull reds and  avocados. . . . They did not justify the new kitchens that were being built or  remodeled, not the thousands and thousands of dollars spent on these. Like  cookware, teakettles have become a status symbol. Alessi must have started it  all with its Michael Graves kettle, which I have and still like. The category  became something the world jumped on."  </P> <P> McNatton, who has a definite eye and likes to see things simplified and given  classic longevity, was asked to put his creative efforts into a new teakettle  for Calphalon. And so was born the Arrondi Teakettle ($110). The architectural  influence and very defined profile of this charcoal gray kettle puts it in  place with the sleek granite countertops and modern cooktops in sophisticated  kitchens, McNatton said.  </P> <P> Oval in shape and featuring a dramatic upward slant along with its  heat-resistant handle, the two-quart Arrondi kettle is made of heavy-gauge hard  anodized aluminum. "It's virtually impossible for a man to scrape off this  treated aluminum," McNatton said after being asked about aluminum  contamination, "but the big advantage is that it conducts heat evenly and water  boils rapidly in it."  </P> <P> One of the most important features in teakettles is cleanability, McNatton  said. He designed the Arrondi with a wide lid and opening so that the hand can  dig through the interior when cleaning. Another design factor is lid retention,  that is, the lid should stay in place when pouring. The Calphalon cover stays  in place at a pour angle of 180 degrees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stainless Steel Kettles  </P> <P> Next to glass, stainless steel is preferred by many for teakettles because it  hardly absorbs any flavor, so long as it's kept clean, of course. One of the  most difficult manufacturing processes involved is to give stainless steel a  highly polished finish. In order to achieve this, Bodum, a Swiss-based company  hand-makes its sparkling new Inox 18/10 stainless steel teakettle called Ottoni  ($150). Now going full steam ahead since its introduction, the handsomely  designed, Italian-made 2-quart kettle is favored for its long-lasting and  fast-heating copper bottom and its mahogany wood handle. The lid has a ball of  crystalline blue acrylic sitting atop a pyramid handle that doesn't come off  when pouring.  </P> <P> The Ottoni was designed by Carsten Jorgensen of Bodum, who also designed the  Bodum Teabowl Teapot ($150) in 1984. Chosen for the International Yearbook of  1987/1988, the conversational stainless Teabowl pot is handmade near Milan.  This pot has a spherical bowl and cone-shaped lid and accommodates a large tea  strainer for whole leaf or whole bunch of tea leaves.  </P> <P> Form following function is reflected in Rosti's Bubble Pot (from $45). Designed  by the late Ben Seibel in Switzerland, the Bubble Pot has a spherical or  "bubble" shape for maximum energy conservation on either gas or electric  heating elements. The 2 1/2-quart Rosti vessel is available in mirror polished  stainless steel ($50) and in colored finish of either enamel on steel or  brushed stainless steel ($45). The colors are slate blue, red, white and black.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Black Phenolic Handle  </P> <P> Conveniently lightweight, particularly for the elderly, the Bubble Pot features  an easy-to-grasp black phenolic handle that assures balance and safety and  stays cool to the touch. The lid attaches to the handle and can be easily held  in place when pouring or pulled back when filling. Also, the opening is wide  enough for cleaning accessibility.  </P> <P>  Soon to join the teakettle parade is the half-size counterpart of traditional  copper teakettles. Coppersource Halves Inc. is bringing out a trio of two-cup  solid copper teakettle for individual servings ($40). Available in Austrian,  Scandinavian and German styles, the charming teapots have stay-cool brass  handles. What's unique about these products is that they double as potpourri  kettles, each consisting of a solid copper warming stand with candle. Perfect  for warming aromatics to get rid of unpleasant scents in the kitchen.  </P> <P>  The Arrondi Kettle from Calphalon is available at Crown Hardware (Orange  County), Bullock's and Montana Mercantile.  </P> <P>  The Bodum Ottoni kettle is available at Crate and Barrel.  </P> <P>  The Rosti Bubble Pots are available at Robinson's and Bed, Bath and Beyond.  The Coppersource Potpourri Kettles will be available in the coming months at  Bullock's, Robinson's and Cookin Stuff (La Habra and Palos Verdes).  </P></p>

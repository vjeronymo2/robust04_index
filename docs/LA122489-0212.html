			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCIENTIST SAYS EARLY STATE MEDFLY ATTACK MAY HAVE LOST WAR  </P> <P> Faced with an infestation that won't go away, a leading scientist says the  government may have made a critical error in its battle against the  Mediterranean fruit fly this summer by ordering aerial pesticide spraying  before the true size of the pest population was known.  </P> <P> Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Medfly expert in Hawaii and  chairman of the scientific panel advising the current Medfly eradication  program, said the rapidity with which malathion-bearing helicopters were  launched may have, ironically, masked the true size of the infestation and  provided a false sense of confidence that the problem had been solved.  </P> <P> If the infestation in the Whittier area in October were as large as evidence  now seems to indicate, the spray might have killed only 90% of the population.  That still would have left enough of the pests alive to spread, Cunningham  said.  </P> <P> "We blinded ourselves with the bait spray," he said. "We must have had a  sizable population at the start. We did not appreciate that. Maybe in hindsight  it would have been better to wait and evaluate the situation" before going on  the attack.  </P> <P> Orange County has been doused twice with malathion in the last month. The first  aerial spraying on Nov. 30 followed the discovery of a single pregnant Medfly  in a guava tree in Brea. On Dec. 6, agricultural officials found three fertile  Medflies in La Habra Heights, and on Dec. 12, they resprayed a 26-square-mile  area that included parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton.  </P> <P> A Medfly was also trapped on Dec. 8 in Westminster, about 10 miles south of the  La Habra infestation. But officials decided not to spray Westminster now  because the trapped fly, while fertile, was not pregnant. Instead, they tripled  the number of traps to see if more flies appear.  </P> <P> The experts believe there are several reasons that the pest has been spreading.  These reasons include people carrying infested fruit out of the Medfly  quarantine zone. But Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California  Department of Food and Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry, said much of  the spreading infestation in the central Los Angeles area today emerged from  the Medfly hot spot in the Whittier area, found on Sept. 26.  </P> <P> That infestation zone was sprayed on Oct. 4, only eight days after the initial  find. By that time 61 flies had been found.  </P> <P> "We moved too fast," said Cunningham. He said the original population in  Whittier must have been very large, but no one will ever know how large because  of the speed with which treatment was begun. He admitted there is always a  danger that the infestation will spread while waiting.  </P></p>

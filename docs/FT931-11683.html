			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Major seeks to restore market faith in sterling: Further interest rate cuts ruled out - Downing Street denies division over policy MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday moved to damp expectations of further cuts in UK interest rates as the government mounted a concerted campaign to restore confidence in sterling, economic policy and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. With the pound under downward pressure on the foreign exchanges, Downing Street, the Treasury and the Bank of England sought to reassure markets that Mr Lamont was in full charge of economic policy and that there were no splits with the prime minister over interest rates. Sterling plunged to a historic low of DM2.3550 in yesterday's far east trading after weekend press reports of a split triggered a sharp burst of speculative selling. The pound recovered slightly in London to close at DM2.3800, more than a pfennig down from last Friday's close. In New York it made further gains, finishing at DM2.3876. Measured against the Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index, the pound ended sharply lower at 77.4. The index, which is monitored by the chancellor as a guide to the currency's strength, fell to a record low of 77.3 yesterday morning from 78.2 on Friday night. In a day which saw continuing tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism following the devaluation of the Irish punt, British economic policy was assailed by Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. Mr Sapin criticised the UK for failing in its obligations to the EC. 'Britain has no right to run a policy on the lines of 'I'll try to save myself and too bad for the rest of you'. Especially as it isn't working,' Mr Sapin said. However the UK authorities insisted that last week's one percentage point cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent was consistent with the government's target of returning to economic growth with low inflation. In a speech to the Overseas Bankers' Club in London, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, said he had supported the rate cut for this reason. For the second day running, Downing Street denied weekend reports that Mr Major was the driving force behind the rate cut and was seeking an eventual reduction in interest rates to 4 per cent. A Downing Street official said the decision last week to cut base rates to 6 per cent had been proposed by Mr Lamont. Doubts continued, however, among Conservative MPs at Westminster over the political authority of Mr Lamont amid widespread expectations that he will be moved by the prime minister after the March 16 Budget. Speculation about differences between Mr Lamont and Mr Major has been fuelled by the prime minister's decision to take a closer involvement in Treasury policy in the run up to the Budget. The chancellor has long been regarded as more cautious on interest rate cuts. But government officials suggested that yesterday's developments would make further rate cuts less likely. Downing Street said the weekend reports of Mr Major wanting big cuts in the cost of borrowing had backfired because of their impact on the pound. 'The one thing that damages the likelihood of interest rate cuts is talking about interest cuts,' it said. Separately, aides to Mr Lamont made clear that he does not regard further cuts in the cost of borrowing as likely before the Budget. 'Interest rates are as likely to go up next as they are to go down,' they said. Government officials pointed out that there has already been a substantial loosening of policy since sterling left the ERM in September and that the effects of this have still to work through fully to the economy. The Treasury pointed out that 1m households will gain this month from a three percentage point fall in mortgage rates that are set annually and that more households will benefit in this way in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the government said that it believed the recent turmoil on currency markets, renewed by the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt, was strengthening Britain's hand in its attempts to reform the ERM.

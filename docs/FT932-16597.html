			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Turned inside out The conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie for insider dealing has reopened anxieties about legislation in this area, due back in parliament after Easter. The Mackie case appears to confirm the view that insider laws trap those undeserving of punishment while the real miscreants walk away scot free. Mr Mackie was not acting for personal gain. But on his advice, clients of Bell Laurie White were saved losses in Shanks &amp; McEwan. Is that just a good analyst doing his job? Those who were not privy to the same information might reasonably think otherwise. The case shows how easily the cosy relationships between companies, brokers' analysts and large investors can fall foul of the existing law. It could be a lot worse under the new legislation which so broadens definitions that even apparently innocuous information may be deemed illicit. Still, analysts' worst fears look unfounded. They are unlikely, for example, to be prosecuted for circulating market-moving forecasts to their clients. Were that the spirit of the age, there would be more prosecutions under existing legislation. The real danger is that some companies will use the new legislation as an excuse to clam up, except on set-piece occasions such as annual results. That would be a pity. The more information in the public domain, the less insider dealing is a problem. Truly skilful analysts can then work out what it all means, just as they must now interpret more detailed financial information under the new accounting standards. Mr Mackie may have thought he was doing his job. But there would have been no confusion over confidentiality - and no need to prosecute - if Shanks &amp; McEwan had issued a profits warning the moment it realised earnings fell short of expectations.</p>

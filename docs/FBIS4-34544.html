			<p>BFN     [Text] Barbadians will go to the polls on 6 September this  year. Governor General Dame Nita Barrow made the announcement on  Saturday. The election announcement followed several days of  widespread speculation on Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford's  political future after he lost a no-confidence motion on the  seventh of June. Opposition Barbados Labor Party leader Owen  Arthur welcomed news of the poll, saying there was no way the  country's political crisis could go on any further.    [Begin Arthur recording] A deep and bitter division within  the Democratic Labor Party as regards the best person to succeed  Mr. Sandiford in the event that he has stepped down. [Words  indistinct] had a person been appointed in his place could have  called herself the [word indistinct] administration. That could  not work. [Words indistinct] Barbados have been spared the agony  of having a government that is unworkable and could only cause  anarchy. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Mr. Arthur added that his party is ready,  willing,  and able to contest the elections and he also commented on the  political future of (MP DeLyle Bradshaw) who missed the vote on  the no-confidence motion.    [Begin Arthur recording] [Passage indistinct] rules is a  democratic institution and our rules require that Mr. Bradshaw  should be given the opportunity to answer to the party and to be  tried in its presence if there is to be a trial. That process  has not yet been gone through and therefore, I am not going to  say anything that would be prejudicial to the case that Mr.  Bradshaw may put, or would be prejudicial to the question as to  whether or not he would be a candidate.

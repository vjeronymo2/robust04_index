Serve as staff to the PAC. Complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment processes; implement the case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant. Maintain necessary case files on each program participant, containing such information and kept in such form that HUD and FmHA shall require. Provide the files to PAC members upon request, in connection with PAC duties; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Monitor the ongoing provision of services from community agencies and keep the PAC and the agency providing the supportive service informed of the progress of the participant; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Educate grant recipient's program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability, and program participant options and responsibilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Assist the grant recipient to build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Educate other project management staff on issues related to ``aging-in-place'' and services coordination, to help them to work with and assist other persons receiving housing assistance through the grantee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) For a Service Coordinator obtained under contract with a case management agency, the contract must include provisions containing, at a minimum: beginning and end dates of the contract; number and responsibilities of staff provided by the agency; rates of pay/costs of services to be provided; location of offices, and an agreement to provide HUD and FmHA access to the files; and other documentation pertinent to the Congregate Housing Services Program. Any contracts awarded or purchases made under this subsection by grantees that are public bodies must conform to the policies and procedures stated at 24 CFR 85.36. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) (1) Each frail elderly person, person with disabilities and temporarily disabled individual tentatively selected by the grantee must be assessed for degree of functional incapacity before being accepted into the Congregate Housing Services Program. The assessment is performed by a voluntary PAC, which handles the individual's entrance into and the transition out of the Congregate Housing Services Program, development of case plans for that person, and regular reassessment of the individuals in the program. PAC members may not be paid with Congregate program grant funds, but if the duties and responsibilities of the PAC are discharged by a community agency, the agency's costs may be counted as matching funds for any time spent on assessments after the initial approval of program participants, if approved by the Secretary concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The PAC, upon completion of the assessment, must make a recommendation to the Service Coordinator for acceptance into (or denial of acceptance into) the Congregate Program. In the case of an acceptance, the PAC must provide a case plan for each eligible resident. Once an individual is accepted into the CHSP it is the responsibility of the Service Coordinator to tailor the case plan to the needs of that participant, and to work with community agencies, the grantee and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory basis, in accordance with the plan. Before actual acceptance into the Congregate Housing Services Program, the eligible resident must work with the PAC and the Service Coordinator in developing his or her supportive services plan. Acceptance of any services under the plan by the program participant is voluntary. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into consideration the participant's needs and wants and must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain independence. If participants want other services, they can buy them at cost, if available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> .225 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Professional Assessment Committee (PAC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A professional assessment committee, under paragraph (b) of this section, shall identify eligible project residents and shall designate services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident. The committee shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process and a right of appeal of the determination of eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records. A professional assessment committee under this section shall consist of not less than three individuals, who shall be appointed to the committee by the officials of the eligible housing project responsible for the congregate services program. It shall include at least one qualified medical or other health professional and social services professionals competent to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals in relation to the performance of tasks of daily living.

At least one PAC member shall not have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee. No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing services under the grant. If a case management agency provides the service coordination, the agency may not be affiliated with the organization providing supportive services under the grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

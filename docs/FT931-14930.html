			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Observer: Backs up Fur is flying with a vengeance in Chile thanks to central bank boss Roberto Zahler, who has rubbed up business chiefs the wrong way with a sobering speech. The best economic performance for three decades - GDP up by almost a tenth, private investment by nearly a third, and exports booming - has seen Chile likened to the tigers of south-east Asia. But with business chiefs preening themselves accordingly, Zahler has come up with what he claims is a more accurate image. 'Tigers are not born overnight, particularly if they have a long history of being cats, with the culture, habits and outlook of cats,' he declared. What's more, they weren't even well-balanced cats, but manic-depressives responding to one good year with euphoria only to wilt in despair at a single poor economic indicator. The country's media have reacted angrily to his call for greater realism. Zoological treatises have been consulted on what sort of feline Chile resembles: cat, tiger or jaguar. Psychiatrists have expounded on the symptoms of manic-depression, which perhaps explains one top businessman's remark that the only cats with inferiority complexes are to be found in the central bank.</p>

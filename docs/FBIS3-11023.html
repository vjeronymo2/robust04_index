			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] With the alleged purpose of collectively defending  democracy and promoting economic growth while advancing on a  strategy of sustained development, the United States will hold a  so-called Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida. According  to the official announcement made by President William Clinton  himself, the meeting will be held in early December with the  conspicuous absence of an invitation to the Cuban Government.    The meeting will call for the creation of a mechanism  capable  of promoting George Bush's so-called Initiative for the Americas  which seeks to open new inroads for U.S. capital and for filling  the gap that -- for obvious reasons -- the United States cannot  fill by way of the Ibero-American Summits. Through a consensus  of the participants, the three Ibero-American Summits reached  common stands on certain issues based on mutual respect and the  sovereign rights of each nation. By virtue of its own right and  by invitation of the organizers, Cuba has attended these  Ibero-American Summits. This has disturbed the power brokers in  the United States who insist on isolating the Cuban Government.    The U.S. authorities are highlighting the fact that Cuba has  been excluded from the Summit of the Americas guest list. No  one should be deceived as to the not-so-secret purposes of  giving the meeting a certain anti-Cuban flavor when economic  issues of the utmost interest to Washington are scheduled to be  discussed. We must not forget that challenges to maintaining  the U.S. blockade against the island are growing in Congress,  the executive branch, political institutions, the press, and  other spheres of U.S. society. Those who advocate tightening  the blockade do not like the steps taken by Cuba and its  neighbors on the subcontinent to establish commercial ties that  are mutually advantageous and encourage investments by Latin  American entrepreneurs on the island.    The venue for the so-called Summit of the Americas is very  suggestive. Naturally, one becomes very suspicious of the fact  that the city of Miami was selected, because this is a city  where extreme right-wing Cuban immigrants still control powerful  media outlets. We will wait and see what the definite agenda of  the Miami meeting, which will be discussed when Vice President  Al Gore visits the region, will be. It will not be easy for him  to find support for anti-Cuban maneuvers, if this is one of his  goals.</p>

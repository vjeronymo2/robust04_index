			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF GATHERS' DEATH BRINGS STRONG REACTION FROM READERS  </P> <P> After sifting through countless stories about athletes on drugs, lockouts,  point shaving and the like, it was always a pleasure to flip to the South Bay  section of The Times and find a story about Hank Gathers and the Loyola Lions.  I was looking forward to the day when news about Loyola would supplant that  about USC, UCLA and even the Lakers on the front page of the sports section.  </P> <P> It happened on Monday, but not at all in the way it was supposed to.  </P> <P> KEN KRUG, Redondo Beach  </P></p>

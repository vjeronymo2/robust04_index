			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Aguilar, Jesus Rangel, and Georgina </F> Tristan]    [Text]  <H5>  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] </H5>   Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, an active participant in the  construction of an economic model of "social liberalism"  Mexican- style, faces today the challenge of showing the  television and radio audience -- with politics and technocracy  -- how he will manage to help society through a confluence of  economic and social policies.    Within the PRI 1994-2000 Electoral Platform, the economic  chapter proposes strengthening an "economy of certitude" by  establishing the groundwork to expand production activities with  price stability. This is the starting point to "launch an  economic development strategy that efficiently and quickly meets  society's demands for welfare and justice, based on responsible  policies which do not threaten the essential balance of the  economy."    Thus, it rejects a populist concept of the state and states  that, within the processes for economic change and trade  opportunities, "the state cannot renege its responsibilities"  and it must maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and  guarantee opportunities for the free development of creativity  and social initiative.    The state must encourage savings and investments, broaden  regional infrastructure, support the modernization of small- and  medium-sized enterprises, sponsor the training of manpower,  pledge strict compliance with labor laws, and guarantee  favorable conditions to strengthen salaries. It terms as not  postponable the economy's reactivation to sponsor the prompt  creation of more and better jobs, to take advantage of stronger  finances to meet social needs, and to guarantee better  conditions for stability in the economy.    The platform proposes a redefinition of the foundations for  relations between federations, states, and municipalities for a  better distribution of resources; improving the allocation of  public funds; and increasing internal savings, "because a  healthy growth must not excessively depend on external savings."    The platform also proposes defending the purchasing  capability of salaries; improving the quality of public  education for work; increasing consultation with the country's  regions for an equitable development; sponsoring new plans for  fiscal coordination among federations and states; and  encouraging an active policy of investments in communication and  transportation infrastructure.  <H5>  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] </H5>   The PRD's economic platform mainly seeks to achieve an  economic growth with equity and to create a new social pact that  helps improve the population's standard of living.    To achieve the first goal, the PRD bases its position on  three issues: A development policy that is answerable to the  nation; a productive reorganization of the economy by sector,  region, and environment -- starting with an overall renewal of  agrarian and livestock activities; and the creation of a legal  and institutional system which guarantees the validity of  economic rights and equal opportunities for Mexicans.    To achieve the aforementioned goals, the party emphasizes  the  development of productive national and foreign investments, and  the discouragement of speculative investments, by adapting  internal interest rates to internationally competitive rates.    The PRD also suggests a revision of the tax system to  achieve  an equitable implementation of taxes. Thus, it would reduce  indirect taxes and public service fees, and it would abolish the  two-percent tax on assets.    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will propose during the televised  debate the ideas of gradually eliminating the oil revenues tax;  increasing social expenses; sponsoring a recovery and expansion  of the internal market and production enterprises; seeking a  definite renegotiation of the foreign debt; and regulating  economic relations abroad.    In the foreign economy sector, the PRD proposes a  renegotiation of the Free Trade Agreement which includes the  issue of manpower mobility, the exclusion of basic grains from  the agreement, the revision of rules of origin which affect the  automobile and spare parts industry, and a balance in the level  of subsidies to agrarian and livestock products, among others.    The PRD suggests revoking the unconstitutional reforms to  Article 27 and the exercise of the Mexican nation's full  authority on its oil resources.    Referring to the new social pact, [the PRD] seeks to reform  the Federal Labor Law and abolish Section B of Article 123,  among other measures.    The PRD proposes the reinstatement of a minimum salary, with  an emphasis on the increase in employment and productivity, and  it suggests that the National Congress determine the basis for  this.    In its political platform, the National Action Party [PAN]  proposes to reduce poverty, strive for balanced regional  development, create jobs, protect the freedom to create unions,  abrogate the taxes-on-assets law, stimulate industrial  development, break up the railroad enterprise, speed up the  financial opening, back up exports, legally protect foreign  investment, establish an agricultural and livestock model for  the 21st century, and encourage the private sector's  participation in all areas of the economy.    PAN proposes constitutional changes to restore the economy  with the people in mind, changes like amending Article 25 to  establish clearly the state's subsidiary role. The party  pledges to reduce the serious poverty of some 14 million  Mexicans through social education programs such as responsible  parenthood, hygiene, nutrition, fighting alcohol and drug  addiction, care of mothers and children, and allocating monetary  resources for the general development of Indian communities.    Also, the party proposes to abolish Paragraph B of Article  123 of the Constitution so all workers can share the same  rights; eliminate unnecessary fiscal burdens, such as taxes on  assets and payrolls; increase contributions for SAR [Retirement  Savings System].    PAN proposes to recognize the government workers' right to  form associations and join more than one union; restore women's  labor rights to be hired and paid their salaries without  discrimination.    The party proposes to launch a countrywide industrial and  commercial development program of property and services where  very small-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises would be given  priority attention.    Finally, PAN proposes to open the railroads to local and  foreign investment, separating them from the public sector, and  increasing the private sector's participation in infrastructure.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc unit hit Shares in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group which is majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc of France, fell 8 per cent yesterday as the company's most promising new drug application was rejected by US regulators, writes Richard Waters in New York. The Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee on cancer drugs voted to turn down an application to market Taxotere as a treatment for advanced breast cancer and some types of lung cancer. The application had been made under the FDA's advanced approval process, which is intended to by-pass some of the normal time consuming late-stage trials for drugs which are believed to have important medical benefits. The shares fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 38, having risen strongly on Monday in the expectation of a favourable outcome.</p>

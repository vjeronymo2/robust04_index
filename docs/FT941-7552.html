			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: A 1930s 'Boheme' - English Touring Opera A touring opera company has a special duty to seek out new audiences. For the past few years there has been a lively debate as to whether it is better to present the operas to them in an up-to-date and obviously relevant style or stay truthful to the composers' intentions - a dilemma to which English Touring Opera seems to have found a good working compromise. The new production for its spring season is La Boheme, which has just had its opening performance at Sadler's Wells, London. This is commonly referred to as a 'verismo' opera, though the term is hardly appropriate. Puccini may pretend to be showing us life as it really was, but his picture of penniless students sharing a garret in Paris one romantic Christmas in the 1830s is highly idealised. Producers today like to strip away the tinsel if possible and Thomas de Mallet Burgess is no exception, though such a limited budget for the sets (Martin Johns the designer) may have forced his hand. His Mimi and Rodolfo are not trendily poor, beautiful people. Mimi is a plain girl, who wears sensible shoes and has to put on glasses to look for her lost key. Her chubby Rodolfo, in a drab brown jacket and striped pullover, dresses for homely warmth, not to look the archetypal poet. All this makes it easier for the central couple to touch the emotions. Christine Bunning catches the awkwardness of shy Mimi, less convincingly her fragility, and sings the music strongly with unfailing, sure tone. Geraint Dodd is a husky-voiced Rodolfo lower down, brighter and easier at the top, which is a bonus in a British tenor. They play sensitively together. The dominant Bohemian is Adrian Clarke's Marcello, incisively sung, an honest sort of fellow who can look a friend in the eye when the going gets rough. Majella Cullagh matures into an appropriately serious-minded Musetta for him by the end. Jonathan May's Colline and Meurig Davies's Schaunard have to provide the fun, the latter with Hitler-esque moustache. Their scenes together go nimbly under Martin Andre's lightweight direction. The reference they make to Hitler is meant to have a point. The production has shifted the period forward a century to the 1930s, though not for any obvious reason. A lot of play is also made over the Parisian locale, with army officers and gendarmes roaming the streets. Quite why a nun should drop in for an evening of transvestite fun at the Cafe Momus I do not know, but never mind. The production has given us believable people who could live anytime, anywhere, and that is more important. The same strength distinguishes the production of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, with which the Puccini is playing in tandem. Sometimes one can go months without seeing real people on an operatic stage. English Touring Opera offers that particular pleasure twice over. It deserves good audiences around the country. Sponsored by Barclays Bank. At Sadler's Wells until February 26, then on tour</p>

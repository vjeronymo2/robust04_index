			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Exports fall widens trade deficit BRITAIN'S exports, one of the few bright spots in the economy since the recession began, fell sharply last month, contributing to a further widening of Britain's trade deficit. A 3.5 per cent fall in the value of exports to Pounds 8.8bn last month from Pounds 9.2bn in May more than offset weaker import figures. That caused the visible trade deficit to increase from Pounds 830m in May to Pounds 922m. The value of imports in June, at Pounds 9.8bn, was 2.5 per cent lower than in May when it was Pounds 10bn. The fall in exports and imports was bad news for the government, reflecting both muted consumer demand at home and weakening overseas markets. A further worry was that, although exports have held up relatively well since the beginning of last year, three-monthly trends show that imports continue to outstrip exports at a time when consumer demand is weak. Measured in volume terms, and minus oil and so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, oil rigs and precious stones, imports grew by 3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter and by 8 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter last year. That compares with exports which, measured in the same terms, grew by 2 per cent in the latest quarter and by 2.5 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago. The visible trade deficit excluding oil and erratic items, which is often taken as the best guide to the underlying trend, widened to Pounds 3.8bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.5bn in the first quarter. The current-account deficit, which includes a projected Pounds 200m surplus from 'invisible' trade, such as services and transfer payments, was estimated by the Central Statistical Office to have increased last month to Pounds 722m from Pounds 630m in May. Exports to the European Community - which account for more than half of UK exports - fell from Pounds 5.3bn in May to Pounds 4.9bn in June, but remained 1.5 per cent up in the second quarter compared with the previous three-month period. Exports to the the US grew by 6.5 per cent. Imports from the EC rose by 3 per cent in the latest three months, while imports from the US fell by 8.5 per cent. A breakdown of exports shows that food, drink and tobacco exports performed best in the latest three months. Volumes grew by 9.5 per cent compared with the three months to March. Exports of cars fell by 2 per cent in the second quarter and were 18 per cent lower compared with the second quarter of 1991. Imports of cars rose by 9 per cent in the latest three months, but the CSO said that was mainly a build-up to August 1, when new-registration cars come on to the market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT (POUNDS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   ---------Visible Trade Balance---------                            Less oil        Current                  and                       Invisibles        balance    Total    erratics    Exports    Imports    balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990     -16.1    -18.6       -21.0      102.0      120.7       +2.5 1991      -5.2    -10.1       -13.4      103.7      113.8       +4.9 Qtr 1     -2.4     -3.0        -3.6       24.9       28.0       +0.6 Qtr 2     -0.3     -2.2        -2.9       26.0       28.2       +1.9 Qtr 3     -1.1     -2.3        -3.5       26.4       28.8       +1.3 Qtr 4     -1.4     -2.6        -3.5       26.3       28.9       +1.1 1992 Qtr 1     -2.6     -3.1        -3.6       26.2       29.3       +0.4 Qtr 2     -2.5     -3.1        -3.8       26.8       29.9       +0.6 Jan       -1.0     -1.2        -1.3        8.3        9.4       +0.1 Feb       -0.9     -1.0        -1.1        9.0       10.0       +0.1 Mar       -0.7     -0.9        -1.1        8.9        9.8       +0.1 Apr       -1.2     -1.4        -1.4        8.8       10.2       +0.2 May       -0.6     -0.8        -1.2        9.2       10.0       +0.2 June      -0.7     -0.9        -1.2        8.8        9.8       +0.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for April to June 1992 are projections.

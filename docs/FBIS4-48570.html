			<p>BFN     [Text] Our guest today on Afrique Midi is General Augustin  Bizimungu, the Rwandan Government Army chief of staff. As you  probably know, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has just taken  control of Kigali airport, which had been at the center of  fierce fighting for several days. Gen. Bizimungu does not give  the same version of events as the RPF. Here is Augustin  Bizimungu's version given to Dominique de Courcelles:    [Begin recording] [Bizimungu] The airport, we, the UN force  requested control of the airport from the Rwandan Government to  carry out humanitarian actions. We granted the neutrality of  the airport.    [Courcelles] Since you granted that neutrality, it appears  that there was fierce fighting last night and that the RPF  managed to seize control of the airport.    [Bizimungu] No, let us say that we left, it was a preamble  to  remove our troops from the airport. I do not know if the RPF  occupied it, it should have been under UNAMIR's [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda] control.    [Courcelles] Have you yourself pulled out all your troops  from the airport?    [Bizimungu] Yes.    [Courcelles] Last night?    [Bizimungu] Yes.    [Courcelles] Where did you pull them back to?    [Bizimungu] To the town center.    [Courcelles] However there was fierce fighting at the  airport  last night.    [Bizimungu] No. Fighting took place, it was extremely fierce  in the past three days, and it intensified in the last two days.  I believe that there is no more fighting now because it is  supposed to be under UNAMIR's control.    [Courcelles] You are saying that you voluntarily pulled out  your soldiers from the airport to hand over the airport to  UNAMIR, therefore the airport did not fall under the RPF's  control.    [Bizimungu] I do not know for sure now. The best might be to  ask the UN mission if it is still controlling the airport or if  the RPF, which was very close, 500 meters away, occupied it when  we left.    [Courcelles] What is the situation regarding the Kanombe  camp, which is very close to the airport runways and which is  one of the targets of the RPF?    [Bizimungu] The camp is next to the airport. To control the  camp it was necessary to control the airport.    [Courcelles] So you also evacuated the camp?    [Bizimungu] Yes, we did.    [Courcelles] Where to? Kigali?    [Bizimungu] Yes. We adopted a new defensive plan by  supporting ourselves on a part near the airport. [sentence as  heard] Therefore we control part of the town and we adopted a  new plan.    [Courcelles] Were there many casualties during last night's  fighting around the camp?    [Bizimungu] No. Not last night, but I told you that there  was fierce fighting in this area for the past four or five days.  Naturally there are always casualties when there is fighting.    [Courcelles] Now general, what are your plans?    [Bizimungu] My plans? We are reorganizing and the fighting  continues.    [Courcelles] Will the battle for Kigali start now?    [Bizimungu] I believe so since when we occupied a position  and when we defended it we were expecting to be attacked. I am  not sure if the RPF will not continue its' attacks. If it does  so, fighting will continue.    [Courcelles] Are you rather on the defensive?    [Bizimungu] In the town itself, yes.    [Courcelles] Elsewhere?    [Bizimungu] In the north, near Ruhengeri, the Rwandan Armed  Forces have the upper hand. We intend to resume the offensive  there. In the south, near Buyefera, our troops retreated two  weeks ago, they are now reorganizing and we also expect to go on  the offensive there too.    [Courcelles] What can you tell us regarding the overall  situation? Do you feel that you are on the retreat, or more or  less holding? How do you assess the situation?    [Bizimungu] We are not on the retreat yet. Let us say that  the situation is complex for the time being, but it is not  hopeless. We lose a battle here, we win one there. Let us say  that we are not in a desperate situation.    [Courcelles] Are talks with the RPF for a cease-fire  possible? Do you wish them?    [Bizimungu] We always hoped for an end to the fighting  because we remain convinced that war will not solve the problems  of the Rwandans. [end recording]</p>

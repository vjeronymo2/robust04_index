There  have not been any clashes between the EPS and the 3-80 Northern  Front led by recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias El  Chacal, the military source added.    A peace commission traveled on Thursday to the Quilali area  in an attempt to make contact with rebel leaders to present a  government proposal for the pacification of the nation's  conflict-ridden and tormented northern areas. The peace  commission is made up of members of the Nicaraguan Catholic  Church and of the International Commission of Support and  Verification, CIAV-OAS.    On Wednesday, the Nicaraguan Government and the rebels each  announced -- unilaterally -- a cease-fire aimed at finding a  negotiated solution to the conflict.</p>

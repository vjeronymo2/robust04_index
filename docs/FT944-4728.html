			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to exercise vote on directors' positions Sir, The letter from Richard V Giordano, chairman of British Gas, (December 1) in defence of Mr Cedric Brown's salary increase, illustrates in admirable fashion the arrogance with which top British management treats both its shareholders and public alike. As an average shareholder, a retired university science professor who worked overseas in poverty-stricken countries, I am expected to vote every year for the directors of the 30 large companies in which I have invested my savings. In one year alone Mr Cedric Brown's salary rise is equivalent to a lifetime's savings and was 'fixed' by a remuneration committee of gentlemen who have joined the club of 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'. I no longer feel that I can vote for a government that taxes such salaries at only 40 per cent. I now make a habit of putting a cross against the re-election of any director of the companies in which I invest unless their remuneration is reasonable, the company profitable and dividends adequate. And I advise fellow shareholders to use their votes in a similar fashion. S W Morel, Granary Farm, Chitcombe Road, Broad Oak, Rye, East Sussex, TN31 6EU</p>

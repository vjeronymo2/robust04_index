At the meeting, Cheng Weigao,  secretary of the provincial party committee, expressed important  opinions on how to successfully implement the guidelines of the  instructions of the central authorities.    He said: In his speech to the national propaganda and  ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin explicitly  pointed out that the fundamental principle for the 1994 work is  to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, to accelerate the building of the socialist market  economic structure, to maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound  development of the national economy, to safeguard political  stability, and to promote the all-round progress of society,  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line. The provincial party committee, the provincial  government, and all other levels of party committees and  governments should firmly implement the fundamental principle  for the 1994 work set forth by the central authorities, should  explicitly, firmly, and unswervingly follow the instructions of  the central authorities, should consciously submit themselves to  the overall interest of the whole party, and should  appropriately organize, arrange, and guide the work in all  fields in line with the guidelines and instructions of the  central authorities.    Cheng Weigao said: This year, centering on accelerating the  pace of building the socialist market economic structure, we  should really attend to the propaganda by media and use correct  public opinions to guide the vast numbers of cadres and the  masses to support, plunge into, and take part in reform. We  should strengthen the sense of overall interest and handle  affairs in accordance with the reform plans worked out by the  central authorities. We should be meticulous in organization  and careful in arrangements to ensure the smooth implementation  of all reform measures.    Cheng Weigao said: Reform is in fact a process of  readjusting the pattern and relationship of profits. At  present, in maintaining stability, we should pay attention to  the following several fields: We should correctly comprehend and  comprehensively implement the principle of developing the  national economy in a sustained, rapid, and sound manner and  seize all possible opportunities to accelerate the pace of  economic development in an effort to fulfill the goal of  quadrupling the 1980 GNP and making the people relatively  well-off. We must, however, persist in the principles of doing  our best and acting according to our capability rather than  lopsidedly pursuing high growth speed, blindly expand the scale,  undertaking low-level and duplicated construction projects, and  running after the output value without social demands and  economic returns. We should place the emphasis of economic  development on readjusting structure and deepening reform. We  should pay high attention to and concentrate our efforts on the  price work and on the price reform. At the same time, we should  strengthen the inspection, supervision, and control over  commodity prices. We must pay attention to the work concerning  daily necessities to ensure the supply of daily necessities of  the masses. We should conscientiously persist in the principle  that first the people must have sufficient food and second  socialist construction must be carried out. We should ensure  the on-schedule issuance of wages to the administrative and  institutional units. We should understand the weal and woe of  the masses and properly solve the masses' difficulties in  livelihood. We should resolutely deal blows to fake and  inferior products to safeguard the interests of consumers. We  should further attend to the building of democracy and the legal  system, deeply conduct the education on the legal system, foster  the authority of the law, and handle affairs in strict  accordance with the law.    Cheng Weigao demanded: The emphasis of economic work should  be really shifted to deepening reform, changing mechanisms,  optimizing structures, and improving efficiency. At present, we  should give prominence to the work in the following several  aspects: We should truly put agriculture in an essential  position, and firmly and unremittingly grasp the production of  grain, cotton, and edible oil. We should develop the rural  economy in an all-round manner. We should conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference,  stabilize the basic policies concerning the countryside, deepen  the rural reform, and ensure the stable increase in grain,  cotton, and edible oil output. We should appropriately fix the  scale of investment in fixed assets and the speed of economic  development. We should not only ensure the fulfillment of the  targets set for every quarter but also ensure the basic balance  between total supply and total demand in an effort to avoid  major ups and major downs in the economy and to ensure the  smooth progress of reform in a relatively relaxed environment.  We should energetically develop the large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, should continue to guide enterprises to  change their mechanisms and make explorations and innovations  for the modern enterprise system. In opening to the outside  world, we should accelerate the pace and stress on practical  results. At the same time, we should further pay attention to  opening to the domestic areas, extensively develop lateral  integrations and cooperation, energetically develop education  and scientific and technological undertakings.    Cheng Weigao stressed in conclusion: In face of the arduous  tasks on this year's reform and construction, leading organs and  leading cadres at all levels must further improve their  leadership art, improve their work style, and pay attention to  implementation of their work.</p>

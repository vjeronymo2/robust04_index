			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish offshoots' proposals Two subsidiaries of Midland &amp; Scottish Resources which operate its Emerald oilfield east of Shetland, have sent a proposal to their creditors for a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act 1986. Trafalgar House, owner of the Emerald Producer rig, and MSR, owner of the floating storage unit, have agreed to defer half the daily charter rates, backdated to October 1 last year, until the unsecured creditors have been paid 50p in the pound. Banks were not prepared to advance the two subsidiaries further funds, and MSR itself was unable to secure further funding as it had already granted security on all its assets to lenders. MSR said that creditors' approval of the voluntary arrangement would allow an orderly run down and eventual abandonment of the Emerald Field at the end of 1994 or in spring 1995. Mr Jon Hawksley, MSR managing director, said the life of the field would now depend on when the operating equipment could be redeployed. Without the voluntary agreements, production, already below 16,000 barrels a day, would have stopped this spring.</p>

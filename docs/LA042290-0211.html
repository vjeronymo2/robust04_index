			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYON FALLS IN VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINALS  </P> <P> Canyon High surprised even itself by advancing to the quarterfinals of the  third Volleyball Tournament of Champions at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion on Saturday  night.  </P> <P> Canyon defeated El Toro, 15-8, in the first round of the playoffs and defeated  Los Altos, 15-13, in a second-round match.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to come this far at all," Canyon Coach Ardyce Masters said. "I  was just hoping that we'd get out of our pool."  </P> <P> Canyon lost to second-seeded Santa Barbara, 15-4, in the quarterfinals, but not  before Eli Contreras had recorded 216 assists and Rick Phillips and Troy  Aldrich added 48 and 47 kills, respectively, in 11 tournament games.  </P> <P> "I was surprised we did this well," Contreras said. "But in the back of my  mind, I knew that if we tried really hard, we could do it."  </P> <P> Masters said it was the best Canyon has played this season. "We played against  programs that have been around for eons. I'm very proud of the kids."  </P> <P> In the second round, Canyon never trailed, leading by scores of 11-7 and 13-9.  The Cowboys survived a scare when Los Altos tied the score, 13-13, but Aldrich  had two kills to give Canyon the victory.  </P> <P> "I think the momentum from wining the first game carried over (against Los  Altos)," Masters said. "They were really fueled up to play Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> Three other Valley teams made it to the playoffs, but all lost in the first  round.  </P> <P> Royal lost to Fresno Bullard, 15-3. Outside hitter Jeff Colton led the  Highlanders with 37 kills in the tournament.  </P> <P> Kevin Hambly (33 kills), Adam White (24 kills) and Travis Ferguson (106  assists) also played key roles.  </P> <P> Madera defeated Taft, 15-5, and Mission Viejo upset Crespi, 16-14.  </P> <P> Matt Davis led Taft with 37 kills and Cody Hein had 28 assists in the  tournament.  </P></p>

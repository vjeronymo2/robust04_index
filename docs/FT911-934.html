			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Elf Enterprise Petroleum in innovative finance deal ELF Enterprise Petroleum, the new joint company formed by Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil, secured economically attractive financing yesterday by making innovative use of an equity-linked structure. Elf Enterprise Finance issued Pounds 438m of bonds exchangeable into Elf Enterprise Petroleum ordinary shares, the second largest offering in the sterling convertible market after Hanson's Pounds 500m issue last month. Previously, the exchangeable structure has been used by companies to trade out of hostile stakes in target companies, for example, General Cinema issued bonds exchangeable into Cadbury-Schweppes shares, News Corporation into Pearson and Bond Corporation into Allied-Lyons. But in this instance, Elf Aquitaine's 25 per cent holding of Enterprise Oil shares is to provide funds for a joint venture between the two companies, while at the same time closing out the overhang of Enterprise oil equity, which had put some pressure on its share price. '(The exchangeable bond structure) balanced marketing requirements with the need to deploy shares into mutually-owned assets, to maximise proceeds from the exchangeable bonds without putting undue pressure on our ordinary shares', said Mr John Walmsley, financial director of Enterprise Oil. An equity placing would have raised less than the convertible, as the shares would have had to be priced at a discount to the current market price. The exchange price for the bonds is 640p, 15 per cent above Tuesday's closing level. The deal was primarily aimed at UK investors, but was also broadly distributed in Europe. Dealers said the issue met strong demand from both equity investors - the bonds yield about 5 per cent more than the underlying shares, with the exchange price set at a reasonably premium - and bond investors. Lead manager SG Warburg, joint lead Goldman Sachs and co-lead Cazenove split an 'exempt list' of more than 100 big institutional accounts, mainly UK, between them, which other underwriters banned from calling. Although this practice, sometimes seen in the domestic market, helped facilitate orderly distribution of the deal, the size of the list was felt to be excessive. The deal performed strongly to close at 100 1/4 bid, above its par issue price.</p>

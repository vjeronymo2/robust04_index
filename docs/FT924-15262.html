			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Pro-Mobutu soldiers ring Zaire parliament TROOPS and paramilitary police surrounded Zaire's parliament building with tanks and armoured cars yesterday stepping up their defiance of reformist Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The soldiers and gendarmes, under the command of President Mobutu Sese Seko, were apparently sent to protect a rebel session of Zaire's national assembly, which was dissolved six weeks ago by a pro-democracy conference. Witnesses said troops also surrounded the Finance Ministry and kept up their guard at Zaire's central bank, where they took up positions at the weekend to support its sacked governor. Defiant members of the pro-Mobutu parliament had scheduled a meeting for yesterday afternoon to draw up a definitive new constitution - a task the conference is supposed to perform. Conference proposals to change Zaire's name, flag and currency have enraged Mr Mobutu, who has ruled the huge central African state with an iron hand for 27 years. He has refused to approve a transitional charter replacing the previous constitution. The conference was forced to shelve the changes, which symbolise rejection of Mr Mobutu's rule, but they have not been scrapped outright. Troops patrolled streets near the parliament building in Kinshasa's up-market Gombe district, ready to stop possible protests against the meeting. The latest military challenge to Mr Tshisekedi started after the prime minister sacked the central bank governor, Mr Nyemba Shabani, on Thursday, accusing him of fuelling rampant inflation by flooding the black market with newly-printed banknotes. Soldiers surrounded the bank to guarantee continued access for Mr Nyemba, part of Mobutu's old-guard leadership.</p>

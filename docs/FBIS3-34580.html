It  has even been claimed that some of them requested his  extradition but there is no official confirmation of such claims.    The same sources said that Bin-Ladin, whose home neighboring  the mosque was attacked by the group, as a result of which three  of his visitors were wounded, used to stay at home and not leave  there and was in the habit of receiving the engineers working  for his company at 1700 every Friday. That is why the attack on  his house was timed at 1630. The attackers searched all the  rooms of the house for him, including his bedroom, and opened  fire on the engineers, wounding three of them. Then they  attacked the neighboring mosque to cover up the operation.    They added that the group consisted of four people, two of  them Mauritanian, one Moroccan, and one Yemeni. They belonged  to the extremist al-Takfir Wa al-Hijrah [renunciation and  repudiation] Movement.    They said that some members of the movement held an open  debate a week earlier at the same mosque that was attacked.  They disagreed with and repudiated Ansar al-Sunnah and regarded  Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and President al-Bashir and members of his  government as infidels.    Sudanese security sources say that the way the group  operated  and carried out its attack confirmed that its members were  well-trained professionals. They did not leave behind any  passports, identity cards, or papers that would betray their  identity or the parties financing them.    The sources also say that they came from different places  and  that the date of their entry into Sudan was not known. There  are numerous questions the investigators are trying to find  answers for as they interrogate the detained members of the  group, especially the Yemeni who was wounded in the exchange of  fire with the police during the attack.    The Sudanese sources emphasized that there was no connection  between the mosque and Bin-Ladin although they did say that  Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyah, to which the mosque belongs, is  an Islamic Wahhabi group known for its links with Saudi Arabia  but with no significant activity or influence in Sudan to make  it a target for such a serious attack. Furthermore, there are  no differences between the Wahhabi group and Sudan.    It is worth noting that the Saudi businessman Bin-Ladin was  one of the most prominent supporters of the Afghan Mojahedin  when they were fighting for the liberation of Afghanistan from  communist influence. He used his own money for the training of  Arab volunteers and their transportation to join the Afghan  mojahedin. He recently moved to Sudan and was the target of  criticism by Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

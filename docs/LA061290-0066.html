In east-central  Kansas, there was flooding along the Marais des Cygnes river, which crested at  Quenemo above 24 feet, or seven feet above flood stage, threatening adjacent  farmland and roads. Elsewhere, Florida saw heavy rain, and winds gusting up to  60 m.p.h. swept across the Montana Rockies.  </P></p>

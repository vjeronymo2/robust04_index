			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Anhui Reaps Summer Grain Harvest"] </F>   [Text] This year, the output of Anhui's midseason grain  and edible oil crop is better than expected. Anhui is expected  to reap another bumper wheat harvest this year, following that  of last year. Though hit by many natural disasters, the province  is still expected to reap a good rapeseed harvest, thanks to the  expanded acreage for rapeseed. The midseason harvest will lay a  solid foundation for the healthy and steady development of this  year's rural economy and even for the entire national economy.    According to statistics, the province is expected to reap  summer grain this year from 2,121,300 hectares out of the sown  2,148,700 hectares, registering a reduction compared to the  previous year. Despite this, gross summer grain output is  expected to post a slight increase over the previous year and to  become the second-highest record year in history, thanks to the  joint efforts of all in the province. This year's summer grain  bumper harvest did not come easily. The major reasons behind  the bumper summer grain harvest are as follows: First, Anhui  conscientiously implemented the economic policies for rural  areas worked out by the central government; mobilized farmers'  enthusiasm for farming; increased investment for midseason  production; and enhanced field work management. Second, weather  conditions during the summer grain growing period were generally  favorable. The warm winter was favorable as it allowed summer  grain to survive; it enabled it to grow smoothly and quickened  the turning green of wheat after spring. Summer grain seedlings  grew well after spring. In addition, high temperatures in the  mid and late growing period, and favorable sunlight,  temperatures, and water conditions were favorable for the  ripening of wheat, increasing the weight of summer grain, and  for raising unit output. Third, plant diseases and insect pests  were not serious. As a solid job was done in the prevention of  plant diseases and insect pests, the harm to summer grain was  reduced considerably. Fourth, the campaign to promote high  output resulted in enlarged acreage and a balanced increase in  the output of summer grain. The province set up various types  of high-output demonstration farms whose acreage totals 133,000  hectares. Fifth, all levels of government and agricultural  departments enhanced leadership and guidance over midseason  production.    Of the 891,200 hectares of sown rapeseed acreage, nearly  130,000 hectares were hit by frost earlier this year and had to  be abandoned. Because localities made timely replanting, it is  estimated that at present the harvested acres for rapeseed total  786,700 hectares, 33,000 hectares more than the previous year.  Having been hit by storms and high temperatures, the province's  rapeseed harvest is down slightly, judging from localities'  reports; but this year is still a good year for rapeseed output.  At present, harvesting and thrashing of rapeseed have been  completed. Harvesting and thrashing of summer grain is in the  final stages. While stepping up harvesting, localities are  striving to store all harvested grain in warehouses and to reap  a bumper summer grain harvest.</p>

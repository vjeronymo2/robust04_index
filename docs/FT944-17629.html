			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Farmers fear loss of subsidies in expanded EU Farmers face the abolition of all price support if eastern European countries join the European Union, the National Farmers' Union said yesterday. This prospect was set out in a paper drawn up by the union's leadership and launched at a meeting of its policy-making council. Mr Martin Haworth, head of international affairs, said extending Common Agricultural Policy subsidies to eastern Europe 'could prove potentially fatal to the EU'. Not only would it mean a possible doubling of the present CAP budget of about Ecu35bn (Pounds 27bn), it would also encourage increased production in eastern Europe, which has great agricultural potential, and lead to fresh surpluses in western Europe. Export of these surpluses to world markets could not be subsidised because of new limits under the Gatt trade deal. Mr Haworth said that opposing enlargement of the European Union was unrealistic since member states were committed to the goal of membership for six eastern and central European countries - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. He said: 'There's not much of a choice at all. It's very hard to see how you can continue with any kind of price support in an enlarged community.' The document, with one released in March on the implications for the CAP of the Gatt accord, is very different in tone from the complacent approach taken by the union in the past. It follows closely an independent study published, but not endorsed, by the European Commission, which called for farm subsidies to be phased into national budgets, with compensation for the worst hit regions. The union leadership is focusing on two options for reform which it considers the most realistic. Eastern European countries could establish a low level of price support for their farmers - enough to cover essential production costs - in advance of joining the EU. Prices for western European farmers would then be lowered to these levels, with 'some form of further compensation,' according to the paper. Alternatively, all price support would end, to be replaced with 'decoupled' aid for EU farmers - payments unrelated to how much they produce. While this would discourage overproduction, it would have some disadvantages. The document says: 'They relate to the budgetary cost if an equivalent level of support is to be granted, or the impact on farm incomes if it is not.' Mr Haworth accepted that the union's 100,000 members might take a different view. But he disputed the argument of some farmers that further reforms to the CAP could be postponed. He said: 'We need to take a decision as to how we change the CAP very quickly. 'The more it's delayed, the more these countries will try to align themselves with the current CAP. This is storing up many more problems than we've already got.'</p>

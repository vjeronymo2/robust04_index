			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel's powerful Histadrut labor federation threatened to call strikes if the  government denies workers realistic cost-of-living pay increases to compensate  for a 12% devaluation of the shekel and subsidy cuts. A federation spokesman  said that unless the government reimposes price controls and gives assurances  that it will not slash education and health budgets, the labor group will  withhold support for a plan by Finance Minister Shimon Peres that ends  automatic cost-of-living increases. Peres has said he will press union  officials to support lower real wages.  </P></p>

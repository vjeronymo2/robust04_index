			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Old City ties fray as new advisers muscle in - Nicholas Denton examines a changing relationship A listing in the Crawford's directory of City connections is not what it used to be. SG Warburg and Baring Brothers are recorded therein as financial advisers to drinks company Allied Domecq. But it was Goldman Sachs, the US corporate adviser, that planned Allied's Pounds 265m sale of its food ingredient business announced this week. The instance is no isolated one. Goldman has encroached on another traditional Warburg client by advising Reckitt &amp; Colman on the disposal of the Colman mustard line. The coincidence of the two cases, aside from reflecting well on Goldman Sachs, illustrates a broader point: ancient ties between company and merchant bank in the UK are fraying. One UK corporate financier says: 'I don't really care what goes on in Crawford's. It's rather archaic.' Investment banking does, as its practitioners are fond of saying, remain a 'relationship business' and old ties count. Reckitt used Warburg for its recent acquisition in the US. The UK house is also handling the disposal of Allied's beverage and bakery businesses. A long-standing relationship remains particularly relevant when a company mandates an adviser to conduct a rights issue or some other core transaction. 'A Crawford's relationship means a lot,' says Mr Mark Nicholls, joint head of corporate finance at Warburg. But even Warburg, bank of record to more UK-quoted companies than any other adviser, knows the limitations of tradition. 'Crawford's does not mean that you win every bit of business from that client,' says Mr Nicholls. 'All it means is that you have an open door.' Clients are spreading their business around more promiscuously than they used to. 'The big international companies like to have two or three strings to their bow,' says a UK M&amp;A specialist. Financial advisers are adapting to the wishes of their customers. Some, such as Morgan Stanley, even make a virtue of their willingness to act as joint adviser. UK banks have mellowed enormously since the 1980s, when some would threaten to resign rather than accept an interloper as joint adviser on a transaction. Sharing out favours can be a way to smooth the transition from one adviser to another. 'A merchant bank is like wallpaper,' says a US M&amp;A specialist. 'You are not going to redecorate the room in one transaction.' Another US investment banker says that a UK client will save face for its traditional merchant bank by giving it a token role. 'There are times when the co-adviser is there for relationship purposes. We say that as long as they stay out of our way everything will be fine.' However, the UK-listed companies that have gone the whole hog, and formally named US houses as their bankers of record, are few and vanishing. Goldman Sachs, listed as Racal Electronics' adviser, is hard pressed to come up with further names. The more general pattern is for large UK companies, such as Allied, to retain a UK adviser while also building a relationship with a US investment bank. UK and US banks' skills can complement each other. A US investment banker says that his company brings industry knowledge, advanced techniques and an international perspective; but he concedes that the traditional UK merchant bank has 'history' and a knowledge of the board. What is more, a pool of advisers can provide useful options for a company when one is 'conflicted out' - forced to turn down a client's business because it is acting on behalf of a competitor. Above all, it is UK companies' acquisition forays into the US or continental European market that have often provided the opportunity for interlopers. Goldman's seduction of Reckitt illustrates the classic scenario: a US investment bank advising on a purchase in the US, getting its foot in management's door and pitching for later business. 'Relationships are important but you cannot rest on your laurels and expect the business to come to you,' says Mr Will Samuel, head of corporate finance at Schroders, the UK merchant bank. But established advisers are also becoming better at facilitating the international ambitions of their clients. Warburg has as many corporate finance employees in New York today as it had in London in the early 1980s. A decade ago an acquisition in the US would have been handled by a local bank. But in the last month Warburg escorted three UK companies into the US in deals worth Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.07bn). Or perhaps Warburg chaperoned them: at least these three will not be meeting any new banks. But investment banks can also seduce from the other side of the table. Goldman made contact with Allied through advising Domecq of Spain, its target earlier this year.</p>

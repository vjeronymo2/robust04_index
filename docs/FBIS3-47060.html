The four-day subcabinet-level negotiations will begin in  Tokyo on Tuesday under an agreement to work out a new framework  for bilateral trade.    The officials said Washington insists on a tough stand  concerning auto and auto parts trade, pressing Japan to make  further concessions to open its automobile market wider to  imports.    The negotiations will focus on a U.S. demand that Japan set  a numerical target for imports of U.S.-built cars and parts,  they said.    In previous sessions of the talks, the United States  proposed  that the Japanese Government ask Japanese automakers to extend  their programs for imports of U.S.-made auto parts beyond fiscal  1995 and that the Japanese and U.S. Governments work out rough  measures setting the value of Japanese imports of finished cars  and parts from the United States in the future.    Sluggish automobile sales at home and overseas have made it  difficult for the Japanese auto industry to compromise on the  U.S. stance, the officials said.    They said Washington will find it equally difficult to back  down on its stand as automobile trade accounts for a large  portion of its trade deficit with Japan.    The officials said the negotiations may drag on toward a  February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>

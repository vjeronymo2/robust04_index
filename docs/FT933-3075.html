			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous close to a confused session ANOTHER nervous trading day saw London equities abandon much of a midsession rally after British government bonds reacted to weakness in New York in the face of the latest US consumer price data. Once again, UK securities houses traded busily between the blue chip shares and stock index futures ahead of Friday's expiry in futures markets. Wider economic uncertainties also played a part in market trading. At home, the rebasing of official industrial production data overshadowed the market's initially favourable response to the statistics for July. The stock market took a cautious view of the possible implications of a firm statement on public sector pay policies from the UK government. A lower opening in London equities, which took the FT-SE 100 Index down by 10.5 points, reflected the 200-point fall in the Nikkei average following the announcement of a slight decline in gross national product and a high trade surplus. However, the stock market rallied as soon as stock index futures started trading, and showed a premium on the September contract on the Footsie which expires on Friday and currently dominates stock market attention. By early afternoon the FT-SE 100 had replaced its early fall of 10 points with a similar gain, taking it to the day's peak of 3,035.3. But the premium on the Footsie futures contract then began to melt away, leaving the London market exposed to the effects of a setback in UK bond prices and a fall of 22 Dow points in early trading on Wall Street. The final reading put the Footsie at 3,028, with the day's gain reduced to a mere 3.2 points. This contrasted with a fall of 12.9 to 3,458.6 for the FT-SE Mid 250 Index as profit-takers in the smaller stocks had to pay a price penalty. Underlying worries over corporate earnings trends were not helped by reports yesterday from the insurance and engineering sectors, and good half-time figures from Kingfisher, the stores group, were taken coolly. Rumours that Mr Nicholas Knight, king of the UK market bulls, was losing his nerve, proved incorrect. However, while standing to his Footsie forecasts of 3,500 at end-1993 and 3,700 at end-1994, he admitted to a 'more hesitant stance in the short term', adding that the move to 3,500 could come very late in the year - and/or from lower levels. SG Warburg, linked to its more cautious Footsie prediction of around 2,900 at end-1993, commented that the key to further gains in the stock market remains strong earnings growth, 'and it is precisely here that the questions are arising . . .' Heavy turnover in stock index futures was the chief factor behind the increase in Seaq volume in equities to 593.1m shares from Monday's 585.3m; non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the total. But retail, or customer, business, the true measure of the health of investment activity in equities, fell away on Monday as trading was dominated by intra-market dealings by securities houses bracing themselves for the stock index future expiry. By value, retail business fell to Pounds 1.06bn, well at the lower end of the range established over the past 12 months. Daily retail business has averaged around Pounds 1.4bn since sterling left the ERM network in September 1992.</p>

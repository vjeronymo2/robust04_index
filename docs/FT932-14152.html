			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE FRENCH move to lower interest rates, together with Friday's strong performance on Wall Street, led to an early advance in stock index futures, although it had faded by the close, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened strongly at 2,841, on the first day of the new account, the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index saw buyers from the outset. The buying was encouraged by the French moves, and by 11.30am the contract was trading at the session's high of 2,858. However, with 2,855 seen by many dealers as a resistance level, traders decided that the early advance had gone far enough and that profit-taking was now in order, which led to a retreat for the June contract. A further decline was seen during the afternoon, more to do with a lack of buyers than outright selling, and a poor opening for Wall Street weakened sentiment further. June closed at 2,845, up 13 from Friday's close and around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash which falls to about 8 on this account. Turnover was unexciting at 6,277 lots. Volume in the traded options remained poor, reaching only 23,576 contracts. A large part of the total was in the index options, the FT-SE 100 option trading 8,996 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 2,411. Bid speculation made Lucas Industries the busiest stock option at 1,484 lots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The government completely rules out any form of  secret diplomacy on the issue of Skopje, but it is leaving the  door open for a dialogue in case the Greek conditions are  satisfied.    The government spokesman yesterday repeated that there are  certain issues which are obviously open to negotiation and  certain other issues which are not. The issue of the name is one  of the issues not open to negotiation. He also said that "the  government does not accept secret diplomacy." [passage omitted]</p>

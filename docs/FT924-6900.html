			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / N Korea threatens to quit all talks NORTH KOREA yesterday threatened to suspend all negotiations with South Korea in the latest sign of increased tension between the two sides, writes John Burton in Seoul. Progress in inter-Korean relations has been blocked by Pyongyang's refusal to accept challenge inspections by Seoul of suspected nuclear weapon facilities. However, other issues have contributed to the stalemate in recent weeks. South Korea last month announced the discovery of a North Korean spy ring and demanded an apology from Pyongyang, which has dismissed the incident as a 'fabrication'. Seoul and Washington also recently said that they would resume the joint 'Team Spirit' military exercise next year after suspending it this year due to North Korea's acceptence of scheduled nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Seoul is following a carrot-and-stick policy in persuading Pyongyang to accept challenge nuclear inspections. While offers of economic aid to Pyongyang are the carrot, Team Spirit represents the stick. Pyongyang said at yesterday's session of the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission that it would cancel meetings with the South, including the prime ministers' talks in December, unless Team Spirit is cancelled.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Jordan on Monday [25 April] welcomed as a  "positive step" Israeli statements indicating readiness for  making territorial compromise and dismantling the settlements in  the occupied Arab territories in return for peace with the Arabs.    "I believe what (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin) said  is positive...it is the first time he makes such a statement and  it (means) an acceptance of the truth that peace cannot be  achieved as long as the settlements exist in their current  shape," Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali told reporters.    Restating Jordan's position that settlements are an obstacle  to peace, Dr. al-Majali said the Hebron massacre was a major  factor in "shaking the idea of building and keeping settlements."    Dr. al-Majali said Jordan was ready to hold the meetings of  the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination committees, blaming the  failure of these committees to meet on the Palestinian  engagement with the autonomy talks in Egypt.    He said this engagement partly justifies the Palestine  Liberation Organisation's (PLO) failure to hold the meetings of  these committees but "does not justify it fully because a long  time has passed (since the formation of committees)." He said,  "our fear for the absence of coordination is that our brothers  in the organisation do not have enough experience in certain  issues and we are more experienced than them and could help them  and avoid harm."    But coordination with Syria "is at its best," said Dr.  al-Majali adding that Syria supports Jordan's demand for an end  to the siege on al-'Aqabah and the two countries along with  other Arab partners will meet to coordinate before the  resumption of the bilateral peace talks.    He said the Hebron massacre and the siege on al-'Aqabah  contributed to the halting of the peace talks until the  emergence of positive signs about these issues.    Dr. al-Majali rejected accusations that his government  lacked  a strategy on the process or its media policy, saying Jordan was  among the first countries to seek peace in the region.    Reiterating Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive peace in  the Middle East, the prime minister said Jordan will be ready  for discussing all issues related to the peace process when it  resumes.    He said Jordan will take into consideration developments on  other tracks of the negotiations which will lead to peace  treaties in accordance with the Madrid formula.    Dr. al-Majali repeated Jordan's rejection of Israel's  "illogical" demands to sign a peace treaty before resolving the  issues on the agenda for the talks signed by the two countries  in September last year.    He said the objective of the negotiations is to reach a  peace  treaty but only after all issues in the agenda have been  resolved.    In reply to a question on the status of the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali reiterated  that Jordan does not accept "any illegal grouping" and will only  deal with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian  people.    Dr. al-Majali said Jordanian relations with some Gulf Arab  countries have improved but said "some issues" remain unresolved  between the Kingdom and Saudi Arabia.    "Time will reveal it all and the day will come when the  brothers will realise that we did not do them any wrong at all,"  the prime minister told foreign correspondents at the Prime  Ministry.    Dr. al-Majali held the Jordanian media responsible for the  failure of the reconciliation efforts among Arab states, adding  that Jordan received some complaints from some Arab Gulf  countries about reports carried by the country's unofficial  media.    "The role of the press was not positive in improving  relations," Dr. al-Majali said, expressing an opinion he has  projected earlier.    Dr. al-Majali, who said the media "shoulders 95 per cent of  the responsibility" for the tension in relations with the Gulf,  said Jordan had told countries which complained that the media  in Jordan are free and "we have never guided (them)," adding  that the Press and Publication Law bans the publishing of news  that harm friendly countries and legal cases have been launched  against those who violated the law.    Pointing out that the government cannot control the  unofficial press, Dr. al-Majali said, "the role played by the  official media towards Arab relations is positive and there was  nothing in them that could be interpreted as offensive to our  brothers in the Arab countries."    Responding to a question on whether Egypt was trying to  undermine Jordan's role in the region, Dr. al-Majali said that  Egypt and Jordan had strong relations and the two countries look  into means of strengthening them.    The prime minister said Jordan played a mediation role in  the  Yemeni conflict upon the request of its leaders who trust the  wisdom of His Majesty King Husayn. But he said there are  differences in Yemen that might have become personal which makes  the implementation of the reconciliation agreement signed in  Amman difficult.    The prime minister said: "We believe in the Iraqi people,  their freedom and (the need) to lift the injustice inflicted  upon them."    The Iraqi people, he said, "are free in their choice of its  leadership and we do not impose our opinion on them because we  do not allow ourselves to interfere in the affairs of others."    Asked about the reported involvement of an Arab country in  the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in  Beirut in January, Dr. al-Majali said the results of the  investigation conducted by the Lebanese authorities did not name  any country behind the assassination.    The prime minister said the two suspects arrested in the  case  admitted that their organisation, Abu-Nidal Group, assassinated  Mr. Ma'ayitah because it "was not happy with Jordan's policy."    It was "a big plot; too many people were involved," said Dr.  al-Majali, adding that the assassins had planned to kill the  Jordanian ambassador in Beirut.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMS TO REPLACE COOLEY AS SEAFIRST CEO  </P> <P> Richard P. Cooley, 66, who helped BankAmerica Corp. turn the once-struggling  Seafirst Corp. into one of the San Francisco banking firm's most profitable  units, announced that he is retiring as head of the Seattle unit at year-end.  Cooley is chairman and chief executive of Seafirst Corp. and Seattle-First  National Bank.  </P> <P> Luke Helms, 46, president of Seafirst's Seattle-First National Bank, will  succeed Cooley, who led Seafirst for seven years. Kevin B. Ferrell, 43, a Bank  of America senior vice president, will succeed Helms.  </P> <P> Cooley helped engineer the sale of Seafirst to BankAmerica for $125 million in  cash and $94 million in stock in 1983, after a rash of problem energy loans had  Seafirst reeling. At the time, it was the largest interstate bank purchase.  </P> <P> The energy loans caused a $90.2-million loss at Seafirst in 1982. Much of the  red ink resulted from loans that Seafirst bought from the scandal-plagued Penn  Square Bank in Oklahoma City, which failed in one of the banking industry's  biggest debacles.

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOHO RECONSTRUCTION PLANNED  </P> <P> Contractors will be laying cobblestone streets again as part of a  reconstruction project in Manhattan's SoHo Cast Iron Historic District, the  city announced today.  </P> <P> The city will spend $11 million during the next two years to rebuild Greene and  Mercer streets.  </P> <P> The work will include new sewers, water mains, catch basins, street signs and  traffic lights, the Transportation Department said.  </P> <P> Because the district was designated a landmark area in 1973, the project will  include distinctive street lights and fire hydrants and the existing  cobblestone roadways will be restored by hand.  </P> <P> "It's worth a few extra dollars to maintain the quality of the neighborhood,"  department spokesman Joseph DePlasco said.  </P> <P> About 85% of the funding is coming from the federal government, he said.  </P> <P> The landmark area contains the largest collection of full and partial cast-iron  facades in the world and retains much of the character of a 19th-Century  commercial district.  </P></p>

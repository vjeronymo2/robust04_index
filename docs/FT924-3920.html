			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sleeping Korean behemoth stirs - John Burton finds intense interest as Kepco opens to foreigners KOREA Electric Power, which was officially opened to foreign shareholders last month, is normally known as a quiet behemoth. Ever since the government offered 21 per cent of the state-run utility to the Korean public in 1989, investors have considered Kepco, the largest capitalisation on the Seoul stock market, a safe, but boring, investment. All that changed in August when the government announced its intention to allow foreigners to acquire up to 8 per cent of Kepco. That unleashed frantic demand for the shares as domestic investors anticipated a surge of foreign buying orders. Kepco shares rose from a low of Won9,200 (Dollars 11.70) in August to Won20,600 yesterday, after hitting a peak of Won25,300 on November 24, the first day Kepco was opened to foreign investors. Kepco now accounts for 17.5 per cent of the capitalisation of the Seoul exchange against the 10 per cent share it previously claimed. Kepco has a healthy financial structure. Annual net earnings have grown at 17 per cent on average during the past five years, although this masks profit declines in 1989 and 1990. Last year, it reported net profits of Won719bn, an increase of 18.6 per cent, on sales of Won5,702bn. Analysts expect a 20 per cent profit rise this year. Kepco's dividend yield of 4 per cent is high by national standards. This reflects its relatively low debt/equity ratio of 90 per cent in a country where most companies have debt/equity ratios of 200 to 300 per cent. Interest in Kepco has been particularly strong among foreign fund managers because its large capitalisation makes it one of the few stocks on the Seoul exchange in which a single investment of several million dollars can be made without exceeding the strict limits on foreign ownership. However, investors will be watching closely the impact of the company's construction programme, which will more than double generating capacity from 19,851MW to 47,655MW by 2001. Kepco is being forced to build new power facilities because its reserve capacity of electricity has shrunk from a surplus of 72.3 per cent to only about 5 per cent in just five years. The slim reserve capacity means that Kepco can barely meet electricity demand during peak periods. The shortage has forced the government to introduce energy conservation measures. The electricity shortage was ironically of the government's own making. Confronted with surplus capacity in the mid-1980s, the government encouraged consumption by cutting rates as part of an anti-inflation policy. But demand, which has risen by an average annual rate of 13 per cent since 1987, exceeded expectations. Growth in electricity is expected to average around 9 per cent until 1997 since Korea's per capita power consumption remains low compared to other countries. Demand growth is expected to slow down thereafter to between 4.5 and 6 per cent. To meet short-term increases in demand, Kepco is building eight liquefied natural gas and 25 coal-fired facilities, which can be constructed relatively quickly. But the centrepiece of Kepco's expansion programme is the construction of nine nuclear plants, to be commissioned between 1995 and 2001, in addition to the nine it already operates. South Korea is one of the few countries in the world expanding nuclear capacity. It is also one of the world's biggest users of nuclear power, which provided 47.5 per cent of electricity generated in Korea last year. Although there is growing public criticism about nuclear power, the government prefers it as the fundamental supplier of electricity because it does not want resource-poor Korea to become dependent on foreign fuel sources. Officials also say that nuclear plants are the cheapest source of electricity in terms of cost per megawatt of energy generated, although they are costly to construct. The nuclear plants are expected to be built by Korean Heavy Industries and Construction, with four of the reactors supplied by ABB Combustion Engineering and two by Atomic Energy of Canada. Kepco plans to spend Won5,000bn annually over the next 10 years on the construction programme, which will also include improving its transmission and distribution system. The group is hoping to finance the expansion programme through annual rate increases of around 5 per cent in addition to loans from the state banks at preferential rates. Kepco will also borrow funds abroad through bond issues, including Dollars 300m it raised through a Yankee bond issue in June. No plans have been mentioned so far of raising funds through new share issues. Jardine Fleming predicts that the increased borrowings will raise Kepco's debt/equity ratio to almost 130 per cent by 1995 but estimates that annual earnings growth can be maintained at 20 per cent. Other analysts are more cautious, and all agree that net earnings will not rise much above 5 per cent next year as capital costs start to bite into profits.</p>

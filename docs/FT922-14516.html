			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour steps up offensive over poll tax LABOUR is stepping up its attack on the poll tax as it becomes convinced that the arrival of this year's bills is undermining the Tories' statements that they have abolished it. Although local authority associations estimate that 19 out of 20 people will have received their bills by Thursday, the Tories say that they have not seen a marked rise in the profile of the tax as an issue. Reaction from Tory associations suggests, said one party strategist, that it was not an issue that changed people's vote but was reinforcing views of people who would vote Labour anyway. Conservatives say that the surcharge - the extra amount shown on bills which is largely to compensate for previous non-payment of the tax - is the aspect most often raised but that it does not necessarily benefit Labour because of some Labour involvement in the non-payment campaign. Labour is putting great efforts into making the poll tax count locally. Figures for its 'fair rates' proposals in each area have been produced. All Labour candidates have been instructed to challenge their Tory opponents to apologise for the poll tax. Mr John Major said on BBC TV's On the Record that everyone regretted mistakes. He added: 'A mistake was made. When you admit a mistake you correct it.' Labour says that its private polling suggests that the issue is now fourth in importance behind health, the recession and education. The latest phase of Labour's attack also focuses on the Liberal Democrats' plans for a local income tax, and says that if Liberal Democrats were serious in opposing the poll tax, they would support Labour's plans for a 'simple and fair property tax'. There is anecdotal evidence that the poll tax, and its unpopular associations such as imprisonment for non-payment, are not yet as dead as the Tories would like. In reducing bills by up to Pounds 140 as from last year and passing the council tax legislation, the Conservatives have done as much as they can to take the tax off the agenda. Their continuing vulnerability on the poll tax means the Conservatives have not been able to raise the spectre of Labour in local government nor capitalise on their own plans for re-organising local authorities. They have not held a single press conference on local government outside London.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Texts for the Tories The Tories badly need a text. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher was leader, voters knew what she stood for. They made a choice. At the general elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987 her party attracted 42-44 per cent of the vote, enough to give her three smashing victories. Nobody is clear about where Mr John Major stands, which is one reason why the Conservatives have recently been unable to approach the 41-43 per cent required if they are to have a hope of winning a working majority. Poor Mr Major. When he took over, most people wanted a complete break with Thatcherism, while most of his party workers sought continuity. He replaced the poll tax and re-aligned Britain's stance within the European Community. He developed the Citizen's Charter, a sensible set of rules for improving relations between producers and consumers of public services. In desperation, and too late, he has become a proponent of a large budget deficit in times of recession. For the rest, he has been obliged to offer warmed-over Thatcherism. Leave aside the merits of the above decisions. The Conservatives' problem is that, taken as a whole, they do not appear to have a mission. It will take all the power of Mr Chris Patten's magic pen to produce an election manifesto that does not resemble a mish-mash of familiar slogans about choice and responsibility, laced with a few one-off wheezes that have managed to pass the Treasury. Mr Patten may draw inspiration from a forthcoming book, Modern Conservatism, by David Willetts (Penguin, Pounds 5.99). Mr Willetts, a former private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson, served in Mrs Thatcher's policy unit before becoming director of studies at the Centre for Policy Studies. His questioning of the welfare state (notably on family policy) once sounded extreme, but in recent years, perhaps since deciding to stand for parliament, he has moved towards the Conservative mainstream. Did I say mainstream? Has there been any such thing since 1979? Hold on. The explanation is coming. The modern Conservatism of Mr Willetts' title has, in his view, been the mainstream since the end of the Second World War. It combines a commitment to freedom, and free markets, with an acceptance of 'large parts of the welfare state, but on sound conservative grounds'. To what will be the astonishment of those who think otherwise of Mrs Thatcher and her brains' trust, he quotes the One Nation group of Tory MPs - 'one of the most significant movements of the 20th-century parliamentary Conservative party, and one of the most misunderstood'. The founders of the group 'were actually much less interventionist than the inter-war generation of Conservatives'. In 1950, One Nation, the group's first publication, argued for liberalising planning control and deregulating Mr Willetts seeks to reconcile free markets with the sense of community the construction industry. The group's 1954 pamphlet on economic policy, whose authors included Enoch Powell and Angus Maude, favoured a return to 'a more competitive system'. The 'One Nation' concept thus rehabilitated, Mr Willetts offers no balm to wets, who 'believe in a bigger role for government and looser financial policies', as against his preferred drys, who 'believe in less government intervention but within the framework of a sound financial policy'. (What will he call Mr Major after the Budget? Wet behind the ears?) The erratic forces in post-war Tory history were those supreme wets, Harold Macmillan and, following his U-turns, Edward Heath. Mrs Thatcher turns out to be a traditional Conservative, One Nation thinking included. What makes her different is her character, reflected in her energy, her ability to illustrate by practical example and her decisions on which issues to fight. Mr Willets seeks to reconcile free markets, 'which deliver freedom and prosperity' with a recognition of the importance of community, 'which sustains our values'. He rejects the economic liberal, or 'rigorous free-marketeer', who 'sees life as a giant supermarket'. Conservatives are bound by loyal ties to historic communities, and an understanding of the rule of law. They do not accept markets and the price mechanism everywhere. 'You cannot sell your children. You cannot sell your vote . . .' Other values prevail. 'A shared cultural tradition, limited government, the free market, the welfare state and loyalty to the central institutions of the nation-state, are the integrating forces in which a Conservative trusts.' These are not left-wing values; in particular, he warns that 'there are perfectly good Conservative arguments for publicly financed education, health care and a social security system which have nothing to do with equality'. Mr Major's ministers are wrestling with just such arguments right now. Mr Willetts' book is therefore an important text. It could bridge the gap between pre-and post-Thatcher conservatism. What it does not do is explain - to my satisfaction at least - how contemporary Tories reconcile their beliefs in freedom and community with their rejection of Scotland's aspirations for home rule, their destruction of local government (which Mr Willetts seems to deplore), and their blind refusal to link constitutional reform with the protection of the individual and the community from an overmighty executive. Perhaps the reason is that the Tories expect to be the executive most of the time. Co-incidentally, the One Nation group has just produced a pamphlet, One Nation 2000, which aims 'to create a Britain in which the growing prosperity of the fortunate is reflected in the better welfare of the disadvantaged . . .' It argues for policies that go beyond 'giving most weight to the individual as the key element in society'. Something more is needed, it says, 'on which to build the policies of the 1990s'. Now there's a text for Mr Patten.</p>

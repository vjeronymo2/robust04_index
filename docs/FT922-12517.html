			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Production edges higher at Anglo American mines THE GOLD mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer, had a satisfactory first three months to March with working costs well contained and production slightly up. Gold production rose marginally to 63,490kg from 63,225kg and unit costs were only 1 per cent higher at R26,367 per kg. The average gold price received dropped 1 per cent to R33,483 per kg, and available profit was down by 9 per cent to R167m (Dollars 58m). The production achievements were overshadowed by a series of seismic-related accidents at Western Deep Levels mine which claimed 27 lives during the quarter. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, said increasing safety was now the main challenge facing them. The best performance came from Freegold, the world's largest gold mine, which lifted available profit to R81.7m from R73.2m. Gold production was 3 per cent up at 28,337kg and, contrary to the trend at Anglo's other mines, the gold price received rose slightly to R34,473 per kg from R33,781 per kg. This was the result of successful forward selling. Mr Sunter said that Freegold's more marginal status meant that management felt it prudent to hedge a greater portion of its production than at richer mines like Vaal Reefs and Western Deep Levels. The mine did very well to cut unit costs by 3.5 per cent to R27,845 per kg. Mr Sunter noted that for the financial year to March, total costs had declined by 1.4 per cent to R3.2bn, in line with Anglo's prediction, made in 1990, that it would hold working costs flat for two years. Available profit dropped by 25 per cent at Vaal Reefs to R48.3m. Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director, said the mine had in fact had a good production quarter, the discrepancy being the result of two extraordinary contributions to last quarter's figures. Gold production was marginally higher at 18,773kg. Western Deep Levels results were badly affected by a number of seismic events which not only caused considerable loss of life, but caused damage to property of more than R10m. Gold production dropped by 10.6 per cent to 8,996kg while available profit dropped to R16.8m from R25.7m. Elandsrand and Ergo had steady quarters, while Sallies, which treats waste rock dumps, slipped into loss as it encountered poor grades. See Commodities</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Clinton v Friedman on welfare How attitudes towards the poor have changed. Just over 30 years ago, Milton Friedman proposed a novel way of coping with poverty, which he dubbed the 'negative income tax'. He argued that government should establish a 'floor' standard of living. Families with incomes below the floor would receive credits while those with incomes above it would pay taxes in the normal way. In Britain, similar schemes are advocated by proponents of a guaranteed 'basic income' for all citizens. Friedman saw many advantages in a negative income tax. It would be a transparent form of poverty relief since the appropriate 'floor' standard of living would be openly debated. It would be simpler to administer than the profusion of different benefits then available. It would be non-judgmental: individuals would qualify simply by virtue of being poor. They would not have to plead their case before sceptical officials. Rough calculations even indicated the scheme would save money by cutting through layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. My purpose is not to argue that a negative income tax is a perfect - or even practicable - scheme. Studies suggest the work disincentives associated with any form of basic income would be far higher than Friedman assumed. In practice, some benefits would have to be tailored to the specific circumstances of poor families. My point, rather, is to underline the extraordinary change in attitudes that has occurred since the 1960s. In that optimistic era, even conservatives believed that a rich society such as the US could, and should, make unconditional payments to poor families. Now consider the welfare reform plan published last week by President Bill Clinton. Set against the Friedman proposal it is a depressingly authoritarian document. Mr Clinton has no qualms about coercing welfare recipients, mostly single mothers and their children. The goal is to force young mothers (those born since 1971) into the paid labour force as quickly as possible. The plan approves of any kind of work except, of course, something as socially irrelevant as childrearing. The state's role is not to provide a floor standard of living, but to act as an 'enforcer' of disciplined work habits and responsible behaviour. The Clinton plan would impose dozens of new conditions and requirements for receipt of benefits. Mothers, including some with children as young as three months, would be required to accept any job offer in the private or public sector, no matter how uncongenial to the individual in question. If, after two years, they had not made a sufficient effort to find employment, or had proved unco-operative, benefits would be terminated. What would happen to families who run foul of welfare offices is not made clear. But since there are no plans to create state orphanages or other institutions, it seems that some children would end up in cardboard boxes. Yet the public desire to crack down on welfare mothers is so intense that many Republicans and conservative Democrats last week dismissed the Clinton plan as a timid half-measure. Nobody seems to have doubts about the proposed extension in the discretionary powers of public officials - something that Friedman was anxious to reduce. The complaint instead is that the two-year time limit is illusory because mothers who 'played by the rules' - obeyed orders - would be allowed to remain in subsidised workfare programmes indefinitely. The critics, if they are to be believed, would throw mothers and children on to the streets the minute the two years is up. What explains this sea-change in attitudes: why are leftwingers such as Mr Clinton embracing policies that conservatives would have recoiled from in the 1960s? The nation, after all, is much richer and, therefore, more capable of providing an unconditional safety net. There is no fully convincing answer. The shift partly reflects bitter disillusionment with the results of the 'war on poverty' that began in the late 1960s. A haphazard system of means-tested benefits, which bore no resemblance to Friedman's negative income tax, was expanded. While possibly reducing material poverty, this appeared to aggravate the social pathologies associated with the urban 'underclass': out-of-wedlock births, crime and drug abuse. By the 1980s social critics were complaining of a 'cycle of dependency' involving second and third generation single mothers. This led naturally to the 'new paternalism' of the 1990s: the notion that government must modify the behaviour of young mothers by imposing work requirements, dictating where and with whom they live and imposing fines in the hope of 'reforming' their characters. If poor women could respond to market incentives, the argument ran, they would not be on welfare. Hence the need for training and discipline: today the preferred model for welfare is not Friedman's cash dispenser but the US Army, an institution that many argue has done more to help the underprivileged than any poverty programme. The Clinton plan is thus a child of the times. The fact that left-leaning Democrats are so keen to force people into paid employment  - even young mothers who are raising children - is a barometer of the sour public mood. Friedman, in his way, embraced the permissiveness of the 1960s - the belief that a rich society should be tolerant of lifestyles that contravene middle-class norms. Ironically, Mr Clinton, a product of those years, is embracing a philosophy closer to that of the Victorian workhouse. And the public, like the audience in a Roman amphitheatre, is screaming for more.</p>

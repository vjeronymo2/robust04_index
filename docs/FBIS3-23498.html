			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Ye. Popov under the rubric </F> "For High Combat Readiness": "Joint Strike"]    [Text] The economic crisis in our society cannot help but  be reflected in the everyday activities of the army. We will be  honest--the state of affairs in the ranks frequently reaches  catastrophic in virtually all regions. The unsatisfactory  logistical support is having a marked effect on the course of  combat training for the air units in the Far East Military  District as well, and naturally not in a positive sense. Many of  the aviation commanders in the local areas thus have to rack  their brains searching for ways out of the situation. They do  find them, you know. By way of example, flight shifts have begun  to be planned with the finely tuned orientation of each flight  toward the comprehensive resolution of basic tasks of combat  training, so as not to permit any further reductions in the  professional qualifications of the pilots. The efficient use of  simulators in particular is contributing to the cause of  conserving material resources. People, that is to say, are not  sitting with their arms folded waiting for suggestions from  above, but are rather seeking out reserves themselves. But they  understand that the maintenance of skills in the techniques of  piloting alone is clearly insufficient to improve tactical  flight proficiency--the principal aim of the martial labors of  the aerial warriors.    This circumstance has obviously also prompted the officers  of  the detached air-assault air regiment to try and find  non-standard solutions for these problems. There have been lots  of proposals, but the most realizable--and ingeniously  simple--one came from Deputy Commander Military Pilot 1st Class  Lieutenant-Colonel V. Yeshmyakov.    Its essence consists of the following: to perform the tasks  of tactical flight exercises [LTU] in conjunction with our  neighbors, helicopter pilots, taking into account experience in  the interaction of Su-25 aircraft and rotary-winged craft during  the combat operations in Afghanistan. Valeriy's idea was then  supported by everyone. The first results of the flights  organized in the new fashion have confirmed its vitality. The  LTU I wish to talk about became the logical continuation.    No, we were not able to accomplish everything planned right  away. The fact is that, as with everything new, Yeshmyakov's  idea required a considered approach and precise calculations in  order to see that the undertaking itself was not discredited,  and to prove its right to life. The first difficulties arose as  early as in the stage of preparing for the LTU. That is  understandable--there was nowhere to turn for experience or  official documents for performing such exercises. The  flight-control officers of the helicopter and attack-aircraft  air regiments had to be trailblazers here. And they managed to  do so, efficiently putting forth methodological recommendations,  elaborations of variations for joint actions and calculations  for the efficient application of forces. This was facilitated by  the fact that many of them had completed the harsh schooling of  Afghanistan.    What did they use as the basis of the calculations? First  and  foremost, the conclusions of military scholars, both domestic  and foreign, seeking to prove the effectiveness of close  interaction among diverse aviation forces. The capabilities of  the Mi-24 crews to detect, identify and destroy armored targets  on the battlefield, by way of comparison, are several times  greater than the analogous ones for the Su-25 crews. The latter,  however, are able to overcome the resistance of enemy PVO [air  defenses] more successfully. It is thus not surprising that the  results of modeling their joints operations showed that they are  1.6--2.1 times more effective than autonomous operations, while  the losses of the one and the other were reduced by 30--50  percent. The required helicopter and attack-aircraft forces were  20--30 percent lower in that case accordingly.    These data were also used to develop the plans for the  impending exercises, namely the distribution of forces for the  accomplishment of combat-training tasks. Comprehensive group  exercises on LTU topics were devoted to clarifying them. All of  the training had to be conducted on the ground, using simulator  systems to the fullest extent, for understandable reasons. The  pilots of both regiments realized very well how difficult the  tasks facing them would be to accomplish, and were thus  thoroughly prepared.    The IAS [aviation engineering service] specialists had their  own concerns. Each technician experienced for himself that the  less his aircraft flies, the greater the attention that must be  devoted to it in servicing. The personnel, for all that,  prepared the aircraft for the exercises very well. The standouts  included aviation technical detachment commander Major G.  Makukh, armaments engineer Captain V. Golub and servicing group  chief Captain A. Nefedov.    Proper credit must also be given here to the specialists of  the support services--Senior Sergeant A. Gusarov and Sergeants  Ye. Stetsyuk and I. Khalilov, among others. The military  collective of the air garrison, that is, was working at a  uniform rhythm, united for a common aim--to achieve success.    The first to go up were helicopter pilots of the group  commanded by Major N. Vasilyev. Understanding very well that the  operations of the rest depended on the results of their work,  each of the reconnaissance crews was in a combat frame of mind.  Reaching the assigned area in concealed fashion, they carried  out the search, transmitted the coordinates of targets detected,  and identified and even designated the targets in the next pass.    The attack aircraft appeared behind them on the practice  range. Leader Major A. Sirotin did not miss the opportunity to  confirm his reputation as a leader; making use of all of the  might of his on-board weaponry, he suppressed the fire of the  "enemy" air defenses on the move. The wingmen supported the  initiatives of the squadron commanders. A group of Mi-24  helicopters rushed into the "overflight corridor" that had been  formed. Could the helicopter pilots really let down their  commander, Major A. Sobolev, with the LTU were being held on the  eve of his birthday?! They deluged the tank targets with a sea  of fire and smoke from the rockets on the first pass.    Then the attack aircraft were back in the sky. While  excellent work on the practice range was the rule for Major S.  Salnikov, Captains Yu. Zabudko and S. Esse--who had recently  obtained their 1st class ratings--were pretty anxious before the  sortie. But for no reason at all, judging by the results.  Participation in the ground attack was for them yet another  opportunity to verify for themselves their mastery under  conditions that were as close to combat conditions as possible.    It is in just such a climate that you understand that common  victory in a military action takes shape from the individual  achievements of each soldier. That is how the successes of  Captain I. Abdullayev's flight can be explained--there were two  destroyed "enemy" artillery emplacements on the scorecard of his  pilots in one pass. Such is the style of the new masters of  weapons delivery. They were entrusted with putting the period to  the end of the LTU. And they did not disappoint.    The tactical flight exercises are behind us now. I would say  right off, first of all, that the work of the fliers on the  practice range was assessed as excellent by the evaluators, and  their smooth interaction in the air was noted in particular. The  joint strike justified itself in every way--virtually all of the  targets were destroyed, the evaluation of the system of command  and control of the crews in the air was conducted successfully,  and a high level of organization of aerial reconnaissance and  search-and-rescue support was achieved. The hypothetical losses  of the crews proved to be minimal as well. Second, a  considerable economy of fuel and ammunition was also achieved in  the LTU through the joint performance of analogous tasks using a  reduced complement (on both sides).    But the aviators have not forgotten the results, and they  have drawn conclusions and lessons for tomorrow. It also makes  sense for others to think some about what can be  undertaken--even on the scale of a single regiment--if one does  not wait for something to turn up, and works creatively instead.  And all that is because--and this is third--the people, yearning  for the true business, finally found faith in themselves and  felt the taste of victory. That is the moral achievement of a  cohesive collective--the gaining of hope.    When this material had already been prepared for  publication,  I called Khabarovsk. It became clear from my conversation with a  senior air officer that the policy of developing command  independence, creativity in the accomplishment of  combat-training tasks and the rejection of stereotypes among the  attack-aircraft and helicopter pilots at garrison X was  unchanged.

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: POINT MUGU;  </P> <P> AIR SHOW TO BEGIN TODAY AT TEST CENTER  </P> <P> Air show enthusiasts and plane buffs can catch a glimpse of wing walkers,  parachutists, aerobatic gliders and hangars full of planes at the Pacific  Missile Test Center this weekend.  </P> <P> Aerial stunts will be performed today and Sunday between 12:30 and 4 p.m. at  the Point Mugu Air Show, with live entertainment during the morning beginning  at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> Air show organizers expect about 55,000 people each day, Cmdr.  </P> <P> Gene Okamoto said.  </P> <P> The show, in its 28th year, will feature stunt men and women from Southern  California and across the country. One local performer, Joanna Osterud of  Oxnard, will perform loops in a new biplane this year, center spokesman Bob  Hubbert said. The Sierra Aces, based in Santa Monica, and the Skylark North  Aerobatic Team, based in Tehachapi, also will perform, he said.  </P> <P> The air show offers the community a chance to see the base at Point Mugu, which  is normally closed to the public, Okamoto said. "It's a community relations  event to show the taxpayers what we're doing with their dollars," he said.  KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

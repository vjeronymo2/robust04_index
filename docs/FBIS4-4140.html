			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 26 (XINHUA) --  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today reiterated U.N.'s  determination to use NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb  Forces if they do not withdraw from Gorazde by midnight.    "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different  resolutions which have been adopted by the United Nations (and  NATO) and that they will withdraw from Gorazde to a perimeter of  20 kilometers, and that we will not be compelled to use air  strikes tonight at 8 o'clock New York time," said the  secretary-general in a press conference in Bridgetown, Barbados  today.    "But if they will not withdraw... [ellipses as received],"  said the secretary-general, "Then we will use air strikes  against them without any hesitation," according to a U.N. news  release today.    The NATO April-22 decision said all Bosnian Serb heavy  weapons must be withdrawn by 0001 GMT on April 27 (0800 New York  time). Otherwise, "These weapons and other Bosnian Serb military  assets, as well as their direct and essential military support  facilities, including but not limited to fuel installations and  munitions sites, will be subject to NATO air strikes."</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / US warship diverts tanker to uphold Iraqi oil sanctions A US warship has intercepted a ship suspected of carrying Iraqi fuel in a breach of United Nations sanctions and diverted the vessel to Kuwait under escort for further investigation, Reuter reports from Kuwait. 'We boarded it and diverted it. It's loaded with diesel fuel that we believe to be from Iraq,' a US navy spokesman said. 'We have substantial evidence that she went to Iraq. . . The ship has been turned over to Kuwait.' The guided missile cruiser Leyte Gulf, part of a ship monitoring operation carried out in the past four years, stopped the Honduran-flagged tanker Al Mahrousa in international waters in the northern Gulf on Saturday, the spokesman said. Navy and coastguard personnel boarded the Russian-built tanker to check whether it was violating the UN oil embargo imposed on Iraq over its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, he added. One shipping source said the vessel, which displaces about 7,300 tonnes when fully loaded, was carrying about 3,000 tonnes of diesel. It had an Egyptian and Pakistani crew. The Kuwaiti government was expected to work with the UN sanctions committee to decide what to do with the vessel. A Kuwaiti defence ministry spokesman said he understood the ship would be brought into a Kuwaiti port under escort later yesterday but declined further comment. Another Kuwaiti official said Kuwaiti naval officers were inspecting the ship and would escort the vessel into al-Shuaiba port. According to the US navy. the captain said the Al Mahrousa had been to Iran. But the ship had maps only for the Khawr Abdullah waterway leading into Iraq. It had no documentation, no bill of lading and no manifest. Kuwait radio said several of the crew indicated it had loaded diesel fuel in Iraq's port of Basra. The US vessel that intercepted the Al Mahrousa was part of the UN Maritime Intercept Operation that monitors ships coming from or bound to Iraq in the Gulf. The boarding was the second in 10 days and occurred amid heightened tension in the Gulf region as a result of Iraq's troop deployment near the Kuwaiti border earlier this month.</p>

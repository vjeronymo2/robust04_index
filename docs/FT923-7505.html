			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Banks warned of severe staff crisis INDUSTRIAL relations in clearing banks are threatened by an unprecedented mixture of job losses, branch restructuring and truncated promotion prospects, according to a report to be published this week. Although banks are attempting to change staff relations policies to cope with their moves towards increased competitiveness, new tensions and the breakdown of the old 'paternalism' are putting staff loyalty at risk, the report says. 'Staff trust in management appears to be at a low ebb, producing the seeds for future conflicts. The level of resistance, of grievance and of resentment remains high,' say the study's authors, Mr Peter Cressey, a sociology lecturer, and Mr Peter Scott, a research officer, both of Bath University. The paper points to the significant job losses, with the number employed in banking as a whole falling from 504,000 in 1990 to 450,000 last year, as one factor in the destabilisation. Career structures are also being affected by banks' increased emphasis on the ability to sell financial products and services to customers. 'There is considerable resistance among the banks' lower and middle managerial staffs, aged in their 40s and above, to the idea of the bank administrator as a salesperson first and foremost,' the report says. In addition, recruitment is becoming increasingly segmented. As management and technical services become more specialised, the banks are employing an increasing number of part-time workers, mainly women, whose promotion prospects out of clerical jobs are limited. This latter group is becoming increasingly dissatisfied, says the report. The study says that each of the 'stabilising pillars of employment levels, employees' career structure and industrial relations at the banks has individually been threatened before. What is new is that rather than being relatively self-contained in their own spheres, they are now interwoven constituents of a general crisis in employment relations.'

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Quebec selling off asbestos interests QUEBEC'S ASBESTOS fibre industry, once the western world's biggest, is being returned to the private sector. A Quebec government agency is selling its 55 per cent interest in Asbestos Corporation and its 100 per cent of Bell Asbestos and Atlas-Turner to a small Quebec mining group for CDollars 34m (Pounds 14m) over 10 years. The minority shares of Asbestos Corporation will still be held by the public. The former separatist Parti Quebecois spent well over CDollars 500m in the early 1980s nationalising and supporting the industry, up to that point dominated by General Dynamics, other US interests and the former Turner &amp; Newall of Britain. These companies gradually pulled out because of the anti-asbestos health campaign.</p>

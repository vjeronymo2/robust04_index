			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Brussels split over car industry training plan A PROPOSAL that the European Community pay car companies to retrain workers is causing ructions inside the Commission. The proposal calls for a major effort in vocational training and retraining in anticipation of industrial and technological change, to help the European car industry develop 'lean production' methods. These efforts would embrace staff in companies or sectors undergoing change who need new qualifications in order to adapt to changes in the nature and content of jobs. Commissioners running social and regional programmes are concerned that the proposal could result in existing funds targeted on long-term unemployment and vocational training for the young could be drained away to private companies. Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner, was yesterday pressing for changes to the Commission paper, which was prepared by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner. Mr Bangemann's suggestions on training policy in the car industry anticipate the Maastricht treaty, which has yet to be ratified, and policies to improve the competitiveness of European industry in the Commission's new five-year financial programme, on which member states are sharply divided. Furthermore, some Commission officials are concerned that whatever is decided for the car industry will become a model for EC industrial policy as a whole - and that French car companies such as Renault and Peugeot will be the prime beneficiaries. The proposal, to be discussed by the Commission today, anticipates taking money from the Social Fund - the 'structural fund' targeted on unemployment  -to upgrade skills of car workers who are not being made redundant. 'It's like robbing the poor to pay the rich,' one official in the social policy directorate said. 'It is an enormously big step to fund training within companies,' he added, arguing that this would eat into the Community's social role, with little practical guarantee that the measures would be effective, or that companies could not use the funds for general training purposes. The policy paper explicitly rules out the latter, but it is notoriously difficult for an understaffed Commission to keep tabs on the use to which EC money is put. As well as trying to equip EC industry with the means to face growing competitive challenges in front-line industries like cars, electronics and defence, the incipient industrial policy is also trying to address a training gap. The Commission, mainly through the Social Fund, funds training for the unemployed at the 'bottom end' of the market, while the Council of Ministers provides finance for mainly higher education programmes at the top end. Until now there has been no strategy for the 'middle' of the training spectrum.</p>

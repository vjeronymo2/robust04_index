			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry on  Saturday [12 February] revived appropriations of some 2.8  billion yen for the draft foreign aid budget for fiscal 1994,  while tacking some 700 million yen onto the defense budget,  ministry official said.    The agreements came amid annual bargaining between the  ministry's budget drafters, the Defense Agency and the Foreign  Ministry prior to government approval of the fiscal 1994 state  budget, slated to come during a cabinet meeting Tuesday.    On Thursday, the ministry proposed fiscal 1994 Official  Development Assistance (ODA) spending of 1.05 trillion yen, up  by a record low 4.0 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 ODA  budget.    The agreed-upon budgetary revival calls for adding 1.09  billion yen for Japan's refugee assistance program and an  additional 1.7 billion yen for grants to poor countries.    The agreements also authorize the Defense Agency to spend an  additional 273 million yen to finance a noise abatement program  to ease the troubles of residents in areas surrounding U.S. or  Japanese military bases, the officials said.    The ministry earlier proposed a defense budget of 4.68  trillion yen, up 0.8 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 budget.    It was the first time in 34 years that the growth of Japan's  defense budget failed to rise above the 1-percent mark, the  officials said. In fiscal 1960, Japan's defense budget eked out  a tiny 0.6 percent rise.    The ministry also approved additional spending of 424  million  yen to finance a personnel training and recruitment program for  the self-defense forces, they said.    The budget drafters have been in negotiations with officials  from other ministries and agencies since Friday after the  ministry Thursday proposed a 73.08 trillion yen draft budget for  the next fiscal year that will start on April 1.    The draft budget projects a mere 1.0 percent growth but  virtually shrinks from the initial fiscal 1993 budget.    In Saturday's negotiations, the Finance Ministry also  approved the restoration of a 140 million yen budget request  made by the environment agency for improving environmental  information systems.    Among other restorations of budget requests, the ministry  approved the Health and Welfare Ministry's request for a 1,150  million yen budget for improving the infrastructure for the  handicapped and the elderly.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Red-line entries rock reinsurers US PRODUCT liability laws lie behind virtually all the financial troubles facing the London and Lloyd's insurance markets, one of the UK's leading insurance lawyers says. Mr David MacIntosh, senior partner of City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper, told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans yesterday that the debris created by the US system was tangible. Over 400 insurers in the US were subject to insurance company supervisions, conservatorships, rehabilitations and liquidations. Giant US corporations such as John Mansville, the asbestos manufacturer, and AH Robins, the pharmaceutical group, had been forced into Chapter 11 protection and insurers and reinsurers around the world were 'reeling from red-line entries'. But it was possible that over-regulation and over-protectiveness had backfired on US consumers, making the practice of medicine too defensive, closing municipal facilities which could not afford to insure, discouraging production of life-saving vaccines and wiping out insurance companies. These concerns were echoed by Mr Victor Schwartz, a US product liability lawyer, who saw a strong case for saying the US system, far from keeping bad products off the market, merely stopped development of good ones.</p>

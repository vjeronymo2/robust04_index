			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Opel head blames industry woes for DM503m deficit Mr David Herman, chief executive of Adam Opel, blamed 'the worst year in the automobile industry in a decade' for a loss of DM503m (Dollars 320.4m) at General Motors' German subsidiary last year. The loss, which followed a net profit of DM259m in 1992, was likely to be followed by a 'dramatic improvement' during the current year, the chief executive said. Mr Herman declined to expand on this, saying there were a number of uncertainties ahead. 'We don't know how quickly Germany can free itself from recession,' he said. Opel had returned to profitability in the first six months of the year, said Mr Gail Gunderson, finance director. However, he warned that it was unlikely to make a profit in the year as a whole. Market share of new cars registered in Germany in the first five months of 1994 was down by 1 per cent to 15.6 per cent. Mr Herman blamed this on poor availability of the new Omega model early in the year, and predicted that market share would be back to 17 per cent by the year-end. The Omega alone was expected to win a 3 per cent market share. The depth of the downturn last year was reflected in a 21 per cent fall in the number of Opel cars registered in Germany, from 671,000 to 530,000, a decline which translated into a drop in market share from 17.1 to 16.6 per cent. Turnover for the German operations was down from DM29.1bn to DM21bn last year, a 21 per cent fall. The results were hit by a DM360m loss on currency translation, and a charge of DM370m to cover early retirement and other rationalisation measures. There were further, unspecified costs associated with the change to production of the new Omega and Corsa models. The losses at Opel in Germany helped hold down profits at the Opel/Vauxhall group in Europe, to just under DM1bn, Mr Herman said yesterday. General Motors is the overall market leader in Europe with a 12.5 per cent share. Mr Herman said that between January and May this year, Opel's market share had risen in 11 European countries. He declined to give details on the state of litigation in the case of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former General Motors director who joined rival Volkswagen last year. Mr Herman confirmed that the US Justice Ministry had lodged a formal request for judicial help with its Bonn counterpart. He also cast doubt on a report compiled by the KPMG accountancy firm exonerating Mr Lopez from being in possession of confidential material belonging to General Motors, as GM alleges.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Scott's clean sheet: Tony Jackson speaks to Al Dunlap, the papermaker's tough boss The Philadelphia headquarters of Scott Paper, the world's biggest tissue maker, are a pleasant sight on a fine autumn morning: squirrels scamper by the pond and the flags of nations flap in the breeze. Mr Al Dunlap, Scott's new boss, hates it. The success of a corporation, he says, is in inverse proportion to the size of its headquarters. Corporate HQs are monuments to the chief executive's ego. Scott's is up for sale. So is much of the rest of the company. Earlier this month Mr Dunlap sold its coated papermaking business for Dollars 1.6bn. On Monday he sold its power stations for Dollars 350m. Still to go are its woodlands and pulp mills, bringing the grand total, he hopes, to Dollars 3bn. Since Mr Dunlap arrived as head of Scott Paper in April, 34 per cent of its worldwide staff - 11,000 people - have lost their jobs. He believes this is a record: IBM may have sacked more in absolute numbers, but their proportion was a mere 13 per cent. He is particularly proud of the fact that 71 per cent of Scott's headquarters staff have gone, including nine of its 11-strong executive committee. The result of all this, he says, is 'one of the great stories in corporate America today'. When he arrived, Scott was 'a stodgy old company which had totally lost its way'. In six months, he has turned it round. The proof lies in the only criterion he cares about: the share price has risen more than 60 per cent. Mr Dunlap started out as a military man, and it shows. An ex-paratrooper with a parade-ground voice, he had his first taste of management running a nuclear missile site near Washington in the early 1960s. After a career in industry which began with Scott's rival, Kimberley Clark, he spent the late 1980s as chief hatchet-man for Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. Had Sir James's bids for either US group Goodyear Tire or BAT Industries, the British conglomerate, succeeded, Mr Dunlap would have been sent in to run them. His admiration for Sir James remains unstinting: 'Clearly the smartest person I ever met in my life, and the next was a footnote to him.' In everything, he says, they thought alike. The alliance seems an odd one: Sir James, the polished Old Etonian, and Mr Dunlap, the son of a shipyard worker from Hoboken, New Jersey. But each is in his own way an outsider; and nowhere is this more evident than in their shared contempt for corporate America. 'Sir James and I coined the phrase 'corpocracy' - companies run for the benefit of bureaucrats rather than the shareholders. I take the simple view that the shareholders run the company. They take all the risk. Show me the company which pays the shareholders back if things go wrong, and I'll show you the company that can afford to ignore them. 'Scott was a microcosm of that. Its shareholders would have been better off captured by terrorists. They'd have been treated better.' The Dollars 3bn he is raising through the sale of assets, he says, is equal to Dollars 40 a share. 'When I joined the company, the share price was Dollars 37.75. Back in the Goldsmith days, that would have been a godsend. You could have bought the world's biggest tissue company for nothing.' Those responsible have paid the price. 'When you do a turnround, you must by definition get rid of the top people. They're the people who got it wrong, and if they did it once they'll do it again. Every corporation has a culture. In a corporation which is not doing well, you must eradicate the culture.' He thumps the table. The problem about turnrounds, he says, is that people dislike change and respond to it with criticism. 'That's where managers fail. They succumb to criticism. I don't have that problem. If you want to be liked, get a dog: in business, get respect.' (He himself has two dogs. Sir James's comment on this was: 'I see you're hedging your bets.') Now that the turnround Mr Dunlap has engineered with such shocking suddenness is almost complete, where does Scott goes from here? Mr Dunlap shrewdly recognises that he has an image problem on this. He is indelibly associated with the corporate raiders of the 1980s, of whom the standard criticism was that they could cut costs, but they could not build. He is quick to reject the charge. It was never as true as people said, he claims. Sir James and he invested far more than people gave them credit for, and he is investing a lot in Scott now: in a new venture in China, in Mexico, in Arizona. Ask him where the world leader in tissues goes from here, and he instantly says it is not the leader, just the largest. 'We're not the best. Our best competitor now is probably Procter &amp; Gamble. They're a good marketing company.' He has just recruited an ex-Procter man to run his marketing. Besides, he observes, much of the paper industry is more concerned with tonnages than with making money. 'I asked a guy here how much we made in a particular grade, and he said, so many tonnes. I said, what's that in dollars? And he said, I'll come back to you. 'I thought, this guy's a humorist. I enjoy a joke, I was waiting to see what he'd come back with. It turned out he was serious.' It seemed superfluous to ask what happened next. Since he joined the company, he has invested Dollars 4m of his own money in Scott shares. In a move calculated to cause a flutter in corporate America, he has decreed that all non-executive directors will be paid exclusively in company stock. The shareholders, he insists again, are all that matter. 'If you're paid to run the corporation, then by God run the corporation. If you do your job and pay your taxes, the rest takes care of itself.'</p>

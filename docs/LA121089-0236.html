			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ALL SUBURBS ARE NOT VIEWED ALIKE BY CAR INSURERS;  </P> <P> PROP. 103: UNDER THE NEW INSURANCE PRICING REGULATIONS, RATES WILL VARY FROM  ONE SUBURB TO ANOTHER, AND SOME CHANGES MAY COME AS A BIG SURPRISE.  </P> <P> When is a suburb not a suburb? Answer: When it comes to setting auto insurance  rates in the areas around the urban core of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In releasing new pricing regulations last week to implement Proposition 103,  state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie predicted they would mean premium  cuts for urban areas and limited increases for suburbs.  </P> <P> But when auto insurers set their prices, not all suburbs will be treated the  same.  </P> <P> Most drivers living in areas that now have the highest auto insurance prices --  including the Westside, Inglewood, the southern parts of the San Fernando  Valley and most of the South and East sides of Los Angeles -- should see some  rate relief.  </P> <P> Insurance experts say drivers in less populous areas of Los Angeles County,  such as the Antelope Valley, will probably experience some small rate increases  when insurance companies prepare new pricing plans in accord with Gillespie's  new regulations.  </P> <P> But there is still a big question in many outlying suburbs -- the far reaches  of the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys, the South Bay area, Pomona Valley  and the Simi and Santa Clarita valleys -- whether most drivers will receive  increases or decreases.  </P> <P> Gillespie's regulations interpreting Proposition 103 strike down consideration  of sex and marital status as well as a driver's ZIP code in setting insurance  prices. Instead, a driver's safety record, annual miles driven and years of  driving experience, in that order, will become the most important factors in  pricing auto insurance.  </P> <P> But the picture is complicated by Gillespie's listing of 25 optional pricing  factors, some of which insurers could use as substitutes for neighborhood-based  or gender-based pricing.  </P> <P> For instance, by calculating such things as population density, vehicle  density, theft rates and litigation rates, insurers could still be able to  charge a driver according to where he or she lives. In measuring miles driven,  and even accident rates, insurers may be able to find substitutes for gender  factors in assessing claims and setting premiums, since males tend to drive  more and have more accidents than females.  </P> <P> Another major complication in an extremely complicated situation is that  Gillespie has told insurers that, except in cases of drivers with poor safety  records, rates cannot increase more than the Consumer Price Index, a measure of  inflation. This, in effect, will limit most increases in 1990 to 5%.  </P> <P> Rather than seeing their overall revenues drop, insurers may be inclined to  calculate the rating factors in such a way as to give urban drivers as little  of a decrease as possible. Under the new system, such drivers would be expected  to get some of the highest decreases.  </P> <P> All of this presumes that Gillespie will prevail in court, where insurers are  expected to challenge the regulations.  </P> <P> Assuming the regulations do stand and are allowed to become permanent, what is  in store for the Los Angeles region?  </P> <P> It is easy to conclude that most drivers now paying the highest rates -- in  South Central and East Los Angeles, Hollywood, Inglewood, Beverly Hills,  Westwood, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks -- will get some decrease. The  regulations are designed to benefit them the most. Gillespie has said these  drivers will still pay more than drivers in outlying areas, but the comparative  difference in their rates will narrow.  </P> <P> There will be some exceptions to this. For instance, a resident in these areas  who drives a lot each year, say 20,000 miles or more, and has not had years of  driving experience may be hit with higher rates.  </P> <P> Those who would benefit the most are experienced middle-aged or elderly drivers  who don't drive many miles each year and now pay extremely high rates because  they live in a central city ZIP code.  </P> <P> It seems fairly apparent that most of those living in the Antelope Valley, who  now pay the least for auto insurance in Los Angeles County, would pay more. But  the increase couldn't be more than about 5% unless their record of accidents  and traffic violations is bad. In that case, such drivers may pay a lot more.  In fact, that will be true no matter where such drivers live.  </P> <P> The great uncertainty will come for drivers living between the highest priced  and lowest priced areas. That includes millions of people.  </P> <P> Steven Miller, the consumer advocate who has become a paid consultant working  with Gillespie to interpret Proposition 103, pointed out last week that many of  the optional factors the commissioner will allow insurers to use as a  substitute for a driver's home address or ZIP code cannot be calculated by ZIP  code or by the present insurance pricing territories.  </P> <P> For instance, litigation rates can be measured only by judicial district,  Miller said, and these districts are much bigger than most ZIP code territories  the companies are using now to calculate rates.  </P> <P> Take the case of a driver living in an outlying area of the San Gabriel or San  Fernando valleys who has been benefitting under the present system from a  considerably lower rate than a person living closer to the central city, even  within these valleys. When the litigation factor is considered, such a driver  may be lumped in with the persons living further in, possibly bringing rates  up.  </P> <P> Population density, similarly, is likely to be measured by census tract. Those  tracts are likely to vary from the present insurance territories, resulting in  another kind of readjustment.  </P> <P> In August, Gillespie calculated what would happen if she simply ruled out  neighborhood-based pricing without providing any substitute pricing factors,  and without limiting price increases. She estimated prices would decline by  about 3% in Burbank, 16% in Canoga Park, 18% in Santa Monica, 20% in central  Los Angeles, 22% in Sherman Oaks and 47% in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> At the same time, she estimated prices would increase 3% in Palos Verdes, 5% in  Glendale, 12% in Pasadena, 14% in Redondo Beach, 15% in Torrance, 18% in El  Segundo, 20% in Whittier and Downey, 22% in West Covina, 25% in Norwalk, 27% in  Saugus and 57% in Palmdale.  </P> <P> But now, because she has limited the rate of increase to the Consumer Price  Index for the previous year and because she has introduced the substitute  factors, all of these calculations are no longer valid.  </P> <P> The price swings are going to be far narrower. And the ultimate outcome on  rates is far from clear, particularly in the areas Gillespie cited for small  increases or decreases.  </P> <P> Gillespie and the special attorney who drew up the regulations, Karl  Rubinstein, say the regulations are not designed to be revenue neutral. They  envision the companies receiving somewhat smaller total revenues than they now  do.  </P> <P> But the companies are expected to calculate the new premiums in such a way as  to be as close to revenue neutral as possible, giving them as much in total  premiums as they get now. It would then be up to Gillespie to reject them if  she finds them unsatisfactory.  </P> <P> In the meantime, some observers think that when the companies come up with  their new rates, they will propose increases to as many drivers as possible by  the maximum 5% or so, while offering cuts to as few as possible. If that is the  strategy, many of those living in the areas in between the central urban  neighborhoods and the rural valleys could find themselves charged slightly  more.  </P> <P> Each company will make its own separate calculations of the pricing factors  Gillespie has allowed, in terms of claims expected and the degree of risk.  </P></p>

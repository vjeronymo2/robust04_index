			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Next steps in the Mideast THE POLITICAL landscape of the Middle East has taken on a slightly surreal aspect this week. If both sides are to be believed, Israel and the Palestinians may be on the point of signing an agreement that will provide an interim framework for Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. As remarkably, Israel may agree to withdraw its troops from an area of the West Bank around Jericho and from Gaza as a first step towards military disengagement. To cap it all, Mr Yitzhak Rabin's coalition government may break a taboo of decades by recognising the PLO; allowing Palestinian leaders to set themselves up in Jericho; and even affording protection for top PLO personalities as they seek to sell the deal to sceptical or hostile constituents. It would scarcely come as a surprise after all that to read of lions whelping in Jerusalem's streets. Can this be the same Mr Rabin as had disappointed so many expectations since he was elected last year with a promise to reach a rapid Middle East peace agreement? Is this the same PLO that vowed in its founding charter to wage 'armed struggle' until Israel was destroyed, and that has proved singularly incapable of seizing opportunities for progress towards an accommodation with the Jewish state? Weary precedent suggests caution is in order. Much could still go wrong as the Washington peace negotiations enter their 11th round. Many details of the purported Israeli-Palestinian accord remain unclear or contested; other participants such as Jordan and Syria are rattled by a deal struck behind their backs; and the Palestinian movement is even more fractious than usual  -divided between the occupied territories and the diaspora, and stalked by the threat of an assassin's bullet. Nevertheless, the claims of breakthrough are sufficiently insistent for the outside world, and in particular the US, to embark now on a concerted effort to ensure that it occurs. Great credit It is to the great credit of Mr Rabin's government and of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, that the two sides have got this far largely on their own. Doing so required the super-cautious Mr Rabin to manoeuvre delicately: gradually acclimatising Israelis to the idea of talking to their sworn enemy while at the same time guarding his flank against charges of jeopardising Israeli security. For Mr Arafat, negotiating from extreme weakness, the risks are if anything even greater. But he has shown commendable single-mindedness in carrying most of his rebellious cohorts along towards an agreement that will fully benefit only some of them. Cherished principles The problem is that Israel and the PLO may not be capable of arriving at their destination unaided. The distrust between them and among Arab leaders remains too great. Moreover, Mr Arafat's legitimacy among his own people is not undisputed: many Palestinians suspect him of throwing overboard cherished principles - such as the status of Jerusalem - to strike a deal while he can. To still such fears, the US should now decisively raise the profile of its involvement and nudge the parties further towards clarifying their intentions. Both Israel and the Palestinians should state clearly that this agreement is an interim one without prejudice to a final settlement in any respect, including Jerusalem. Jordan and Syria should be offered high-level American reassurances that the Israeli-Palestinian deal is part of the multilateral process, not designed to cut them out. Most important, the structure of the Middle East negotiations - which currently institutionalises Palestinian divisions by directly involving only hand-picked representatives from the occupied territories - urgently needs to be changed. Israel should go the extra mile and sit openly with the PLO without insisting that it go through the difficult and tortuous process of amending a charter that Mr Arafat has already declared null and void. If Mr Rabin is worried that such a step would imply eventual Israeli acceptance in principle of an independent Palestinian state, so be it. Some form of Palestinian sovereignty is the only basis on which a final settlement can be reached, and it would be better to admit as much now.</p>

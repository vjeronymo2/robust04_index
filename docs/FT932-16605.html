			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Observer: Mao-thballed Only a dash of colour (red, perhaps) can save the politically correct 'Mao jacket', if China's fashion designers are to be believed. The cheerless blue or grey high-collared jackets that were the stern revolutionary uniforms of Mao Zedong's day are selling so poorly in China these days that even a 60 per cent discount cannot shift them from the warehouses, according to yesterday's China Daily newspaper. Beijing's Meidu Garment Factory - chosen by the Ministry of Light Industry as a leader in quality Mao jackets - has ceased production and shops are clearing them from their shelves to make way for more stylish and pricey, western brand names. 'The first thing to do to restore the Mao jacket's popularity is to brighten up the colour,' one garment designer said.</p>

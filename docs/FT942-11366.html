			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Socialist Euro-MPs' boycott infuriates Italy Socialist Euro-MPs yesterday provoked a furious reaction from Italy's president after voting to boycott any Italian neo-fascists taking part in EU institutions. The action follows last month's election victory by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's three-party coalition, which includes the far-right MSI/National Alliance. The Socialists, set to dominate the increasingly powerful Strasbourg assembly after next month's Euro-elections, say they will withhold co-operation from the Council of Ministers of the 12 on vital issues like the EU budget if Italy is represented there by neo-fascist ministers. They have also decided to block parliament's mandatory endorsement of the new European Commission - due to take over in 1995 - should a Berlusconi government seek to send a neo-fascist Commissioner to Brussels. The move brought an instantaneous angry reply from Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and cast a cloud over the formation of the next Italian government. President Scalfaro was so furious over what he regarded as an unwarranted interference in internal affairs of an EU member that within eight minutes of the vote he had issued a formal reply. The lapidary tone of the reply made his feelings clear: 'Italy's adherence to principles and values that form the basis of Europe is crystal clear and beyond discussion, and we need no one to either tell us this or offer to give us lessons.' The full parliament, in which the Socialists are already the largest bloc, voted late on Wednesday night to remind Italy that it 'must be faithful to the fundamental values which lay behind the foundation of the European Community.' The motion - an unprecedented intervention in the politics of a member state  -was carried by 189 to 188. The Christian Democrats, now the second largest bloc at Strasbourg, including the parliament's president, Mr Egon Klepsch, voted against. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said yesterday: 'This Union was founded on the ashes of fascism.' He denied interference in Italy's internal affairs, saying that 'we are delivering a warning that this Union is a partnership which depends on shared fundamental values.' Italian opposition parties exploited the vote to remind Mr Berlusconi he faced problems in allying so openly with the MSI which had yet to dissociate itself from its fascist roots. The Strasbourg vote comes at an awkward moment for the media magnate turned politician. Mr Berlusconi's efforts to form a government are foundering on the insistence of the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi on the key portfolio of the interior ministry. Mr Bossi has threatened to stay out of the government unless this post is given to the League. If the deadlock is not broken within the next 24 hours, Mr Berlusconi could well have to rely for his main support outside his Forza Italia movement on the MSI. The League would merely offer unstable external backing in parliament. In Strasbourg the Socialists also decided to expel from their bloc any MEP seen as siding with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia group. They have three to four MEPs in their sights, including Ms Maria Magnani Noya, a vice-president of the Parliament for the nearly defunct Italian Socialist Party. Last week, the so-called Rainbow Group of regional parties in the parliament asked its two members from the Lombard League - the third element in Mr Berlusconi's coalition - to leave their bloc, because of their alliance in Italy with the neo-fascists.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Anger of Muslims and Backward </F> People Caused Congress' Defeat"]    [Text] Bombay, 21 December (N.P.)--One of the main causes  of the Congress defeat in the Bombay Municipal Corporation  bye-elections in six wards was the anger of Muslim and backward  classes against the Congress Party. There was a significant  increase in the votes for the Janata Dal. It will not be easy  for the Congress (I) to form another government or win the 1995  general election . It is very likely that Shiv Sena will take  over the Bombay Corporation again.    It appears that the Muslim voters have not forgotten the  destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992  and the destructive riots that followed it. That is why they did  not vote for the Congress (I) candidates. Almost 100 percent  Muslim votes went to the Janata Dal candidates. If we compared  the results of the general elections held two years ago with  these bye-elections, we will find that the votes for the Janata  Dal have almost doubled. In Dharawi, the Janata Dal candidate  received 3388 votes. Similarly, in Tulsiwadi and Nayagaon, they  received more than 1400 votes compared to the 800 votes received  last year.    The backward classes also did not give all of its votes to  the Congress (I) because of the change in nomenclature. They did  not only not vote for the Congress, but did not give full  support even to Savita Jitia (Tardev), a Dalit candidate  representing coalition of the Congress and Republican Party of  India. The number of the Dalits in that district was more than  half.    The Shiv Sena leaders are overjoyed at this victory and the  Congress (I) leaders have started to accuse each other. The  unhappy group of Congress councilors is ready to come out in the  open against Ramanand Lad, the leader in the Corporation.  Veteran city councilor R.T. Kadam is leading this group of young  councilors. He himself is also in the race for becoming the  mayor. Mr. Lad has lost some prestige because of the defeats of  Congress candidates, especially in Dharavi. Ramanand Lad (the  future mayor) was given the responsibility of making sure that  the Congress (I) candidate from here wins.    It will be difficult for the Congress (I) to have its  candidate as the mayor. The Shiv Sena has increased its number  of seats from 67 to 71 after winning four more seats. The number  of Congress members is 109 now. The number of the joint  opposition has increased to 110. These numbers clearly indicate  that there will be a lot of bartering during the next mayoral  elections in March 1994.    Looking at the committed supporters of Shiv Sena, and the  Muslim and Dalit voters who are unhappy with the Congress (I),  it is clear that the Shiv Sena might win the majority in the  next election. The Muslims knew that voting for the Janata Dal  was indirectly voting for the Shiv Sena. Still, they did not  vote for the Congress (I). Mr. Gunwant Seth, a Congress worker  who visited homes for votes during the election, said that the  Muslim voters expressed distrust in the Congress (I) in these  words, "We can give the key to our house to Shiv Sena people,  not to the Congress (I).    The Congress (I) leaders are blaming these reasons, bogus  votes, lack of committed workers, and the fact that the major  leaders did not take this election seriously for their  defeat.</p>

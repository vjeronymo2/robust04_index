			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Panic as French quit Rwanda France pulled its last troops out of Rwanda yesterday, triggering chaos at a border crossing as Hutu refugees tried to storm across into Zaire, Reuter reports from Bukavu. After being blocked by Zairean troops firing into the air, the refugees last night were streaming south along a riverside trail to another border crossing eight miles away. The rush to the Ruzizi border post leading into Bukavu broke out less than half an hour after 150 French Legionnaires crossed into Zaire, signalling an end to the French humanitarian mission in Rwanda. Ethiopian United Nations peacekeepers stood by helplessly as hundreds of refugees swarmed across a rickety bridge and tried to overrun the Zairean border post. While the Zairean troops stopped the rush to the border post, other refugees managed to swim across the river or to get across using straw mats as makeshift rafts. The chaotic scenes provided an unwelcome background to the end of France's controversial two-month humanitarian mission. Now that the French have left, the Hutus fear reprisals by members of the Tutsi tribe, who have ousted the former government and seized power in Rwanda. The Hutus have voiced suspicions of the 800-strong Ethiopian contingent, which is part of the 2,200-strong African UN mission in Rwanda. They suspect the Ethiopians may be sympathetic to the Tutsis. The French pulled out despite concern by the UN and aid agencies about the implications for the south-western Rwanda protection zone they had guarded. French officials say there are 2.5m people in the 'safe zone' against only 1.9m in the rest of Rwanda. In the last two days more than 45,000 Hutus have managed to cross into Zaire, joining many thousands of others already there. Zaire said the border closure at Bukavu was motivated by a fear of a huge refugee influx like that at Goma recently. Some relief officials also voiced fears of a new exodus. 'We're trying to prevent them clogging up the town because it is an absolute death trap,' said one aid worker. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said trucks today would ferry Rwandans split from their families by the abrupt closure back to Bukavu and funnel others to new camps on the outskirts of the settlement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "df": "The Classic Wage Agreement Is a Thing of </F> the Past"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 Mar--Hans Peter Stihl, president of  the German Industrial and Trade Association--the first to call  for "zero-change negotiations" for 1994 wages--"is now pleased  that the earlier assessment by the employers that `zero-change  negotiations are naive and confrontational,' was contradicted by  the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement."    In retrospect, Stihl also favors the employers' spectacular  cancellation of the metal industry's vacation compact. "It was  necessary for the employers to give this unequivocal signal to  emphasize the seriousness of the situation. Such a sledgehammer  approach is sometimes needed when dealing with trade unions to  help them understand economic realities."    Stihl said that this time the metal industry had been able  to  avoid disproportional increases for low-wage groups, which in  the past had contributed to a steadily rising unemployment base.  In the course of such mistaken wage policy, wage groups I and II  had been abolished. Thus, an important potential source of  employment was voluntarily eliminated. It would help facilitate  reincoporation of the unemployed if these two wage groups were  resurrected.    It is unfortunate that the Industrial Trade Union of Metal  Workers resisted an increase in the 13/18 percent ratio of  employers with a 40-hour workweek. An increase in this ratio is  necessary to strengthen research and development in the German  metal industry. "It is still true that in Japan research and  development engineers and other highly qualified employees work  up to 600 more hours a year than in Germany. In the long run, we  cannot afford such a disparity."    The current differentiation in the workweek in the metal and  electrical industry could be regarded as adequate, especially  since many companies have not taken full advantage of all the  options offered by the wage agreements. "And for that I would  criticize the corporations; they demand greater flexibility  without taking full advantage of existing rules."  <H5>  Opening Wage Negotiations to Corporations Is Not Rescindable </H5>   The Hannover secure employment agreement, which opens the  way  for plants to negotiate wages, is limited to two years. There  will now be many deviations from collective bargaining  agreements. Stihl thinks that it will be impossible to rescind  such variations after two years to return to an industry-wide  wage agreement. "The opening for the plants must and will  continue to exist; the traditional industry-wide wage agreement  cannot be maintained since it no longer meets the needs of a  widely varied industrial structure."    However, Stihl opposes wage agreements differentiated by  metal branches. After all, industrial branches can develop wage  policies tailored to their needs since the plants now have that  opportunity. In the course of time, the in-plant agreements will  show certain patterns for each industrial branch since there  will be an internal exchange of information within each branch.  That should be enough. The overall metal-industry association  should not become the manager of the varied collective wage  arrangements of the different branches of the metal industry.  "Because then, it would become necessary for the overall  metal-industry association to subdivide into numerous branch  associations. It is an advantage that we only have a few  associations in Germany which negotiate with the trade unions  independently. Thus, the authority to negotiate is consolidated  in the metal industry's overall association. But to allow as  many associations as possible to consolidate, the collective  wage agreements should only contain minimum provisions."    If the economic climate improves again, the works councils  will try to rescind the wage sacrifices to which they have now  agreed. This will create many conflicts within plants, and the  Works Council Statute has not provided the machinery to resolve  such conflicts.    The president of the German Industrial and Trade Association  is convinced that the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement  will create a precedent for the public service sector. "The  signals emanating from the collective bargaining agreements of  the Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers--the largest  industrial trade union in Europe and even the world--have always  determined subsequent agreements with other trade unions.  Actually, the agreement with the Public Services,  Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union should fall  significantly short of that of the metal industry."    Stihl called on German industry to pay more attention to  college and university graduates. His firm is currently  conducting an 18-month training program for such graduates with  reduced pay in which they can gain work experience and augment  their expertise.    Stihl commented on the dispute about nursing-care insurance,  which industry considers to be badly conceived. If it fails,  there is a chance that it could be reinstituted under private  law, which is the only approach industry approves. "The  political contortions that an amazed public has been exposed to  hurts the reputation of all parties." That a team of experts is  now supposed to find a mode of compensation, "is simply another  harebrained idea in a long series of strange ideas that have  been advanced on this subject."    Commenting on the economic programs that the political  parties have now evolved, Stihl said they all seemed acceptable  at first glance. For instance, if the German Social Democratic  Party [SPD] calls for greater fiscal economy or for relief for  industry, one can support the idea. However, when it comes to  financing, it becomes apparent that the SPD wants to resurrect  preoccupation with envy. It talks about "unwarranted income,"  and wants higher taxes on the income of top management.  <H5>  Politics Cannot Produce Jobs </H5>   This is not the way to finance the government, just as  politicians cannot solve the unemployment problem with work  programs. "There is only one primary labor market and all  political attempts to stimulate employment by artificial means  are bound to fail."    Instead of becoming entangled in employment policies, the  government should cut expenses. "There is no reason why Germany  needs to pay for 16 land governments, 16 landtags, 16 land  administrations and more than 600 Bundestag representatives.  Consolidation is just as urgently needed here as in industry.  However, contrary to political institutions, industry attacks  its problem with great zest."    Stihl criticized the "remarkable lack of scruples," the  United States demonstrated to create the tools to apply pressure  on Japan's trade policies. It is, of course, correct as always  maintained that the type of surplus Japan achieves in trading  with North America can only be explained by the fact that  Japanese markets are not so open as is always claimed.  Distribution channels in Japan are firmly in the hands of large  conglomerates which can control the success or--more often--the  failure of an importer. Thus, one does have a right to demand  that Japan become more open. But according to Stihl such demands  for openness should apply to the whole Western world and not  just bilaterally to the United States.    German industry welcomes the expansion of the European Union  with the addition of the nordic states and of Austria. These  states are aware of the need for stability and favor free trade.  However, this expansion creates a need for reform within the  European Community. Sixteen countries can no longer be subjected  to Brussels' penchant for regulations but must be treated in  accordance with the principle that only those acts are  legitimate that member states cannot perform for themselves.</p>

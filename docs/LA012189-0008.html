			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> A one-time Jewish presence in China, notably in Shanghai, will be relived this  Passover season in a visit mixed with nostalgic and business motives.  </P> <P> Rabbi Abner Weiss of Beverly Hills' Beth Jacob Congregation was recently in  China to finish arrangements to serve kosher food at the upcoming International  Assembly of Jews in China, to be held April 18-23.  </P> <P> Organizers of the event say it indicates that the Chinese government's desire  to attract international investment and business from Jewish communities. Yosef  Tekoah, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and a one-time Shanghai  resident, said the return trip will be "a tangible restatement of our faith in  Jewish survival and our friendship toward China."  </P> <P> Considering that China does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, the  event is "a welcome development," Weiss said.  </P> <P> The first modern Jewish settlement in the country was in Shanghai in the 19th  Century, mostly by Iraqi Jews seeking new business opportunities. The Jewish  population in the city swelled to more than 20,000 during the pre-World War II  flight of refugees from Europe.  </P> <P> Buildings once important to the Jewish settlement will be identified by signs  during the visit. The group will also visit Beijing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> The Rev. Stanley E. Olson, the last Los Angeles-based bishop of the old  Lutheran Church in America, has accepted the pastorate of Grace Lutheran Church  in Santa Barbara. The church is a 350-member congregation of the new  Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Olson was not elected a bishop when the  Lutheran Church in America merged with two other denominations in 1987. Olson  will be installed as pastor March 12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DATES  </P> <P> A Pepperdine University conference on "Christian Perspectives: Issues Facing  the New Administration" will feature keynote addresses by U.S. Sen. Mark O.  Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Roman Catholic scholar Michael Novak of the American  Enterprise Institute. The opening session on Thursday includes a discussion on  how the Churches of Christ, a national fellowship of autonomous churches linked  to Pepperdine, relate to the political arena. About 300 scholars, students and  political activists are expected to attend the three-day conference. JOHN DART  </P></p>

Measures  toward that end are being developed by the Army General Staff.  Possible actions include the use of Army helicopters to back up  the work of the Federal Police. Three aircraft are already  operating in Manaus at the Military Command of Amazonia. In the  future, a company of those aircraft will be assigned there, as  the embryo of a future Helicopter Battalion in that region, Army  sources say.</p>

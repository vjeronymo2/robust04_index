			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: A 'Spitting Image' Lysistrata - Theatre It would be almost impossible to mount a production of Lysistrata more shocking than the original. The erections, the blue jokes and, above all, the satire are there in profusion in the Aristophanes text of 412 BC when - to put it mildly - the war with Sparta was going badly. Sir Peter Hall has achieved the impossible in another way. His production is not shocking, not funny, not erotic, not topical and consequently has lost the satire. If it were put on in Bosnia, it would have about as much effect on the warring factions as a newspaper editorial urging mutual restraint. Hall's direction at the Old Vic has the television programme 'Spitting Image' written all over it. The men are old buffers; the women, far from looking remotely like Helen of Troy or her ilk, resemble pantomime dames. This is the original 'Spitting Image' mistake. If you make the targets look over-grotesque, more like puppets than people, you diminish the force of the satire because it is not close enough to reality. In Hall's Lysistrata, the error is compounded. The essence of Aristophanes's play is the force of sexual attraction. Only by withdrawing their favours do the women compel the men to make peace. Even then Lysistrata has a hard enough time keeping the rest of the women in line because the females are just as libidinous as the males. It would be good, indeed one expected, to see some of this sexual longing at least hinted at on stage. Yet if you make the women look like harridans and the men like left-overs from the Crimean War, you have negated the point of the play. No-one could care a fig about this lot. Hall is not acknowledging the power of sex; he is knocking it. I also object to the extraneous use of four letter words; in Lysistrata there is plenty of room to use them literally. An accompanying blunder, though it is part of the same pattern, is that the characters wear masks. There is no reason why this should be so, but I suppose that if you give the women giant artificial busts, you might as well conceal their facial beauty as well. The other fundamental error is Ranjit Bolt's verse translation. I admired Bolt's early work: for example, his translations of the Corneille comedies. The trouble is that his style has become excruciatingly repetitive. Again there is no necessity for a modern English version of Lysistrata to be in verse at all. It would go down perfectly well in prose. What Bolt offers is a string of couplets like: 'I'll be the lousiest lay he ever had/ He won't have dreamed that sex could be so bad.' One knows that Aristophanes is ribald; the effect is spoiled when the words descend into drivel. There is a further lost opportunity in the set. The background world is covered with slogans. It must have been possible to devise a few wittier wilier graffiti than 'We hate all Spartans' and 'Your country needs you.' There is very little sense, apart from a burst of machine gun fire at the end and a few helmets, that a war is going on, lovely or otherwise. Joan Littlewood would have been acutely embarrassed. All that is a great pity, for Lysistrata is played by Geraldine James who should have ideal for the role. She struggles manfully against the obstacles. There are a couple of good songs, one where Ms James goes into splendid cabaret-style and leads the women's chorus in 'I made you give up sex to save the nation.' The other is the men's chorus with 'I've got to find a pimp/Before this thing goes limp.' I know the words are weak, but it sounds all right and there is some nice saxophone. The performance runs for 90 minutes without an interval. The ending especially is intolerably slow, for once Lysistrata has made her point there is nothing left to happen, not even the joy of sex. Old Vic Theatre (071) 928 7616 American theatre is getting a good showing on the London fringe at present, and deservedly so. At the New Grove, a relatively new pub theatre in the Euston Road, there is a revival of Sam Shepard's The Tooth of Crime, which was first performed at the Open Space in 1972. The piece has its origins in the Rock and Roll, drugs cult of the late 1950s and, like much contemporary American drama, contains more than its share of violence. However, it is the quality of the writing and the variety of the playing that stand out. If the images are those of Hollywood, they adapt very well to the stage. The outstanding performance in The Tooth of Crime is by Guy Oliver-Watts as Hoss, the rock singer who is ultimately overtaken by the new age. There is a touch of Hamlet in the play which goes beyond the verbal duelling and is clearly deliberate. Direction is by Richard Kimmel who heads a Boston-based company called Empty Gate. Unfortunately it runs only until Saturday, but a new Sam Shepard, States of Shock, is opening at the Salisbury Playhouse in association with the Royal National Theatre Studio later in the month.

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORENZ BELL GRAHAM; WROTE OF BLACK LIFE  </P> <P> Lorenz Bell Graham, a former missionary, probation officer and social worker  credited with bringing realistic black characters to young people's literature  by building many of his tales around the English folk patois of African  peoples, has died in West Covina.  </P> <P> Graham, known particularly for his "Town" series about a young black's struggle  to overcome racism as he becomes a doctor, was 87 when he died Monday of  cancer, his daughter, Ruth Siegrist, said.  </P> <P> A one-time probation officer for Los Angeles County, Graham had lived in  Claremont since 1970 when he joined the faculty of Cal Poly in Pomona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trip Piques Interest  </P> <P> Son of a Methodist minister who traveled widely throughout the country, Graham  accepted a teaching-missionary assignment in Liberia while still a student at  UCLA. The journey piqued Graham's interest in things African, and he began to  conceive the stories for which he became well known. His first, "How God Fix  Jonah," published in 1946, was a collection of biblical tales told in Liberian  dialect.  </P> <P> In 1947, he published "Tales of Momolu," an outgrowth of stories he had told to  children about a small boy in an African village.  </P> <P> The New York Times wrote that, "The American reader will recognize Momolu as  just another fellow," a judgment that Graham sought throughout his work, once  saying that "as a Negro I grew up with fears and hatred for white people and  came to understanding of these destructive emotions only after being outside  the United States and separated from the 'race problem.' "  </P> <P> He returned to the United States where he received a bachelor's degree from  Virginia Union University in Richmond and became an assistant to black  historian W. E. B. DuBois. He was a social worker in New York in the 1950s, and  in 1957 came to Los Angeles as a deputy probation officer, retiring in 1967.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uses Other Topics  </P> <P> In addition to folk tales for and about young Africans, he wrote of John  Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and novelettes for which critics praised his  ability to tell tales in a distinctly African way that retained the  universalities that were his goal.  </P> <P> His "Town" series ("South Town," "North Town," "Whose Town?" and "Return to  South Town") was published from 1958 to 1976 and described the travails of the  young black David Williams as he becomes a physician.  </P> <P> "As a group," wrote critic Rudine Sims, "these books tend to celebrate the  courage and determination of Afro-American families and individuals who are  faced with racism, oppression or violence . . . the idea that while blacks must  take responsibility for their own lives, blacks and whites can learn to coexist  -- that people must be judged as individuals."  </P> <P> "Someone," Graham said, "should write about the unheroic quiet ones, those who  know the evils and feel the pain of injustice and discrimination but hold on to  their hope and continue to struggle for a better life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Receives Many Honors  </P> <P> "South Town" received a best novel award from the Child Study Assn. of America,  one of many honors Graham received throughout his life.  </P> <P> In 1969, Graham was a participant in Los Angeles in what was then called Negro  History Week and observed at a seminar that "life isn't a matter of black and  white . . . it is more a matter of fear and hope . . . right and wrong."  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, the author Ruth Morris Graham, two sons, two  daughters, 15 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held Saturday at noon at McCarty Memorial Christian  Church, 4101 W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles.  </P></p>

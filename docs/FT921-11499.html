			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bosch reports further decline ROBERT Bosch, the German motor components, telecommunications and engineering group, yesterday reported a further decline in operating profit and warned that moderate wage deals would be necessary for any improvement in 1992. Turnover rose 5.5 per cent last year to DM33.6bn (Dollars 21bn), with domestic sales up 11.5 per cent to DM17.5bn, helped by the stimulation to demand provided by unification. Foreign turnover was flat at DM16.1bn. Bosch, owned by a foundation, gave no actual profit figures for last year. In 1990, net profits fell by 11 per cent to DM560m. As a big supplier to motor companies worldwide, Bosch could be a key target  -as in the 1984 engineering strike - for selective union action aimed at disrupting the sector. The engineering pay round has not begun, but a ballot by the IG Metall union in the steel industry is expected to lead to a strike. Bosch's experience in the last strike was one reason for its decision to locate more production abroad. Another was the high cost of German production. Bosch cut its world labour force by around 8,000 people (excluding the impact of acquisitions) last year to try to improve profitability. Most cuts were at German plants. Bosch also announced plans to take control of two motor equipment companies in Czechoslovakia.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN CASH NOW SLUICING TO STATE PARTIES  </P> <P> The 1988 presidential election was distinguished by name calling,  misrepresentation and a new low in personal vilification. But that's not all  the bad news. The worst is that the system of electoral finance reform, which  took from 1971 to 1979 to work out, has effectively been overthrown. This is  not to say that anyone acted illegally. If anything, we might point to the  success of the 1970s by noting that it took political money men another decade  -- 1979 through 1988 -- to figure out ways to get around the law.  </P> <P> Federal campaign finance laws were intended to ensure open and fair elections.  They focused on money because we have come to equate it with communication, and  because it is the easiest thing to measure. The backbone of the federal law is  built on limitations and disclosure. Individuals can contribute up to $1,000,  organizations $5,000, to candidates in congressional and presidential  primaries. Individuals can also give up to $20,000 to the parties, but not more  than an aggregate maximum of $25,000 a year to candidates and parties. The  security of the law lies in its disclosure provisions -- who gave what to whom  -- and how the money was spent. The laws were aimed at eliminating fat-cat  contributors and undue influence of big business.  </P> <P> In 1988 the fat cats came back in force, which is about all we know, except  that more money probably went to state parties than elsewhere. We don't know  specifically how much they gave, where it went nor how it was spent, because  the information is too diffuse. We know that reports to the Federal Election  Commission indicate a greater than 50% increase in state and local party  spending that was coordinated with presidential campaigns between the last two  elections; between 1984 and 1988, California state parties reported an increase  in contributions from $5 million to $10 million for Republicans, from $2  million to $8 million for Democrats. Both parties' national committees -- after  a bit of pressure from such groups as Common Cause -- published lists of donors  who contributed $100,000 or more.  </P> <P> One of the most controversial loopholes in the law is its allowance of  independent spending -- defined as money spent by an individual or a group in  advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, without contact between the  spender and the candidate or his election committee. More than $9 million was  so spent in the 1980 election; in 1984 that had more than doubled to $20  million. Most of it was spent by New Right groups, such as the National  Conservative Political Action Committee and the Fund for a Conservative  Majority.  </P> <P> Although the impact of independent spending on the election was never clear,  the groups themselves were controversial because they could not be held  accountable for their behavior or the nature of their message. Campaign  managers considered them wild cards, even when they supported their candidate.  Most campaigns and both parties tried to direct funds away from such spending  into the mainstream.  </P> <P> Although independent spending was down in 1988, the principal reasons are  probably the nature of the campaign and the decline of big spending groups  because of death and squabbling among their leaders. The largest spender in  this election was a new group, the National Security Political Action  Committee, which produced the controversial Willie Horton ad used against  Michael S. Dukakis; the committee accounted for more than $10 million of the  $17 million in 1988 independent spending.  </P> <P> Because presidential campaigns are publicly funded during general elections,  with private contributions prohibited, the parties are the last mainstream  vehicle for donors.  </P> <P> State parties were "discovered" in the 1980 election when the Republican  National Committee targeted 12 critical states and coordinated $9 million in  contributions from big givers, telling them how much to give and where to give  it. A donation from California to the Florida state party would be reported in  Tallahassee, but no one in California or Washington outside the campaign would  know about it. The Democrats made a similar but smaller effort, and both  parties have been developing such programs ever since.  </P> <P> The good news is that the money is going to the parties where it has the  potential for doing far more for party-building than any reform since the  Progressive era. That fact makes Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.'s decision to take  over the California Democratic Party an astute move; if the state parties are  the last remaining conduit for big contributors beyond presidential election  years, the state parties will be the place to be in the 1990s. With better  resources to recruit candidates and run campaigns, the parties would not be as  dependent on self-selected candidates, and be more likely to promote those best  able and qualified to win office and govern.  </P> <P> When we wonder why we fail to attract the best men and women to public office,  we cannot ignore the terrible burdens we put upon them -- not the least of  which is the ordeal of raising money (a Senate campaign, for instance, now  takes an average of $4 million). If the parties can supply most of what it  takes to win, without requiring candidates to mortgage homes and empty bank  accounts, we would all be better served.  </P> <P> Popular prejudice notwithstanding, political parties serve a critical function  in American democracy. They are principally in the business of winning  elections, and they cannot win if they put up candidates who fail to represent  the interests of the majority of voters because they are too ideological or too  corrupt. Increased funding is both to their benefit and ours.  </P> <P> On the negative side, the most important consequence of this boom for the state  parties is that it comes at the expense of a belief that campaign reform laws  eliminated fat-cat contributors.  </P> <P> While it is no surprise that the GOP is indebted to the business community, the  Democrats are just as dependent on large donors -- and have been, since the  days of John F. Kennedy. They have made substantial strides in the past 10  years, developing a small-contributor base through direct-mail solicitations.  While Democrats trail Republicans by 2-1 in fund-raising, the gap narrows every  year.  </P> <P> There will be some discussion in Congress this term about the growing  proportion of money given by political action committees (PACs) in  congressional elections -- an issue long-overdue for attention. But the  perception of abuse because of fat-cat contributors may be a greater threat to  campaign law integrity. This goes to the very heart of reform intention.  Whether "soft" money (from individuals and corporations, giving at the national  level for state parties) subverts the process, or whether there is only such an  appearance, the need for reform seems clear.  </P> <P> The best proposals would not eliminate the money but would make clear the  source and amount, so that anyone interested in the flow of influence could  tell who did, in fact, give what to whom. All the soft money that goes to the  national parties can easily be reported to the Federal Election Commission; so  should be all large in-state (more than $1,000) and all out-of-state  contributions to the state parties.  </P> <P> Much soft money is already reported one way or another. What is missing is a  central reporting location for state parties and any reports at all from  congressional campaign committees. It may just be a problem in perception, as  the attorneys for the parties contend, but it is a perception related to basic  beliefs about what elections are and should be in a democracy.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Intervention blows Germany off M3 target THIS week's massive Bundesbank intervention to prop up the French franc will send September's German money supply figures even further out of the 1992 target range, despite money market operations to mop up liquidity, economists said yesterday. Frankfurt dealers estimate at between DM10bn (Pounds 3.9bn) and DM20bn the intervention needed to keep the French currency within the bands of the exchange rate mechanism in the past two days. This has been carried out by both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, whose currency reserves have come under substantial pressure. The sharp fall in French monetary reserves comes in the wake of the run on the currency holdings of the other weak ERM currencies in the past 10 days. At the same time, the Bank of Italy is believed to have continued discreet intervention to support the lira this week, in spite of the decision to maintain a floating rate outside the ERM. The Bank of Spain is estimated to have used up Dollars 15bn, or 20 per cent of its Dollars 70bn currency reserves, to defend the peseta during the period of currency turbulence. Liquidity created by unprecedented D-Mark central bank sales throughout Europe will expand further Germany's already fast-growing money supply. Economists forecast an annualised expansion rate of more than 10 per cent for M3, the broad monetary aggregate, this month after a higher than expected 9 per cent for August. 'This means there will be no real scope for further interest rate cuts,' said Mr Nigel Rendell, European economist at stockbrokers James Capel. 'Even though the figures will be distorted, a further easing at this stage would make a mockery of the Bundesbank's linking of policy to M3.' A further ERM realignment, involving a D-Mark revaluation against the franc, would enable the bank to cut rates, but the Bundesbank would probably also want to see Bonn tighten fiscal policy. Yesterday, the Bundesbank acted to drain funds from the money market, with more expected today. The central bank has been offering currency swaps and treasury bills at rates of 8.9 per cent for two days. It also extended maturity periods for bills and swaps due yesterday. Dealers expected the Bundesbank to offer four-day bills and swaps today to last beyond the weekend. Dealers estimated that the treasury bill sales on Monday and Tuesday took around DM16bn from the market, with the currency swaps draining a further DM10bn or more. The central bank did not offer a further securities repurchase deal to replace the DM20bn falling due yesterday. Overnight rates were down to less than 1 per cent last night. 'I doubt if they can sterilise the full effect of the intervention,' said Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets. 'We have to expect very poor money supply figures'. Mr Rendell reckoned M3 could be up by at least a net DM20bn this month compared with DM16bn in August and DM8bn in July. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, gave a figure of DM60bn for ERM support efforts up to last week. The further support of the French franc has considerably added to this. 'The Bundesbank will be concerned at the scale of intervention, but will not see it as the end of the world just because one month's figures have jumped,' Mr Hubbard added. However, he said this could lead it to consider 'de-emphasising' its reliance on M3, as other economists have suggested.  --------------------------------------------              CURRENCY RESERVES  --------------------------------------------                     Germany     France                     (DM bn)    (FFr bn)  -------------------------------------------- Jan                   95.1        91.2 Feb                   95.9       102.7 March                 97.3       103.6 April                 98.0       105.6 May                   98.7       105.7 June                  96.8       104.2 July                  97.6       102.9 Aug                   98.0        97.7 Sep 22*              160.0        50.0  -------------------------------------------- *Bankers' estimates Source: Bundesbank, Banque de France  --------------------------------------------</p>

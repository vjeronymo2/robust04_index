			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 23, IRNA -- A scheduled visit to  Baghdad this Saturday [25 June] of an Iranian foreign ministry  delegation has been postponed without indefinitely. [sentence as  received]    The postponement, according to a foreign ministry spokesman  here tonight, is due to the terrorist bomb blast at the holy  shrine of Imam Reza (as) in Mashhad on Monday last that took the  lives of 26 mourners on the day of Ashura (martyrdom anniversary  of Imam Hussein) and injured about 170 others.    The terrorist Mujahidden Khalq outfit (MKO) has been held  responsible for the blast.    The visit to Baghdad was within the framework of pending  matters between Tehran and Baghdad.</p>

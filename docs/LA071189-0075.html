			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> YOU CAN BE SURE THEY'LL HAVE ONE GOOD OLD TIME TONIGHT  </P> <P> They're both way too old to do what they do, but there they were Monday  afternoon, in center field at Anaheim Stadium. It was the American League  All-Star workout, under a scorching sun, and they were playing a game with a  bat and a ball.  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan, age 42, baseball's power pitcher laureate, was darting around a  small area in deep center field, shagging sharply hit baseballs.  </P> <P> Jimmie Reese, age 83, baseball's all-time fungo king, was 10 paces in front of  Ryan, swinging his skinny bat like a weapon, working Ryan back and forth across  the grass like Boris Becker working Stefan Edberg.  </P> <P> It was like old times, when they were on the same team and when they became  lifetime friends. They both came to the Angels in 1972, Ryan from the Mets and  Reese from a minor league coaching job.  </P> <P> The first day of spring training, someone instructed Ryan to go shag in the  outfield. Reese was waiting with his trusty toothpick of a bat, and he fungoed  Ryan around the outfield for a solid half hour without so much as a 10-second  break.  </P> <P> "I was hitting 'em all over the park," Reese said Monday, smiling. "We finished  and Nolan asked someone, 'Who the hell is that fella? He's going to kill me the  first day.' "  </P> <P> By the time the season started, the two were in the habit of grabbing a cab  together to get to the ballpark early, before the rest of the team, to have  time for extra outfield work. Even on days Ryan was to pitch, Reese would run  him for five or 10 minutes in the outfield, to help him loosen up.  </P> <P> They ate a lot of meals together, caught a lot of movies, talked a lot,  developed a solid friendship.  </P> <P> Ryan called Reese "Dunk," which is an offshoot of Donk, short for Donkey, and  pretty soon that was Reese's only name in the clubhouse.  </P> <P> What did the two men have in common?  </P> <P> "I have no idea," Reese said. "I can't imagine why we became friends. I'm about  100 years older than Nolan."  </P> <P> Simple, says Ryan, a man with a reputation as one of the game's true gentlemen.  "Dunk's just a good person. I just gravitated to him."  </P> <P> In '77, Ryan and his wife, Ruth, had their second son and they named him Reese.  </P> <P> Two years later, the Angels let Ryan slip away. Dunk stayed on and is still an  Angel coach.  </P> <P> They remained friends. Ryan still phones Reese frequently, and they get  together for lunch when they're both in Los Angeles. When Ryan pitched his  fifth no-hitter, he shipped the game ball to Dunk.  </P> <P> Ryan rejoined the American League this season, and when his Texas Rangers came  to Anaheim last week, he worked for 20 minutes in the outfield, chasing Dunk's  fungoes. Joining Ryan in the workout was his 12-year-old son, Reese.  </P> <P> Monday and today, Dunk and Nolan are teammates again, their dressing cubicles  side-by-side in the American League All-Star team's locker room.  </P> <P> Ryan is having a remarkable season for the Rangers and was edged out for the  All-Star starting nod by Oakland's Dave Stewart.  </P> <P> Reese is having another remarkable season, too, running Angel pitchers and  outfielders nearly to death with his bat. His pet project -- "My new bobo" --  is a quiet, young, bullet-throwing pitcher named Jim Abbott.  </P> <P> In honor of Reese's seven decades in a baseball uniform, he was asked to throw  out the ceremonial first ball at tonight's All-Star game.  </P> <P> The request took him by surprise.  </P> <P> "Mr. Giamatti (Commissioner Bart Giamatti) phoned me and asked me if I would do  him a favor, if I would throw out the first ball," Reese said. "I thought it  was a joke."  </P> <P> The Angels' clubhouse this season, remember, is hotfoot heaven, prankster  paradise. So Reese said to the caller, "What's the gag?"  </P> <P> And Giamatti said, "No, this is serious."  </P> <P> Reese hung up and phoned an Angel official, who assured Jimmie that the  invitation was legit. Who better for the first-ball honors? Reese broke into  baseball in 1917 as a batboy for the L.A. Angels of the triple-A Pacific Coast  League, a team managed by Frank (Tinkers-to-Evers-to-) Chance. Seventy-two  years later, Reese is still an Angel, still playing a kid's game, making  friends, epitomizing the spirit of the sport.  </P> <P> He wasn't a bad player in his day, either. Reese was a fine infielder, working  his way to the major leagues, playing for the Yankees in 1930 and '31 and for  the Cardinals in '32.  </P> <P> He also played 13 seasons in the Pacific Coast League. When the all-time PCL  All-Star team was selected, Reese was the second baseman.  </P> <P> At New York, Jimmie was Babe Ruth's roommate and occasional running mate, and  he was also befriended by Lou Gehrig. Those were two vastly different  personalities, Ruth and Gehrig, but Reese hasn't run into anybody in 72 years  that he doesn't get along with.  </P> <P> Ryan, though, holds a special place.  </P> <P> "He's probably my best friend in the game," Reese said.  </P> <P> Reese was sad when Ryan left the Angels in a dispute over money, and even  sadder when Buzzie Bavasi, then the general manager, dismissed Ryan as a common  .500 pitcher. Reese is very proud that Ryan has proven otherwise, that he has  become one of the marvels of sport.  </P> <P> "He's done baseball proud, that man," Reese says.  </P> <P> For 17 years, Reese has been applauding the accomplishments of his great  friend. Tonight, for a moment before the game, it will be Jimmie Reese taking  the bow, and his proud friend applauding from the dugout steps.  </P></p>

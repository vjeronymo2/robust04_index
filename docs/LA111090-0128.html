			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA HAS SHOT AT NO. 1 CONTENDER;  </P> <P> BRUINS: WASHINGTON'S MOTIVATION COMES FROM BEING ONE SPOT BELOW NOTRE DAME IN  POLLS.  </P> <P> Any notion UCLA had of tiptoeing into Husky Stadium and surprising Rose  Bowl-bound Washington today has become merely an idle thought.  </P> <P> The Huskies, who have mauled every Pacific 10 Conference opponent they have  played this season, are motivated by national championship aspirations.  </P> <P> Washington, 8-1 overall and 6-0 in the Pac-10, is ranked second, behind Notre  Dame. If the Irish lose to Tennessee today and the Huskies beat UCLA, as  expected, Washington most likely will become the No. 1-ranked team in next  week's balloting.  </P> <P> The Huskies have never won a national championship, but they have become  dedicated to that purpose.  </P> <P> Only UCLA, Washington State and the Big Ten representative in the Rose Bowl  remain on the schedule.  </P> <P> "The national championship is the goal now," Husky quarterback Mark Brunell  said. "We're contenders, and people are accepting how good a team we are."  </P> <P> Awesome may be a better description, considering how the Huskies keep elevating  their game each week.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Since beating Oregon, 38-21, Oct. 13, Washington has beaten Stanford,  California and Arizona by increasingly higher margins each week -- 52-16, 46-7  and 54-10, respectively.  </P> <P> In its six league games, Washington has outscored the opposition by an average  of 33.6 points.  </P> <P>  -- The Huskies waste little time in asserting their superiority. They have  outscored their Pac-10 opponents, 72-7, in the first quarter. A blocked punt by  Arizona State accounted for the only touchdown allowed.  </P> <P>  -- Washington is the Pac-10 leader in virtually every statistic and is ranked  first nationally in rushing defense, allowing an average of only 65.7 yards a  game.  </P> <P>  -- The Huskies have a smothering defense and an effective offense led by  Brunell and tailback Greg Lewis.  </P> <P> Brunell, an inexperienced sophomore at the start of the season, has completed  53.6% of his passes for 1,242 yards and eight touchdowns while throwing four  interceptions in the last seven games.  </P> <P> Washington Coach Don James says that Brunell is the fastest quarterback he has  had. The 6-foot-1, 205-pounder from Santa Maria is the team's second-leading  rusher, averaging 4.5 yards a carry.  </P> <P> Lewis is the mainstay of the running game. He has gained 100 or more yards in  nine consecutive games for a season total of 1,229 yards and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P>  -- James has always emphasized the importance of special teams. So the Huskies  excel in another area. Beno Bryant, a reserve tailback from Los Angeles Dorsey  High, has returned three punts for touchdowns. The Huskies also have blocked  two punts.  </P> <P> So, these are the seemingly overwhelming factors UCLA will be confronting  today.  </P> <P> The Bruins, 4-5 overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, will have to beat Washington  today and USC Nov. 17 to have a winning season. It isn't likely.  </P> <P> Even so, UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox is not ready to concede anything. He is  aware, of course, that the Huskies will try to rattle him with blitzes, or the  threat of the blitz.  </P> <P> "We can't look at Washington as some elite team. They're another team we have  to face," Maddox said.  </P> <P> "It will be tough, though, with their crowd and all the energy they've built  up. It's going to be the toughest game of the season. We don't have anything to  lose at this point. We have a chance to upset them, and we have to look at it  that way."  </P> <P> Maddox said the key to beating Washington, if there is one, is to pass  successfully because the Huskies don't allow any team to run.  </P> <P> "If we beat Washington, it will be amazing how many people will forget about  the close games we've lost," Maddox said. "Everybody says our program is not  what it used to be. But if we beat Washington and go into the USC game on a  high, it's going to be exciting for the program and the fans."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> It has been raining here and more showers are forecast today. . . . UCLA Coach  Terry Donahue has a 7-4-1 record against Washington and 3-2-1 in Seattle.  </P> <P> Four UCLA players were left home with injuries: defensive end Mike Chalenski,  with a shoulder problem; defensive tackle Brian Kelly, with a pinched nerve in  his neck; and offensive tackles Derek Stevens and Rick Fuller, with ankle and  knee injuries, respectively. . . . Shawn Wills is expected to start at  tailback. Brian Brown is bothered by a bruised thigh. . . . Kevin Williams, the  No. 2 tailback, has flu and didn't make the trip. . . . Vaughn Parker, normally  the starting right guard, will play right tackle, with Mike Linn filling in for  Parker.  </P> <P> Washington's offensive line averages 293 pounds with strong tackle Lincoln  Kennedy checking in at 315 pounds. . . . Inside linebacker Chico Fraley, from  La Puente Bishop Amat High, is one of 10 Southern Californians who play  regularly for the Huskies. . . . Washington's Rose Bowl appearance will be its  11th bowl game in the last 12 seasons.  </P> <P> Arizona offensive guard Rob Flory on the Huskies: "That's the best team I've  ever seen. They've got to be No. 1. We came in here thinking we could play with  them. After halftime, though, you could see some guys giving up."  </P></p>

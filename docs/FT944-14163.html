			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: South Korea chip exports soar South Korea exported semiconductor chips worth Dollars 8.83bn in the first nine months of this year, up 70.8 per cent from Dollars 5.17bn a year earlier, the trade ministry said. Brisk exports were largely due to enhanced competitiveness abroad because of the strong Japanese yen, ministry officials said. The ministry forecast semiconductor exports would reach Dollars 12bn for the year, up from Dollars 7.03bn in 1993.</p>

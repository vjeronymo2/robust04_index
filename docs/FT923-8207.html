			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price tumbles as NY investors bail out NEW YORK platinum futures were tumbling in late trading yesterday as the precious metals markets moved into reverse. The active October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was almost Dollars 20 down at Dollars 348.50 a troy ounce in late trading. 'They are bailing out,' one New York floor analyst said as stop-loss sales by commodity funds and others hit the market. On the New York Commodity Exchange gold and silver futures followed platinum down. In late trading the December gold contract was down more than Dollars 8 at Dollars 342.30 a troy ounce - well below key support levels. 'There is no reason to own any of these metals at recent levels - either technically or fundamentally. Reality is catching up to these markets,' one floor analyst told the Reuter news agency. Earlier gold fell on the London bullion market below Dollars 348 a troy ounce - widely regarded as a critical support level - as it continued to retreat from the recent high of just over Dollars 360. It closed at Dollars 346.35 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.30 on the day. London's platinum price also fell, shedding Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 367.75 a troy ounce. The market has been keeping a close eye on the falls in the Tokyo stock market, fearing that demand for platinum from Japan, the world's biggest importer, could slacken. Those fears sparked the hectic trading in New York, which was also responding to a further fall to fresh six-year lows in the CRB index of 21 futures, a widely-watched inflation indicator. The London gold market has retraced its steps by more than 50 per cent after the rally early last month. Some analysts believe the market could now fall back to this year's lows around Dollars 334, although others were suggesting that strong support would emerge at Dollars 345. The drift down over the last few days has been mainly due to professional selling by the large commodity funds, disappointed at the market's failure to push above Dollars 360, said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken. On some days in the past week as much as 250,000 ounces has been sold. However, analysts could not point to any single reason for the decline. Mr Jon Bergtheil of James Capel said there had been no developments in the currency markets and no Central Bank activity which might have pushed prices down. He suggested that De Beers' forecast of a dividend cut on Tuesday could have sparked some jitters over jewellery sales this Christmas. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, part of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert group, said that the weakening Australian dollar had led producers there to sell forward at ADollars 480 a troy ounce.</p>

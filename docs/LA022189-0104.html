			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SUNNY HOLIDAY DRAWS CROWDS TO BEACHES AND PARKS  </P> <P> Orange County residents greeted the President's Day holiday with delight Monday  as thousands filled the county's parks and beaches, firing up barbecues,  organizing pick-up softball games and generally enjoying the sunny, breezy  weather.  </P> <P> While the sun made a gallant showing, gentle but persistent winds kept  temperatures in the low- to mid-60s, sweaters on and the sun tan oil back on  the shelf. Still, the sunshine offered many the chance to get outdoors after  Sunday's intermittent rainfall.  </P> <P> At Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, about 2,000 people came through the  park's gates to enjoy the huge recreation area's picnic, sports and hobby  facilities.  </P> <P> "We've had a pretty good crowd for a winter day. It was sunny, but it was cool  enough for most people to keep their sweaters on," park ranger Jeff Bukshapan  said. According to Bukshapan, the park's model airplane and rocket-launching  hobby areas were packed most of the day.  </P> <P> At Irvine Park, about 700 people gathered to barbecue steaks, hamburgers and  hotdogs. Riding horses, playing pick-up games of touch football and softball  were also popular activities, park officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sun and Surf  </P> <P> "It was an excellent turnout," park official Scott Pritchard said. "I think  with the weather we have been having lately people were really looking forward  to the holiday. It was sunny, but many kept their coats on in order to be  comfortable."  </P> <P> Tom Tarpley, a Seal Beach lifeguard, said that about 5,000 people came out for  the sun and surf. A few people, braving chilly 55-degree waters, went swimming  or belly-boarding, Tarpley said. A handful of the swimmers received stingray  bites for their efforts, he said.  </P> <P> "It was a pretty good sized crowd, easily the biggest of this year. While we  had a few swimmers, I think that most of the people who came just wanted to  enjoy the sun," he said.  </P> <P> According to Gordon Reed, Newport Beach marine safety captain, about 8,000  people ventured onto the beaches at Newport and Balboa during the day.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of people out today. All seemed to be in a great mood and were  having a lot of fun. We had a gentle but steady westerly breeze for most of the  day, and it was just enough to keep things cool," Reed said.  </P> <P> Terry and Jayne Brenna, along with their children Erin, 4, and Ryan, 2, were  lured to Laguna Beach for a sunny, three-day Southern California weekend from  their home in Phoenix.  </P> <P> "This is great. We're having a lot of fun. We even have the required Disneyland  balloon in the back of the car," Terry said as the family enjoyed a fried  chicken lunch on the sand.  </P> <P> For state social worker Thomas Novak, 34, of Arcadia, the sunny weather meant a  chance to relax and do some people-watching on the Laguna Beach boardwalk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Great People Wtaching  </P> <P> "We wanted to get out and get some fresh air. I work indoors all week and I  really wanted to get out in the sun. Besides, the people-watching is great,"  Novak said.  </P> <P> The holiday for Golden West College students Theresa Arroyo, 21, and Keith  Minnie, 24, meant a day off from lectures and exams, and a chance to sample the  shops and eateries of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> "We haven't had a chance to get away for a while. Being here is like a small  escape, you might say," Minnie said.  </P> <P> Monday's high in Orange County was 69 degrees in Santa Ana, with El Toro and  San Juan Capistrano both reporting highs of 63, according to the National  Weather Service. Newport Beach posted the coolest daytime temperature with 57  degrees, up from an overnight low of 50.  </P></p>

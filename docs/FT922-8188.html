			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Du Pont's Dollars 300m issue eases shortage of high-rated deals THE international bond market saw a handful of mainly dollar-denominated deals yesterday, with Du Pont and City of Stockholm launching two medium-sized issues. Du Pont, the US chemicals group, is issuing a Dollars 300m, seven-year bond with a coupon of 7 1/2 per cent which is due to break syndicate today. Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager, expects fairly strong demand for the paper given the shortage of dollar-denominated issues from triple-A rated borrowers recently. Triple-A names have been unable to raise funds at sub-Libor costs recently, forcing investors who want to pick up a decent yield to focus more on well-known, but lower-rated issuers instead. The Du Pont issue was priced to yield 34 basis points over the seven-year US treasury bonds, which was considered a fairly tight pricing by some market participants. City of Stockholm launched a Dollars 325m floating rate note with a coupon of  1/16 below three-month Libor. IBM International Finance, the large computer company's financing arm which is used to support sales, is launching an Ecu 150m two-year bond with a coupon of 9.25 per cent. Paribas, the lead manager, reported demand for short-dated Ecu paper and said that the issue is aimed at retail and small institutional investors. The deal is the first bond issue from IBM since the company had its credit rating downgraded from Aaa to Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service, so the market was keen to see whether this had any effect on IBM's cost of funds. IBM is keen to maintain the same cost of funding and Paribas claimed yesterday that the company was borrowing on broadly similar terms to those commanded in the recent past, helped by better-than-expected first-quarter profits. IBM still has a triple-A rating from S&amp;P. In the D-Mark sector of the market, Corfin, the Czech leasing company, announced a DM25m private placement - the first private Czech company to issue a foreign currency bond. The bonds carry a coupon of 11 1/2 per cent and were priced at Libor plus 260 basis points and the issue is guaranteed by Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech foreign trade bank. Daiwa Europe, the lead manager, said most of the bonds have been placed mainly with German investors although some bonds were sold to the Japanese. Corfin, which leases cars, trains and small aircraft, is borrowing in the international markets for the first time but it is expected to return from time to time since it needs to fund its car purchases in D-Mark. Sumitomo Corporation, the Japanese group, launched a Y50bn five-year bond with a coupon of three-month Libor in the first three months, turning to 6 per cent thereafter. Daiwa Europe, lead manager, said most of the deal was placed with Japanese investors.</p>

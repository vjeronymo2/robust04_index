			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>   [Text] At least 17 people are now known to have been  killed by the collapse of Zhuhai's Yu Xin factory on Friday and  scores remain missing. Rescue workers were today planning to  continue their search for more victims still believed to be  trapped in the rubble.    The tragedy happened the day after fire tore through the  six-  storey printing and dyeing factory and while workers were on the  premises, reportedly trying to clear up and salvage goods.  Reports yesterday said the authorities had arrested three  welders they claim had started the blaze by igniting bales of  cotton in the factory, a joint Hong Kong and Chinese venture.  No one was hurt in that incident.    The factory site, five kilometres north of Macao, was  cordoned off by police, and reporters were barred from Zhuhai  People's Hospital where an emergency team awaited victims.  There were unconfirmed reports that one Hong Kong worker was  taken to hospital and three others had died in the tragedy.  Last night, 57 of the injured had left hospital and 101 were  still being treated.    All buildings in the region are being checked by officials  today for safety and fire security measures. Some workers  suggested a combination of thunderstorms and the fire had  prompted the collapse of the damaged building and that many more  bodies were still buried in the rubble. The factory employed  over 2,000 workers.    Labour activists in Hong Kong met in emergency session  yesterday and denounced greedy local investors who put profit  ahead of human life. A coalition of trade union and human  rights groups vowed to fight for strict worker safety  regulations, and planned to enlist the support of international  labour groups.    Rescue teams and firemen were reported to be among those  missing in the disaster, which occurred minutes after workers  were ordered back into the factory to salvage equipment in the  aftermath of Thursday's blaze. The area was not cordoned off by  government officials, according to local reports. "How come  these workers were allowed back in?" asked Lam Wah-hui, chairman  of the Joint Organisation of Unions in Hong Kong. "This is  crazy. The authorities should be guarding the site to prevent  this kind of disaster. If the area is unsafe, no one should be  allowed inside."    Representatives of eight worker, human rights and women's  groups met yesterday in the territory to form a coalition to  improve Chinese worker safety, said Winnie Tam, executive  secretary of the Confederation of Trade Unions. "We plan to  push investors to pay more attention to worker safety," she  said. "Most of these incidents involve Hong Kong investors. We  plan to advocate strong measures for the protection of workers  in China. They shouldn't be victims of Hong Kong investors."    The Zhuhai accident is the second this month involving Hong  Kong businessmen. A toy and plastics factory in Shenzhen  collapsed two weeks ago, killing 11 migrant workers. Last  November 84 people, mostly migrant women workers, died in a fire  at another Hong Kong- owned toy factory in Shenzhen.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Management: Experience of a lifetime / A look at the value of schemes that introduce young people to the world of work Work experience used to be a convenient way for schools to rid themselves of troublesome pupils and place them in the care of an unsuspecting employer for a fortnight. Developed from such inauspicious beginnings 20 years ago, the provision of work experience for the employee of tomorrow is the best established, the most popular and the clearest manifestation of the growing partnership between the worlds of business and education. Yet there is little agreement on the purpose. At government level, the experience is deemed valuable as an introduction for the young to the world of work, as a broadening of horizons; indeed, it is a recommended, although not a compulsory, element of the national curriculum for 15-16 year olds. At pupil level, motives are diverse. For some, it is less an educational experience, more a useful way of obtaining an inside track to a limited range of jobs. John Spires, Birmingham director of Project Trident, which finds work experience places for 125,000 pupils a year, recalled that earlier this year most of the 400 pupils in one group wanted to work in shops and offices. 'Only 18 or 20 wanted to go to engineering companies.' The most severe problem, suggested Robert Powell, communications manager of School Curriculum Industry Partnership, is matching young people to placements. 'Very often they choose according to what they know. Is it a more valid learning experience to get them to do what they don't want to do?' Although it can be taken for granted that no employer wants to play host to recalcitrant teenagers, employers themselves approach work experience from a mixture of motives. According to John Berkeley, education and careers manager at Rover Group, the car manufacturer: 'No apparent consensus exists among employers as to why their organisations, particularly those operating in a competitive, commercial environment, should devote time, effort and resources to providing pupil placements.' Spires, who spends much time talking to employers, listed a number of possible motives, including the following: To gain an extra pair of hands. To enlarge the pool of future labour. To influence what goes on back at school. To provide staff with supervisory experience. Such disparity of objectives inevitably means that the value of the work experience for the pupil cannot be guaranteed. 'A lot of it should carry a government health warning,' commented Berkeley. 'It is better to have none than that which distorts the view of work.' In this hit-and-miss world where work experience can mean shoving papers in files for a fortnight, sitting for hours at a checkout till - being used, in fact, as cheap labour - there tends to be a difference in approach between large and small companies. 'If I place somebody in the branch of a multiple shop or Land Rover, I would expect them to have a structured programme,' said Spires. 'If I place somebody in a small solicitor's office, what they get to do depends on workload and what time the partners have to spend with the kids.' Rover, itself, delivers the kind of structured programme that is being copied by other groups. Ideally, the company hopes that pupils coming forward for work experience will come from schools with which it already has a contractual partnership, so that the work experience is an integral part of a broader collaboration between school and industry. Although Berkeley noted that work experience should not be career-oriented - 'I would place equal value on work experience when the young person concerned realises that this industry is not for them'  - Rover consciously adopts a business approach to each individual placement. There is a learning agreement with each pupil, an extension of the contractual relationship it has with schools. This is the concept, Berkeley observed, 'of the employer as sub-contractor to the school'. The learning agreement seeks to enshrine the answers to three questions. What is to be learned? How is to be learned? What evidence of that learning will there be and how is that learning to be assessed? Last year 1,000 school pupils went through the process, not on the assembly line, but in the workshops, laboratories, test areas and offices of the group's plants. Elsewhere in industry, Spires said employers were more frequently asking the question: 'How can we take kids on to our premises when we are laying people off?'</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Reluctant spenders hindering recovery and continued reluctance by consumers to spend rather than save - hindered the recovery of consumer demand in the second half of last year, Central Statistical Office figures showed yesterday. Real personal disposable income fell by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second and by 0.6 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1990. The savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, dropped only marginally - from 11.2 per cent in the second quarter to 10.9 per cent in the third. The state of company finances provided no sign of relief for the economy, with seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO revealing a financial deficit of Pounds 2.5bn in the third quarter compared with Pounds 1.4bn in the second. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities, said that in spite of the latest increase the corporate sector's financial deficit would probably continue to shrink - the trend in previous quarters - as companies ran down stocks rather than invested. Gross trading profits of the UK corporate sector, net of stock appreciation, stayed at about Pounds 17.9bn, similar to the second quarter. The figure was maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits. Those increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter from Pounds 1.2bn in the second, thanks mainly to increased crude oil sales. Non-North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits fell between the second and third quarters from Pounds 16.7bn to Pounds 16.3bn. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in London, said the higher savings trend in the personal and company sectors would continue to hinder recovery. The higher company deficits, acting as an encouragement to cut investment, were also likely to hinder growth. 'The financial position of the corporate sector is sufficiently weak that the emphasis is still going to be on saving, and hence on retrenching rather than investing,' said Mr Saunders.</p>

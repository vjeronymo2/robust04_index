			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Car wars spread to cards Good news this week for high-spending Barclaycard customers who buy a new Ford Escort every three years, writes Bethan Hutton. If you spend Pounds 12,000 a year on your Barclaycard, after three years you could save Pounds 1,800 on the price of a new Ford car or van. Ford is adding to the colourful array of credit cards already on offer to UK consumers with the launch of its own-brand credit card, in a joint venture with Barclaycard. The card will be available from April, as Visa or Mastercard, and will have the same interest rates and benefits as a standard Barclaycard except that the Pounds 10 annual fee will be waived for the first year. Every Pounds 10 spent with the card earns one point worth 50p, which can build up towards a rebate when you buy a Ford. You can accumulate up to Pounds 600 worth of rebate points a year to a total of Pounds 1,800 over three years. The minimum rebate is Pounds 100, earned by spending Pounds 2,000. As an added incentive, new customers can transfer balances from other credit cards and get 5 per cent knocked off the debt. So, if you owe Pounds 1,000 on one credit card and transfer it to the Ford Barclaycard, you would end up owing Pounds 950. You do not even need a Ford-branded card to benefit from the rebate scheme - all Barclaycard's 8m customers are eligible. About 3m of them are registered already with the Profiles scheme, where every Pounds 10 earns you one point to be spent on gifts or short breaks from a catalogue (although the cheapest items are 190 points, which means that Pounds 1,900 of spending entitles you to a screwdriver set or a family day out at Kew Gardens). Now, the same points can also be used to get a discount on Ford cars. So, if you have saved up Profile points already, you could get a discount from January. Ford's main UK rival, Vauxhall, launched a credit card in October. The GM Card, named after Vauxhall's American parent company General Motors, is also available as Visa or Mastercard and accumulates points towards a new Vauxhall car in a similar way, to a maximum of Pounds 500 a year and Pounds 2,500 over five years. But the GM card charges no annual fee and its interest rates are lower - at 1.53 per cent a month (APR 19.9) compared with Barclaycard's 1.585 (APR 21.9).</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: Revival of the well-turned song - Cabaret is making a comeback Bobby Short is as big a feature of Manhattan as the Empire State and the yellow cabs. Most nights for the past four decades he has sat beaming at the piano in the Carlyle Hotel, bringing into a more austere age some of the glamour and style of pre-war society. When the Duke of Windsor wanted to give the Duchess a good time he took her to the Carlyle where he made Bobby Short's life complicated by asking for the song about 'blackbirds: no, not Bye-bye Blackbird, the other one.' Short, whose knowledge of 20th century music is encyclopaedic, immediately played an obscure number from the 1920s, 'Just a bluebird looking for a blackbird to love.' He performed it again this week, but not at the Carlyle. He is playing one of his very rare away fixtures, at the Green Room in the Cafe Royal, until January 22. The Cafe Royal is a strange place these days. The ground floor restaurant still retains enough decadent plush to make Oscar and Bosie feel at home, but up the gilded staircase management-man takes over, with featureless rooms given over to corporate gatherings. The setting for Short is more Crossroads Motel than Caesar's Palace, but he can provide the class. He bounces on, looking like a wide eyed cherub, to join his drummer and excellent bass player, and it is straight into a Cole Porter medley. Now knocking 70, the voice is starting to show signs of wear and tear but Short plays the piano with a style probably almost extinct. It carries on a duet with his wonderful phrasing, and as the classics flow, 'I Can't Get Started'; 'Tea for Two'; 'Miss Otis Regrets' you realise that you are catching an art form near the end of its natural life. The world of sophisticated cabaret, with witty lyrics and insidious tunes, has become as extinct as the music hall or castrato arias. It will still be performed, but by imitators and impersonators. Short knew the period. He talks familiarly about speakeasies and slipping away from Prohibition America to Cuba for a drink. As he stands and reminisces about Bessie and Ira, a slight, eloquent figure, without race or class, he is as spellbinding as when he plays their music. 'I am now going to play a medley which is sophisticated, swish, and so terribly expensive that alone it is worth the price of your ticket' he says  -and then plays 'Do I Love You'; 'Just One of Those Things'; and more brittle memories of a dead past. It is Noel Coward with commitment; an immersion, with sad touches, into a lost art form. Bobby Short should be seen as the last of the breed, but as he ends, naturally, with 'A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square', he also touches the nostalgia for a lost innocence which is as much a vision as a dream. And at the commercial level it could be a vision, for cabaret seems to be making a come back in London. Perhaps it is fin de siecle decadence, which inspired the Parisian cabaret of the 1890s, or the need to smile through hard times, which made night life in Berlin in the 1920s so creative, but London is not such a cabaret-free zone these days. Of course the national temperament is too diffident to embrace cabaret in all its tackiness, and there is a woeful shortage of venues, but anyone seeking drollery past midnight is better served than in the past. Even early bedders can join in the fun with nice Kit and the Widow currently being awfully bitchy about our national institutions at the Vaudeville in the Strand. As well as the Green Room at the Cafe Royal, which has Clark Peters, creator of Five Men Named Moe, following on from Bobby Short, there is Pizza on the Park, where cabaret artists like Issy van Randwyck fill in between jazzers; the Chesterfield Hotel, which has introduced dinner jazz evenings; and Drones, which puts on monthly cabaret. The spate of musicals over the last decade has thrown up scores of singers who want to go solo when their West End contracts expire. There are also new song writers, like Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Peter Reeves, and what seems to be a collection of song writing vicars. Their work is sometimes witty, sometimes painful, all contemporary. Cabaret can build again on this revival of the well-turned song, in which the lyrics drive the melody as they did for Cole Porter and the Gershwins. All that is needed is more venues.</p>

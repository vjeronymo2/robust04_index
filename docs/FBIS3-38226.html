			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "First Peacekeeping Exercise by NATO </F> Rapid Response Force"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels (NATO), 31 Jan (BELGA) -- The new NATO  rapid response force will be organizing its first "large-scale  maneuvers" in early February in order to prepare for a possible  UN peacekeeping mission, it was learned from a military source  on Monday [31 January].    Some 2,000 soldiers -- from the rapid response force  headquarters (ARRC) -- will take part in this exercise, known as  "arrcade guard." It will take place between 3 and 9 February in  the area of Bielefeld (Northwest Germany), relying largely on  computers to simulate the deployment of 100,000 men.    The rapid response force, which can use troops from twelve  Atlantic alliance countries, including Belgium, is the key  component of NATO's military mechanism in the post-Cold War era.  According to NATO Secretary General Manfred Worner, the  principal task of the ARRC is to defend the territory of the  twelve member states but certain elements of the unit would in  the future be deployed on peacekeeping missions outside the NATO  zone.    For its part, the alliance has repeatedly stated that it is  willing to dispatch -- under the aegis of the United Nations --  up to 50,000 men to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to implement a  peace plan agreed between the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. The  "arrcade guard" exercise will be the first carried out by the  rapid response force in the field of peacekeeping. It will  include the simulated deployment of the force headquarters to a  nonidentified crisis area, the ARRC announced in a communique.  "The ARRC headquarters will validate the necessary procedures  for transferring its multinational staff headquarters to a  foreign country where the mechanisms for responding in support  of a UN mandate will be tested. This exercise will simulate all  aspects of such an operation, including cooperation with UN  agencies and humanitarian organizations, together with the way  of dealing with local politicians and belligerents," the text  adds.    The force headquarters -- under the command of the British  Lieutenant General Jeremy Mackenzie -- will command imaginary  land troops up to 100,000 strong. But only 2,000 men will be  present in the field as most of the troops will be  computer-simulated, an ARRC spokesman reports.</p>

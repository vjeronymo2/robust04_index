			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA FOLLETTE PROMISES SCHOOL DISTRICT PLAN  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette said she will privately create a plan to  break up the Los Angeles school district that she hopes to present to voters.  </P> <P> Her strategy would bypass the state Legislature, where she has repeatedly been  stymied on the issue.  </P> <P> La Follette (R-Northridge) announced that she has created a five-member panel  that will hold hearings in the summer and fall on how to accomplish the  breakup. Called the Los Angeles Task Force for Better Education, it will hear  from parents, students, educators and community leaders and will develop a plan  to create as many as 15 districts out of the Los Angeles Unified School  District. The first hearing is scheduled for Aug. 15.  </P> <P> Such a reorganization plan would have to be endorsed by the State Board of  Education and the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization.  It would then have to be approved by voters.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JRA Aerospace Managing Director John Rootes: </F> "Return from Space"]    [Text] ESA's [European Space Agency] technology spin-off  program, set up over eighteen months ago to transfer the most  innovative research from Europe's space programme to more  terrestrial uses, is beginning to bear fruit with medicine the  prime beneficiary. However, an agreement between French and  German companies to use composite molding techniques, developed  for spacecraft antenna, in the production of civil aircraft  simulators, represents the first transfer of the programme.    In another early success Photek Ltd., a UK company, has  taken  a licence on an ESA patent covering developments in imaging  techniques used by ESA in optical astronomy. Photek specialises  development of high intensification photoncounting cameras for  biomedical applications. The cameras can capture high quality  pictures of the sub-molecular structure of cells, and are used  as tools in DNA research and as an aid to new techniques such as  fluorescent microscopy, which offers advances in the way the  spread of certain diseases may be monitored.    Photek initially plans to carry out further development of  the camera through an EC Eureka programme called "Phobia" in  collaboration with the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory and  Scottish and Dutch partners. The camera will then be marketed  worldwide by Photek; at that stage, ESA will collect royalty  revenue to feed back into the transfer program. The licence  agreement was made possible by the efforts of Spacelink Europe,  the consortium of technology transfer agents set up by ESA to  assist with the spin-off program. Spacelink publishes an annual  catalogue of space technology and is able to assist non-space  companies at all stages of the transfer process, including the  all-important sourcing of investment funds for technology  adaptation. The catalogue is called TEST (Transferable European  Space Technologies) and is distributed annually in five  languages to more than 30,000 companies throughout Europe. TEST  3 has recently been issued and contains "offers" of innovative  space technology in many fields, including optics, sensors,  communications and robotics which are available for licence for  use in other applications. Another early success for the  programme has been the adaptation of novel material techniques,  developed by Brunel Institute for Bioengineering for an ESA  orbiting laboratory programme, to orthopaedic surgical  applications. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) can be made into  structures whose shapes can be controlled precisely by heating  them to a known temperature. With assistance from the ESA  programme, Brunel has developed a range of SMA staples which,  when cooled and used to join a fractured arm or leg bone, alter  shape as they heat to body temperature to hold the ends of the  fracture in compression and speed the healing process. Hospital  trials of the staples are imminent and, when these are complete.  Brunel will collaborate with medical equipment suppliers to  market them worldwide.  <H5>  Many Contacts </H5>   Over 90 company-to-company negotiations stimulated by the  ESA  programme are in progress and eight transfers have already been  signed or are close to completion. One particularly satisfying  aspect is the transnational nature of most of the contacts. For  example, spotting the wider possibilities for some high spec  seals developed in France for use in rocket motors, the  Spacelink UK agent will be able to alert a UK supplier to their  existence. The company was seeking higher performance seals to  meet tighter EC environmental regulations and, with assistance  from the Spacelink partner in France, a licence deal is now in  its final stages.    Many other examples of transnational co-operations are  taking  place. Prototype miniature pumps developed for a space based  microgravity laboratory are currently being evaluated for  several applications including the continuous infusion of  intravenous drugs by an Italian medical equipment company. The  device -- four of which would fit in a matchbox -- has the  ability to pump minute quantities of fluid continuously with  great accuracy and reliability. Elsewhere, a Danish producer of  advanced power supplies is in negotiation with a potential  German collaborator, and Swiss-originated solid-state  accelerometer technology is attracting interest throughout  Europe.    Transfers in progress are not confined to hardware. There is  also much interest in ESA's software. A "generalised" version  of the "ESA Software Engineering Standards," which have been in  demand by software engineers since their introduction to space  programs by ESA a number of years ago, have now been accepted  for worldwide promotion by an international publishing house.  Again ESA will benefit from royalty returns on the sales and it  is the agency's plan that royalty income from such transfers  will eventually make the program self-supporting.    The momentum of the technology transfer program is now  increasing as links continue to be forged between space and  non-space companies. A database of over 2,000 companies  actively seeking new technology has been established and  Spacelink undertakes regular focused searches of the ESA  research establishment ESTEC in the Netherlands for technology  to meet specific terrestrial needs. One hundred and ten space  technologies are on offer for transfer through the first two  issues of the TEST catalogue, and significant opportunities  exist for companies seeking to broaden their technological base  to take advantage of the money invested throughout Europe in  space research.    Many of the spin-off applications so far have been medical.  Both space and medical engineers have interests in automation,  advanced optics, sensors, materials technologies and  miniaturisation, and both (at least currently) are better placed  than other sectors to absorb the higher costs related to  advances in these areas.    ESA is interested in hearing from non-space companies which  are seeking innovative technology and space companies which  believe they may have technology to offer.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / PM reviews progress on charters a step towards contracting out services - and performance-related pay will be at the centre of the renewed impetus given to the Citizen's Charter initiative at a seminar this morning chaired by Mr John Major. Cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries have been summoned to the three-hour session at Downing Street to report progress on introducing charter proposals in their areas of responsibility. The outcome is expected to include the promise of further charters shortly, including one for London Underground passengers. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, will also bring forward plans for a 'motorist's charter' for better information about roadworks and delays. Mr John Patten, education secretary, is expected to announce further progress. A parent's charter has been published, but the Tory manifesto included a pledge to increase information published about all schools in each area. Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service and science, plans to make a statement later this year on how far departments have come in introducing market-testing. The move comes with the announcement that Mr Waldegrave's responsibilities are to be extended to the Stationery Office, which publishes government documents, and the Central Office of Information. The Lord Chancellor's Department is expected to come under pressure to explain its failure to produce a final draft of the Courts Charter. The department, which is responsible for drawing up a charter to guarantee standards of service for court users in England and Wales, is one of only two government departments that has yet to publish charter material. The delay in publication of a final draft is believed to be largely due to difficulties in setting meaningful standards for court proceedings which will meet the conflicting interests of all court users. Contrary to recent speculation, the Courts Charter for England and Wales will not be based on the Scottish justice charter, which covers standards of service in the police and the prison service as well as the Scottish courts. The English charter will cover four main areas: improvements in court procedures, building on initiatives resulting from the review of civil justice; improvements in facilities in court buildings, adding to the standards already set for the court building programme; customer care; and business standards, which will set out how court proceedings should run. The charter is expected to be ready for publication by August but is not expected to be published until after the summer parliamentary recess.</p>

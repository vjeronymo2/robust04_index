			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Motoring: A tax cut you can afford Right Hon Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer, 11 Downing Street, London SW1 Dear Chancellor, There is a rare opportunity for you to please industry and environmentalists alike in your next Budget. All you need do is remove some of the unjust financial penalties on those who buy or use cars that save energy and put less muck into the atmosphere. When your colleague, Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Transport, addressed the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders last December, he called for a 40-50 per cent improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency by the year 2005. He rejected sweeping government restrictions on car use as 'barely worth contemplating' and advocated the development of alternative fuels. We have one already; diesel. Diesel-engined cars use a lot less fuel than their petrol equivalents. Official figures produced by the Department of Transport put the saving at around 15 per cent. In fact, according to a report called The Diesel Passenger Car in a Green World, by Britain's internationally-renowned Ricardo Consulting Engineers, their actual benefits are twice that. The official (EC 15-cycle) consumption figures are obtained by testing cars with fully-warmed engines. In real life the average car journey is under 10 km (six miles) and many start with cold engines. Petrol engines guzzle fuel while warming and catalytic converters do not work properly until hot. So, during this time they are uneconomical and their exhausts are dirty. By contrast, a diesel's consumption is much the same whether warming or at working temperature, and the exhaust is just as clean. Cleaner and less damaging to the environment, in fact, than that of a comparable petrol engine, even one with an elaborate catalytic converter. Ricardo tested two cars - one with a 1.8-litre petrol engine, the other a 2.5-litre diesel version - for a full year and 30,000 km (18,640 miles) of urban and rural use. They used petrol at the rate of 10.64 litres per 100 km (26.55 miles per gallon) but diesel at only 7.89 l/100 km (35.8 mpg). The real-life saving: 35 per cent - and that is just on fuel. There is a corresponding reduction in the nasties flowing out of the exhaust. What financial reward is reaped by the business driver of a diesel car? Often, it is a thumping increase in personal tax liability. Drivers who pick a Peugeot 605 SRD turbo-diesel (official average fuel consumption 41.9 mpg, or 6.74 l/100 km) instead of a two-litre petrol-engined 605 SLi (29.4 mpg, or 9.6 l/100 km) more than double their personal income tax liability from Pounds 55.21 to Pounds 114.58 a month. Their crime: picking a car with an engine a few cubic centimetres over two litres in cylinder capacity and costing a little more than the magic (and arbitrary) Pounds 19,250 list price. There are several ways in which you could remedy this unjust situation. You could raise the engine capacity tax break on diesels from two litres to 2.5 litres. (A diesel must be bigger than a petrol engine of similar power). The 10 per cent special car tax could be removed or reduced, or the Pounds 19,250 price limit raised, just for diesels. You would reward, not penalise, those sensible and responsible enough to run diesels and encourage others to follow their good example. You might care to note, too, that most EC states have a wider differential than the UK between petrol and diesel prices. (In France, diesel is two-thirds the price of unleaded petrol. About 40 per cent of all new cars there are diesels, compared with under 10 per cent in Britain). Of course, unleaded petrol is better for the environment than leaded, particularly in cities. Unleaded is essential if a car is to have an exhaust catalyser, as all new ones must by January 1 1993. But its benefits have been exaggerated and its disadvantages - such as higher fuel consumption - are overlooked. In the same way, the diesel car's benefits have been overlooked officially. You have a chance to put that right, Chancellor. A little discrimination in favour of the diesel car will earn you the thanks (and, perhaps, the votes) of Britain's growing band of diesel car-users. You will please the car-makers (all big British-based manufacturers make diesels). Companies cutting the cost of running business cars will praise you. Environmentalists - the kind with their feet on the ground - will approve. Yours sincerely, STUART MARSHALL</p>

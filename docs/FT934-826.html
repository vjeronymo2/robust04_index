			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (2): Quick on the draw / A look at directors and the law As they lie awake wondering if the recession has really ended, company directors might add the threat of criminal prosecution to their catalogue of woes. Under environmental law, directors and managers can be personally liable for their companies' pollution. In theory, criminal charges can be brought against them and they can be sent to jail. They might comfort themselves that only a handful of charges have been pressed under these rules. But phalanxes of lawyers are on hand to warn them that the government regulators are going to get tougher. Once convinced that there is cause for concern, however, directors can take a few simple steps to shield themselves from the risk. Directors' liability for pollution is woven into much recent environmental regulation. One of the main planks is Section 157 of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, which makes directors, managers and senior officers of the company liable as well as the company itself for breaches of the Act, if the pollution can be shown to have been caused by their 'neglect, consent or connivance'. The 1991 Water Resources Act carries a similar clause. Lawyers point out, too, that liabilities are also tucked away in crannies of pollution legislation dating back to the 1960s. Despite these rules, government regulators - the pollution inspectorate (HMIP), the National Rivers Authority and local waste regulatory authorities  -have generally chosen to pursue companies, not individuals. The NRA explains: 'It is fairly easy to establish that a company has done something it shouldn't. It is much harder, particularly with a big company, for us to pin down who was responsible'. In one of the few exceptions, when the London Waste Regulatory Authority this year prosecuted the incinerator company, Clinical Energy, the site manager and managing director were also charged. They received conditional discharges. For these reasons, many directors may not have felt much personal risk under environmental legislation. According to Ms Clare Deansley, of Gouldens, the solicitors, the risk of prosecution is 'probably more in directors' minds than a few years ago but still not as much as it should be - many have been concentrating recently on saving their businesses from going bust'. But lawyers are agreed that the threat is growing, and that directors are beginning to take it more seriously. Ms Pamela Castle, head of the environmental group at solicitors McKenna &amp; Co, says that one reason 'is the large number of prosecutions under health and safety legislation, which overlaps in many areas with environmental issues'. She points out that health and safety regulators have declared their intention to focus on directors' and managers' liabilities. A rush of cases have drawn attention to directors' responsibilities - not least the prosecutions which followed the 1987 capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry off Zeebrugge (the officers were prosecuted as well as the ferry company, but the charges were dropped). Ms Castle says: 'I have been asking myself why we are so active in advising companies on this when the government for the moment has put the environment on the back burner. What is driving our business is fear'. In her view, directors' concern is one force prompting companies to improve their environmental performance; the second main one is their bankers' concern. Lawyers also point out that environmental regulators may begin to adopt the aggression of their health and safety counterparts. Ms Deansley believes that 'in the not too distant future, one of the regulatory authorities will decide to make an example of a director of a high profile company'. The pollution regulators may be temporarily disrupted if the government's proposed merger to create a new environment agency takes place. However, environmental campaigners such as Friends of the Earth have argued that the advantage of the proposed agency - a 'one-stop-shop' for pollution control - is that it may be more vigorous and systematic in pursuing offenders than the agencies can now be. A further reason why directors should be concerned, lawyers argue, is that the environmental pressure groups are developing a taste for bringing their own prosecutions. They may begin to see the pursuit of company directors through the courts as a powerful way of publicising their anti-pollution campaigns. Because directors have criminal liability under environmental legislation, they cannot insure themselves against being found guilty, although - in theory - they can insure against the legal fees of defending themselves. In practice, however, they may find such insurance hard to obtain. Rather than running these risks, lawyers say that directors should take several straightforward steps. The essential measure, they argue, is to make scrutiny of the company's environmental standards a regular part of management. That means taking the trouble to monitor emissions, finding out how well the company meets existing environmental law, and becoming alert to possible changes in legislation. For a start, that kind of systematic monitoring helps reduce the risk of illegal pollution, whether constant or accidental. The second advantage is that it also helps directors demonstrate that they have not personally been negligent if excess pollution does occur. Company directors who find themselves besieged with consultants recommending 'environmental management systems' may feel sceptical of the benefits (in some cases with good reason). But if they turn up their nose at the carrot, they may not ignore the stick. They have plenty of evidence that their personal liability under environmental law is worth taking seriously.</p>

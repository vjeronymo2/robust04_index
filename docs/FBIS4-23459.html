			<p>BFN     [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] has  received information from high ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] sources in  Monrovia of a diabolical plan to plant arms and ammunition in  several locations in and around Monrovia, only to be discovered  later by ECOMOG itself and subsequently falsely linked to the  NPFL officials in Monrovia. According to the high-placed ECOMOG  sources, the motive behind the secret agenda is to effect the  arrest of several key NPFL officials in Monrovia, including Vice  Chairman Isaac Musa, NPFL chief negotiator John T. Richardson,  and others, falsely associating them with the hidden arms racket.    According to ECOMOG sources, these diabolical lies were  brought to their attention by a certain official of the NPFL  cabinet within the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional  Government], who continues to demonstrate insincerity in  disguise to undermine the NPFL. The NPFL says it has identified  this minister in question and is questioning his motives for  continuously promulgating lies and deception against the  interests of the NPFL.    The leader of the NPFL, President Charles Gankay Taylor has  strongly warned that if such a diabolical plan is carried out  with the view of keeping Liberia continuously occupied by  Nigeria, and its officials arrested in Monrovia, this will lead  to the immediate resumption of war in Liberia.</p>

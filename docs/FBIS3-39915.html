			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democrats 66 leader Hans van Mierlo by Frans </F> Boogaard and Cor van Santen; place and date not given: "D66  Remains D66"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] According to  market researchers De Hond, supposedly D66 [Democrats 66] could  win 45 seats if it set itself further apart from the other main  parties.    [van Mierlo] Radicalism is now in vogue. A determined face,  and in with the knife. However, I do not believe in that  approach. Furthermore, it must tally with the rest of the  party's visiting card. I feel strongly about that: Consistency  in one's attitude, and in one's presentation -- being  reasonable. I know that other parties are not bothered about  this, but that is precisely the difference between us. I am  governed by my opinions, not by the desire to win 35 seats.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet you, yourself, give rise to  expectations, for example by reproaching the cabinet for making  drastic cuts in allowances and administrative blundering in your  party publication. That gives rise to the expectation that you  can do better. Will D66 stick to its approach of lesser  allowances? Can you promise that you will not make any cuts?    [van Mierlo] For three years the government has not listened  to us. The only thing it has done is make cuts -- in everyone's  budget, but nas not solved the budget problem. Now it is too  late. We are sparing old age pensions, but linking the other  allowances to wage movements by 50 percent. In so doing, we  have opted for a respectable path. The PvdA [Labor Party] is  suggesting that full linkage is possible, but there is no way in  which that is true. Freezing levels for the next four years, as  proposed by the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], is unfair  psychologically, because doing so would mean excluding an entire  category in advance, for the next four year, from any possible  growth in prosperity. We are offering those people receiving an  allowance the prospect of being able to "half-grow" with the  economy. However, that approach may also be superseded. I  cannot give any guarantees.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Your party congress wants the Betuwe  [railroad] line to be laid underground, or at least dug into the  landscape, which would cost an extra four to five billion  guilders. A ticklish issue in the coalition formation?    [van Mierlo] The congress supports the party, but the party  lost the debate in the Chamber. We are doing our best. We will  fight terribly hard for this.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] One of your members, Rinnooy Kan,  president of the employers' federation, sees nothing to be  gained by the energy tax, for which D66 is making such a strong  pitch. How eligible is he for a ministerial post?    [van Mierlo] I am not talking about ministerial posts.  Rinnooy Kan speaks as a representative of the employers' lobby,  and those are clear views. He is an excellent party colleague.  I know damned well that the opinions he is expressing when he  says that are those of the employers.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet surely he cannot have completely  different opinions on, say, energy tax as the D66 minister for  economic affairs?    [van Mierlo] I do not know. I have a difference of opinion  with employers' president Rinnooy Kan, not with D66 member  Rinnooy Kan. Very soon there will be a coalition agreement, and  every future minister will have to comply with that agreement.  Otherwise he will not become a minister.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] D66 is staking a great deal in the  campaign on the referendum. However, does Jan Modaal not merely  want to be able to walk safely down a clean street with a  reasonably full purse?    [van Mierlo] Yes, that is what the rest of the platform is  about. However, we consider the referendum to be just as  important. A little more power to the citizens, and a little  less to the politicians. If the citizens really do not want a  particular law, then you give them the chance to pull on the  hand brake. That is of a different political order than the  energy tax or the fight against crime. People are supporting us  on that. I also would consider it to be treason retrospectively  to drop the matter after 25 years. It constitutes part of the  identity of the party. If we were to drop it, then we would  have been better off never having gotten started in the first  place. One has a moral duty to make a go of it.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] If the CDA and PvdA were shortly to  suffer  great losses, and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] and D66 made tremendous gains, who would then take  the lead when it came to forming a cabinet?    [van Mierlo] One guideline is the size of the party, another  is who has won the most seats. Mostly it is a cocktail of the  two. There is no law about it. I believe the most important  criterion is which party is the largest. And of course, to soem  extent, parties also look after their own interests. It is not  merely the quantitative aspect that is important, but also the  qualitative aspect -- how people emerge from a campaign.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] You stick with your preference for a  purple coalition?    [van Mierlo] As long as you do not write that I raised the  subject!    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] But could VVD and D66 ever agree?    [van Mierlo] I would be the last person to say that  compromises are inconceivable with certain parties. And I am  not doing so now, although I will admit there is a large gap  between the VVD and D66 -- apart from on a few points. The VVD  has radical views, but I must still see that it keeps going, in  whatever coalition there may be.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] So purple has precedence?    [van Mierlo] I continue to believe that a purple coalition  would be structurally good for the Netherlands. The question is  whether the PvdA and VVD can wriggle out of their traditional  attitude.    [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Could you become a minister in such a  cabinet and also remain a political leader?    [van Mierlo] Everything is conceivable, up to and including  a  party leadership. I think the most plausible scenario, also for  our citizens, is one in which I join the cabinet in one capacity  or other, but I am not ruling out anything.</p>

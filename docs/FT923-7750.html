			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Property: Price slump savages West Country - But John Worrall discovers that it's not all gloom, doom and inertia in deepest Somerset HOUSE prices in the south-west have fallen by 40 per cent from the 1988 peak, and the decline appears to be steepening. According to the Halifax building society, average prices in the region in the second quarter of this year were 8.5 per cent lower than a year earlier. The equivalent figure for the first quarter was 7.1 per cent. Only in Greater London and the south-east did prices fall more steeply. Since those two regions still provide many potential buyers for West Country properties, the outlook is for more torpor. Most agree that much depends on the confidence of first-time buyers. In Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, where holiday flats now begin as low as Pounds 18,000, Paul Gass of Abbott &amp; Frost says first-timers in the Pounds 35,000-40,000 range are the most active. 'Two- and three-bedroom semi-detached and two-bedroom detached houses are moving and the retirement market has also re-awakened over the past three or four months, with some inward movement notably from West Midlands and the Home Counties.' But at Castle Carey in the central east of the county, 90 minutes from London by rail, agent Sue Bradley Hudson says houses costing between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 130,000 are selling best. 'Part of the problem is that some properties are offered at too high a price in the first place and then have to be reduced. Buyers, having seen many reductions, become reluctant to sign a contract in case they see a better deal next week.' At Ilminster, in the south of the county - a stopping-off point for holiday-makers heading for Devon and Cornwall - Andrew Hale of agent Lawrence Hale says about half of the buyers this year have come from outside the area. 'There has been a rise in activity insofar as we have been selling more than we have been taking on since the election. That has led to certain shortages. Cottage properties up to, say, Pounds 100,000 and good bungalows are extremely scarce. 'The problem is that although some people want to trade down and raise some capital, they feel that they might pocket more money when the differential is greater. Others simply cannot grasp the fact that property values have come down.' Hale says the Ilminster market starts at Pounds 25,000 for a studio or one-bedroom flat and most activity is centred on sales at less than Pounds 80,000. Second-home buyers looking for small cottages can get particularly good value, with two bedrooms available at not much above Pounds 40,000. 'In 1988, we could sell a one-bedroom house at Pounds 46,000-48,000 but we would be hard pressed to achieve Pounds 30,000 today,' Hale adds. Semi-detached houses are the same, down from perhaps Pounds 75,000 then to Pounds 50,000 now." At the higher levels there is, if anything, even more inertia - and some appropriately brave faces. Robin Thomas, from the Exeter office of Strutt &amp; Parker, says prices are down by 45-50 per cent from their peak of late 1988 and early 1989. According to agent Michael Waite, of Sherborne, cash buyers are being cautious in a soft market. He is, however, getting strong interest in Heale House, a nine-bedroom property set in nine acres at Curry Rivel to the east of Taunton which is available at a guide price of Pounds 430,000. Part of the house dates from 1620 and, he says, a number of inquiries has come from the Home Counties. A similar pattern of inquiries is reported by Strutt &amp; Parker for Brympton d'Evercy, a Grade I-listed house in 25 acres two miles from Yeovil offered at a guide of Pounds 850,000. For another Pounds 500,000, a buyer would get the surrounding 470-acre farm. Humberts' Taunton office recently sold Glebe Court, a Georgian House at West Monkton three miles north of the county town, where about Pounds 500,000 was paid by a buyer moving out of London. Humberts' Richard Pawson has noted a slight increase in activity in the lower market levels prompted by the imminent return of stamp duty. But despite some other successes this year, he sees little direct cause for wild optimism. 'Volume is fairly low across the market and vendors have to encourage interest. Prices, more than ever, have to be realistic.' For those seeking it, though, there is perhaps a little good news, even if it is open to interpretation. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley International has seen an increase recently in overseas interest in the upper levels of the market, notably in Stavordale Priory in Charlton Musgrove, on offer at Pounds 1.6m. According to Michael de Pelet, of the Sherborne office, inquiries on this and other properties - such as Burford House at Pilton, available at Pounds 375,000 - have come from as far afield as Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. If you accept that investors from such places are well practiced in using their money to the greatest effect, it could just be a sign that the UK market really has bottomed out.</p>

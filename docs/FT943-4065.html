			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / The Long View: A new phase of crisis When the German government can no longer easily sell its bonds you have to start worrying. For decades German bunds set the standard for investment quality among fixed-income securities but, this week, the yield on 10-year D-Mark bonds rose to more than 7 1/2 per cent - significantly greater than the yield on those by the US Treasury and denominated, of course, in the dodgy dollar. That old law of supply and demand is at work here. A reminder of the sheer volume of supply of bonds around the world comes from the annual Salomon Brothers estimation exercise, which has thrown up a figure of Dollars 16.3 trillion (1trn = 1,000bn) as the size of the world bond market by the end of last year. This covers the 21 leading currencies, although almost half the bonds are denominated in US dollars and by the time you have added in Japanese, German, Italian, French, British and Canadian paper you have covered 80 per cent of the field. Total outstanding debt rose 10 per cent in 1993, expressed in dollars. The world's investors swallowed all the new issues greedily - a net total of Dollars 1.6 trillion - then choked. They have spent 1994 regretting this over-indulgence. The US 30-year Treasury bond yield at about 7.5 per cent is slightly below the worst but is a long way above the 5.8 per cent at which it troughed in the latter part of 1993. Not only has the overall yield on bonds risen but there has been a widening of differentials as investors have become more conscious of risk. Swedish, Italian and Spanish 10-year government bond yields are running at more than 400 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bond yields. What are the risks? Firstly that the currency will depreciate but ultimately that some country or other will get into such a mess that it will have to restructure its debt. The sort of risks that used to be confined to the third world are now beginning to trouble first world investors. Old-fashioned fiscal discipline is right out of fashion. This week the European Commission ticked off 10 out of 12 member states for running excessive budget deficits. In the bond market they particularly worry about elections. They were mildly impressed by Silvio Berlusconi's victory in Italy but have lost faith subsequently. Now there is an imminent poll in Sweden promising the return of the social democrats and another in Denmark, although Denmark is a long way from being on any critical list. For obvious reasons electors do not tend to vote in a way that bond investors would like. The man in the street likes public money to be spent on health, education, social security and other benefits but hates the idea of paying matching taxes. He also flirts with nationalism and ideas of separation, a theme that has sent the Canadian bond market into a tizzy over the imminent Quebec elections that may well restore a secessionist Parti Quebecois to power. That is not to say that the PQ could ever win a referendum on separation. But the very possibility that particular regions of a troubled country might try to walk away from responsibility for a large part of the national debt is a bondholders' nightmare that may yet haunt creditors of the Belgian and Italian governments, to name but two. Oddly, unification can be fiscally dangerous too. Germany has accepted the financial burden of its restored eastern provinces, but it would prefer not to pay up right away. Hence, most of the debt problems. Germany is also facing elections this autumn. It seems that Helmut Kohl is likely to be returned to power, and policies will not change significantly. But those policies have become notably slack - extraordinarily so by past German standards - so that the money supply is rising strongly and government borrowing is worryingly high. Internationally, therefore, the problems in bonds are becoming focused in public sector debt. A few years ago there was a flurry of private sector problems, notably in US junk bonds, but such of the corporate indebtedness has been refinanced through the booming equity markets, in emerging as well as developed markets. Central government outstanding bonds rose by 12 per cent last year as the fiscal deficits ballooned. And whereas in 1980 the share of new bond finance raised from abroad ranged from just about nil for France and Spain and up to 14 per cent for Germany and the UK, by 1993 these countries were selling 25 per cent upwards to foreigners. In fact, Germany in recent years has often sold more than half its bunds to international investors (although foreigners have now lost their appetite, helping to explain the recent sharp rise in funding costs). The solution to the bond market's woes is clear enough - governments must cut their spending and encourage higher savings among their populations. But it is a deeply unpopular message and not one that can be writ large on election manifestos, even if the strategy will, perforce, have to be adopted eventually. Hence the fear that the bond markets may have to choose a sacrificial victim. Some unco-operative country or other in Europe will be declared a pariah. Its debt spurned except perhaps by scavengers running vulture funds. Would 15 or 20 per cent interest rates force such a country to reconsider. It might simply declare a siege economy and restructure its liabilities, say by converting its debt into 30-year bonds yielding a 'fair' 5 per cent. It is not clear who would be teaching whom a lesson. At any rate, we seem to be entering a new phase of the bond market crisis that began last February, this time centred in Europe. Investors seem to perceive that the risks have risen. Or maybe it is that the Japanese, with a trade surplus, are hogging too much of the world's liquidity and, scarred by losses, are refusing to recycle it into long-term markets. But those elections won't be over a moment too soon.</p>

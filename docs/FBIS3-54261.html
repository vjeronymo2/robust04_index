According to reliable sources, the delegation which had been  sent by Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to explore  avenues for finding a lasting solution to the Afghan imbroglio,  could not meet Mowlawi Yunus Khales and Mowlawi Nabi Mohammad,  chief of his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of  Afghanistan] and Herakat-e Enqelab-e [Islamic Revolution  Movement], respectively, on Friday [21 Jan] and Saturday [22  Jan] due to some unknown reasons.    The delegation, which comprises Abdol Hadi Arghandwal of  Hezb-e Eslami, Hashamatollah Mojaddedi, a representative of Prof  Sebghatollah Mojaddedi's Afghan National Liberation Front, Dr  Talib of Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], and Dr Abdol Karim  Zaray of militia warlord Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e Melli Eslami  [National Movement], Afghanistan, also intends to meet President  Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to  convey to them a personal message from Hekmatyar and to inform  them of the four-party coordination council's stand on the  fighting in Kabul.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami, Ustad Qaribur  Rahman Saeed, said that reports appearing in section of the  Press on Saturday about the destruction caused by bombing in  Charasyab were exaggerated.    Talking to DAWN by telephone, Saeed said that, in fact, the  Rabbani forces were left with very limited air power after the  recent bombings and there was no question of their jets hitting  Charasyab with such severity as was reported. He denied that  Hezb controlled radio station, Payam-e Azadi, and a TV booster  were destroyed. "Only a rocket had fallen there which did not  cause as much damage as was claimed by the enemy," he maintained.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Secretive retailer extends its tangled web of interests - David Waller looks at Metro's plans to acquire a majority stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus METRO is one of the most secretive and most controversial companies in Germany, if not the whole of Europe. It is getting bigger, more controversial - and not a jot less secretive. Metro, domiciled in Switzerland like Mr Otto Beisheim, the man who founded the group 28 years ago and is still its biggest shareholder, last week won approval from Germany's federal cartel authorities for its plans to buy a majority stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, a large but financially-stretched German retail group. This will take sales in Germany to DM60bn (Dollars 37.7bn) or more this year. The transaction means that Metro will rival US companies Wal-Mart and K mart as one of the world's largest retail groups. It will consolidate its position as one of Germany's largest companies, a rival in turnover terms to industrial leaders such as Daimler-Benz and Siemens. The deal is likely to give the group a market share of 20 per cent or more in the German food retailing sector, and large market shares in furniture, textile and DIY retail as well. It will also accelerate the process of concentration in the retail sector, leaving just three companies - Metro/Asko, Tengelmann and Rewe, with total market share of about 50 per cent. It has revived grievances about what competitors call Metro's brutal and unfair commercial tactics. The influential HDE, the association of German retailers which represents 460,000 retail businesses, has been fighting Metro in the courts for 7 1/2 years - accusing it of breaching numerous retail laws - and has vowed to intensify the battle in the wake of the federal cartel office's decision last week. Size considerations apart, it remains unclear why Metro has made its latest move, as the loss-making Asko is suffering the consequences of a takeover spree in the late 1980s, culminating with the acquisition of Co-op in 1989. With turnover of about DM20m expected next year, it has net debt of DM5bn which it has to finance out of the slimmest of operating margins. 'I am convinced that the 1992-93 result will be a complete disaster,' says Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, head of German research at James Capel in Frankfurt. Last year, the Asko parent company made a net loss of DM269m after a profit of DM106m in 1990, reflecting high write-offs against acquisitions. 'It has the worst balance sheet in the whole of corporate Germany, and a rights issue would seem to be essential.' In addition, the retail sector is plagued by intense competition. The consumer spree of the late 1980s is over and prospects are blighted not only by the economic slowdown but also by the likelihood that taxes will rise and wage rises start to fall in the years ahead. The deal could, some suggest, have positive tax implications for Mr Beisheim, one of Switzerland's richest men. Alternatively, it could be a way of ensuring that Asko does not sink under its debt burden. All are agreed that it will add to the Metro group's already formidable purchasing power, but questions are raised about where the money for the purchase will come from. There is no opportunity to put these, or any other questions to the company, as the company does not speak to the press. Mr Beisheim, 68, who founded the business in 1964 when he opened his first store (modelled on the US cash and carry concept) has withdrawn from day-to-day management of the business and leads a reclusive life moving between homes in France, Italy, Switzerland, Florida and California. All press enquiries are directed to Mr Erwin Conradi, the 58-year-old chief executive who manages the business from an office above one of the group's stores in Dusseldorf. Calls are put through to his secretary who politely, but firmly, tells callers that Mr Conradi is too busy to respond. The group's structure, like its public relations policy, is inscrutable, a veritable tangle of holdings and cross-holdings giving the Swiss parent control of an estimated 180 companies. One of its biggest holdings is a majority stake in Kaufhof, one of Germany's largest, quoted retail groups. Others include the Massa discount stores group, the computer chain Vobis and Pelikan, the office supply group. Via Asko, it controls Co-op, the AVA department stores group and the Adler clothing stores chain. Noteworthy among the web of interests are the group's links with Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB), the aggressively-managed public sector bank based, like Mr Conradi, in Dusseldorf. The bank, one of the biggest in Germany and with an active approach to the way it manages its extensive portfolio of industrial interests, owns a 10 per cent stake in Asko. The precise scale of the group's influence is made all the more difficult to understand by the lack of disclosure and takeover rules in Germany: there is no obligation for the group to declare its hand until it has amassed a 25 per cent direct stake in a company. It is widely suspected that Metro controls Asko via indirect stakes. The only thing known for certain is that in the absence of a takeover code for Germany, Metro is not obliged to make an offer for the company's minority shareholders. Metro's acquisition of Asko is going ahead after the federal cartel office reversed its decision that the deal would be anti-competitive. Metro and Asko agreed to sell stores with total turnover of DM1.2bn as the price of the go-ahead. This represents only a fraction of the group's total turnover and the cartel office's decision has done nothing to still the controversy surrounding the group's size and secrecy.</p>

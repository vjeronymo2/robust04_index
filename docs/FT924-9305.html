			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Policy talks continue in Little Rock: Yeltsin urges early summit and more N-weapon cuts PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton continued yesterday to prepare himself for his new administration in a series of meetings in Little Rock with senior advisers, writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington. Talks focused on Cabinet and other appointments and on the economic proposals he is expected to unveil early in his first term, Mr Clinton spoke by telephone to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who suggested an early summit, British Prime Minister John Major, and Mr Nelson Mandela of South Africa. In a separate message the Russian leader proposed further nuclear weapon cuts. There was no word when Mr Clinton's appointments would be announced. If history is any guide they may emerge piecemeal and only after he has interviewed leading candidates. The first announcement is likely to be over the composition of the transition team, providing clues as to who might get top Washington jobs. A small team has been set up but it will be succeeded by a larger group that, in effect, operates for 10 weeks as a government-in-waiting. Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, is considered a front-runner for the job as transition director. Other candidates are Mr Eli Segal, campaign director of administration, Mr Warren Christopher, former deputy secretary of state under President Carter, Mr Vernon Jordan, the civil rights activists and former head of the Urban League, and Ms Madeline Kunin, once governor of Vermont. The last three formed the 'search committee' which eventually recommended that Mr Clinton chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate. Of all the appointments he may make, none will be more significant in the long term than those to the Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life, and it is probable that vacancies on the highest court will occur during his term. Only one justice on the current court was a Democratic nominee - Mr Byron F. White, named by President John Kennedy in 1962. Justice White, now 75 and progressively more conservative in his rulings, may want to step aside. So may Justice Harry Blackmun, who is 83 and is probably the most liberal member of the court. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Reagan appointment but an important swing vote between liberals and conservatives, has not been in the best of health. Justice Blackmun, who wrote in 1973 the Roe vs Wade ruling guaranteeing the right to abortion, is believed to have resisted retirement for some time because of his fear that he would be replaced by a Republican-appointed justice committed to overturning the landmark ruling. Mr Clinton's only pronouncements on his criteria for the Supreme Court were that he would prefer justices who believed in a woman's right to reproductive choice and that he thought Governor Mario Cuomo of New York had the sort of intellect that belonged on the court. But those who follow Mr Cuomo closely are convinced he would hate the thought of leaving New York. Mr Clinton may want to appoint a justice from one of the minorities. The 'black' seat on the court has moved sharply to the right with Justice Thurgood Marshall's retirement and the accession of Justice Clarence Thomas.</p>

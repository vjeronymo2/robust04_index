The Americans are moving  intensely and are the main participants in events behind the  scenes.    Informed diplomatic sources say this policy was adopted  during one of the frequent meetings between U.S. and British  diplomats at the Foreign Office last fall. The diplomats were  coordinating their actions to promote the CBM's after the  "election" in the pseudostate.    With their stance, the U.S. and British diplomats, along UN  envoys, are proving the accuracy of this information. During  their recent meetings in Cyprus, the UN envoys avoided meeting  the country's political leaders and only held talks with the two  communities' leaders.    There was talk in the past of "secret negotiations" but the  issue resurfaced with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas'  remarks after his latest meeting with the UN secretary general's  representatives Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel. Following the  official talks, Denktas seems to have told the Greek Cypriot  reporters who went to the occupied areas to cover the meeting:  "Secret diplomacy will follow."    Bearing all this in mind, you cannot help but link the  optimism expressed by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special representative in Cyprus, immediately after he arrived  in the Greek capital, the second stop on his tour.    Based on official statements and President Glavkos  Kliridhis'  briefing of National Council members, there was talk in Cyprus  of a deadlock. According to the government spokesman: "The  procedure has ended for now." In his statement, Clark said:  "There could be progress in the effort toward a Cyprus  solution."    The UN official's statement surprised the common view. Those  who are familiar with behind-the-scenes events link the  statement with one of Denktas' references. Asked about the  prospects for an agreement with Kliridhis, Clark said in his  statement that they may disagree but in the end they will agree.    There is another fact, reported and not denied, that  strengthens all of the above information. Before their meeting  with the five UN Security Council permanent representatives at  the Russian Embassy last Wednesday [26 January], Clark and  Feissel reportedly "secretly met" U.S. Ambassador Richard  Boucher at the U.S. Embassy.    The U.S. ambassador recently adopted intense activity to  persuade politicians, economists, and other elements to support  the confidence-building measures. But he cynically told them  there is no margin for improvement because Denktas would not  accept such a thing (the package of CBM's).</p>

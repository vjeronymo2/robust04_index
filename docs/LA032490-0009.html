			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER YOSEMITE'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Several commentaries on Yosemite Valley, including David Brower's "Give 'Em  Bouquets, Not Bricks" (Editorial Page, March 10), brought back memories of my  father's story of his first visit to Yosemite in 1910.  </P> <P> He told of the train trip from Los Angeles to El Portal and the ride into the  valley on a stagecoach. "Breathtaking, peaceful beauty," he said.  </P> <P> His next trip to Yosemite Valley was in 1940. His comment after that trip was,  "The automobile has ruined my beautiful Yosemite."  </P> <P> HERBERT A. WASSERMAN  </P> <P> Hemet  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Passage indistinct] based on the list of demands  presented by the workers, the National Assembly, which met  today, decided that work must resume throughout the territory.  Gabonese citizens or local companies which have been deprived of  butane gas or other forms of fuel until now, can now obtain  their supplies from gas stations of their choice. This is very  comforting news for Gabonese after several days of tribulations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program] </F>   [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha met with Zulu  King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi last  night to discuss the deadlock in negotiations. Michelle Vermaak  asked Mr. Botha whether any progress had been made in resolving  the impasse.    [Begin recording] [Botha] I would first of all wish to make  it clear, this was an informal meeting, no agenda, just a  discussion -- informally, openly, as South Africans. So I would  not wish to proceed from a point where the purpose was to make  progress in any way. The purpose was to discuss, to analyze, to  be completely open with one another and that is what we did.    [Vermaak] Do you think that any solutions, anything positive  then came out in the meeting?    [Botha] That will depend on decisions taken today and in the  days that come. I reported fully to the president in Cape Town  and to my colleagues, Minister Roelf Meyer and Minister Danie  Schutte, and the one thing that came out very clearly was a  deep-rooted desire on the part of His Majesty the king, to have  the position and status of the Zulu kingdom preserved and  guaranteed and secured. That to the king is a very important, if  not nonnegotiable position, because his reasoning is that the  Zulu kingdom was functioning long before the British came to  Natal or long before the Union of South Africa came into being  in 1910, or the Republic of South Africa subsequently, and their  reasoning is that the Zulus, the king, being a monarch,  recognized worldwide -- in years to come -- that they had not  been consulted.    [Vermaak] Do you think that the government and the ANC  [African National Congress] are moving closer to the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] and that a possible solution will be  found before the elections?    [Botha] I personally believe that a distinction must be made  between the status and the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu,  and political activities or elections, and participation in  elections, and I think we ought not to confuse the two, or  rather, see the one directly related to the other. The king or  the kingdom ought to be above politics and elections and should  not be subject, in my opinion, to political decisions in which  the king has no power, but if something could be agreed on or  something could be done urgently in the next day, or two, or  three, to put the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu beyond any  doubt -- no tampering with it -- I think if something could be  done in this direction then there is a good possibility that all  the other outstanding matters which trouble Dr. Buthelezi and  Inkatha, I think they could then be resolved.

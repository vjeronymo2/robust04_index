The rally in the  Small Arena of the Luzhnikiy Stadium was timed to the third  anniversary of the referendum of the future of the former Soviet  Union.    According to the police, about 3,000-4,000 people took part  in the rally.    On March 17 1991, about 70 percent of the voters favored the  preservation of a renovated Soviet Union.    According to Zyuganov, "the ruling regime is devastating  Russia as a superpower and destroying its science and culture.  But the conscience of the people is waking up." Zyuganov  pointed to the need for an immediate adjustment of the course of  reforms, the formation of a government of popular confidence,  "an end to the destruction of the army and state security bodies  and the restoration of a united state."    The leader of the Russian All-People Union, Sergey Baburin,  said that "justice demanded an uncompromising struggle against  those who dismantled the Soviet Union. We are ready for civic  accord, but we expect the sinners to make the first step."    According to Baburin, if President Yeltsin "wanted peace,  let  him come to us and repent." He called on opposition forces for  consolidation and pointed out: "We will resuscitate our  fatherland (meaning the Soviet Union - IF's note) despite any  obstacles."    In his address to the rally, Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov  proposed the movement Accord for Russia be turned into another  movement called Accord for Restoration of the Soviet Union. He  also proposed the new movement set up its regional committees to  encompass local nationalist, patriotic and pro-Communist forces.  The committees could organize the struggle for the restoration  of the Soviet Union, Lukyanov was quoted as saying.    The rally was also attended by former Soviet Deputy Sazhiy  Umalatova, Secretary General of the Communist Bolshevik Party of  All Soviet Union Nina Andreyeva and Russian Communist Workers'  Party Secretary Viktor Anpilov.</p>

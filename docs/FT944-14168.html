			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Black votes seen as key to Virginia race The vitriolic race in Virginia between Democratic Senator Charles Robb and Mr Oliver North has finally focused on the constituency which could determine the outcome on November 8 - the black voters who comprise 18 per cent of the state's population. Both men campaigned at black churches in Richmond, the capital, on Sunday. Mr Robb was in the company of Mr Doug Wilder, the black former Democratic governor who last week, after intervention by President Bill Clinton, finally endorsed his long time rival. Mr Wilder said his appearance with Mr Robb was 'no idle gesture' and promised to stump for him constantly in the remaining two weeks. The church's pastor told the senator, 'we are receiving you with delight because we believe, Brother Robb, that your opponent is bad news'. Mr North, who enjoys the adulation of the predominantly white Christian Coalition, told his audience he believed in the power of prayer and that the Bible is 'the only book I've ever read more than once.' The latest polls cannot separate the two, with Mr Marshall Coleman, the independent candidate and a former Republican lieutenant governor, trailing. This means that neither Mr Wilder's withdrawal from the race in September nor the continued presence of Mr Coleman on the right has yet dented the North bubble, as had been expected. Persuading black voters to turn out on November 8 may be crucial. The assumption had been that they would stay away from the polls in large numbers, which could only help Mr North. Each day in this ferociously negative and expensive campaign, whose cost, already over Dollars 20m, has only been exceeded by the Senate race in California between Senator Dianne Feinstein and Congressman Michael Huffington, brings new charges and accusations of lying. Mr North alleged last week Mr Wilder's endorsement was only obtained by the promise of an ambassadorship from Mr Clinton. This produced a furious White House denial. The Republican candidate had to fend off a story in the Washington Post that suggested he may have connived at trafficking in narcotics while he was running the Iran-Contra operation from his position on President Reagan's national security council. But the former Marine lieutenant colonel has been unabashed in his onslaught on Mr Robb. Last week he said his rival's military career, also in the Marines, was spent more on ceremonial duties than active service. His commercials, featuring massage parlours and cocaine dealers, recall Mr Robb's confessions of marital infidelity and some dabbling in drugs.</p>

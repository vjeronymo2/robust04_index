"I will not be prepared to agree to an international  conference before we know where we are going," Christopher said  during an appearance before the Cable News Network's "The World  Today" program.    Earlier, Russia called for an international conference next  week on the Bosnian crisis, which has left more than 40,000  people dead since its outbreak 22 months ago.    "Before we have an international conference at the  ministerial level or a high level," he said, "It needs to be  well prepared so we don't get in this situation of building up  expectations and then dashing them by not accomplishing  anything."    On a related matter, he described as "flat wrong" the  remarks  by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian presidential envoy on Bosnia,  that if threatened NATO air strikes took place, it would lead to  an all-out war.    "What we are trying to prevent is the expansion of the war.  What we're trying to prevent is the end of the carnage there, I  just think he has it wrong," Christopher said.    The secretary of state reiterated Washington's cautious  optimism over the prospect of the Bosnian Serbs removing all  their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before the Sunday [20  February] deadline as set by NATO.    He said some 50 pieces of Serb heavy weapons have been moved  out of the Bosnian capital and reports on Thursday that they  were removing the weapons in convoys still need to be verified.    "I'm cautious about this," he said. "The Serbs have  disappointed us many times before."    The Bosnian Serbs announced that they would withdraw all  heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before Saturday, one day  before the expiry of the NATO deadline, after Russia promised to  send its troops to help implement the ceasefire in the city.    "Although they've made some rather extravagant statement,  we'll wait and see," Christopher said.    Also today, President Bill Clinton notified Congress that he  was ready to order U.S. warplanes to launch air strikes against  the Bosnian Serbs if they failed to meet the Sunday deadline.    He told Congress that more than 60 U.S. aircraft are  available for participation in the authorized NATO missions.    The formal notification came after a meeting of Clinton's  top  security staff at the White House on the Bosnian crisis.    A war powers act requires the President to notify Congress  any time he sends or plans to send U.S. forces to action.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Books: Sybil of the 'pelvic truth' MARTHA by Agnes de Mille Hutchinson Pounds 20, 500 pages BLOOD MEMORY by Martha Graham Macmillan Pounds 20, 278 pages MARTHA GRAHAM died last year at the age of 96. She was central to the creation of American modern dance as performer, teacher and choreographer. Whether we may separate the dancer from the dance, and understand Graham best as a supreme performer whose creations were a vehicle for her genius in movement, is a matter critical opinion has to address. Certainly Graham danced for far too long, making her final stage appearances when she was in her seventies. It is arguable that even 20 years before that, her performances were tinged with those hazards which make one freeze with embarrassment in the theatre. Her later works, denied her full physical presence, smacked more of formula than of inspiration. And she had by then been taken over by her other role - as sybil in what she called 'the house of the pelvic truth'. By the extreme span of her longevity, Graham connected the first aspirations of free dance in America - as propounded by the quaint activities of Ruth St. Denis in the early years of this century - with the extreme experimentation of the 1960s and '70s. Indeed, she outlived her own art. Yet for more than 20 years, when the force of her dance powers fuelled her creative drive, and the integrity of her manner and that of her troupe gave physical and psychic weight to the style she had evolved, Graham was of huge significance. It is important to stress this time-scale since the value of Agnes de Mille's biography of Graham lies in the fact that the author, nine years Graham's junior and her friend for more than half a century, saw the career and life, and recalls them in writing bold and sometimes acerbic. De Mille's text is really brilliant table-talk. There are other, inordinately worthy biographies and studies of Graham, which supply more facts - sometimes more correct facts  - and lengthier disquisitions about the Graham repertory. What de Mille gives us are memories of the woman and dancer, vivid, brisk - she is merciless with the dreadful Ted Shawn, husband of Ruth St Denis in a mariage blanc - and a passionate assessment of Graham's work, as is proper from one professional theatre artist to another. (Her description of the first performance of Primitive Mysteries in 1931 is a stunning re-creation of a great event in Graham's career.) De Mille is exceptionally good in placing Graham in her time. The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York comes grandly alive, as does Louis Horst, musician, mentor, lover, and the most influential figure in Graham's story. And de Mille is not reverential about those later years when Graham was turned into an institution. The hugely-overdue end of her dancing career, the massive drinking, the reverberations from her fraught relationship with Erick Hawkins, are a sad tale. The marketing of the ancient, arthritic and face-lifted Graham, turned into something like a Bunraku doll decked out in Halston dresses and Black-glama mink, while outside forces start to manipulate the Graham troupe and legend, makes for equally sorry reading. While de Mille was working on her text she sought her subject's help, only to be told that Graham was writing her own autobiography. This has now appeared under the suitably Graham-esque title Blood Memory and it is a fairly resistible offering. Of course Graham makes fascinating comments upon her work, and there are rare and illuminating photographs, but it is a fragmentary document, and featherweight anecdote is given an oracular tag-line to endow it with spurious significance. Do we need to know that a weekly telephone conversation with Betty Ford is 'another example of what Emily Dickinson meant by 'an act of light''? The text suggests the idea of the aged Graham as the Delphic pythoness being interviewed for Hello magazine, and ever ready to drop a name, be it Margot Fonteyn or Madonna. There is a cast of thousands, from Lotte Lehmann to Ted Shawn (whom Graham recalls recruiting young men by asking them to send nude photographs of themselves). This is the Martha Graham given to dire and winsome statements and surrounded by the beautiful people. Agnes de Mille provides the proper antidote when she recounts how Paul Taylor, in rehearsal with Graham, reacted to some pretentious suggestion with the cry of 'What a pile of shit]' - a comment with which the reader may well sympathise . But there is a passage in Graham's text which opens up a vaster aspect of Graham's art than is found in these ramblings. One of Graham's dancers of the 1930s described her to me as 'a breath-taking performer'. In her autobiography Graham observes: 'I never really cared for choreographing . . . I think I really only started to choreograph so that I could have something to show off in. It came as a great shock to me when I stopped dancing that I was honoured for my choreography.' Is this the ultimate pelvic truth about Martha Graham: a great dancer mistaken for a great choreographer?</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / New coal-fired power station on the horizon UK coal sales could be given a boost later this decade as a result of negotiations to build a combined heat and power plant in north-west England, Michael Smith writes. The proposed plant for the site of Brunner Mond, the chemicals company, in Northwich, Cheshire, would use 1m tonnes of coal a year, replacing a facility that uses just a fifth of that amount. It would be the first significant coal-fired power station to be built in several years and would provide a substantial fillip to the coal industry which has lost out recently to gas in power generation. Brunner Mond is considering the possibility of a joint venture on the clean-coal technology project with Manweb, the electricity company, and IVO, the Finnish power group.</p>

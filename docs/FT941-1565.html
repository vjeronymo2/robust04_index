			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Volvo appoints new truck chief Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, yesterday appointed a new head for its truck division. Mr Sten Langenius, who built Volvo into one of the world's top truck makers, is to step aside after 17 years and will be succeeded by Mr Karl-Erling Trogen. It is the latest move in a review of senior management, begun since it scrapped a plan to merge with France's Renault, which prompted the resignation of its long-time chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar. Mr Trogen, head of Volvo's US truck operation, was to have been in charge of truck operations in the ill-fated Renault-Volvo company. Mr Langenius, soon to reach retirement, will remain a full-time executive at Volvo as vice-president, with responsibility for the smaller marine engine and aero engine divisions. Another top Gyllenhammar executive, Mr Lennart Jeansson, was left without a clear function by the collapse of the merger plan. He had given up his position as head of the car division to Mr Per-Erik Mohlin in preparation to become finance chief of Renault-Volvo. Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said management functions within Volvo were still under review.</p>

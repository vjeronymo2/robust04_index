			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber growers may cut output to boost prices THE SEVEN major rubber producing countries - representing 90 per cent of the world's output - say they could resort to cutting production to boost prices if consumers refuse to revamp the present price support scheme, which lapses at the end of this year. Ministers from the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries who met in Bangkok yesterday refused, however, to reveal exactly how they planned to pressure consumers into lifting rubber prices from 30 year lows in real terms. Malaysia's minister of primary industries Dato Seri Dr Lim Kheng Yaik said: 'Don't ask us to expose our cards but rubber can very easily be kept in the trees. I can tell you that.' The producers complain that the current International Natural Rubber Agreement's intervention fund, set up in 1979, to which both producers and consumers contribute, tends to stabilise prices at low levels. Their problem is that global economic recession and poor sales of cars, and hence tyres, is keeping rubber prices low. Yesterday Dr Lim stressed that 'rubber is certainly not a sunset industry. As long as there are cars on the road there will be a demand for rubber'. But he went on to say 'we have to do something to help ourselves. . . where there is more production than demand we can expect prices to stay low for a long, long, time'. Malaysia has already lowered its production by about 350,000 tonnes - from 1.6m tonnes in 1988 to 1.25m tonnes in 1993. The seven producers said they would 'take a long hard look whether they wanted to be members' of the International Natural Rubber Organisation, which groups producers and over 20 consumers, if their demands were not met. They are working on a strategy of revamping the intervention fund and co-ordinating production and marketing of rubber and other commodities. Thailand's deputy minister of agriculture, Mr Suthep Thaugsuban, said they expected a response from consumers - led by the US, the European Community and Japan - this year and final agreement, if possible, next year; indicating that they might be prepared to see the current Inra rolled over for one more year. A communique issued by the producers said the International Natural Rubber Agreement needs to be 'reviewed and updated' and called for 'intensified' negotiations between producers and consumers. Consuming countries have repeatedly complained that producers are reluctant to face market forces and allow the intervention fund manager to lower his floor price. After some acrimony earlier this year the floor price was lowered from 176 Malaysia/Singapore cents a kilogram to 166 cents. Even so the buffer stock manager, who already had 180,000 tonnes in hand, said he bought for the first time this year only on Friday when the price drifted below 165 cents. Natural rubber production in Malaysia fell 11 per cent to 86,323 tonnes in June, compared with the same month last year, the statistics department said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Production for the first six months of the year was 537,480 tonnes, 4 per cent lower than in the same 1992 period. Malaysia exported 66,452 tonnes of rubber in June, down 13 per cent from a year ago and 11 per cent less than in May.</p>

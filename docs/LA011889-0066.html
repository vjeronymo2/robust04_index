			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MARCOS INVESTIGATOR KILLED  </P> <P> Gunmen assassinated an official of a Philippine government panel charged with  recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth of ousted President Ferdinand E.  Marcos and his associates, police said. A few hours after the slaying of Jesus  Ronan, another member of the Presidential Commission on Good Government  received a death threat, officials said. Ronan, 58, a former air force colonel  and operations director of the commission, was shot twice in the head. There  was no claim of responsibility, but Commissioner David Castro said Ronan was  slain because he enforced orders to sequester companies that Marcos or his  cronies are believed to have acquired illegally.  </P></p>

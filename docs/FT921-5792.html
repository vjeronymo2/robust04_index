			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Warning of increase in inflation BUDGET plans for tax cuts or higher public spending on infrastructure investment could lead to higher inflation and unemployment unless combined with a policy of co-ordinated wage restraint, a leading left-of-centre think tank argues today, Edward Balls writes. An expansionary Budget is needed to prevent unemployment rising to 3m this year, according to the Institute of Public Policy Research. Such a Budget should include a short-term programme of maintenance of schools, hospitals and council houses, it says. Central government restrictions on the ability of local authorities to build new homes should also be lifted. Yet boosting demand could lead to a renewed bout of wage and price inflation unless unions and employers agree to limit pay settlements, the report argues. The institute says the government should open talks with employers and unions in order to draw up a pay policy. Any workable strategy would have to contain an agreement on the desired 'going rate' of pay settlements and the circumstances under which exceptional increases could be allowed.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's address by Prime Minister Patsatsia; read by </F> announcer]    [Text] Dear compatriots: 1993 will soon be gone. It was  the hardest year for the Georgian people, when the fate of  Georgian statehood was hanging in balance. Political  cataclysms, rampant separatism, internal disorder, and betrayal  had a negative effect on the country's agriculture, which was in  difficulties because of both objective and subjective reasons.    The country's industrial potential dwindled so dramatically  that it can now produce at only 20 percent capacity. Social  discomfort and peoples' hardships reached a critical limit. Yet  1993 was the year of Georgia's salvation. It was the year of  bravery of Georgia's sons and the halo on the ascension of  Georgia's soul. It was the year of true democracy, the victory  over an attempt to establish neo-Bolshevism, and the final turn  toward the irreversible process of Georgia's unity.    Georgia's Cabinet of Ministers believes that the practical  measures carried out in 1993 for minimally accommodating the  social security of the socially insecure strata were not enough.  We are hoping to use all of our efforts and resources to  resolve this issue next year. I would like to tell you that as  of 1 February wages will rise considerably.    You know that as a result of the head of state's efforts and  through his immediate participation, many countries around the  world extended a helping hand to us and alleviated our situation  considerably. This aid will continue, but we can be saved only  if Georgia's economy is restored and if it starts to function at  full force. The prospect for this has become a reality as a  result of the agreements signed in Ashgabat. Serious investment  in the republic's economy by individual concerns and firms is  emerging. The only indespensible condition for a full  functioning of the country's potential abilities is, of course,  stabilization.    Georgia's cabinet of ministers will do its best to secure  stability in 1994. I would like to assure you that a battle  against mafia clans and organized crime will be stepped up even  more.    The New Year will enter everyone's homes in several hours.    May it carry peace, kindness, and happiness for all of you.    I wish you a Happy New Year.    Otar Patsatsia, prime minister of the Republic of Georgia.</p>

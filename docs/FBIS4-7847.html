			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 6 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of the  Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic today received Milan  Martic, president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], and  Borisav Mikelic, prime minister designate of the new RSK  government, who informed him about their efforts to stabilize  Krajina politically and economically, about the successful  cooperation with collectives in Serbia, and about the peace  efforts of the RSK leadership.    President Milosevic expressed his support for the start-up  of  the peace negotiations between Knin and Zagreb, expressing his  conviction that the peace talks were the only correct way of  resolving the Yugoslav crisis and that their success would,  without doubt, be a defeat for those in favor of war.    The Serbian president at the same time noted the danger of  extremists and extremism, which are damaging the interests of  the Serb people, and in particular he pointed to the danger of  the activities of some members of the Serbian Radical Party and  other irresponsible groups and individuals in the RSK. Their  destructive behavior in the RSK Assembly clearly shows that the  interests of Krajina are their least concern. The danger of  extremists supplementing their moral and political defeat in  Serbia by running amok in Krajina is a serious threat to the  interests of Krajina. Hence, it is vital that these forces are  marginalized and placed under the control of the Serb  authorities in Krajina as soon as possible and that individuals  who have contravened the law and are up to their necks in crime  are brought to book as soon as possible. The Serb nation, which  is proud of its freedom-loving past, should not allow extremists  and criminals to tarnish its reputation, President Milosevic  stressed.    Stressing that the normalization of Serb-Croat relations as  a  whole is of crucial influence for peace and stability in the  region, the Serbian president wished the new leadership of the  RSK success in its work and success in the realization of the  cease-fire agreement between the Croatian army and the RSK army.    It was announced that Milan Martic and Borisav Mikelic  expressed their agreement both as regards the policy of  resolving disputes by peaceful means and as regards the danger  of extremism, and they stressed their efforts to strengthen the  legal institutions and legality.    Mirko Marjanovic, prime minister of the Republic of Serbia,  also took part in the talks.</p>

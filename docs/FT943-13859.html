			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / MoD yet to finalise plan to curb research spending The Ministry of Defence has admitted that it has no detailed plans of how it will save the Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m a year from its science research budget which was promised in last week's defence cuts. Nor is it sure where the proposed 1,300 job cuts will fall. In spite of eight months' study under its Front Line First review, the ministry has yet to work out where to make most of the redundancies or where the proposed new science agency will be based. The ministry has acknowledged that both the savings and job cuts figures given in the package of cuts last Thursday are estimates. In its report the government proposed to set up a Science and Technology Agency to replace the multitude of smaller research operations currently spread around the country. It will cover all of the ministry's non-nuclear scientific research and will be modelled on the Defence Research Agency, which was established last year and is based at Farnborough in Hampshire. Detailed proposals will have to wait until the new agency is established, which may not be until next April. The ministry spends Pounds 600m a year and employs about 20,000 people on research. It also funds about Pounds 1.8bn of development in the private sector. The STA will have its own chief executive and budget and will act as a supplier of services to the MoD. The STA's main divisions will be the Defence Research Agency with 8,500 staff, a test and evaluation centre employing 2,825, the Chemical and Biological Defence establishment at Porton Down with 615 people and a small defence operational analysis centre. A number of smaller groups will be consolidated into one of these divisions. The DRA conducts most of the ministry's basic scientific research, while Porton Down studies chemical and biological warfare. The test and evaluation centre verifies weapons performance and runs some missile test ranges. The operational analysis centre evaluates threats and forecasts what weapons systems might be needed to counter them. The market-based efficiency improvements which were introduced to the DRA last year will be extended to the rest of the science divisions, and the ministry thinks that this will save Pounds 12m a year. All science operations will have to tender for work from the ministry and will have a strong incentive to cut overheads and improve efficiency. More substantial savings will come from changing work at the DRA. The agency will only work on areas which are likely to provide useful weapons in the next 20 years. Previously the brief was even more vague, and this narrowing of focus is due to save Pounds 20m a year. Observer, Page 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, on 4 May, the U.S.  imperialists waged an aerial surprise strike exercise with the  South Korean puppets, by introducing fighter-bombers,  pursuit-assault planes, early warning planes, and electronic  jamming planes from overseas bases into South Korea.    Prior to this provocative war exercise, EA-6 electronic  jamming planes, which had been flown in from a Japanese base,  created an electronic jam by flying into the areas over Yongwol  and Pyongchang--the operational areas.    Timed with this, E-3 early warning planes mobilized from  overseas bases ran amok in waging an exercise of launching a  surprise bombing by calling air squadrons [pihaengdaedul] out,  while flying in the air where an electronic jam had been created.    Converged into this extremely dangerous war were air  squadrons which had come from U.S. Pacific bases and  fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and  (?reconnaissance) planes belonging to the U.S. occupation air  force in South Korea and to the puppet air force.    In the meantime, the puppet Army's 105-mm artillery group,  which held firing positions in Mago-ri, Yonchon County; and  Naedae-ri, Chorwon County and (Tajon-ni), Inje County, Kangwon  Province of South Korea, displayed that day a war frenzy by  firing several tens of rounds at the areas near the DMZ of the  Military Demarcation Line.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Setback for Shanghai A shares as Nikkei declines Although the dollar's rise to the Y101 level supported share prices in the morning, the Nikkei 225 average finally closed lower on arbitrage unwinding and selling by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 45.61 down at 20,590.22 after a day's high of 20,774.75 in the morning and a low of 20,583.22 in the afternoon. The dollar moved above Y101 for the first time in six weeks, while a rise in the Chicago futures market on Monday prompted buying by arbitrageurs. But afternoon selling eroded the gains. Volume was 259.3m shares, against 225m. Small-lot buying supported a wide range of stocks, but lack of follow-through buying, mostly due to summer holiday absences, prompted profit-taking. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 0.63 to 1,656.15, while the Nikkei 300 firmed 0.07 to 301.01. Declines led advances by 517 to 472, with 163 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.28 to 1,343.24. The day's four most active stocks were steels on buying by foreign investors: Sumitomo Metal Industries, the day's most active issue, put on Y3 at Y323, Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y368, Kawasaki Steel gained Y4 at Y368 and NKK dipped Y3 to Y281. Chemical issues, expected to record an increase in earnings due to a recovery in industrial production, were higher on continued foreign buying. Showa Denko added Y6 at Y367 and Ube Industries Y5 at Y410. Takasago International, the fragrance maker, rose Y19 to Y840. The company supplies fragrances for cigarettes to Japan Tobacco, whose shares are being auctioned next week ahead of its listing in October. Profit-taking depressed Aids-related stocks, which have been supported recently by interest related to the International Aids Conference currently being held in Yokohama. Green Cross, the blood plasma maker, fell Y40 to Y1,130 and Ajinomoto, the foods maker which is involved in the development of an Aids cure, declined Y40 to Y1,320. East Japan Railway lost Y2,000 at Y520,000: after the market closed, the Tokyo stock exchange authorities said it would add JR East to its list of stocks eligible for margin trading from August 18. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 28.46 at 23,017.20 in volume of 43.8m shares. Roundup Second thoughts in Shanghai, and weakness in Hong Kong and Wellington, were the outstanding features in the region. SHANGHAI's A shares plunged by 13.1 per cent in a powerful technical correction following the index gain of more than 117 per cent in the previous six trading days. The index lost 95.63 at 633.90 in reduced turnover of Yn6.87bn. Analysts suggested that market sentiment was still strong but expected the consolidation to continue today. Shanghai's B index, meanwile, was dragged lower by general weakness in sentiment to 77.02, a decline of 1.92. HONG KONG lost nearly 1 per cent, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index falling 91.44 to 9,446.43 in thin trade. Analysts suggested that investors were holding back over interest rate uncertainty and did not expect trading to pick up until the US FOMC meeting. The garment retailer Giordano slid 20 cents to HKDollars 3.99 after the Chinese authorities ordered the closure of its Beijing store. WELLINGTON fell 1.4 per cent amid worries about Saturday's by-election in the vacant parliamentary seat of Selwyn, the NZSE-40 capital index closing 30.39 lower at 2,076.23. The market was shaken by Prime Minister Jim Bolger's comments warning of disaster if the opposition Alliance won the by-election, a prospect which a poll saw as increasingly possible. A win by the Alliance, which has said it would raise taxes on the rich and redesign the Reserve Bank Act, would be taken negatively by the markets. AUSTRALIA ended slightly higher on firm futures in turnover of 161m shares worth ADollars 252.7m. The All Ordinaries index moved up 5.7 to 2,086.8 as the September futures contract rallied 12 to 2,103, four points off its high. BHP climbed 14 cents to ADollars 19.62; but Coca-Cola Amatil receded 7 cents to ADollars 9.28 after reports of analysts reacting coolly to the company's interim net profits. KARACHI finished a shade firmer on institutional demand for blue chips. The Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share price index put on 2.44 at 2,292.01. ICI Pakistan gained Rs6 at Rs233 on expectations of good results being announced next week. General bullishness in the mutual fund sector, and prospects of good half-year and annual results, pushed First Confidence Modaraba ahead Rs1.50 to Rs24.00 and LTV Modoraba up Rs1.55 to Rs24.30. BOMBAY gained ground on buying across a broad front. The BSE 30-share index closed 21.74 higher at 4,319.08 as analysts said investment buying was strong but that overseas funds had withdrawn from the market.</p>

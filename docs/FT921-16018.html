			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Taking plenty of food for granted - Falling self-sufficiency matters because of the widening trade deficit IMAGINE PAYING the equivalent of two months' salary for a couple of kilograms of fat pork and having to queue for it for up to half a day with no guarantee that there would be any left when you reached the shop counter. This is the prospect facing the citizens of Moscow and a great many of the cities of what used to be the Soviet Union this cold Russian January. It really makes you appreciate an abundance of food, doesn't it? Or does it? Apart from a few hiccups with sugar and potatoes in the mid 1970s, British people have not experienced a shortage of any food or drink since the second world war and the few years of rationing after it. Most of today's consumers were not even born then so perhaps we have come to take food for granted. The level of UK self-sufficiency in food that can be produced in our climate was about 30 per cent during and just after the war years. Higher yields and greater farming efficiency raised this figure to nearly 80 per cent by the early 1980s but it has slipped back since then to between 73 per cent and 75 per cent and the downward trend appears to be continuing. British self-sufficiency in all foods, including those from warmer climates, was just 56.4 per cent in 1990, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, so the country is still heavily dependent on food imports. But does it matter you may ask. After all, there is plenty of cheap food on world markets. It might even be cheaper to import it rather than try to grow it at home. The problem, surely, is food surpluses? As you would expect, farmers, myself included, believe that it does matter, and not just because of the effects on our incomes. Indeed the food and drink sector has become the largest single contributor to the UK's trade deficit at Pounds 6bn, or 42 per cent of the total. Furthermore, close to 60 per cent of that figure is with northern European nations with climatic conditions similar to our own. In other words, those imported products could just as easily have been grown at home. Even more worrying, for the government as well as for farmers, is that total food and drink imports into the UK virtually doubled during the decade 1980-90. Moreover, forecasters have predicted that, if the trend is not halted, by the year 2000 Britain will have a food trade gap with northern Europe of well over Pounds 4bn. The reasons for all this are many and varied. They range from accidents of history to the changing tastes of British consumers returning from holidays abroad. On the face of it, Britain benefitted from having its agricultural revolution in the Middle Ages and developing, thanks to the principal of primogeniture, an industry composed of yeoman farmers surrounded by broad acres. In some parts of Europe the Code Napoleon still dictates that when a farmer dies his property be divided between his children, leading to the fragmentation of farms. The practice in Britain, where the eldest son normally inherits the land, may be seen by second and subsequent children as unfair but it has allowed efficient-sized holdings to be maintained. In retrospect, however, the small acreages run by European farmers virtually forced them to co-operate in order to survive. Some of these long-established co-operatives, which handle and market almost all of their members' produce, are now huge and powerful. They are able to accept large orders for packaged produce amalgamated from their members and to deal on equal terms with big retailers. Britain's farmers on the other hand did not see any need to co-operate. Furthermore, when it was recognised in the depressed 1930s that there was a need for better organised marketing of farm produce, the solution adopted was statutory marketing boards, which, by guaranteeing to market their produce, tended to insulate farmers from the marketplace. It is hardly surprising therefore that British farmers are poor co-operators, and that many of their recent efforts to organise have ended in tears. Meanwhile the big supermarkets - which are much more significant than in any other European Community country, claiming over 60 per cent of the food and drinks market between them - are tempted to buy abroad rather than from domestic producers, some of whom find it difficult to produce the quality required in the quantities required. More recently the system of quotas imposed by the EC has inhibited UK farmers from increasing production to supply a bigger proportion of the home market. The EC milk quota, for instance, ensures that although British farms supply virtually all the milk required for liquid consumption, the UK has to import 35 per cent of its butter and 36 per cent of its cheese requirements. Britain's EC sugar quota restricts UK production to just 56 per cent of its requirements, while co-responsibility levies paid by UK farmers on several commodities the EC has a surplus in but in which this country is not self-sufficient, act as a disincentive to production. The food trade gap could of course be improved by greater exports of UK food or by successful import substitution, and many individual companies, together with the promotional organisation Food from Britain, are attempting both. The problem is lack of resources for advertising. Food from Britain for instance has a total budget of Pounds 7.7m (compared with a total UK food industry turnover of about Pounds 40bn) of which Pounds 3.2m comes from the agricultural industry and Pounds 4.5m from the British government. Similar organisations in France and Germany receive up to 10 times more government aid, as well as matching contributions from farmers. As Mr Paul Judge, the FFB chairman, told an all-party House of Commons select committee investigating the food trade gap last month: 'It is hardly a level playing-field.' The danger is, if, as a result of ever declining margins, UK food availability falls back further, big food processors may decide to base themselves in other EC countries and treat Britain as an offshore island to be supplied from the mainland. Indeed I understand that Cadbury has already made such a move and other companies seem set to follow. The problem hardly compares in magnitude to that facing Muscovites and St Petersburgers. But at a time when the UK's economy is not exactly booming it should surely concern the British government that the balance of payments is being eroded in this way. It certainly concerns me that, at a time when I am being urged to produce for the market, the market may be going elsewhere.</p>

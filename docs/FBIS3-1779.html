Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and secretary of the CCDI, presided over the meeting.    Jiang Zemin said: This CCDI plenary session is very  necessary to sum up the anticorruption drive in the previous  period and make plans for the next stage in accordance with the  Central Committee's suggestions. Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered  a very good report to the session. I'm in full agreement. We  should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the  achievements already made.    Assessing the anticorruption efforts in the previous stage,  Jiang Zemin said: There are four points that should be  stressed: First, we have been fairly successful and achieved,  by and large, the expected results. Thanks to the common  efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying degrees of  success in the three tasks set by the Central Committee for the  near future. The results are even more pronounced in localities  and departments that have done a better job in implementing this  work. Facts have shown that although the anticorruption drive  involves considerable difficulties, we are able to cut, step by  step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so long as the leadership  takes it seriously, enlists the participation of the masses, and  works together with them with one heart and one mind. Second,  the work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting the  short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central Committee  pronounced a number of specific principles and policies which  have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will be closely  integrated with reform and construction. Practice has shown  that this work has -- rather than standing in the way of reform  and construction -- served as an important guarantee for reform,  opening up, and economic construction. Third, judging from the  problems that have been exposed, corrupt phenomena are serious.  We must continue our efforts with determination. Fourth, the  tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our efforts. In  view of the actual problems that are out there and the people's  demands of us, the work we have done so far falls considerably  short. Many problems have not been solved well and the masses  remain dissatisfied. We must continue to pay close attention to  the anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the  achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep  a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the  anticorruption drive well.    Speaking of the next stage of the anticorruption drive,  Jiang  Zemin pointed out: The Central Committee has set the basic  policy and overall requirements for the work of the whole party  in 1994. The anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve  these basic principles and overall requirements and it must be  implemented in a deepgoing, sustained, and more effective  manner. This is the general requirement. It can't be expected  that the anticorruption drive will be completed in a single  battle. Rather, we should solve the problems one by one,  investigate the cases one by one, deepen the drive step by step,  and push it forward phase by phase. We should be prepared to  fight a prolonged war. We must not slacken our efforts to the  slightest degree; we must never provide a "pliable environment"  for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the corrupt  elements to act willfully and get off scot-free. In addition to  the three main tasks set by the Central Committee last August,  the current session has put forward some new requirements. All  localities and departments must earnestly carry them out. Those  departments or localities that did pay adequate attention to  this work in the previous stage must bestir themselves and catch  up.       Jiang Zemin said: We gained an important experience  from the anticorruption drive in the early period; namely, we  must firmly believe and rely on the masses and must combine the  arousing of the masses to report corruption cases to the  authorities with the special organs' investigating them  according to law. We must continue to adhere to this  experience. We must resolutely conduct a thorough investigation  of the corruption problems exposed, especially the big and  important cases, and sternly deal with them. We must pay  attention to policies and stress focal points when rectifying  unhealthy practices and fighting corruption. While launching  the anticorruption drive, we must make improvement and build the  party as well as a clean and honest government; we must address  the issue by looking into both its root cause and symptoms. We  must conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons by directing  our efforts in this connection against the problems exposed and  the loopholes existing in control, rules, and regulations; we  must improve our rules and regulations, strengthen control, and  resolutely get rid of bureaucracy.    Jiang Zemin stressed: The key to launching an in-depth and  sustained drive against corruption more effectively lies in  strengthening leadership. The party committees and governments  at all levels must properly handle the relationship between  reform and development and between development and stability;  they must firmly grasp the central task of economic  construction; they must persist in attaching equal importance to  two types of work [promote reform and opening up and, at the  same time, crack down on all kinds of criminal activities]; they  must make overall plans and take all factors into consideration;  and they must successfully integrate the anticorruption drive  with deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development,  and maintaining stability. Principal party and government  leaders must personally handle the task and solve important  problems. They must support the work of discipline inspection,  supervisory, and judicial organs and coordinate the  relationships between all departments concerned so as to join  forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption  drive.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin called on the whole party to  further consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties  between the party and the masses of the people. He said: The  ties between the party and the masses of the people is a  fundamental political issue that has a bearing on the success of  the party's cause and on the matter of its life and death. This  principle must be stressed repeatedly; the alarm must be sounded  for a long time to make sure that all comrades of the party  attach a high degree of importance to it. Our party represents  the people to take control of political power; all its  activities are conducted for the sake of protecting and  fulfilling the interests of the broad masses of the people. If  we fail to strengthen the ties between the party and the masses  of the people, do not pay attention to eliminating the phenomena  of divorcing ourselves from the masses, and let corruption  spread unchecked, we would lose popular sympathy. We must  resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of divorcing  ourselves from the masses. The masses are the source of our  strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished  heritage. The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular,  leading cadres must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint,  adhere to the party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves  among the masses, and improve their ideological and work style  in a down-to-earth manner. They are a necessity not only for  implementing the party's line, principles, and policies, but  also for successfully fulfilling various tasks, for continuously  remolding world outlook, and for resisting corruption and  preventing [peaceful] evolution. So far as Communists are  concerned, the issues of stand, ideology, and feelings are  fundamental ones. When communists divorce themselves from the  masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal and woe, and become  apathetic, their thinking will inevitably degenerate and it  becomes hard for them to avoid corruption in action.    At last, Jiang Zemin said: The current situation in the  whole country is very good. However, we must be aware that some  contradictions and problems still confront us in our march  forward and that some destabilizing factors still exist in  society. We must attach a high degree of importance to these  issues and must not lower our guard. Leading cadres at all  levels and, in particular, principal leading cadres must  personally take a hand in successfully solving the conspicuous  problems in their own local areas. The tasks undertaken by the  party committees and governments at all levels are very heavy.  They must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels  and on the masses. The party and its cadres must work together  with the masses with one mind to maintain political stability;  to create a favorable social environment; to accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economy; to maintain  sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [bao  chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0202 2170  0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455];  and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to build  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Today's meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People.  Comrades in charge of all departments of the organs directly  under the CPC Central Committee, comrades in charge of all CPC  Central Committee organs and state organs, and comrades  attending the All- Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference  also participated in the meeting.</p>

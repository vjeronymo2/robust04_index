			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> PLAY TELLS TRAGIC TALE OF TEEN AIDS  </P> <P> Her voice rising, grief etched into her young face, Angie turns to Rudy and  cries out, "You don't understand; kids can get AIDS, too! My brother. . . ."  She lowers her eyes and says softly, "My brother died of AIDS last year."  </P> <P> It is a dramatic moment in a play produced by the Teen Teatro AIDS Prevention  Project, a division of Avance Human Services. The audience -- teen-agers  themselves -- reacts with a mixture of tears, thoughtful silence and a few  embarrassed snickers. But as the word gets out about AIDS, the teen-age actors  are hearing a lot less laughter from their young audiences.  </P> <P> The play is entertaining all right, but its message -- that even teen-agers are  at risk of contracting AIDS -- is deadly serious.  </P> <P> The young actors who play Angie, Rudy and other characters speak peer to peer  about what has all too often been an unspeakable subject in the Latino teen-age  community -- AIDS. The actors are street-smart and cool. And they speak a  language that communicates far better than any white-coated doctor lecturing  with charts and graphs.  </P> <P> The facts about AIDS are sobering. Latinos make up 7% of the U.S. population  but 14% of the nation's AIDS cases. In Orange County, the incidence of Latinos  with AIDS is lower than the national average at 12.5% of all reported cases,  but it rises to 18% in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Nationwide, 20% of women with AIDS are Latinas, and one in five teen-agers with  AIDS is Latino. AIDS experts are particularly concerned that Latino youths are  engaged in behavior that puts them at high risk for contracting the fatal  disease.  </P> <P> Eve Rubell, administrative coordinator of the Avance AIDS Community Outreach  Service, stated what most parents would rather not acknowledge: "Kids are  having a lot of sex. They think monogamy is having just one partner for a month  or two, then going on to another partner."  </P> <P> Rubell said a sizable majority of sexually active teen-agers do not use  condoms, leaving them in peril of being infected by the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> "Right now the number of teens infected with AIDS is not that high," she said,  "but so many are engaging in high-risk behavior that a sizable number could  very well become ill in their early 20s."  </P> <P> Janet Martinez of AIDS Project Los Angeles said, "There's a lot of denial going  on in the Latino community. People don't want to talk about sex so we have to  come up with creative ways, through theater or education, to do whatever we  can. The (Teen Teatro) performances are very therapeutic because they create  awareness about the risks and provide the kids with the information they need."  </P> <P> If Angie's tragic story about her brother does not move the young audience  watching the play, Rudy's probably will.  </P> <P> He is the cute guy who dates all the girls -- and doesn't believe in using  condoms or taking precautions. Or there is Christina, a drug user who has shot  up with shared needles, another AIDS high-risk action. And then there is  homeboy Joe, who thought it was macho to get a tattoo from a sleazy parlor. But  now he, like the others, is scared.  </P> <P> Just to make sure Latino youths get the message, each teatro performance is  conducted in English and Spanish. A bilingual question-and-answer session after  each performance lets the audience ask the most personal and embarrassing  questions and get direct, no-nonsense answers.  </P> <P> How effective the teatro is in changing teen-age attitudes toward AIDS is  difficult to measure, but Rubell believes that the play hits home. "Before  teens change their behavior, they have to believe they're at risk."  </P> <P> Rubell said the teatro emphasizes that "it does not matter whether you have sex  with a man or woman, what matters is whether you practice 'safer sex.' Using  condoms is safer than nothing at all, but it's not 100% safe. Abstinence would  be safest . . . for preventing the AIDS virus transmission. But if you are  going to have sex, use condoms."  </P> <P> The teatro program "has been pretty well accepted," she said. "Although some  Catholic groups haven't wanted us to present it, others have. And there have  been no negative reactions as far as I know."  </P> <P> Several weeks after a performance at Bancroft Junior High School in Hollywood,  Principal Peggy Selma admitted, "I was a little apprehensive toward the end of  the program with all the talk about condoms, but honestly, I have not heard any  negative feedback -- not from students, the Student Council, not even from  parents."  </P> <P> Following one recent performance of "AIDS . . . I Want to Know," a  16-year-old-girl burst into tears. "One of my best friends got AIDS," she  sobbed. "And when people found out he was sick, nobody would even talk to him.  If they had seen what we saw today, then maybe he wouldn't have died alone."  </P> <P> Elizabeth Rodriguez, 18, who plays Christina in the play, said, "Many teens  don't know very much about AIDS because their parents are strict and don't want  them to know."  </P> <P> But the teen-agers -- and their parents -- have to know, teatro members insist.  As Angie concludes in a dramatic moment in the performance, "we are talking  about death and survival here."  </P> <P> AIDS RESOURCES  </P> <P> The Avance teen-age theater group is available for performances throughout  Southern California.

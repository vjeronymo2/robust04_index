			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Adams attacks Ulster veto as bar to peace process Sinn Fein appeared last night to be moving towards rejecting the UK-Irish peace initiative after Mr Gerry Adams delivered a strong attack on Northern Ireland's right to self-determination. In a speech in the republican stronghold of west Belfast, the Sinn Fein president said 'genuine' peace in Ireland depended upon the British government's recognition of the right of the Irish people to determine their own future. 'Partition and continued support for the loyalist veto are a recipe for ongoing conflict,' Mr Adams warned. Downing Street said last night it would study Mr Adams's words carefully, but 'what the people in Northern Ireland need is a signal that the terrorists will call a permanent cessation of their violence'. Mr Adams's speech came as Mr John Major accused the IRA's political wing of being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the Downing Street declaration. The British prime minister sought to increase pressure on republican leaders by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Last night's developments overshadowed concern expressed earlier on both sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland. Speaking little more than a day after Mr Martin McGuinness, another senior Sinn Fein spokesman, dismissed as unacceptable any British offer short of eventual withdrawal, Mr Adams called on London and Dublin to make the 'exercise of Irish national self-determination' their 'policy objective'. 'Partitionist solutions cannot create the conditions of peace and democracy in Ireland,' Mr Adams said. 'Since the partition of Ireland, the Irish people's right to self-determination has been denied by the British government and parliament. Partition represents the most fundamental denial of democracy.' The Sinn Fein president acknowledged that the joint declaration contained 'for the first time ever' a recognition by Britain that the Irish people 'as a whole' had the right to self-determination. But he said the 'deadlock' had not yet been broken. He also acknowledged the right of unionists - whom he called 'the Irish minority' - to be consulted. Downing Street has taken great pains to reassure unionists that the joint declaration did nothing to dilute their effective veto over any change in the province's constitutional status. Addressing MPs on the day the joint declaration was agreed last month, Mr Major stated specifically that the document contained no suggestion that Northern Ireland's future status 'should be decided by a single act of self-determination by the people of Ireland as whole'. Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded talks which began in 1992. Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994. Sinn Fein is excluded from the process, but Mr Major confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA violence. In a passage aimed at the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'. But unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern conflict'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dieter Mueller: ``First German </F> Facility for Chemical Recycling of Polyurethane''; Subhead: ``Up  to 1000 Tons Per Year of Polyurethane Waste Materials from  Production of Shoe Soles to Undergo Recycling by Being Broken  Down into Source Materials'']    [Text] Pirmasens, 11 March 1994 -- Up until now industry  has been able at most to process polyurethane [PUR] systems into  pressed slabs via very unsatisfactory ``particle recycling.''  Such is no longer the case. Regra Recycling GmbH in  Pirmasens-Gersbach recently introduced the first facility  throughout the FRG for chemical recycling of the production  waste materials from PUR shoe soles. In the view of Prof. Dr.  Gunter Bauer of Aalen College, it can rightfully claim to be a  strictly defined recycling principle.    In the words of Heinz Bader, Regra's managing director, the  nearly DM1.7 million investment in the new PUR recycling system  should be amortized in fewer than five years. He sees the  reasons for this in the rising costs for disposal and the  somewhat more favorable prices for the recycled material  ``Recypol,'' compared to new material. But what makes the system  quickly profitable is primarily the fact that up to 20 percent  of the PUR shoe sole output can be reincorporated into the new  material. Nor do existing facilities have to be overhauled. Only  a metered product feed system has to be integrated for delivery  of the recycled material, as Bader explained when introducing  the PUR recycling system in Pirmasens in the middle of December.    The batch-processing facility has a capacity of 1000 tons  per  year. Superficially considered, therefore, it would be  over-sized for processing the approximately 70 t per year that  result from the chlorofluorocarbon [CFC]-free shoe sole output  of Regra Kunststofftechnik GmbH. But the company is offering the  excess capacity to other firms that use similar PUR systems for  recycling on a paid basis. Additionally, Bader figures that the  investment risk is limited. The nearly 70 tons of PUR waste  materials from his own group to be processed, have a materials  value of nearly DM400,000. As the Regra managing director puts  it: ``Valuable replacement materials that are too good to  dispose of, not to mention the high fees for doing so.''    By comparison, the system was built by Kloeckner Ferromatik  Desma, Achim, to the specifications of the recycling firm and  costs approximately DM500,000, excluding R&amp;D outlays. Prof.  Dr.  Gunter Bauer of Aalen College holds the patent for the process.  He was entrusted with its development under a Regra research  commission. The recycling company, however, has secured for  itself exclusive market licensing. Elastogram GmbH, Lemfoerde, a  member of the BASF group, contributed applied engineering  support as a raw materials supplier of PUR systems. Development  and creation of the system were sponsored by the  Rhineland-Palatinate environmental and economic ministries.  Bader applauded the support as nothing to be taken for granted.    According to Prof. Bauer, the goal in developing the process  was not to include any new materials (polyol and isocyanate  components) in the process. ``That means radically modifying the  process so that the only materials used for it are those already  used in the manufacture of shoe soles.'' In this context, polyol  is combined in a reactor with the waste material and converted  into a dispersion at a maximum of 200 degrees C, using a  catalyst. The Aalen professor optimistically explained: ``That  is why this recycling process can rightfully claim to be a  strictly defined recycling principle.''    One qualification has to be made, however. The process has  to  be respectively adjusted for the specific PUR recipe. Recycling  experts, therefore, cannot convert one recipe one day and  another the next day into a singly recycled polyol or even  deliver blended PUR waste materials to the process. Still,  managing director Baden is optimistic about finding customers  for the system and/or recycling orders on a paid basis in the  shoe sole recycling sector initially because of the similar  recipes. As Prof. Bauer states: ``Other PUR processors are  confronting the same problems as we are.'' For example, five  million tons of PUR systems are used around the world (1991). Up  to eight percent of that results from product waste materials.  In this context, advances in PUR recycling technology are making  a noticeable contribution to the saving of resources.    Progress has also been reported in the field of processing  blended PUR waste materials using glycolysis. Bernard Naber, a  degreed chemist and recycling expert with BASF Schwarzheide  GmbH, reported this in the course of Regra's introduction of a  project of the Development Corporation for the Recycling of  Plastics [EWvK] in Wiesbaden, in which recycling was tried out  on 1.6 tons of PUR low-density foamed material from used car  seats. As concluded by PUR experts, each automobile accounts for  nearly 10 kg of foamed material of various sorts (block,  cold-formed, heat-formed foamed material).    In the words of Naber, the non-uniform chemical composition  made it impossible to sort out the waste materials. Still,  according to the Schwarzheide PUR recycling expert, despite such  unfavorable preconditions, glycolysis is ``exceptionally well''  suited to be a recycling process. The reason is that in the  quest for new fields of application, it turned out that the PUR  recycled product can be used especially for the production of  solid foamed material as well as coating systems. PUR  specialists reintroduced up to 81 percent of the recycled  product into the polyol components for a solid foam and up to 90  percent for a coating system. Naber is convinced: ``The recycled  products display a properties profile that is comparable to that  of conventionally manufactured PUR products.'' As early as the  spring of 1994, therefore, an initial facility operating  according to such specifications, is supposed to start  processing the product residue of a large FRG automobile  supplier.</p>

The life of the  president was exposed to danger, because the power supply in the  air traffic control center in Rostov-na-Donu (the "Strela"  center) was suddenly turned off "for nonpayment of its electric  bill."    The Strela center was turned off at the very moment when, in  addition to the president's aircraft, there was the largest  number of Il's, Tu's, and Western Boeings in the air space of  the Southern region.    "This was the first incident in the history of world civil  aviation when a dangerous situation of such a scale was created  in fact not as a result of an accident, but by the absolutely  deliberate actions of a person," notes an observer. "Meanwhile,  specialists know that even less dangerous disruptions in air  traffic can lead to a fatal disaster"    In revealing the extremely alarming situation in air  transport, the observer reports that within two days after the  "presidential" incident, the electricity from the air traffic  control center in Rostov was cut off once again. This time,  Sergey Shakhray, a recent deputy prime minister and now a member  of the Security Council of Russia, was in one of the aircraft  that ended up in the "dead zone."</p>

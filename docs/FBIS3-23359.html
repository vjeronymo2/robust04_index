Reports say the Iranian city of Darja last October witnessed  meetings between Naser al-Din, an official from the pro-Tehran  Shiite Afghan Wihdah Party, and Me'iri, an Iranian major  general. The two sides agreed that the Afghan Wihdah Party would  send several of its members to receive military and security  training at the Hizballah camps. It has been learned the  cooperation is designed to acclimatize Afghans to fight on  terrain different from their own and to tighten friendship and  cooperation between Afghan and other extreme fundamentalists.    This is in addition to other security and political  considerations. The aim is to bring together various  fundamentalist groups in Lebanon that Iran can keep as reserves  for possible future actions in the region. The Afghans are  deployed in a number of Hizballah centers in al-Biqa', Beirut,  and Ba'labakk. They are receiving training at premises of  Ja'farite scientific seminaries supervised by an Iranian. At  the Hizballah camps in Hanta, the Afghans are being trained in  the use of anti-tank TOW rockets alongside Sudanese, Tunisians,  and Algerians. At the Hizballah base for naval training on the  banks of the al-'Aji River in al-Hirmil, Afghans are being  instructed in diving skills and naval mines detonation by  Bahrasi, an Iranian expert.    According to security sources, Afghans are receiving  training  in Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

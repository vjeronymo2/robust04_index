			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Scotch a la Kirov - Ballet On Wednesday night the Kirov Ballet presented something which announced itself 'A Gala Programme'. In the event, two promised items - Jerome Robbins' In the Night and Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux - did not materialise, and were replaced by quaintnesses which had the debilitating effect of a diet of macaroons. One major piece, though, was on view: Balanchine's Scotch Symphony, and Kirov style redeemed some (if not all) of the rest of the programme. The evening was, indeed, an occasion to savour manner rather then matter, to see how the aristocracy of St Petersburg training can rescue the ghastliest nonsense. The Fairy Doll is an insupportable bit of sugared whimsy: diabetics should not even be in the same theatre as this antique bonbon, which dates from 1903. It involves a terminally cute danseuse, in Cartland pink, being courted with maximum roguishness by two clowns. Hell gapes. Yet even the men's noxious capers are illuminated by distinction of technique: their education wins through. I can offer no bouquets to the sextet from La Esmeralda, which must be wholly confusing to an audience not told that the heroine is dancing for the man she loves at his betrothal party. It needs more stylish performance than it received on Wednesday: in past seasons Yevteyeva and Asylmuratova were wonderful because they made us believe in its drama as in its predictable steps. On this occasion it seemed merely lugubrious. The sextet from La Vivandiere is a pretty thing, a reconstruction by Pierre Lacotte from St. Leon's own notation of his 1844 triumph. (The cast sheet, as usual, provided so little information for the public as to be almost useless.) It was prettily danced by Irina Sitnikova and her companions, who merit both names on the cast list and flowers. About the novelty of the evening, an adagio act of lambent vulgarity by Oleg Vinogradov, I record that it involved Yulia Makhalina and Konstantin Zaklinsky, that the orchestra played Samuel Barber, and that Zaklinsky, who merits better, lugged and twisted Makhalina in approved Bejartian struggle-fashion. She might have been his Muse; she looked more like his luggage. All of these matters seemed more foolish since the evening had begun with the choreographic felicities of Scotch Symphony, led by the entrancing Larissa Lezhnina. We see Balanchine somewhat Kirov-ised - broader, gentler phrasing; rhythms and energies less acute than in New York - but it is Balanchine nonetheless, and most touchingly so in the work of Lezhnina and the female corps. Lezhnina's virtues (the lightness and sweetness of her manner; the rectitude of every step) are an abiding joy. So, too, her sense of the ballet's implicit homage to Romantic ballet's traditions: Taglioni's heroine is just below the surface of her tender portrayal. I wish, though, she had been given a partner more credible than Alexander Kurkov, whose optimistic performance I did not appreciate. The evening ended with the last act of The Nutcracker in Vasily Vainonen's 1934 version. It is very much of its time, and interest now lies only in the grand pas de deux with its lifts in which the ballerina is thrown between her cavaliers - a reminder of Soviet ballet's acrobatic tendencies in the 1930s. We have memorably seen Irina Kolpakova like purest crystal in this scene. On Wednesday Veronika Ivanova was radiant, showing that dignity which is the hall-mark of Kirov style. The closing moments of the Sugar-plum variation, as Ivanova rounded out the last musical phrase with an exquisite placing of her arm, made one forget every numbing moment of the divertissements. Here was noble dancing. To Ivanova, and to Lezhnina, gratitude: they told us why the Kirov is still the repository of classic style. The Kirov Ballet season continues at the Coliseum, with mixed repertory, until July 31</p>

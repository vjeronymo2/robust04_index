			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT DISPLAYS A RARE BURST OF TEMPER AT HIS 16-COUNT MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> Randy Steven Kraft, who has remained calm throughout his 9-month trial on  charges of killing 16 young men, displayed a rare burst of frustration Tuesday  during arguments over what evidence the jurors should hear about the first  victim's death.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown argued repeatedly that much of the defense's  information pointing to other potential suspects in the 1972 death of Camp  Pendleton Marine Edward Daniel Moore was irrelevant.  </P> <P> In once instance, Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald wanted jurors to know that  authorities found a portrait in Moore's locker of a Long Beach man. The defense  claims that man may have hired Marines to pose for him.  </P> <P> "So what?" Brown asked Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin outside the  presence of the jury. "Assuming all that is true . . . it doesn't have anything  to do with this case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kraft's Eyes Widened  </P> <P> Kraft's eyes widened and he spoke to McDonald in a shouted whisper audible to  the audience.  </P> <P> "So what? So what (it matters) to me," Kraft said, pointing to himself.  </P> <P> Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, has been linked by prosecutors to  a total of 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon and Long Beach. If Kraft  is found guilty of any of the 16 murder charges, the other killings could be  used by prosecutors at a penalty hearing where they sought a death verdict.  </P> <P> Kraft was arrested on May 14, 1983, after two California Highway Patrol  officers found a dead Marine, 25-year-old Terry Lee Gambrel, in the front  passenger seat of his car. The 16 charges date back to the death of Moore, who  was found on a freeway off-ramp in Seal Beach on Dec. 26, 1972. Moore, like  several of the 45 people Kraft is accused of killing, was found with a sock  inserted in a body cavity.  </P> <P> McDonald wanted to present evidence that Moore had a homosexual relationship  with another man and that prosecutors found a pile of single socks in the man's  trailer.  </P> <P> Judge McCartin, over the prosecution's objections, permitted the defense to let  jurors hear about the homosexual relationship. But the judge said the search  information was irrelevant.  </P> <P> McDonald said later: "I thought it was relevant. We've had so many socks in  this case, how could that not be relevant?"  </P> <P> Prosecutor Brown has continuosly objected to defense evidence he contends is  designed to throw the jurors off the track. For example, Brown said that the  picture of the Long Beach man found in Moore's locker was meaningless "unless  we're saying that anyone who has had sexual contact with one of the victims in  this case is prime to be brought in automatically . . . and that is just not  the case."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Can I Just Flip the Coin'  </P> <P> McDonald did not give up.  </P> <P> "Can I just flip the coin here for a moment?" he said. "What if within the  locker was a picture of Mr. Kraft? Would the prosecution be allowed to present  that to the jury?"  </P> <P> Prosecutor Brown countered, "Yes, because of other evidence linking Mr. Kraft,  which in our opinion is overwhelming." The judge agreed.  </P> <P> Although prosecutors have no physical evidence linking Kraft to Moore's death,  the entry "EDM" was found on a list in Kraft's car, in his handwriting, which  prosecutors claim is Kraft's own death list. Brown also considers the sock  strong evidence. Also, Moore was found in an area Brown claims was "Kraft's  favorite dumping ground"; he was strangled like most of the other victims in  the case and he had been re-dressed after death, as were some of the others.  </P> <P> McDonald, however, contends that the list found in Kraft's car is meaningless  and that the rest of the evidence cannot be linked to his client.  </P> <P> Although Moore is the last of the 16 victims discussed by the defense before  the jury, McDonald told the court he still has 19 witnesses and cannot  guarantee he can meet the judge's tentative timetable of completing the defense  by Easter.  </P> <P> Kraft has not testified and McDonald refused to say whether his client will  take the witness stand. But he did tell the court that he must meet with Kraft  privately to determine whether the defense will put on anyone besides the 19 he  mentioned.  </P></p>

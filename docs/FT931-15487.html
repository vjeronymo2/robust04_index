			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv pauses after an outstanding year in 1992 - More modest gains lie ahead After a breathtaking year in 1992, investors on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) may have to settle for more modest gains in 1993. But there is still some confidence in the market that the graph will continue to point upwards this year. A potent combination of strong economic growth, rising corporate profitability, low interest rates, falling inflation, liberalisation and optimism over the Middle East peace talks made the TASE an outstanding performer in 1992, outstripping markets in North America, Europe and the Far East. The general index climbed more than 74 per cent on the year, while the narrower index of the 94 most-traded stocks was up in excess of 95 per cent. Volume rocketed to Shk37bn (Dollars 14.8bn) for the year, compared to Shk19bn in 1991, and for the first time, equity market capitalisation of Shk77bn at the year-end was greater than that of the government securities market, which has traditionally dominated the TASE. All this came on top of a strongly rising trend in the previous 18 months, broken only by a dip during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. Mr Saul Bronfeld, managing director of the TASE, attributes this remarkable bull run to confidence that the economy, fuelled by mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, is in a period of real growth not seen since the early 1970s: real GNP growth for 1992 was 6.4 per cent. Confidence was enhanced, perhaps prematurely, by a spreading belief in the market, following the election of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led government in mid-year, that the Middle East peace talks, begun in late 1991, would ultimately yield the political stability that the economy has always lacked. In addition, liberalisation in the capital markets, including a relaxation of foreign exchange controls and a rise in the proportion of funds that providential funds can invest in equities, has fuelled demand in what remains a tightly held market, in spite of a flood of new issues over the past 18 months. In November and December, issues worth a total of more than Shk1bn by IBD Holding, a big investment group, and First International Bank of Israel were oversubscribed respectively 120 and 400 times. The first foreign-based funds for investing in Israeli securities were set up last year. To soak up this demand, the market is clamouring for the government to fulfil its promise to accelerate privatisation of the state's big industrial holding companies such as Israel Chemicals, Bezeq, the telecoms monopoly, the electricity utility and El Al, the national airline. 'We feel the market can absorb a lot of new issues. If things continue as they have in 1992 there is certainly big scope for privatisation issues,' says Mr Bronfeld. Some 25 per cent of Bezeq and Israel Chemicals have been sold off on the TASE and the government plans to float a 20 per cent stake in each of the country's two biggest banks, Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim, in February, raising up to Shk2bn. Mr Bronfeld says that the pace should be stepped up in case an opportunity to sell off the companies - and deepen the market - is missed. But as 1992 ended, some of the excitement had tempered. Economic growth may slow this year and the outlook for the peace talks has been clouded by the crisis over the deportation in December of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon. So far in January, the market has been steady and some analysts believe that with an average price-earnings ratio of around 20 times, a period of consolidation is now desirable. Mr Mark Meiras, managing director of Pacific Mediterranean Investments, which provides independent market analysis, foresees a solid, but calmer, year. 'I think the market can maintain something like 25 per cent growth. That is slow compared to the last 2 1/2 years; but in my opinion this market needs to take a breather,' he says.</p>

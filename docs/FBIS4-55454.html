			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman </F> Gyula Horn by Szendrei in Miskolc on 11 May: "The Country Has  To Be Put In Order"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Szendrei] Would you now  have the courage to predict the final results for the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] at the elections?    [Horn] Naturally, it is difficult to enter into such  predictions. I would very much like our individual candidates  to gain as many mandates as possible. There is a chance for the  majority to win the elections. It is no accident that they had  such good results in the first round. I continue to have faith  in the sober judgment of the voters.    [Szendrei] Do you think it possible for the MSZP to gain an  absolute majority in parliament?    [Horn] I think this is also possible. The MSZP was the  party that offered the real political change, therefore, it is  not out of the question for us to reach more than 66 percent.    [Szendrei] Does this mean that Hungary might end up with a  one-party government?    [Horn] I continue to hope for the government to have as many  political forces as possible, or for it to have their support.  This would be good for the country and for handling the very  serious heritage we are facing. We will have to begin putting  this in order immediately after the round on 29 May. The  country has to be put in order. It cannot carry on the way it  is.    [Szendrei] I will ask again: Will your party be willing to  govern on its own?    [Horn] If the voters wish, and if our support is so big that  we can undertake this on our own, then we will. We have never  yet run away from any tasks.    [Szendrei] After the first round, have you discussed a  possible coalition with the Free Democrat leaders?    [Horn] No. I know that, after my accident, the Free  Democrat leaders immediately spoke to [Deputy Chairman] Imre  Szekeres and wished me a speedy recovery through him, but  political talks did not take place between the two parties at  all. [passage omitted]    [Szendrei] In the interview you gave to the Television's  News program, you categorically refuted that you might be  supporting Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate of the  Alliance of Free Democrats] as prime ministerial candidate.  Does this mean that you will apply for the prime ministerial  position?    [Horn] As it has already been announced, the MSZP will hold  an extraordinary congress and the party's prime ministerial  candidate will be selected there.    [Szendrei] How will the MSZP begin to govern?    [Horn] First of all, it is most important to get a realistic  view of the country's situation. We have only partial  information on the past four years, we do not have a full view  of the situation. I am afraid that, when it comes to defining  the practical tasks of governing, we will find far graver  details than those we are aware of at present. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank of Montreal and Bancomer set up fund Bank of Montreal and Grupo Financiero Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest financial services group, are setting up a jointly-managed mutual fund. It will invest in US, Canadian and Mexican companies which stand to benefit from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The fund, to be known as the Nafta Advantage Fund, will be managed by the brokerage arms of Bank of Montreal, Bancomer and Harris Bankcorp of Chicago, Bank of Montreal's wholly-owned subsidiary in the US. The mutual fund will be open to investors in all three countries. To satisfy regulatory requirements, the fund will in practice comprise separate pools of assets in each country. Each pool, however, will have precisely the same mix of investments. Each of the three participants will nominate managers to select shares from their own country. The fund will be required to invest at least 20 per cent of its assets in companies based in each country. Bank of Montreal said the fund was predicated on the assumption that companies taking advantage of Nafta would generally outperform those which stick to their home market. According to Mexican figures, two-way trade between the US and Mexico surged by 17.5 per cent in the six months after Nafta came into force on January 1, compared to a year earlier. Canada-Mexico trade flows jumped by 33 per cent, albeit from a relatively low base. Trade between the US and Canada, the world's two largest trading partners, has also grown appreciably since the implementation of a bilateral free trade pact in 1989. The fund is the latest in a series of links between Canadian and Mexican financial institutions since the Nafta negotiations began three years ago. Bank of Nova Scotia purchased a minority stake in Inverlat, the Mexican financial services group, while Bancomer opened an office in Toronto earlier this year.</p>

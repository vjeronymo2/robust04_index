			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq crisis fails to revive oversupplied oil market OIL PRICES increased by some 30 cents a barrel yesterday following the news of US raids on Iraq, but the market quickly slipped back into fears about over-supply and prices dropped. North Sea Brent crude for March delivery ended unchanged at Dollars 17.10 a barrel. 'The news about Iraq made many people nervous in the market and speculators moved to cover short positions,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, market analyst at ED &amp; F. Man in New York. But he said producers were selling into the rally. New York prices were stronger than those in London in spite of production problems in the North Sea because of severe storms. March futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange were up 23 cents in mid-day trading at Dollars 18.79 a barrel. In spite of the tension in the Middle East, traders were still worried about over-production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Iraq is at present barred from exporting oil by United Nations' sanctions and action against it has no short term threat to oil supplies. Libya said yesterday it would cut 50,000 barrels a day, but traders were sceptical. Venezuelan oil officials indicated to the Reuter news agency yesterday that Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec's current president was embarking on a Middle East tour to seek a deal that would take 600,000 b/d out of the market before Opec's next meeting on February 13. Analysts believe Opec must cut at least 1m b/d if it is to lift oil prices. The International Energy Agency said it expected world oil demand to increase by 600,000 b/d in 1993, a modest rise of just 1 per cent from levels in 1992. At the same time, figures released by the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday night showed that US stocks of oil products had increased last week. Stocks of heating oil, diesel oil and jet fuel were up by 1.1m barrels and gasoline stocks had risen by 5.4m barrels.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "General </F> Affairs Council Supports Energy Charter Compromise"]    [Excerpt] The General Affairs Council has adopted  conclusions on the European Energy Charter. Announcing what  constituted in his opinion an "important element for conclusion"  of the negotiations on the Charter in June, Council President  Theodoros Pangalos, Greek deputy foreign minister, was in fact  only announcing the event a little early: The Committee of  Permanent Representatives put the finishing touches on these  conclusions at its meeting on Wednesday [18 May] and the  decision will be taken formally (without debate) at the  Transport Council on 25 May. EUROPE recalls that the European  Energy Charter was signed in The Hague on 17 December 1991. Its  purpose is to create the framework of an effective European  energy market making energy supplies secure, improving energy  yield and limiting the negative effects of energy generation on  the environment. Negotiations on the conclusion of a treaty  have been in progress since September 1991 under the  chairmanship of Dutch Ambassador Rutten in order to give the  undertakings made with regard to the Charter a sound and binding  international legal basis. Mr. Rutten presented a compromise  text on 22 April last for debate at the plenary session of the  signatory countries of the Charter scheduled for the week of 6  June. The Twelve are preparing to take a position on this  compromise in the following terms.    1. The European Union reaffirms its conviction that the  conclusion, at an early date, of a substantial European Energy  Charter Treaty is important not only for the future economic  development of the European continent, but also for political  stability in the world and the future of international relations.    2. At the initiative of the European Union, the Chairman of  the Conference on the European Energy Charter agreed to draw up  a final draft compromise of the Charter, which he presented to  the parties on 22 April 1994. The EU considers that this text  constitutes a solid basis for concluding the negotiations and  will incontestably facilitate agreement at the upcoming and  final plenary session in June 1994.    3. Nevertheless, to attain this objective, improvements must  still be made in a certain number of areas. These include  questions of trade and investments, as well as the need to  ensure that the trade provisions of the European Energy Charter  are fully compatible with the relevant provisions in the  Treaties or agreements concluded or to be concluded in this  spirit, and in particular the agreements negotiated or to be  negotiated with Central and Eastern European countries, as well  as the Republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    4. The EU will approach the final session in June with the  will to reach an agreement on a global compromise, depending on  satisfactory solutions to its fundamental concerns. It  reaffirms its commitment to signing such an agreement, along  with, it hopes, all other parties to the negotiations and is  convinced that the latter will adopt the same attitude.    5. If the June plenary session does not lead to a  satisfactory solution, the European Union will examine the best  way of proceeding. It will, however, do all it can for  negotiations to succeed and is convinced that all the other  partners in the negotiations will do the same. [passage omitted]</p>

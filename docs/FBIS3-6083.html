			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by MAINICHI SHIMBUN Economics Department reporter </F> Yoshiyuki Itsumi: "Accord on Talks on Mobile Phone Should Not Be  Overestimated"]    [Text] With the 12 March the conclusion of the Japan-U.S.  negotiations on mobile phones, views have been expressed within  the government that the Japan-U.S. agreement -- which a senior  Foreign Ministry official regards as the "first accord between  Japan and the United States since the failure of the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks at the summit talks in February -- will  serve as breakthrough in the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic  relations. However, such views are the minority opinion within  the government, and the agreement is not a guarantee that the  Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanction measures  against unfair trade partners) will not be applied to Japan.  Therefore, the majority of opinions within the government is  that "it is dangerous to have an optimistic view" (according to  a top official of Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI]).    The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have remained  deadlocked. Regardless of the outcome of the recent negotiations  on mobile phones, how the United States will assess details of  market opening measures which the Japanese Government plans to  announce late this month is the key to the resumption of the  economic framework talks. The U.S. Trade Representative [USTR]  is to pick out unfair trade partners and trade areas as the  subject of sanctions under the Super 301 provision from a list  of unfair trading nations and areas described in a annual report  on foreign trade barriers which is scheduled to be worked out by  the USTR late this month. It is most likely that dozens of  trade items -- which involve some areas of trade with Japan --  will be listed in the report as unfair trade areas.    The recent agreement has both a bright and a dark side.  Underlying the conclusion of the negotiations is how the U.S.  Motorola and the USTR steamrolled the negotiations, and it seems  that the results of the negotiations helped the United States  reaffirm its view that "Japan gives up when pressure is  applied." Now, the USTR can propagate that showing a stand of  imposing sanctions is effective when holding negotiations.    However, there is the bright side, too. This is because the  agreement can be taken as "a concrete signal" (according to a  senior official of MITI) that reflects the position of the  United States, which has said that failure in the economic  framework talks "will not lead to a trade war between Japan and  the United States" (as stated by Secretary of State  Christopher). But it seems that the current jerky Japan-U.S.  relations will remain uncorrected until the Naples summit (of  industrial nations) is held in July.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: A 'Trelawny' to warm the heart - Alastair Macaulay hails the National's production HERE IS the best revival of a Pinero play I have seen, and the first to do Pinero proud since the National staged The Magistrate some seven years back. The whole production, a triumph of ensemble acting, brings out the best in the play; and the first two acts, in particular, are among the Olivier Theatre's triumphs. Everything shows how adroitly Pinero could interweave three kinds of drama: realistic social comedy, backstage comedy, and sentimental melodrama. And the play shuttles so delicately between laughter and tenderness that tiny details may prompt laughter one moment, tears the next. The beauty of this Trelawny is not in its fun - more laughs could be milked at several points - but in its human detail. It lies in little lines like Mrs Mossop's 'I hope the affliction of short breath may be spared you, Albert' (panting gently in an armchair) and Imogen Parrott's little remembrance of 'a supper which rather - well, I'd had some strawberries sent me from Hertfordshire' (looking momentarily bilious); and Sir William Gower's quaint old pronunciations: (looking for chairs) 'Have ye no cheers here?' And it is at its most touching in the Telfers, former theatrical stars, now rather pompous but learning to deflate their stature and become yesterday's people. Pinero really creates a living world onstage - can an artist do more? - so that the Act One lunch party is as real to us in all its overlapping detail as that in Act One of The Three Sisters. Through this tapestry, Pinero threads his central stories so subtly that you never know for long how much it matters that Rose Trelawny should marry, or that Tom Wrench's comedy should be staged. Helen McCrory catches, with marvellous spontaneity, Rose's blend of outsize theatricality and well-mannered refinement; and in her second-act costume she looks ready to sit for Winterhalter. Robin Bailey makes Sir William's fustian pronunciations one of the comic masterstrokes of the evening; and those of us who have loved, since Black Snow, his genius with extraneous wordless noises are treated to a gorgeous array of disapproving whinnies and nervous mini-neighs, all in character. His finest moment comes as this old grandfather tries to remember how Kean played Richard III. 'A horse] . . . made something summer by . . .' As the Telfers, Betty Marsden and Michael Bryant give object-lessons in the old saying that there are no such things as small roles. It is perfect that Marsden's first word, 'Violent,' should evoke Edith Evans (the full trisyllabic emphasis deployed in Evans's Millamant). Bryant actually throws away some of the comic potential of Telfer's adorably stuffy toast - throws it away in favour of catching the character's faintly absurd dignity. There is something about Bryant's greatness in supporting roles that makes me tremble in awe. The cast is large, admirable, and full of detail, and John Napier has provided four different sets, each enlarging our sense of the world within; I should like to describe all of them. There are moments when Pinero's plot starts to seem too conventional (late in Act Three), and bit parts in Act Four that are acted more for staple comedy than for sincerity. But I note that Bernard Shaw found more fault with the 1898 premiere than I do with this; and that he nonetheless found that it showed Pinero at his most wise and affecting.

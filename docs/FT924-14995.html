			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Denholm Elliott - Obituary Denholm Elliott, the actor who typified the diffident Englishman, has died at the age of 70. His early career was in the theatre, with a West End debut in The Guinea Pig at the Criterion in 1946. However in the past 30 years it was cinema and television that made him so familiar. There have been times in the last decade when viewers might have thought that no single play or mini-series on the small screen, and no new British movie, was complete without a cameo performance from Elliott. He was never a star, his own over-modest comment being 'I was quite good looking and quite a good actor, I should have been a star, but perhaps it's the sex appeal I lacked.' Yet the abnormally large amount of work pressed on him in an over-populated profession proved how highly he was valued. Whether playing a back-street abortionist in Alfie or a frighteningly recognisable caricature of a repressed suburban father in Brimstone And Treacle, Elliott invariably carried conviction. Born into a family of lawyers, he was educated at Malvern, and served during the Second World War in the RAF. Shot down and held in a PoW camp, he formed a drama group and thus developed his interest in acting  - though it was a profession he never took as seriously as some. With Ralph Richardson he shared a passion for fast motorbikes, and he enjoyed playing the stock market. After the war he met Laurence Olivier in a production of Venus Observed and his career blossomed. David Lean used him in the 1949 film about jet aircraft, The Sound Barrier, and he appeared in The Cruel Sea. He gave one of his most finely judged performances in the more recent Merchant-Ivory production of Room With A View. He was married briefly to actress Virginia McKenna and then in 1962 to Susan Robinson with whom he had a son and a daughter.</p>

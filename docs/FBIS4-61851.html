			<p>BFN     [Text] In 1994, the output of grain in Russia will be no  more than 50 percent compared to last year when its net weight  was 99 million tons, the chairman of the Federation Council  committee for agrarian policy, Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, told  INTERFAX Tuesday.    This year, grain crops will cover a little more than 60  million hectares and agricultural products manufacturers could  harvest about 100 million tons "despite all our troubles."    However, farm workers failed to plough nearly one third of  arable lands last autumn. As a result, they will have to plough  up to 20 million hectares more this spring which alone will  result in a loss of 15 million tons of grain, he said.    In addition, Russia had always spread 18-19 million tons of  pesticides every year, a quarter of which was used for grain  crops. This year, farms do not have more than 10 kilograms of  pesticides per hectare. This will seriously affect the grain  output, because every million tons of pesticides results in an  additional 4-5 million tons of grain, according to expert  calculations.    Large losses - about 2-3 million tons of grain - should be  expected this year due to the poor condition of winter crops.  To make matters worse, too few winter crops were sown in  comparison with the last year. Another reason for the losses is  poor maintenance of agricultural equipment and the lack of fuel  and lubricants.    Zvolinskiy stated that taking this into account Russia could  count on only 50 million tons of grain this year. Moreover,  "the country will receive this amount only thanks to God and the  selfless labor of Russian citizens who, despite the fact that  the state has not paid for the grain it purchased from them last  year, are doing their best not to leave the land unsown this  spring," he was quoted as saying.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 6 April, the Dominican newspaper EL DIARIO  denounced the smuggling of oil products between the Dominican  Republic and Haiti, which is being done extensively, according  to the newspaper. A reporter of the daily confirmed that  transactions between Haitians and Dominicans are made daily in  homes, located not far from the border between the two  countries, where the products are stored. The trafficking of  fuel and other products affected by the international embargo is  done for the profit of the Haitian military regime, according to  the Dominican daily. The article points out that in Dajabon, a  region located 350 km northeast of Santo Domingo, a gallon of  gasoline is sold for 55 Dominican pesos, that is, $5; whereas  the regular price is 20 pesos, or $1.50.

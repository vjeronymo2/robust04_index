			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Swedish trade balance in deficit Sweden's balance of trade swung into a SKr400m (Pounds 34m) deficit in August after a July surplus of Skr9.6bn, according to preliminary figures from the Swedish statistical agency. Although the figures are distorted by summer holidays and represent a narrowing of the Skr600m deficit during the same month last year, they represent a trade performance well below the predicted Skr2.5bn surplus. The victory of the Social Democratic Party in Sunday's vote has tended to firm rather than weaken the Swedish krona as markets wait to see if SDP leader Ingvar Carlsson can establish a strong government. Unemployment in Finland fell during August to 19.1 per cent, down from 20.1 per cent a month earlier, according to the Finnish labour ministry. Switzerland's balance of payments position worsened in August. The Federal Customs reported a deficit of SFr290.2m (Pounds 143.5m), and a revised surplus of SFr315.3m for July.</p>

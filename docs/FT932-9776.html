			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pubs acquisition gives first half lift to Vaux VAUX GROUP'S acquisition of 265 pubs last year helped boost the Sunderland-based brewer's first half trading profit by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 17.3m. The pre-tax line was distorted by the switch to FRS 3 with headline figures showing a 32 per cent decline. However, excluding property disposals and exceptional profit from the sale of the Blayney's off-licence chain, pre-tax profits for the 24 weeks to March 20 rose from Pounds 9.21m to Pounds 9.66m, in line with market expectations. Earnings per share, on the same basis, rose 6.7 per cent to 5.42p. The interim dividend is held at 3.25p. Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman, said: 'This has been a far from easy period in which to make progress . . . but there have been some bright spots which give hopeful signs for the future.' The breweries and enlarged tenanted pub estate lifted profits from Pounds 7.31m to Pounds 8.43m. Total beer sales fell 1.4 per cent. Draught volumes, however, rose 8.4 per cent, with Samson, the leading brand, ahead 13.2 per cent. Cask beer volumes were nearly 25 per cent higher but sales of low-margin packaged beer fell 20 per cent. Sales of wines, spirits and soft drinks all increased. Vaux Inns, taking in the 127 managed pubs, raised profits from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.35m with income from amusement machines beginning to improve. Profits from the St Andrew's nursing homes were 19 per cent higher at Pounds 1.99m. Occupancy was close to 92 per cent - more than two percentage points above the same period last year. The group bought a 50-bed home in Co Durham last week and has two further homes under development. Swallow Hotels increased profits 8.7 per cent to Pounds 5.3m. Occupancy improved 3.4 percentage points to 56.4 per cent but achieved room rates declined 6 per cent. 'Forward bookings look rather healthier than at this time last year,' Sir Paul said. 'If the recession is over, we can expect a recovery in hotel profits, which has been the biggest problem faced by the group in this recession.' The pubs acquisition programme raised net debt from Pounds 94.6m to Pounds 125.2m, representing 30 per cent of shareholders' funds. COMMENT Signs of recovery are still weak in Vaux's northern trading area. On the beer side, market share gains are tempered by an overall decline in its beer volumes, down 2.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis, and continuing margin pressure. Pub income from food sales and amusement machines is improving, but slowly. Hotel occupancies and forward bookings are rising but customers are haggling over room rates. On full year profit forecasts of Pounds 25.5m and a p/e of 17, the shares look expensive despite a prospective yield of 4.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Confidence figures boost dollar EVIDENCE from the US that consumers grew more confident about the economy in May boosted the dollar. The US currency perked up during European trading after news that the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 71.6 in May from a revised 65.1 for April. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Bank, said: 'The consumer confidence figures were extremely good news for the dollar. The very strong pick-up suggests that consumers are getting ready to spend again.' By mid-afternoon the dollar had recovered early losses to stand at DM1.6115, from DM1.6060 just before the confidence data were released. It rallied to Y129.33 from a Y128.75 low and a Y129.25 start. But in later trading it lost ground to end at DM1.6090, nearly a pfennig down from Friday's DM1.6185 close. The dollar firmed in New York to close at DM1.6127 and Y129.50. Although the confidence data were welcome news for the dollar, analysts warned that it would not be sufficient to enable the currency to break out of its DM1.6050 to DM1.6250 range. Other US economic statistics yesterday were less encouraging - existing home sales fell by 0.3 per cent in April compared with March - and the wide interest rate differential between the dollar and the D-Mark continues to obstruct the US currency's progress. Meanwhile, sterling was unmoved by news that the UK's current account deficit almost doubled last month. The sharp deterioration in the figures for April were ignored by the foreign exchange markets, traders said. Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays, commented: 'There was absolutely no interest. Sterling held absolutely rock steady when the news came out.' There were suggestions that the pound would test its central EMS rate of DM2.95 this week. According to traders, the steadiness of the UK currency - which finished the day at DM2.9425 - stemmed partly from positive long-term prospects for sterling, notably the dwindling possibility of another base rate cut on the horizon, and partly from the fact that the big rise in imports was concentrated in areas such as capital and consumer goods which suggested a recovery in confidence. The French franc also nudged higher, improving to FFr3.3602 per D-Mark from FFr3.3620. Traders said the French currency was underpinned by a comment from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, that he would not lower interest rates except as part of a co-ordinated move with other countries. This positive sentiment was reinforced by news that France's economy grew by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.</p>

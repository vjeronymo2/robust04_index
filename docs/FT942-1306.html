			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Market turmoil puts 'King Kidder' to test - Few observers expect mortgage-backed bonds to rebound In the Dollars 1,600bn market for mortgage-backed bonds, Kidder Peabody is the undisputed king. Even after the recent turmoil, in the market and at Kidder, it remains the dominant force in the market. The question for Kidder, is whether this market, which until recent months provided the bulk of its profits, will ever rebound to 1992-93 levels. Mortgage-backed bonds, known as pass-throughs, are created by securitising pools of domestic mortgage loans. But only about half of all mortgage-backed bonds outstanding are held as plain pass-through securities. The rest have been converted into structured bonds, each with a different risk and payment profile. These structured securities are known as collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs). It is in the creation of CMOs that Kidder has made its name. It is the activity that has given rise to most speculation on Wall Street about the firm's financial health. CMOs are structured to meet the different risk appetites and cashflow needs of different customers. For example, US banks - traditionally big buyers of CMOs, though their purchases have dropped sharply - have used short-term securities to lift the yield on their large bond portfolios, while adjusting the interest-rate sensitivity in their basic banking business. Plain mortgage-backed bonds are highly liquid but the tranches of individually-tailored CMOs into which they are carved may not be - particularly when prices are falling and there are few buyers. That is what happened in recent months. In the rout in US fixed-income markets as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates this spring, mortgage-backed bonds fell faster than most. Mr Joseph Hu, an analyst at Oppenheimer, says the benchmark mortgage-backed issue, the 8 per cent Ginnie Mae bond maturing in 2008, yields about 100 basis points more than Treasuries. Last year, that spread averaged 80-85 basis points. Since these bonds are backed by the US Treasury, the premium mainly reflects a risk which is unique to mortgage-backed bonds. If borrowers opt to pay off their loans early as interest rates fall (as happened last summer) bond holders are faced with reinvesting at the new, lower market rates. On the other hand, if borrowers choose not to pre-pay the loans because interest rates are rising (the experience of this spring) then the average lives of the bonds are extended, making their yields less attractive. With a positive US yield curve - albeit not as steep as at the start of the year - bond holders demand a higher yield for holding longer-term bonds. The recent swings in the interest rate cycle has earned mortgage-backed securities the nickname 20-20 bonds. 'They could last 20 months, or 20 years,' says Mr Hu. Banks have been among the biggest sellers of CMOs. For regulatory reasons they hold mainly short-term paper, and are forced to sell as the bonds' duration grows longer. The pressure has spilled over into other fixed income markets, as managers have sold long-dated Treasuries or other liquid bonds to offset the extra duration injected into their portfolios by the changing pre-payment habits of mortgage holders. These pressures have made the mortgage-backed market one of the biggest sources of concerns among followers of the securities industry. With falling prices and less liquidity, it is no surprise that Kidder has been besieged by reports of big losses. It has suffered indirectly from the loss of liquidity that hit some parts of the CMOs market. Askin Capital Management, a specialist fund group that invested in CMOs, declared itself insolvent as the market dried up. Kidder, which traded heavily with the firm and held its bonds as collateral, faces a loss of about Dollars 20m. Kidder has denied similar problems in its portfolio. Since March, the firm had cut its holdings of CMOs to under Dollars 10bn from Dollars 16bn, Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, the firm's parent, said. This was not a fire-sale, added Mr Dennis Dammerman, the GE chief financial officer who was this week put in to run the firm. With fewer new bonds being underwritten, it was natural for Kidder's inventory levels to run down. GE and Kidder deny that Kidder has sold off its most liquid holdings first, leaving it with securities with no ready market. The firm had made sales from every part of its bond portfolio in recent weeks, said Mr Dammerman. Its holdings of bonds which have been on its books for more than six months have fallen to Dollars 430m in the past month from Dollars 600m. The valuation of its portfolio has been scrutinised by auditors KPMG, among others. Inevitably, given its position as the biggest trader in this market, Kidder has taken losses. GE put these at Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m since the end of March. This was far less than the Dollars 100m that an internal analysis last autumn had suggested it could lose in such circumstances, Mr Welch said. Such stress-testing is common among securities firms as a way of assessing their potential exposure to rapid price movements. The direction of the mortgage-backed market, and a review of Kidder's internal controls in the wake of the Joseph Jett scandal, could prove more significant for Kidder in the long term. New issue volume has dried up in recent months as demand for the bonds has fallen. Few expect a repeat of the recent bull market in bonds. Kidder is at least holding its position in the market, whatever its internal troubles. In the first three months of this year, it underwrote Dollars 26bn of bonds, or a quarter of all new bonds sold, according to figures compiled by Securities Data. This was more than double the market share of its nearest rivals. Since the end of March, it has remained in front, with a market share of 19 per cent, ahead of Salomon, with 17 per cent of the market.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Fresh setbacks for Australian budget plans THE Australian government last night suffered a further setback when two of the revenue-raising measures in its proposed budget were voted down by the Senate. The first measure to be defeated was a proposed increase in wholesale sales tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. This has been strongly denounced by both the opposition coalition and by the minority parties (the Democrats and the Green party) which hold the balance of power in the Senate. The loss of this increased tax revenue would affect the government's revenue calculations for the current tax year, but by a relatively small amount of some ADollars 70m (Pounds 30m). The Senate subsequently approved one round of wholesale sales tax increases, but then voted down a proposed second round, due to come into effect in July 1995. The second round of tax increases was rejected by the opposition and the Greens, leaving the crucial vote with the Tasmanian independent senator, Mr Brian Harradine. He finally voted against the increase. Although the outcome of the Senate voting was largely as predicted, it is still unclear where this leaves the government's finance proposals. Earlier in the day Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, had insisted that the government would implement the income tax cuts proposed in its budget only when the revenue-raising measures had been passed by the Senate. 'This is a package, and it will remain a package as far as the government is concerned,' he said. Mr Dawkins' latest affirmation of the government's determination to link revenue-raising and tax-cutting measures could mean the personal income tax reductions, due to come into effect next month, will be delayed. Should this happen, Mr Dawkins claimed, the opposition could be held responsible. There was, however, one brighter piece of news for the government yesterday. The nation's unemployment rate fell from 11.1 per cent in August to 10.9 per cent last month, according to the latest seasonally adjusted data. The Bureau of Statistics said 45,100 people found work during the month, although most of the jobs created were for part-time work, and full-time employment rose only slightly. The drop in the unemployment rate was largely in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>

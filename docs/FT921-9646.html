			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: German group close to Indonesian copper deal METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals, mining, and engineering group, is near agreement on a Dollars 500m smelter and refinery project in Indonesia in which it will combine with Japanese, US, and local partners to produce copper for the fast-growing domestic market At the same time, it is involved in negotiations about a zinc smelter in Thailand, which would cost about Dollars 300m. In this venture, which would also act as a recycling centre for metallic waste from steel plants in Asia, mainly Japan, Metallgesellschaft will work with a big Thai mining concern. No announcement on either deal has yet been made by the Frankfurt-based group, which intends to use the latest environmental technology in the planned Asian smelters. Its world-wide mining and metallurgical activities already include operations in Germany, Canada, Alaska, Papua New Guinea, Turkey, Tunisia, and Australia. Metallgesellschaft's stake in the Indonesian smelter, which will produce 150,000 tonnes of refined copper a year at Gresik near the port of Surabaya in eastern Java, will be 55 per cent. Both Nippon Mining of Japan and Freeport MacMoRan of the US will have around 20 per cent each, with the Jakarta government and Indonesian business interests sharing the rest. Industry sources said the Gresik project would eventually enable Indonesia to meet its own copper demands instead of exporting the metal in concentrate form for outside processing, mostly in Japan, and importing it back for domestic use. Financing is being arranged by an international banking consortium, including German banks. In the Thai venture, Metallgesellschaft will probably have a 49 per cent participation, with Pateng Industries owning 51 per cent. Eventual output of 80,000 tonnes of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead a year is planned. Both projects will be operated by subsidiaries of the German group: Rheinische Zinc in Indonesia and Norddeutsche Affinerie in Thailand. Lurgi, also part of Metallgesellschaft, is likely to be involved in building the smelter plants. Finnish mining and metals company, Outokumpu, has decided to shelve a plan to build a copper smelter at Sines in Portugal, reports Reuter from Helsinki. Instead, it will examine options for the longer-term development of its Harjavalta smelter in western Finland.</p>

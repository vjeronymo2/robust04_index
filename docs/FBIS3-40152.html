			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yun Yang: "Major Current Tides in China's News </F> Media"]    [Text] Under a planned economic system,  news-gathering activities tend to be carried out only on the  basis of being governed by "plans," seeking news on the basis of  being guided by the spirit. Otherwise, even reports which are  very newsworthy would have to be thrown into the trash heap.  Now, under a market economy, how is the situation?    "Recently a hinterland publication carried a report: A group  of over 20 human snakes from Fujian, carrying service passports  bought with money, traveled to the United States by air in an  attempt to immigrate into the United States; eventually they  were exposed and became illegal immigrants."    Some time ago, while presiding over a seminar here in Hong  Kong, Fang Hanqi, professor at the Journalism School of the  People's University of China and member of the academic  discipline evaluation group under the State Council, discussed  China's news-reporting industry since the 14th CPC Congress. He  pointed out that in the past it had been impossible to see in  newspapers such absurd stories as the one mentioned above.    Reporting good news but not bad news was a reporting policy  of the Chinese media in the past. No matter how big a traffic  accident or a natural or human disaster was, it would not be  reported in a timely manner by newspapers. However, such an  ossified view has now been loosened up. Recently, newspapers  inside China even reported the news of a scientific exploration  satellite's failure to return to the earth on schedule.    In the past, not only was "bad news" kept unreported, but  the  so-called "secrets" were also kept unreported. At that time the  country was closed to a great extent and the scope of secrets to  be kept was large. During the Cultural Revolution, ordinary  people in such a great country were not even allowed to know  when and where a session of the People's Congress, attended by  several thousand people, was held. A news report was released  only after the session was concluded. Activities at the session  were even more a matter of secret. Comparatively, the current  situation represents substantial changes, and embodies  journalistic values to a greater extent.  <H5>  The System of Newspaper Management Has Changed Substantially </H5>   The system of newspaper management has also undergone some  changes, and the dual-track party-government system has been  restored.    For a long time in the past, the media were all managed by  the propaganda departments of party committees. It was only in  1987 that the Press and Publication Administration, which would  regulate nonparty newspapers, was restored. The Press and  Publication Administration was in fact established (under the  name of the General Press Administration) in the early years of  the PRC. For at that time there were also some newspapers which  were public-private joint operations, some private newspapers,  and some newspapers run by foreigners. As party committees'  propaganda departments could not handle matters involving so  many newspapers, the General Press Administration under the  State Council was thus established. But, in the early 1950s,  foreign newspapers disappeared, while private newspapers as well  as newspapers which had been public-private joint operations  were all turned into public operations, which could then all be  managed by party committees' propaganda departments. As a result  the General Press Administration was abolished.    To some extent the restoration of the Press and Publication  Administration reflected the diversification of publications.    In addition, Professor Fang argued, news-gathering  activities  were also governed by plans under a planned economy. If the  superior agencies determined that there was a sector, then there  would be a corresponding office in a newspaper, which would be  exclusively engaged in reporting news about the sector. In the  past, news-seeking activities had to be carried out in the  designated sectors and in accordance with plans and the spirit.  Otherwise, even reports which were very newsworthy would be  thrown into the trash heap. This way of doing things also made  reporters lazy and stupid.    Photographs were handled in the same way. The size of a  photograph carried by a newspaper was not determined by its news  value, but by the bureaucratic rank of the person in the  photograph.  <H3>  Substantial Increases in the Number of Publications and in  Advertisement </H3>   Changes in the quantity, layout, and content of the media  are  even more obvious.    Since the 14th CPC Congress held in October last year, the  market economy within China has been getting increasingly  lively, and the news-reporting industry has also achieved  significant development, resulting in a substantial quantitative  increase in the media (see Table 1). The present period is one  of the periods in Chinese history where the news-reporting  industry is the most prosperous in terms of quantity; there are  now more publications than pre-Liberation 1946 when there were  over 1,400 publications. Furthermore, the growth in quantity is  continuing. According to estimates, next year the aggregate  circulation of publications will increase by 15 percent over  this year. Currently, the number of newspapers increases by one  every two and one-half days, the number of periodicals increases  by one every two days, and the number of publishing houses  increases by one every nine days.    Because of the large advertising demand resulting from the  development of the market economy, the volume of advertising  business of the media is also increasing substantially,  producing an average annual growth rate of over 40 percent (see  Table 2).    In order to attract more customers, the contents of  publications cannot remain so boring and undiversified as  previously, and are becoming more diversified and interesting,  with each publication showing its characteristics in a creative  way.    Before the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  the media carried few advertisements. For, after the founding  of the PRC, publications in China emulated the Soviet Union; as  PRAVDA carried no advertisements, publications in China would  carry few advertisements. During the "Cultural Revolution,"  there were mainly four categories only: advertisements about  books and periodicals, theater performance advertisements,  lost-and-found announcements, and government announcements on  land requisition and the cleaning up of graves.    As the survival of the media would depend on advertisements,  it was inevitable that the contents of a thousand newspapers  would be the same. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, in  order to avoid making mistakes, local newspapers would telephone  RENMIN RIBAO every evening "to compare the layouts" so as to  ensure their being identical.    Presently, as the media are growing quantitatively,  competition becomes inevitable. It can be confidently predicted  that such things as contents and reporting methods will also be  improved on a daily basis because of the need to attract readers  and customers.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1: The Number of Institutions in Each Category of the Media in China i-|  |n June 1993                                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Media category           |Number                   |Increase over 1978       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Newspapers               |Over 1,800               |1,000 percent            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Periodicals              |Over 7,000               |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Internal publications    |Over 2,000               |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Radio stations           |Over 500                 |500 percent              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Television stations      |614                      |1,920 percent            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cable television stations|Over 500                 |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volumes of Advertisement Business of the Media over the Years                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |unit: the renminbi                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1979                                  |Several million yuan                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1980                                  |110 million yuan                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                                  |2.5 billion yuan                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                                  |3.51 billion yuan                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                                  |5 billion yuan                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  There Is a Fever of Paid News Reporting </H5>   With the development of the market economy, the  new-reporting  industry is undergoing reform continuously; but many problems  have also emerged. In his speech, Professor Fang Hanqi also gave  a detailed briefing on the problems.    Recently a doggerel has appeared in China: "First-rate  journalists trade in stocks; second-rate journalists solicit  advertisement business; third-rate journalists write for other  publications; fourth-rate journalists attend meetings; and  fifth-rate journalists edit articles." This shows that many  journalists are devoted to their second jobs, whereas those who  are doing their primary jobs are ridiculed as fifth-rate  journalists.    In addition, the increase in paid news reporting is also  producing ever greater detrimental impact on the spirit of  journalists.    News space can be sold for "red envelopes"; what follows the  words, "a report by this newspaper," is actually an  advertisement. After reading it, readers cannot but feel  cheated. In his speech, Professor Fang cited many instances:    The "richest village," Daqiu Village, bought over a  floor-cleaning worker at the Japanese embassy with 70,000 yuan,  and arranged, through that worker, for a Japanese reporter to  visit Daqiu Village. Recently, after Daqiu Village's problem was  exposed, Daqiu Village gave a 50,000-yuan bribe to a government  functionary with a rank which was not very high, so as to be  informed of the attitude of the agency in charge of the matter  with regard to the handling of Daqiu village's problem. This  shows that Daqiu Village was willing to spend a great deal of  money on news-gathering activities, and many of the reporters  who gathered news in Daqiu Village might have also been "paid."  <H5>  Like Other Commodities News Reporting Is Sold for a Price </H5>   In another instance, when collecting evidence in the home of  an enterprise manager who had committed the crime of  profiteering, a court discovered that he had given 170,000 yuan  in bribes to more than 20 newspapers, which had then written  articles to sing his praises.    With regard to the recent Great Wall Group fraud case,  television stations, central-level newspapers, and local  newspapers all carried flattering reports during the process of  the Great Wall Group's fund gathering, thereby helping the Great  Wall Group establish credit in society. It is difficult say  whether some deals were involved here.    Some local television stations even openly list prices,  explicitly setting the standards for fees to be charged for  various news reports. For instance, a news report on the holding  of an enterprise meeting, the ordering of goods, or a product  show will cost 500 yuan, while a five-minute feature story will  cost 5,000 yuan. Even Professor Fang, who tended to speak rather  gently, denounced such conduct as: shameless "prostitution."    According to Professor Fang, work in two areas has to be  done  in order to maintain journalists' professional ethics. One is to  improve the benefits enjoyed by journalists; the other is to  formulate the Press Law, creating a code of professional conduct  for journalists.    The Press Law began to be formulated in 1980. Successively,  the Journalism Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, the Press and Publication Administration, and Hu Jiwei  of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress  (dismissed after the June 4th Incident) each produced a plan;  afterwards comparative study was also carried out. Nevertheless  the law has yet to be enacted.    In recent years legal disputes involving news reporting have  been on the rise. As there is not an effective law to define the  related matters, sometimes cases are handled in accordance with  criminal law, and more frequently cases are handled in  accordance with civil law.    The lack of effort to construct the legal system governing  the news-reporting industry is now a big problem in the  development of journalism.  <H5>  Yu Zuomin Bought a Journalism Prize With Money </H5>   The third problem is the interference of capital.    The interference of some wealthy individuals in the  news-reporting industry has adversely affected the taste of the  news-reporting industry. Professor Fang cited some examples:  Last year a nationwide contest of short news stories was held in  Daqiu Village, and the expenses for the contest were paid for  mainly by the "village chief," Yu Zuomin.    After the judging activity produced results, Yu Zuomin  argued  that a TIANJIN RIBAO report on Daqiu Village's donations for  relief efforts in disaster-stricken regions should be awarded a  prize. The judges believed that the report was of ordinary  quality, and thus hesitated to some extent. As a consequence a  very unhappy look passed over the face of Yu Zuomin who was  powerful because of his wealth: "If this news report is not  awarded a prize, this check will not be signed either." After  repeated discussions, people succumbed to the will of Yu Zuomin,  and the news report on Daqiu Village's donations was awarded the  third prize.    In addition, some newspapers have accepted investments from  collective enterprises; some newspapers sold some of their  shares; and some newspapers sold rights over advertisement or  advertisement spaces, which have then come to be controlled by  advertising agencies.    Such situations are, in fact, commonplace in capitalist  societies, but are doubtless new things in a socialist market  economy. Professor Fang, a scholar, pointed out: Because of the  interference of capital, sometimes contents are made to  accommodate the market, resulting in the carrying of stories  such as those of problems in marriages, crime-of-passion  murders, and sensational crimes in society as well as  pornographic pictures; consequently publications have become  more vulgar.    Lastly, there are the problems that the volume of  information  is still too small, that there is a tendency to intentionally  avoid negative stories, and that reporting is not timely enough.    During the effort to bid for the right to host the Olympics,  the people of Beijing felt rather good about themselves. It was  exactly because they had only seen their positive side, with  reports being mostly positive, that their sense of failure was  very profound at the time of defeat.</p>

Majdi Hifni, Egypt's ambassador to Ethiopia, chaired the  meeting because Egypt is the current OAU chairman. Ambassador  Hifni said that the ambassadors discussed aspects of the  mechanism's work in light of the resolutions passed at the  summit meeting of the central apparatus, chaired by President  Mubarak in Cairo last December.    Ambassador Hifni told a MENA correspondent in Addis Ababa  that discussions during the meeting also dealt with the  mechanism's functions and the creation of an OAU peace fund.    The Egyptian ambassador said that the conferees agreed that  a  plan should be drawn up to finance the mechanism. Such a plan,  they agreed, will be formulated by a working team from the OAU  General Secretariat and African countries, with the aim of  raising donations from companies, African institutes, and  non-government organizations.    The budget plans, Hifni added, will be submitted to the  ministerial meeting of the mechanism, which will meet in Addis  Ababa in March under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa.    The ambassadors also discussed the formulation of a general  legal framework governing the participation of OAU member  countries in peacekeeping operations in the continent. The  ambassadors discussed a report by the OAU secretary general's  special envoy to Burundi and reviewed the conflicts in Somalia,  Liberia, and Angola, Hifni noted.</p>

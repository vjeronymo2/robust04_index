			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / HK investors warm to mainland cooling: With market reforms on course, austerity measures are not being seen as a threat AS THE source of two thirds of all foreign investment in mainland China, Hong Kong is closely watching Chinese vice-premier Zhu Rongji's moves to rein in an over-heating economy. But while the colony's businesses may be toning down publicity of their mainland investments, few are toning down the projects themselves. The main concern for Hong Kong investors is not so much the state of China's economy, but the state of its reform programme. With Mr Zhu's reformist rhetoric continuing, confidence has returned and China deals are being be signed rather than cancelled. Mr Edward Cheng, director of Wharf Holdings - a company with a number of significant China investments - admits that the austerity measures will take their toll on Hong Kong businessmen. 'But,' he argues, 'those who will be affected are the short-term speculators. For the long-term investors the slow-down will create genuine opportunities.' According to Credit Lyonnais Securities, Hong Kong listed companies have 'committed' to China investments worth a total of HKDollars 86bn (Pounds 7.4bn), primarily in infrastructure, property, manufacturing, leisure and retailing. The retailers and property developers would be the obvious casualties of a collapse in the yuan, the Chinese currency, and of an austerity programme which focuses on eradicating property and stock speculation. But few appear particularly apprehensive. Mr Anthony Nightingale, managing director of Jardine International Motors, whose associate company owns the Mercedes franchise for southern China, confidently predicted that sales would 'more than double' this year. The company sells mainly top range models to Chinese joint venture companies, at HKDollars 500,000 before tax. The Mercedes has become the ultimate status symbol for southern China's born-again capitalists, many of them the speculators or corrupt officials Mr Zhu wants to bring under control. So far the evidence is not of an excess of austerity. Mr Dickson Poon, who recently set out to bring his range of luxury brand names to the Chinese, said his strategy had remained unchanged. His company, Dickson Concepts, is investing HKDollars 400m in setting up both stores and a manufacturing capability in China. 'Since our opening (in May) we have experienced extremely stable sales. There has been no negative impact on the sales side since the announcement of the austerity programme,' he said. By March 1993 Dickson Concepts will have opened 30 fashion boutiques, two fashion stores, and 10 luxury watch outlets in China, selling a wide range of brand name products, from Charles Jourdan to Rolex. However, 90 per cent of these products will be manufactured in China, which reduces both costs and currency risk. Mr Poon said he was convinced the long-term investors would reap significant rewards. Retailers focusing on imported goods have been harder hit because of escalating costs and the impact of currency depreciation. But as one merchant banker commented: 'Retailers were paying a fraction of the labour and land costs of Hong Kong, but charging double the prices for the product. It could never last.' Nor, it seems, could the spiralling in southern Chinese property prices, which was chiefly the result of mainland and Hong Kong speculators, rather than any build-up in demand. The austerity plan focuses on rechannelling existing financial resources from property speculation back into more productive activities. A recent study by property consultancy CY Leung indicates that this has already taken its toll, with residential property prices falling 29 per cent this year in Hong Kong's border city of Shenzhen. For the smaller players the austerity programme could be a chastening experience. Mr William Cheng, managing director of listed property developer Shun Ho Construction, said: 'From an investor's point of view, we are currently faced with an artificially propped up currency and a situation where the rules could all have changed by next year. Investors are going to wait.' The more substantial property developers, however, have always played a long-term game. Mr Peter Churchouse, research director at Morgan Stanley, said: 'What the big developers have been saying is, let's get a foot in the door and see how this market works. These companies have played the game very well, tactically.' Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok has pulled out of a HKDollars 3bn commercial development in Beijing and New World Development cancelled an investment in the re-development of a Beijing department store. However, both withdrawals resulted from disagreements with the joint venture partners rather than concerns over the state of the market; other Hong Kong companies are considering the two projects. The larger Hong Kong investors have concentrated on building up cheap supplies of land in core areas within the main cities, and their initial financial commitment remains small. The other primary focus has been basic infrastructural projects, such as power stations, roads and ports, where the costs are higher, but the demand is irrefutable. A Baring Securities report on 59 of the largest listed companies in Hong Kong calculated that an average of only 2 per cent of their total assets were in China and only 3 per cent of pre-tax profit was derived from there. A more salient concern for most investors is the knock-on effects of the austerity programme on assets within Hong Kong. There could be a significant impact on the colony's role as a service centre for China's trade and manufacturing, combined with the effects of an outflow of Chinese capital - as much as HKDollars 50bn is estimated to have flowed into Hong Kong's property market during the past 18 months. If Mr Zhu achieves his soft landing for the mainland economy, Hong Kong's pioneering China investors should flourish. But if he fails, they will not be alone in facing the consequences.</p>

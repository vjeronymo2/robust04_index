			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUE GRAFTON  </P> <P> I enjoyed Ellen Hawkes' article on Sue Grafton ("G Is for Grafton," Feb. 18).  </P> <P> I thought Grafton's (Millhone's) comment about devout Christians was a gross  generalization. Of course, anyone can make generalizations. Here's one I like:  Being with Sue Grafton is like being with a silly, willful child.  </P> <P> ED SCHAEFER, Tustin  </P></p>

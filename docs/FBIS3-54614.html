As for Little Rock Bill Clinton, who did  make it to the finals last year, defeating Texan representative  George Bush, his true test is still ahead of him -- at the next  finals in three years.    This week Clinton marked the beginning of his second year in  White House. While he did pass first grade, his graduation to  second grade is accompanied by the feeling that he has not yet  fully adjusted to his new school. In his annual State of the  Union address yesterday, Clinton presented America's current  priorities: less foreign affairs, less defense, more employment,  more health insurance, and above all, more action against crime,  which is destroying the Americans from within. The punch line,  which got Clinton the most applause, borrowed its terminology  from another sports arena: baseball. Like a pitcher whose ball  veers from its destination, a third-time violent offender will  find himself out or, in this case, inside.    Clinton's address touched on the Middle East in passing: The  Rabin-'Arafat handshake on his lawn was mentioned and received  in total silence at Congress, where his secretaries, officers,  and justices were also sitting. Yet Clinton emphasized his  commitment to the attainment of "comprehensive and durable"  peace in the region. His intent -- territories for peace --  cannot be seriously doubted, although he did not bother to spell  it out. This does not contradict the departure from tradition  which Prime Minister Rabin detected this week in the stand of  President al-Asad, who agrees to a bilateral peace that does not  depend on the attainment of other agreements. It is a fact that  King Husayn and Rafiq al-Hariri are waiting for al-Asad, and not  vice versa, while 'Arafat is the last man in the world al-Asad  would trust with a veto right over Syria's moves.    In his speech, Clinton maintained that there is no  isolationism in America. This assertion in itself must be  proven. The Americans have stayed away from involvement in  Bosnia -- a position which they feel is justified and which the  President, who dodged the Vietnam draft, can understand. They  temporarily blundered in Somalia, but were quick to announce a  date of disengagement and to behead the secretary of defense who  was -- unjustly -- perceived as responsible for some of the  casualties in there. All these, as well as the tendency to  reduce the U.S. naval and ground troops in Europe and Asia, can  offer no encouragement to Washington's friends. For the time  being, they can be comforted by the defense aid which refuses to  die -- $3 billion a year, in Israel's case -- and to wait for  the future report cards of student Clinton, who lacks the  qualities that would make him Super Bill in the eyes of  Americans and foreigners.</p>

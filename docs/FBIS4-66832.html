			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Algeria on Hold"] </F>   [Text] The murder of two French religious and the fiasco of  the demonstration for national "reconciliation" in Algiers on  Sunday 8 March were a reminder of the fragility of the calm  being experienced by that country in recent weeks. The calm  atmosphere had led a good many people to return to an almost  ordinary life--a life of strolling about and going to the beach.    If there was detente, it was bought at a high price,  considering that the Army, which for a time had seemingly  abandoned the field to armed Islamist groups, resumed its  offensive in fundamentalist bastions both in the eastern and the  western part of the country. It did not spare the  means--including napalm, among other things--in its attempt to  get the better of its opponents at the risk of harming the  innocent.    The armed Islamist groups were probably hit hard, but  despite  that, they are not ready to let go. They are more convinced than  ever that victory is to be found at the end of a gun and that  nothing can be won around the green baize of a conference table.  Their fierce resistance promotes the goals of the "politicians"  in the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), especially its leaders,  Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, who can thus raise the stakes in  their fight against the government, which is striving to draw  them into the institutional game.    By refusing to participate in the march for reconciliation,  the "party of God" won a victory by default. By murdering two  Catholic religious, the most radical of the Islamists tried to  go even further and show anyone who might tend to forget it that  time does not dull their combativeness and that it will  eventually work in their favor.    In assuming the office of president, General Lamine Zeroual  gave the impression that he wanted to find a political solution  to the crisis being experienced by the country rather than  relying on the law-and-order approach. He went about it by  surrounding himself with men who were not hostile to that view  of things and by initiating discreet dialogue with the Islamist  leaders. It must be admitted that for the moment, he has gotten  nothing in return.    The government is being forced to have two irons in the  fire.  It must simultaneously engage in warfare with the armed groups  and hold talks with the Islamist leaders in the visiting room at  Blida Prison, while at the same time not burning its bridges  with the traditional political forces, be they "reconcilers" or  "eradicators"--advocates of strong-arm tactics--who are always  ready to draw it into their own camp. And, above all, without  endangering the unity of the Armed Forces, which are the  cornerstone of any solution.    Algeria therefore seems to be taking its troubles patiently  and adjusting as best it can to an instability that is difficult  to overcome and a "war" that no camp seems capable of winning.  Except by putting the country to fire and the sword.</p>

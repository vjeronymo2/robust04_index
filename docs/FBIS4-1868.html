			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese legislator  Qiao Shi met Cyrus Vance, former U.S. secretary of state, this  afternoon in the Great Hall of the People.    In the meeting Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of  the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), said that the NPC  plays a major role in the country's legislation.    China is accelerating its pace of legislation and the NPC is  playing an important role in this regard, Qiao said. The NPC is  focusing on economic legislation, which he said is necessary for  the building and development of a socialist market economy.    Vance said he had taken note of the NPC's efforts in  building  China's legal system, and the United States can benefit from  China's experience in this regard.    Qiao extended a welcome to Vance on his current visit to  China and expressed appreciation for the efforts Vance made for  the establishment and development of Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties  while serving as state secretary in the Carter administration.    Qiao said that China and the United States should strengthen  their cooperation and maintain a sound relationship which would  not only be in line with the fundamental interests and common  desire of both peoples but also be beneficial to the peace,  stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the  world as a whole.</p>

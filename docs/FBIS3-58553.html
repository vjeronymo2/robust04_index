Sikorsky and  Cobra helicopters are participating in the operations when the  weather permits. The bodies of 28 terrorists were found during  searches conducted following the clashes between the security  forces and the terrorists in the Korugan-Kislagi region on  Thursday [13 January].    Furthermore, it has been determined that at least 20 of the  some 100 terrorists who were under fire yesterday night have  been killed, and many have been injured. Based on the blood and  other evidence, it has also been determined that many injured  were taken to other regions of the mountain.    A terrorist shelter was discovered during an intense  operation in the northern peaks of Agri Mountain. Various  equipment, a generator, a television, a video machine, a camera,  lighting and medical equipment, and tonnes of foodstuffs were  found in the shelter, which has two separate entrances. It was,  however, impossible to film due to the heavy fog around the  mountain. Operations are continuing in the region.</p>

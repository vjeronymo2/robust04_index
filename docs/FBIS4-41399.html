			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Smirnov, director of the Moscow </F> research center for human rights, by correspondent Dmitriy  Orlov; date and place of interview not stated: "Demand that  Official `Play by the Rules'"]    [Text] The Moscow research center for human rights is an  association of independent human rights organizations (the  Moscow group for promoting the fulfillment of the Helsinki  agreements, the "movement without frontiers" group, the public  center for promoting the reform of criminal law, the committee  of soldiers' mothers, the independent psychiatric association,  the society for the protection of convicted economic leaders and  for economic freedoms, and others). The center's public council  includes Ye. Bonner, B. Zolotukhin, S. Kovalev, and A.  Pristavkin. The problems which exist today in the field of the  protection of human rights are described by Aleksey Smirnov, the  center's director, in a talk with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  correspondent Dmitriy Orlov.    [Orlov] Aleksey Olegovich, what in your view is above all  preventing the assertion in Russia of international norms for  the protection of human rights?    [Smirnov] Primarily the fact that in the law enforcement  organs and structures of power there are still people working  who have not borne any responsibility for law violations and  crimes committed in the past. "That is what it was like then"  is a typical empty refrain of the workers of the former KGB. A  mass of evidence of crimes by the authorities has been  accumulated. I believe that a decision should be made to repeal  the statute of limitations with regard to the communist regime's  crimes against the individual. Can we speak of law today if  past crimes are unpunished?    [Orlov] Does that mean you are in favor of opening and  inspecting correspondence?    [Smirnov] Yes, if this is understood not as sweeping  dismissals of state employees but as a careful study of each  specific case, exclusively, of course, within the framework of  existing legal procedure.    Proving crimes committed in the past and even initiating  criminal proceedings is hard work.    Today there is not a single precedent for punishing KGB  staffers. Yet the KGB tortured Sakharov before my very eyes!  Many people died in the camps. Where are the culprits? Still  in power? Still deciding our lives? I shall cite a personal  example. The investigator who was in charge of my case during  the years of stagnation has falsified the interrogation records.  I can prove this because I kept parallel records and recorded  violations of the law. What were violated were not the USSR's  international commitments but the criminal procedure norms in  operation at the time -- at the time! How did the Moscow  prosecutor's office reply to me? There are few investigators  and many difficulties and the worker in charge of your case  resigned, and it was a long time ago....    [Orlov] Can you note instances of the most flagrant  violations of human rights in Russia relatively recently?    [Smirnov] Of course. The most graphic of them is the regime  introduced by the Moscow City Hall for registering incomers. I  like Mayor Luzhkov as a person: He is a practical person who  does not stop to think and makes decisions swiftly. But the  decision on administrative banishment.... It is clear how it  could be carried out (and is now being carried out): According  to the principle that you can't make an omelet without breaking  eggs. In my view when applying preventive measures of this kind  in the struggle against crime, powerful mechanisms must be  created for monitoring the militia's actions. And unless the  Moscow City Hall does this, our center will receive complaints  of violations of human rights in this field and render legal aid  to victims, including by dispatching materials to the  prosecutor's office and court. I nonetheless hope that in the  very near future Mayor Luzhkov will create organs for monitoring  the actions of the Moscow law enforcement organs within the  framework of the registration regime.    [Orlov] How effective is your center's activity? Can you  help many people?    [Smirnov] In one day the organizations belonging to the  center receive up to 100 people. In simplified terms 50 of them  are simply people who do not properly understand what is  happening, 25 percent are not in the right place (as a rule they  are interested in socioeconomic problems), and only with regard  to the remaining quarter do we take any actions. We manage to  help nearly half of these.    In general we are obliged to work constantly in practical  human rights activity. There is virtually no time left for  lobbying in the organs of executive power, educational projects,  or legislative initiatives on human rights issues. Yet  essentially the system of "giving charity to every poor person"  is not effective -- we must create conditions such that he does  not have to ask for it.    [Orlov] A specific question. Recently the organs of state  power and the mass media and in particular our publication have  been receiving requests to expand the system of benefits for  those repressed under the bolshevik regime. What is your  attitude toward such appeals?    [Smirnov] We often get them too. It seems to me that  increasing monetary grants and giving food and so forth on the  basis of lists is not very fair to other citizens of the  country, to taxpayers! No monetary compensations! We must not  "give" or "take." For former political prisoners it would be  far more useful to be relieved of taxes and municipal charges.    [Orlov] What general recommendations could you give to those  citizens who do not want to become victims of the violation of  their rights?    [Smirnov] The main thing is to know the law and the  procedures for protecting your own rights. You must appeal to  legal advice bureaus. You must learn to work with the  authorities, not to set yourself against a particular zealous  official but to demand toughly that he "play by the rules."    Systematic violations of human rights today come not "from  above," as in 1970-1980, but "from below," from the local  authorities. We can and must fight that.</p>

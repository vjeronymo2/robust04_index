			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT;  </P> <P> FAA AWARDS $950,000 TO IMPROVE SECURITY  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded the county $950,000 to pay for  security improvements at John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> The grant will be used for radio communications, card reader and video  surveillance systems.  </P> <P> "They were persuaded by the county's need," Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport  Beach) said Thursday. "This will spare the expense to county residents."  </P> <P> Cox is one of two Republicans who sit on the House subcommittee on government  activities and transportation, which will begin hearings Sept. 25 on aviation  security in response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,  Scotland, in December, 1988.  </P> <P> "Generally we are updating airline security across the country," Cox said.  </P> <P> The county will also receive $3.25 million this fiscal year to pay for airport  improvements including roadways, taxiways, and aircraft rescue and firefighting  vehicles. That money is part of $10 million budgeted for the airport through  1992, but will be delivered earlier than expected.  </P></p>

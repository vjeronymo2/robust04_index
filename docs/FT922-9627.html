			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Recovery in US uneven THE US economy is picking up but the recovery is uneven, the Federal Reserve said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions by the Fed's 12 district banks gave a guarded assessment of the economy. The report said manufacturing had picked up in most parts of the country, along with home construction, although the rate of building appeared to have slowed. Many districts had reported gains in retail sales and more optimism among retailers about future sales. Loan demand was beginning to increase, but it remained uneven. Most banks across the country reported an increase in mortgage originations and a slowdown in refinancings. Demand for non-mortgage loans was soft. On inflation, the report said producer and consumer prices were generally stable.</p>

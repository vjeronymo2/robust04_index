			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALMAHURST FARM, HORSE RACING LEADER, PLACED ON MARKET  </P> <P> Almahurst Farm, which produced 1918 Kentucky Derby winner Exterminator and  numerous harness racing champions, has been put on the market for $16 million.  </P> <P> The 884-acre farm, five miles south of Lexington in Jessamine County, is owned  by P. J. Baugh.  </P> <P> He cited his health, estate planning and a decline in the standardbred industry  as the reasons for selling the historic farm.  </P> <P> "I guess it's the toughest decision I ever had to make in my life," said Baugh,  58, who bought Almahurst in 1963 and developed it into one of the industry's  leading farms.  </P> <P> "We put our heart and soul and assets in it."  </P> <P> Baugh said a heart attack he had in October and his children's lack of interest  in running the farm made him reconsider whether he should keep it.  </P> <P> He began cutting back last year, selling mares owned in partnership and moving  Almahurst stallions to New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast.  </P> <P> The farm, which will be offered worldwide by Ledbetter and Stewart Ltd., has  barns for stallions, mares and yearlings, seven houses, an original log cabin,  offices and a maintenance shop.  </P></p>

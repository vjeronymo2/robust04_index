			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Design Revealed" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Prime  Minister, Tsutomu Hata, recently told the Budget Committee of  the House of Councillors and the press group that Japan "has the  capacity to possess nuclear weapons."    In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks fully  revealed Japan's policy of nuclear armament which has reached  the danger line.    The analyst says:    The Japanese reactionaries have accelerated nuclear arms  development in secrecy, concealing a large quantity of plutonium  under the cloak of "three non-nuclear principles." As Hata  admitted, Japan has made all preparations and has now the  capacity to massproduce nuclear weapons any time it wants. The  nuclear armament of Japan is a matter of time.    Japan intends to become a nuclear power and give vent to its  bitter grievances for its past defeat, behaving like a big  power, and revive its old empire. Now the Japanese ruling  circles are claiming that the use of nuclear weapons is not  contrary to the international law, thus revealing their  intention to produce nuclear weapons and use them in overseas  aggression. Their alleged "maintenance of the three non-nuclear  principles" and "efforts for nuclear non-proliferation" are  nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the nuclear armament of  Japan.    Japan is the only A-bomb victim in the world. For such a  country to seek nuclear armament, forgetful of the lesson, is a  foolish act inviting a nuclear holocaust.</p>

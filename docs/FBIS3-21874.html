Political reaction to a proposal  letting drug addicts escape punishment if they agree to undergo  treatment is positive.    A broad political majority in the Folketing supports the  Progressive Party's proposal to let drug addicts escape a prison  term by undergoing treatment to recover from their addiction.    This can be seen from a poll conducted by BERLINGSKE  TIDENDE.    "It is completely insane to put these young people behind  bars. They will not be rehabilitated that way," says the vice  chairman of the Judicial Committee, Ebba Strange (SF [Socialist  People's Party]):    "The criminal code provides for the possibility to sentence  people to undergo treatment. This opportunity should be used  somewhat more, and more treatment centers should be provided."    The Progress Party's proposal is aimed at drug users who  commit crimes related to their drug abuse.    This proposal was submitted a short time after the proposal  from the Conservatives concerning, among other things, life  terms for financial kingpins in the drug world.  <H5>  Liberal Party Agrees </H5>   "We agree in fact with both proposals, to say it in a  radical  way," Birthe Ronn Hornbech, the Progressive Party's legal  spokesperson, says:    "The financial kingpins should be hunted down, [while at the  same time] the addicts must be helped. Just punishing the  addicts does not accomplish this, so let us try sentencing  addicts to undergoing treatment. We already have a corresponding  arrangement for drunk drivers. But there must be a relationship  to the crimes they have committed."    Viggo Fischer, the Conservatives' spokesperson in narcotics  matters, is not enthusiastic about the proposal, but is willing  to discuss treatment in lieu of punishment in cases of low-level  crime and first offenders.    "But this must be under the condition that the addicts  continue with their treatment -- by force if necessary. Our goal  is to have treatment take place in drug-free prison wards,"  Fischer says.    As mentioned in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE yesterday, the Progress  Party also proposes that the treatment of drug abusers be  financed by the national government rather than the present  arrangement where it is being paid for by the counties and the  municipalities, and that an independent council be created to  furnish information about drugs and drug abuse.  <H5>  Positive Initiative </H5>   "The Progress Party has presented a surprisingly positive  initiative," says Frank Jensen, the political spokesman for the  Social Democratic Party, who is especially happy about the idea  of providing treatment rather than punishment and the proposal  about government financing.    The political parties disagree as to the need for government  financing, and both the Liberal Party and the Conservatives  reject the need for an independent drug council.  <H5>  Drug Addict: Everyone Will Accept </H5>   A drug-addicted prostitute from Vesterbro in Copenhagen says  that all the addicts she knows will accept an offer to avoid  prison by accepting drug treatment.    "Yes, definitely. Everyone I know will accept. For sure."    The 29-year-old addicted prostitute who used the name  "Maria"  has no doubt.    If she was offered treatment so she could overcome her  addiction and thereby avoid prison when she had stolen money,  credit cards, or checks from her customers, she would accept.    "Maria" approves of the proposal from the Progress Party to  the help drug addicts who commit crimes arising from their abuse.    "They should be offered treatment instead of prison.''    ``All addicts would like to be helped, but treatment that  lasts only four months does not have much effect.''    ``And there is not sufficient capacity to treat everybody.''    "It does not do any good when nobody is there to take care  of  you when you sit there crying, having a hell of a time, and are  ready to quit," "Maria" says.    We met "Maria" at Halmtorvet, and over a Jolly Cola at  Freddy's Bar she tells us that she has been an addict since she  was 11 years old.    "Cocaine and heroin. I spend 1,800 kroner a day on drugs. I  walk the streets to make the money, and I have been convicted of  having stolen cash, checks, and credit cards from my customers,"  "Maria" says.    Her face is sunken and pale, she has lost several teeth,  "they were knocked out" and her neck and hands bear signs of  drug abuse over many years. She is dressed completely in black,  boots, pants, shirt, coat.    She tells us that she has been in prison four times--every  time because of drugs. She was off drugs for four years when she  lived at Jutland, but as soon as she returned to Vesterbro, she  went back to the needle.  <H5>  Treatment Opportunity Unused </H5>   Drug treatment: A catastrophic lack of treatment centers is  the reason why so many addicts end up in jail rather than in  treatment centers, according to a physician.    Even now the criminal code offers the possibility of  sentencing drug addicts to treatment rather than incarceration,  but this possibility is mostly unused.    "It is relatively rare that someone is sentenced to  treatment  because there is a lack of treatment centers and because it is  expensive," says Peter Ege, the director of medicine of  Copenhagen county.    "Maybe it happens 20 times a year that someone is sentenced  to treatment. This must be seen in relation to the fact that  there are about 1,100 drug addicts in prison," he says.    Ege's remarks come in response to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's  comments yesterday on four proposals that the Progress Party  will submit next week.    These proposals are to the effect that drug addicts who  commit crimes stemming from their drug abuse shall be offered  treatment instead of incarceration; that the treatment shall be  financed by the national government instead of by the counties  as it is at present; that a council for information about drug  abuse be created, and that a treatment model like the one in  Rome, where 85 out of 100 people go through a drug treatment  plan, be adapted for Danish conditions.    "It would be wonderful if treatment could be government  financed, because it is not reasonable that Copenhagen County  should pay for the treatment of all the addicts in the country,"  Ege says, while still being somewhat doubtful that it is  economically and politically realistic to expect the proposal to  be carried out.    There is capacity to treat about 2,000 addicts while there  are at least 10,000 addicts.    Ege realizes that the capacity for treatment must reach  3,000-4,000 to meet the need. There is especially a need for  24-hour care centers, he says.    Director Jorgen Green, the head of Storstroms County Youth  Center in Vordingborg, says that the Progress Party's proposal  will remedy the problems created by the funding [mechanism] of  the drug measures. The efforts to furnish treatment have been  made without any oversight by the government, and they have  suffered from the counties' and municipalities' budgetary  cutbacks with the result that drug abusers ended up in jail  instead. By letting money for treatment and prison  administration come from the same source, the treasury,  solutions based on economic considerations can be avoided when  it comes to choosing between treatment and prison, Green opines.    "An increase in the number of drug related deaths cannot be  seen as a result of the efforts of the police or as a rise in  drug abuse, but must be regarded first and foremost as a sign of  both poor quantity and quality in drug treatment and a lack of  concerted action against drug abuse in Denmark," Green says.    Both he and Ege approve on the whole of the Progress Party's  four proposals, and they agree that in the long run they will  lead to large savings for, among other things, the judicial  system, because successfully treating drug addicts will lead to  less crime; crime that the addicts commit in order to get money  for drugs.</p>

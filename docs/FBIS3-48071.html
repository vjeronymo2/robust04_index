			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This afternoon His Excellency [H.E.] Ing Kiet, state  minister and minister of public works and transport; and H.E. Pu  Sothirak, minister of industry, mines, and energy, together  received H.E. Wolfgang Schallenberg, Austrian deputy foreign  minister. The talks concerned the plan to repair the Kirirom  hydropower network.    H.E. Austrian Deputy Foreign Minister said that a plan to  restore the Kirirom hydropower network, worth about $11 million,  will be signed between Austria and Cambodia in the near future.  Austria will dispatch technicians to carry out this plan. The  Kirirom hydropwer station was built in 1965 by the former  Yugoslavia and was operational in 1968. This station provided  up to 10,000 kilowatts of power during the rainy season and  about 5,000 kilowatt in the dry season. Many parts, however,  have been damaged since 1970 when the hydropower station was  abandoned.    Austria and Sweden have been authorized by the Royal  Government of Cambodia to study the plan to restore this  hydropower network. Austria plans to provide about $11 million  for the project and another $46,000 for protection and mine  clearing in the Kirirom area.</p>

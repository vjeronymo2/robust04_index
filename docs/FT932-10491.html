			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Lloyd's hopes scheme will settle Names row HOPES OF reaching a negotiated settlement to the legal problems dogging the Lloyd's of London insurance market rose yesterday following the publication of a report prepared by a special market committee. The committee's chairman, Mr Neil Shaw, who leads a group of Names - the individuals whose capital backs underwriting - said he was confident that the proposal to establish a new Lloyd's company to negotiate legal actions on behalf of Names was 'a runner'. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, who appointed the committee, said there were problems with the proposals but negotiations would continue. Several thousand Lloyd's Names have either taken action or are planning action against the agents who handle their affairs to recover over billions of pounds of insurance losses. Lloyd's is keen to reach a negotiated settlement to the litigation in order to make the market more attractive to new investors. Mr Shaw's committee has been examining the possibilities of a deal between Names and the errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurers, which cover agents against legal awards. E&amp;O funds available for a settlement of actions by four groups of the biggest groups of lossmaking Names amount to between Pounds 690m and Pounds 940m, compared to estimated claims of Pounds 1.8bn, the report says. The report proposes that a new Lloyd's company - Recovery - should be created to take over the legal rights of Names and seek to negotiate a deal or arbitrate a settlement with the E&amp;O insurers. Alternatively it would conduct legal action on Names' behalf. Names would be offered credits by Lloyd's to take part in the scheme. Mr Middleton warned yesterday that it was 'less than a simple matter' but said 'at least we have something to work on. We are seeing whether we can find a framework. I am reasonably confident we will be able to establish an acceptable process.' The scheme's biggest flaw surrounds the possible failure of arbitration or negotiation efforts, he added. 'If we go to litigation we would find ourselves taking legal action on behalf of one group of Names (those taking the legal action) against another group (those who are members of the syndicates offering E&amp;O cover),' he said. Mr Shaw, who also chairs the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents several thousand Names, said: 'The proposal may not satisfy everybody but Lloyd's will end up with a route forward.' Mr Middleton said he had devoted most of the past week to the issue and had had a 'useful' meeting with E&amp;O insurers on Tuesday. He was expecting to meet the leaders of Names' Action groups, which are co-ordinating legal actions, on May 17. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said last week that Lloyd's might be prepared to contribute a 'modest' additional sum to make a settlement possible. Limited liability plan, Page 10</p>

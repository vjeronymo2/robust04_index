			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Airtours It would be tempting to argue that Airtours deserves a premium rating. The tour operator boasts an impressive trading history, with its chairman, Mr David Crossland, showing a commendable obsession with delivering on seemingly extravagant promises. There still seems plenty of growth to go for in the travel business, with Airtours' latest expansion into Scandinavia holding out promise. Moreover, Airtours has been among the best-performing stocks of recent times; its market value has leapt from Pounds 18m to Pounds 555m in less than four years. Yet, by themselves, Airtours' interim results do little to bolster the case for such a rerating. The inherent seasonality of the travel business and the flurry of recent acquisitions complicate the task of making any meaningful assessment of the company's financial health at the halfway stage. Everything must be taken on trust. Even then, it must always be doubted whether the earnings stream produced by a tour operator should be rated as highly as those on offer elsewhere. Airtours may have done a good job in countering the inherent volatility of the holiday business. It is also persuasive in suggesting that the perennial fears of price wars are much overdone. But that cannot be guaranteed with Owners Abroad remaining an industry wild card. The last resort of a struggling holiday company is price.</p>

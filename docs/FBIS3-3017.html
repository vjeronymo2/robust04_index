In 1993, courts throughout the  country continued to adhere to the principle of "grasping two  links at the same time" in severely cracking down on serious  criminal offenses.    In the report, he said: In 1993, courts accepted 403,267  criminal cases of the first instance, of which trial was  concluded on 403,177 cases. Courts gave verdicts to and  enforced the law on 451,920 criminals. Of these, 173,879 were  sentenced to prison terms of five years or more, life  imprisonment, or death (including death sentences with a  two-year reprieve), accounting for 38.48 percent of the total,  or up 3.86 percentage points from the previous year.    In 1993, courts throughout the country deepened the struggle  to deal severely with economic crimes. They accepted 27,463  economic criminal cases of the first instance, of which trial  was concluded on 27,323 cases. Of these, 15,204 cases were  tried and 16,143 cases were concluded from August to December,  73.62 percent and 102.13 percent respectively more than the  monthly average of the first seven months of the year. Except  for cases pending on appeal, withdrawn by procuratorates, or  returned to procuratorates for further investigation, courts  gave verdicts to and enforced the law on 22,106 criminals. Of  these, 6,863 were sentenced to prison terms of five years or  more, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence with  a two-year reprieve), accounting for 31.05 percent of the total,  up 7.17 percentage points from the previous year.    Last year, courts concluded trial of 7,872 cases involving  10,000 yuan or more, representing 54.75 percent of the total  number of economic criminal cases and up 10.66 percentage points  from 1992. Of this, 443 cases involved 300,000 yuan or more.  Among the convicted were 69 county- or section-level and seven  department- or bureau-level officials.    Ren Jianxin said: By punishing criminal offenders according  to the law, the people's courts played an important role in  strengthening comprehensive management of public order,  safeguarding social stability, and ensuring the smooth progress  of reform, opening up, and economic construction.</p>

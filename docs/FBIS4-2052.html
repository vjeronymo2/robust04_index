			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report by Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin </F> Municipality, delivered at the municipal economic work  conference on 17 January: "Uplift Spirit, Work With All-Out  Efforts, and Create a New Situation in Accelerating Development"]    [Text] This economic work conference is a very important  conference, whose major tasks are, in accordance to the  guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, to implement the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee and the national economic work conference and,  based on the requirements put forward at the second (enlarged)  plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, to make  overall arrangements for Tianjin's economic work for 1994.    Following the enlarged session of the municipal party  committee, people throughout the municipality have  conscientiously studied and thoroughly implemented its  guidelines, taken quick actions, exerted earnest efforts, and  created a good momentum. A good beginning has been achieved in  the work of all fields. I will now speak on 10 opinions on  economic work.    1. Seize Favorable Opportunities To Further Accelerate  Development    The 1990's constitutes a very important historical period  for  Tianjin's economic and social development. Seizing the  opportunity to accelerate development is our task of prime  importance and also the common desire of the people across the  municipality. Based on the general demand put forward at last  year's municipal party congress and people's congress and to  meet the needs of the development of the situation, we have put  forward clear targets to quadruple Tianjin's GNP three years  ahead of schedule in 1997; to complete the renovation of  dilapidated houses in large areas of the city proper in five to  seven years; to transplant, adjust, and technically transform  all the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the  municipality in about eight years; and to generally complete the  construction of the new coastal area in about 10 years. Having  attained these targets, Tianjin will regain the magnificence of  a large commercial port, create new advantages in the modern  economy, and gradually become a large international city. An  arduous, yet great cause, this period is important for Tianjin's  development. We must bravely shoulder tasks that are heavier  than anytime before. To attain these targets, we should  earnestly summarize the experiences gained from the many years  of economic development and make innovations. The general road  for development is to deepen reform, open wider to the outside  world, and, paying attention to the economy's new growth points  to accelerate development there while paying attention to the  renovation of the older city proper and its older enterprises by  accelerating adjustment and invigoration of existing areas and  enterprises. The older city proper should support new areas,  and the new areas should lead the older city proper. They  should develop together and promote each other so that a new  situation can be created in which Tianjin is opened wider to the  outside world, provides better service to the country, and  achieves great development in service and the process of opening  up. To attain these targets, we must make every year and every  step successful, effect new changes every year, and effect a  large change every five years.    A review of last year's work showed that we made important  steps in accelerating development and achieved new changes in  the work in all fields. Our GNP grew by 11.8 percent,  industrial output value 24.5 percent, fixed asset investment  32.4 percent, contracted amount of foreign capital 84.9 percent,  and revenues 21.8 percent, all of which are the best records for  the past few years. Agricultural production increased steadily,  commodity distribution was expanded, markets thrived, and urban  construction, science and technology, education, culture, public  health, and other undertakings made new headway. The 20 tasks  to benefit urban and rural people were fulfilled on schedule,  and people's living standards were improved. We continued to  maintain an excellent situation of political and social  stability. All this resulted from the unified and indomitable  efforts of the people throughout the municipality which has laid  a good foundation for success in this year's work.    The year 1994 is critical to the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure, to making even greater  breakthroughs in reform and opening up, and to effecting even  quicker progress in the economy. Therefore, it is of extremely  great significance to do this year's work well. We should  deepen the reform, expand the opening up, enhance morale, and go  all out to do our work in line with the work principle and  general demand defined by the municipal party committee. All  localities, all departments, and all professions and trades  should foster a high degree of urgency and responsibility, start  from a high level, stress high efficiency, high quality, and  good economic returns, and achieve better major economic targets  than last year. Continued efforts should be made to maintain  sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy.  Major goals of the municipal economic work are: to effect a  12-percent increase in the GNP; to top $5 billion in the total  value of contracted foreign investment directly utilized by the  municipality, with investment made by foreign traders reaching  $3.5 billion; to effect $2.3 million in foreign export trade  volume; to complete 3.6 million square meters of housing; to  effect obvious improvement in economic returns; and to further  improve the income level of urban and rural residents.    The tasks we face are arduous, but, when viewed from the  general situation, there are also many favorable conditions.  Thus, it is entirely possible for us to realize these tasks  through hard work. As far as reform is concerned, the decision  of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  will certainly be carried out in an all-round way, and the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure will  certainly develop in depth. Now, the new round of reform has  already begun, a series of major reform measures of the state  have been put forth, and macro-economic environment will become  even more stable and better. As far as opening up is concerned,  international capital finds favor China, and Tianjin has become  a popular area for foreign investment, resulting in an upsurge  in our utilization of foreign capital. Regarding the condition  for development, the international market's capacity has  expanded, the demands on domestic markets are brisk, and the  adaptability of enterprises to market demands has been  strengthened further. Meanwhile, the scale of investment and  credit funds have improved over last year. Some key projects  related to the development of strength and momentum in Tianjin  have already been built, some of which have already witnessed  results and manifested great potential for development. Some  old enterprises have transformed mechanisms, undergone  renovation, and thus become more vigorous and active. Tianjin  has taken the lead in carrying out the tax assignment system and  the system of separating tax payment from profit retention, thus  gaining an initiative. The mental outlook of leading cadres at  all levels is undergoing profound changes, and the broad masses  of the people in the municipality are trying to make changes and  rapid progress. The work in the past several years has laid a  good foundation for future development. Central leading  comrades and responsible comrades of relative state ministries  and commissions have come to Tianjin to learn about the  situation and give guidance to our work, thus giving us great  support and help. We must have a full understanding of this new  situation in reform, opening up, and development.    Of course, while viewing these favorable conditions, we  should also catch sight of the problems and difficulties  emerging in our way of advance, catch sight of all sorts of  factors that restrict our development, and catch sight of the  shortcomings and the deficiencies in our work. We should  clearly notice that both favorable and unfavorable factors are  in a dynamic state and that one can be transformed by the other.  While favorable conditions can be obtained and created through  our energetic endeavors; unfavorable conditions can also be  transformed and overcome through our energetic endeavor. Under  the same conditions and problems, whether Tianjin can create a  new situation and effect even more rapid progress depends  chiefly on our mental outlook, our morale, our determination,  and our work level. On the whole, we are now in an excellent  opportunity of large-scale development, and favorable conditions  are a main trend. Such a good opportunity is not frequent for  Tianjin, and thus it is very valuable. The opportunity cannot  be missed, and the opportunity will not await us. We must seize  the opportunity to accelerate development.    2. Build a New Coastal Area and Quicken the Pace of  Building It Into the Largest Economic Growth Point of the  Municipality.    To quicken the development of Tianjin and to create new  economic development advantages, we must cultivate large  economic growth points. Occupying a forward position in opening  the municipality to the outside world, this coastal area has  more advantages and potentials for accelerating the pace of  development than any other places in the municipality. With the  efforts made by the previous municipal party committees and  governments, the thinking of accelerating the construction of  the new coastal area has basically been ripe. The general  project is as follows: Build a high-degree, open-type  modernized new economic area with Tianjin Harbor, development  zones, and bonded area as its framework and metallurgical and  chemical industries as its foundation; where commerce and trade,  banking industry, and tourist trade vie with one another for  development; with new rising industries and export-oriented  enterprises as its mainstay; with complete sets of  infrastructural facilities and service functions; and catering  to the needs of the 21st century. Based on this, Tianjin will  be able to further develop itself into a free port. Through the  development and construction in the next 10 years, the new  coastal area's GNP and foreign exchange earnings from exports  will account for more than 40 percent of the municipality's  total. The development and construction of the new coastal area  should be regarded as a key economic work priority of the  municipality. We should work out a unified plan and implement  the plan in a step-by-step manner. We should mobilize the  enthusiasm of all fronts, concentrate energy, accelerate the  construction, and build the new coastal area into one whose  economic growth rate is faster than any other places in the  municipality as well as the largest economic growth point of the  municipality.    First, we should exert efforts to accelerate the port  construction. Port is the largest advantage of Tianjin. Cities  rejuvenate themselves in reliance on ports and ports become  flourishing in reliance on cities. Therefore, the construction  of ports should be regarded as the most important task. In line  with the principle of increasing the total capacity and having  full functions, we should accelerate the pace of construction  and strive to build Tianjin harbor into an international large  harbor with an annual loading and unloading capacity of more  than 100 million tonnes at the beginning of the next century.  We should open various channels to attract capital, use both  domestic and foreign capital, and develop both cooperatively-  and independently-funded enterprises. Anyone who wants to make  investment is welcomed.    Second, we should further bring into play the functions of  the development zone and the bonded area. The development zone  and the bonded area are the banners in opening Tianjin to the  outside world. Thus, the development zone and the bonded area  should exert greater efforts to continuously maintain their  leading role in the whole country and play an experimental,  guiding, and serving role for the new coastal area and even the  municipality as a whole. The development zone should accelerate  the development of land on a large scale, its development on a  snowballing basis, the development of inter-regional circulation  of capital; and develop itself into a large-scale, high-level,  technologically advanced export processing zone and a financial,  commercial, and trade zone. It should develop 25 square  kilometers by 1997 and 33 square kilometers by the end of this  century. The bonded area should firmly attend to the  construction of the second-phase project and try every possible  means to set up a system of making storage, transportation, and  processing a coordinate process. We should draw on the methods  of the international free trade areas, expand the circulation of  goods and materials, develop entrepot trade, and build itself  into the largest international trade window in north China.    Third, we should build a heavy chemical industrial area. Key  maritime chemical industrial and petrochemical industrial  enterprises are concentrated in the new coastal area. A modern  metallurgical industrial foundation with seamless steel tube as  a symbol has been laid. There are also several on-going  projects and several projects whose construction has been  prepared, including a 140,000-tonne ethylene project, a  200,000-tonne polyester project, and a 5 million-tonne oil  refining project. So, a new-typed heavy chemical industry zone  has preliminarily taken shape and shown a vast prospects for  development. This is a key investment area. From now on, new  large-sized industrial projects should be developed in this area  in principle. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of  the projects that have started construction and firmly attend to  the pre-phase preparatory work for the projects whose  construction has been defined. The old enterprises in urban  districts can be moved to this area when conditions permit. The  enterprises in the new coastal area should accelerate the  transformation of managerial mechanisms, set up completely new  enterprise systems, and create new modernized industrial  advantages.    Fourth, we should speed up construction of infrastructural  facilities. To start up the new coastal area early, we should  make a breakthrough in infrastructural construction. Urban  construction departments should improve the plan, make  arrangements, and put forward a clear demand on progress.    This year, we should make the best of the funds from various  sources and increase investment to complete the construction of  the overpass on the Xinhua Road in Tanggu District, start  construction of the Gangtang Road and Shanguang Road, speed up  construction of the Nanjiang Bridge, and complete, as soon as  possible, the heat and power plant and water plant in the  development zone and the project to divert Luan He water to  Hangu District. We should make active efforts to use foreign  capital to build the expressway from the city proper to the new  coastal region.    Speeding up construction of the new coastal area is a major  task in Tianjin's economic work. All fields should take the  overall situation into consideration, make concerted efforts,  devote energy, and make contributions to construction. Tanggu,  Hangu, Dagang, Dongli, and Jinnan Districts should do their work  well to meet the needs in the construction of the new coastal  area, compete with and promote each other, and accelerate  development.    3. Deepen Reform and Invigorate Existing Enterprises    To accelerate development, we should also make more efforts  to invigorate existing enterprises. If existing enterprises are  not invigorated, it will be very difficult to develop new ones.  We may say that invigorating existing enterprises, especially  state-owned, large and medium-sized ones, is the foundation for  future development. After over four decades of construction,  Tianjin has accumulated a considerable amount of property and  technology and possesses a number of backbone enterprises and  highly competitive products. A valuable source of wealth, their  potential should be fully tapped in every way.    We should invigorate existing enterprises by accelerating  reform. Through the means of reform, adjustment, and  reorganization, we should adopt different measures according to  differing conditions and keep some while abandoning others to  suit the remedy for each case. Large and medium-sized  enterprises whose conditions permit should actively experiment  with reform in the modern enterprise system and turn themselves  into limited liability companies or limited liability stock  companies. Small enterprises should make great efforts to adopt  the cooperative shareholding system or the leasing and contract  methods to become enterprises "run by the people without  changing their state-owned status." Enterprises which have  achieved notable efficiency and large shares of the market and  have bright prospects for development should be encouraged to  expand their scale and upgrade their levels and, by merging and  cooperating, expand their strength and develop enterprise groups  linked mainly by property rights. Enterprises with poor  efficiency may be divided into several smaller ones and improved  with measures that match their actual conditions so that they  can be invigorated. In short, all enterprises should adopt  reform measures that match their actual conditions and take  actions as soon as possible. Enterprises should make earnest  efforts in reform, take the initiative in finding ways, and try  to liberate themselves through their own efforts instead of  relying on assistance and relief.    We should invigorate existing enterprises through technical  transformation carried out with foreign funds and technology.  The experience of a number of enterprises, such as Otis  Elevator, Honda Motorcycle, Tianyang Washing Machine, and  Jinmeile Beverage, proved that technical transformation with  foreign funds and technology is an important way to invigorate  existing enterprises. Therefore, we should have greater courage  and greater determination to promote this work. Not only small  enterprises but large ones, not only one enterprise but a whole  trade, and not only enterprises in a slump but also ones that  are doing well may conduct technical transformation with foreign  funds and technology as long as foreign firms are willing. This  year, Tianjin should select a group of large enterprises for  contacts with foreign firms and they should achieve great  progress in technical transformation with foreign funds and  technology.    We should invigorate existing enterprises by encouraging  them to do business with various industries and various trades  and professions. Development of the market economy requires  that enterprises break the mode of developing only one plant or  one product and that they conduct unitary management, adapt  themselves to market changes on their own initiative, accelerate  structural readjustment, and do business with various industries  and various trades and professions in a timely manner. This has  become the law of economic development. Therefore, it is  necessary to do business this way. It is not an expedient  measure. We should be determined to do it in a big way, gather  momentum, select a number of enterprises that were running in  the red for a long time in downtown areas, particularly in the  golden areas, to practice this and make big strides in this  aspect. All enterprises that need to do business with various  industries must take action quickly, because they will gain  initiative in this regard if they start this work early and will  be in a passive situation if they carry out this work late.  They must change their ideas, never put on airs, suit measures  to local conditions, each display their own strong points, and  seek development by doing business with various industrial  sectors.    We should create necessary external conditions for  invigorating the existing economic units. Invigorating economic  units is not a matter of enterprises only, it is also an  unshirkable duty of all departments. We must give enterprises a  free hand, decontrol their management, and delegate powers to  them. Powers which have been defined to be delegated to  enterprises must be put in place, and more powers should be  delegated to the lower levels according to needs and  possibility. It is necessary to boldly allow enterprises to  manage things which they can manage well. The higher level  pertinent departments and functional departments should actively  support enterprises conduct readjustment, reorganization,  grafting, and development of various industries, and should not  interfere with or restrict their work. With regard to  enterprises which the municipality authorities do not want to  manage but the district authorities are willing to accept, we  should place them under the management of district authorities.    4. We Should Expand the Use of Foreign Capital and Open the  Municipality to All Directions, at Home and Abroad    Being an open coastal city with development of  export-oriented economy as the mainstay, Tianjin should strive  to do a good job in opening itself at home and abroad and give  rise to a situation of opening up to all directions, various  spheres, and higher levels.    First, we should further expand the scope of using foreign  capital. To accelerate development, it is necessary to increase  investments. Judging from the possibility of raising funds,  using foreign capital is a very practical and convenient and  rapid way of getting money. Introducing foreign capital will  bring in not only funds but also advanced technology and  management. In order to develop the new coastal area, accelerate  the pace of enterprise grafting and transformation, fulfill the  target of renovating dangerous and shoddy houses, and conduct  infrastructure facilities, Following the path of expanding the  degree of opening to the outside world and using foreign  capital, Tianjin must take quick action in using foreign  capital. If we do a good job in using foreign capital, we will  be able to accelerate the realization of our defined goal, if  not, accelerated development will be empty talk. The higher and  lower levels across the municipality should make due  contributions to this major matter of extreme importance and  urgency. We should proceed from the overall situation, mobilize  all sectors, take coordinated action, and form a joint force to  speed up introduction of foreign capital and use them  practically and wisely. We should regard introduction of more  foreign funds and good efficiency as the standards for testing  this work. This year, the trend of using foreign capital is  very good, the prelude has been played, and the climate is being  formed. This trend has appeared more quickly than expected. We  should take advantage of this trend to advance, carry out this  work comprehensively, and make breakthroughs in some major  aspects. In addition to achieving major progress in the direct  use of foreign capital, we should also actively open up the  channel of effectively using inter-government loans, loans from  international banking organs, and buyers' credit. Cooperation  can be conducted in all sectors, including the primary,  secondary, and tertiary industrial sectors; all large,  medium-sized, and small items are welcomed and various  cooperative forms may be adopted. We should firmly grasp those  large projects which, once imported, will result in the  development of a large area. All units should not delay this  work. Regarding some major items, we should report the  situation of progress to the higher level in a timely manner in  an effort to combine the efforts of the higher and the lower  levels to make this work a success.    Second, we should vigorously improve the intangible  environment of investment. Whether we can utilize a large  amount of foreign capital depends chiefly on our investment  environment, the intangible environment in particular. To  improve the intangible environment for investment, we should  always proceed from ourselves. We should create an environment  in which foreign traders have profits to net and have money to  make. We should be good at doing accounts and lay emphasis on  long-term benefits. We should persist in the service forms of  "one continuous line" and "one station," characterized by quick  tempo and high efficiency. Proceeding from expediting the  completion of our projects, we should revise and prefect our  policies in a timely manner. By improving the intangible  environment, we should be able to attract and retain more  foreign capital, utilize foreign capital more quickly, and yield  better results from utilizing foreign capital. We should make  great efforts to build Tianjin into an area that is most  attractive to investors and make foreign traders more  enthusiastic in investing in Tianjin.    Third, we should try every possible means to make Tianjin  more popular. Since last year, all fields have exerted great  effort in going abroad and bringing in foreign funds and have  done a lot of work in absorbing foreign investment and spreading  propaganda abroad. Not long ago, the municipal government  delegation paid a visit to the ROK and Malaysia via Hong Kong,  and the visit left a deep impression on the delegation. There  are many funds that can be utilized in the world. The key lies  in whether we can absorb them. From now on, we should make even  better use of all sorts of channels, opportunities, and  propaganda media to extensively propagate Tianjin, spread its  influence in the world, and interest more foreign investment by  foreign friends. In absorbing foreign investment, we should  attach great importance on the role of noted persons, large  enterprises, and large financial groups that are influential in  the world. If we have the ability to invite them to Tianjin to  carry out several large projects, we will be able to further  expand Tianjin's influence in the outside world and attract even  more investors to Tianjin.    Fourth, we should play the "service card" well. Tianjin's  reform is multi-directional, and thus its service should also be  multi- directional. We should strive for development with  service and set up the role as the economic central city with  service. Not only should we improve the service abroad, but  also improve the service at home. Not only should we serve the  areas around Bohai Bay, but also serve the areas in north,  northeast, and northwest China. Not only should we serve  various departments under the central authorities, but also  serve various provinces and municipalities. We should drop the  haughtiness of being a large city and jump out of the closed  circle to open Tianjin's gate wide. Convenience and service  should be given by every possible means to the projects that are  conducive to the economic development of both sides, regardless  of their scale, distance, and order of cooperation. All  localities, all departments, all units, and even all social  members should foster a strong sense of opening up and a strong  idea of service and should find proper places to conduct  service. We should enhance the comprehensive service functions  of cities, use first-class service to win sentiment and  reputation, and constantly enhance our attraction to bring in  even more professional talents, materials, funds, and  information in order to create a completely new situation of  opening the whole municipality in all directions at home and  abroad.    5. Accelerate the Development of the Tertiary Industry, With  Emphasis on Cultivating and Developing the Market Structure    To successfully establish the socialist market economy, we  are required to cultivate large markets and develop large-scale  circulation. In the past, enterprises relied on plans, but now  they rely on markets. Establishment of several large markets  will provide conditions for developing enterprises, and the  image of the entire municipality will experience big changes.  In future economic work, we should regard the cultivation and  development of large markets as an important part of  government's service to enterprises and change of government  functions and should place this work in an even more conspicuous  position so that we can gradually build Tianjin into the biggest  commercial and trading center in northern China.    It is necessary to consolidate and develop the existing  trading markets. Over the past years, the municipality has done  a lot of work in setting up markets. So far, 64 commodity  wholesale markets, 28 trading markets for capital goods, and a  group of banking, technology, skilled persons, and labor markets  have been set up. A market system framework has beginning to  take shape. This has positively helped promote the reasonable  flow of production factors, the enlivening of the economy, and  the acceleration of development. But, the existing markets are  still less advanced in terms of the development scale, the  categories, the influential power, and the service level. We  must further adopt positive and effective administrative  measures to expand the scale of management, intensify the  service functions, improve the trading environment, form a big  climate. On the basis of developing spot markets, we should  create conditions to run, on a trial basis, one or two futures  trading centers. We should fully apply market information to  serve enterprises. Simultaneously, enterprises should be good  at using information to guide production and management.    It is necessary to build another group of trading markets.  First, we should form, as soon as possible, the banking markets  dominated by the flow of funds by banks. We should positively  expand the categories and scale of various bonds, increase the  negotiable securities management organizations and service  networks, achieve the issue and listing of stocks, enhance the  influential power and attractiveness of the municipality's  securities markets, and create conditions for striving to run  the third securities trading center in China. We should also  strive to run gold trading centers. Second, in line with the  setup of the modern enterprise system, we should positively  cultivate and develop the markets for trading enterprise  property rights. Third, we should firmly attend to organizing  the state-level north China technology trading market and build  the municipality into a key scientific and technological  findings and information distribution area and a technology  trading center in north China. Fourth, in line with the  development of land resources, the reconstruction of the old  urban areas, and the reform of the housing system, we should  further improve and expand the real estate market. Fifth, we  should continue to build a group of national and regional large  markets in cooperation with state departments and commissions  and brotherly provinces and municipalities. Simultaneously, we  should positively develop various kinds of professional  intermediate organizations of market and bring into full play  their functions for serving, notarizing, and supervising  economic activities.    By developing various categories of markets, we should  further promote the development of transportation, postal and  telecommunications, information consultation, catering service,  shopping, tourist, and entertainment trades; increase the  proportion of the tertiary industry in the GNP; and further make  Tianjin vigorous and flourishing.    6. Accelerate the Construction of Key Projects and Enhance  the Reserve Strength for Economic Development.    To elevate the economy to a new height, Tianjin must build,  as soon as possible, a group of pillar industries and develop a  group of large-scale, high-level, and wide-needed products with  competitiveness so as to enhance the reserve strength for  development and competitiveness. Otherwise, Tianjin will lose  the position as a key city.    Tianjin's machinery industry with automobiles and machinery  equipment as the mainstay, electronic industry with  telecommunication and computers as the mainstay, chemical  industry with petrochemical products, marine chemical products,  and fine chemicals as the mainstay, and metallurgical industry  with fine-quality steel tubes and high-grade metal products as  the mainstay have taken an initial shape. Their output value  accounts for 70 percent of the total industrial enterprises, and  their profits and taxes account for 80 percent of the total of  all budgetary industrial enterprises. We should continue to  accelerate the development of these four pillar industries and  expand them. In automobile production, we should increase the  capacity to 150,000 as soon as possible. In seamless steel tube  production, we should organize and operate it well, make the  best of its investment, and apply its advanced technology to  other trades. Construction of the ethylene and polyester  projects should be accelerated. Regarding the production of the  20 key products, such as program-controlled telephone exchanges,  video recorders, engineering machines, metal products, and  chemical fibers, we should expand the scale, upgrade the levels,  and improve the efficiency. Guided by market demand, we should  expedite the adjustment and renovation of light and textile  industries and their technical transformation with foreign funds  and technology. Larger-scale renovation and reorganization  should be made in some key industries. All districts, counties,  and bureaus should also pay attention to their own key products.    We should comprehensively speed up construction of  infrastructural facilities, further improve the investment  climate, and enable the municipality to play a better role as  the carrier to meet the requirement for the great economic  development. This year, we should step up the expansion of the  Beimalu Road and Laotieqiao Street, link up all the sections of  the inner ring road, build four new overpasses, and expand and  renovate some road sections with snarled traffic to ease  strained transportation in urban areas as soon as possible. We  should speed up construction of a number of commercial, trading,  and public cultural facilities, such as the Quanyechang  Department Store, Baihuo Shopping Center, Zhongshan commercial  building, Huaxin commercial building, Beiyang industrial and  medicinal herb commercial and trading integrated building,  TIANJIN RIBAO multi-purpose building, and JINWAN BAO building,  to effect a notable change in the outlook of the municipality.  We should continue construction of the second-phase project of  the Xinkaihe Water Works, expedite construction of such energy  facilities as the Jixian Power Plant and Chentangzhuang Heat and  Power Plant, actively prepare for the construction of the No. 3  gas plant, ensure supplies of heat to 3 million square meters of  houses, and increase the local telephone capacity to 400,000  lines. We should make all-out efforts to organize the  implementation of the projects for the 43d Works Table Tennis  Games and make sure that they are completed on schedule.    7. Strengthen the Fundamental Position of Agriculture and  Further Expand the Rural Economy    Persisting in the integrated and common development of urban  and rural areas and quicken the process of Tianjin's rural  modernization constitute an important aspect of the endeavor to  develop Tianjin's economy. We should always attach importance  to agriculture and rural work and never shake the fundamental  position of agriculture in the process of establishing the  socialist market economy system. Agriculture can only be  strengthened and never weakened. All trades and professions  should support agriculture and rural work and forge closer ties  between urban and rural areas and between industry and  agriculture.    To accelerate rural economic development, we should continue  to develop suburban-type and export-oriented economy, adhere to  the principle of serving the city and making peasants prosper,  further restructure the rural economy, develop high-yield,  good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, stabilize and  increase grain and cotton production, make the "shopping basket"  project successful, and improve the socialized service system.  We should increase agricultural investment continuously and  improve rural policies. We should focus all our efforts on  increasing peasants' income. This is the basic guarantee for  stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. All localities should  adopt various forms in line with their actual situation to  greatly enhance the living standards and actual income of  peasants. This should be regarded as a major criterion for  assessing the work achievements of leading bodies at all levels  on the agricultural front. Continued efforts should be made to  grasp the work of helping the poor people, and study and adopt  some permanent measures to rapidly change the backward outlook  of the poverty-stricken areas. Greatly developing township  enterprises is a major move for invigorating Tianjin's economy.  We should further deepen reform, clearly define the property  right relations, promote the shareholding cooperative system,  and standardize and develop township enterprise groups. We  should keep a flexible mechanism in township enterprises and  never follow the old pattern of state-owned enterprises. It is  necessary to take the market as the guidance, actively expand  the use of foreign capital, readjust the structure, upgrade  quality and management, enlarge the scope, upgrade products, and  form a leading industry and key enterprises, and produce  competitive products of our own in an effort to strengthen the  ability to compete. We should combine the development of the  rural economy with the building of small towns, carry out this  work ahead of schedule, clearly define the major points, provide  support and guidance, and build a number of new towns with their  own characteristics through several years of efforts.    8. We Should Develop High and New Technology, and Combine  Science With Economy    We are now in a period of rapidly developing technology and  information. Science and technology have infiltrated into all  spheres of our social and economic life, playing an increasingly  important role. Under the market economic condition, commodity  competition is actually a contest of technology. As a big city,  it certainly cannot find a foothold if its technology is  backward. It must strengthen the sense of urgency in relying on  scientific and technological progress. Through reform and  opening up, we should apply the market mechanism to further  promote a combination of science and technology. We should  unceasingly use advanced technology to transform traditional  industries and old enterprises, digest and absorb imported  technologies, blaze new trials, and raise the technological  content of products. Pertinent economic and scientific and  technological departments at all levels, all scientific research  organs, and all enterprises should make arrangements for the  work of relying on scientific and technological progress, and  achieve actual progress.    We should expedite the development of a new technology  industrial park. The park must be built to become our  municipality's high and new-tech industrial base, the source of  radiation in transforming traditional industries, the showcase  of opening to the outside world, and the experimental area for  deepening reform. We should give play to our advantages of  having many scientific research organs, a good foundation in  high and new technology, and a strong capacity in research and  development, actively use foreign capital, and achieve big  progress in developing jointly-funded and cooperative scientific  and technological items and new industries. We should further  improve all policies, laws, and regulations, raise the service  level, and realistically enhance cohesion in the park. This year  we should accelerate the construction of Huayuan industrial  zone, Wuqing industrial zone, the management and service base,  and the second Baidilu science and trade street, and rapidly  form an atmosphere in this aspect.    We should actively establish the science and technology  service system. This year we should give priority to building  science and technology coordination centers and technology  trading centers in northern provinces, and raise and perfect the  science and technology pioneering center. On this basis, we  should establish the science and technology evaluation center  and the productive forces promotion center. It is necessary to  make our municipality produce more and better achievements  rapidly through the establishment of science and technology  service system, and rapidly translate scientific and  technological achievements into real productive forces.    Tianjin, being one of our country's old industrial bases and  the economic center of northern China, should follow the world's  advanced technology in some spheres. We should give full play  to the role of scientific research units, institutions of higher  learning, and municipal scientific research organs in Tianjin,  and speed up the process of commercialization and  industrialization of the scientific and technological  achievements. We should implement the doctrine of bringing in,  and graft advanced technology with pillar industries and  transplant it to competitive products.    Personnel are the guarantee and education is the foundation  for implementing the principle of developing the municipality  with science and technology and for developing high and new  technology. To develop the economy, education should be  developed first; to promote the economy to a new height,  education should be promoted to a new height first; and to make  the economy a cut above others, personnel and the education that  trains the personnel should be made a cut above others first.  All relevant departments should put education in a strategic  position for development on a priority basis, conscientiously  implement the arrangements made at the municipal education work  conference held by the municipal party committee and government,  accelerate educational reform and development, and train a large  number of high-quality personnel of various specialties for  Tianjin's economic development and social progress.    We should establish a social practice of respecting  knowledge  and respecting personnel throughout the municipality,  realistically raise the social status and material benefits of  intellectuals, and give full play to their role in reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive.    9. Achieve a Breakthrough in the Renovation of Single-Story  Houses To Further Improve People's Living Standard    Seizing the opportunity to accelerate development, in the  final analysis, depends on the enthusiasm, initiative,  creativity, wisdom, and forces of the masses. Without them,  everything will be out of the question. When the masses are  plunging themselves into reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive with high spirit, we should all the more  show concern for their vital interests and exert utmost efforts  to do practical work for them. All our leading cadres come from  the masses and are at the service of the people. At no time and  under no circumstances should they forget the masses. They  should put themselves in the position of the masses and work for  them. They should step up the work urgently needed by the  masses and create favorable conditions for doing the work for  which conditions are lacking for the time being. Regarding the  work most urgent in people's lives, in particular, they should  not wait until the revenue is improved or the economy is  promoted to a new height. They should adopt every means to carry  it out and truly regard the difficulties of the masses as the  focus of their work.    Housing, income, children's education, and public security  are the issues the masses are currently most concerned about.  Due to numerous reasons, Tianjin still has many dilapidated  single-story houses, where many people are living. There are  even some houses where three generations live together, sweating  in the summer and freezing in the winter. If we remain  indifferent to this, serving the people will become an empty  talk, the endeavor to accelerate development will have no  appeal, and the image and prestige of the party and the  government among the masses will be damaged. This is a serious  issue. We should also note that speeding up the renovation of  dilapidated single-story houses cannot only directly benefit the  masses but it can also lead to the improvement of urban traffic  conditions, the renovation of the old city proper, the  construction of infrastructural facilities, and the development  of the tertiary industry, increase urban employment  opportunities, and raise the degree of urban civilization. It  is a good thing that has plenty of benefits and a major measure  to make the city prosper and the people happy. We should  enhance understanding and confidence and race against the time  to carry it out.    In 1994, we launch the first battle to rebuild the  one-storey houses. We must be successful in the first battle.  Six districts in the municipality should set historical records  in the number of areas where houses are dismantled and the  people have to move to other places because of the  reconstruction, the number of construction areas, and the number  of newly built houses. A total of 2.795 million square meters  of houses should be built this year. All districts should ensure  to achieve this target. We should try every possible means to  increase the use of foreign capital. We should timely sum up  experiences, revise and perfect policies, and attract more  foreign businessmen to engage in the reconstruction of  one-storey houses. All supporting units should take the overall  situation into consideration, care for the weal and woe of the  people, strive to reduce various expenses, and make up no  excuses to gain profits from the reconstruction of one-storey  houses. According to the requirements of the overall urban  planning, we should ensure that the construction designs are  new, carefully organize construction, and guarantee the  construction quality so the masses are satisfied. We should  achieve the work in such channels as dismantling old houses,  having the people move to other places, exchanging houses, and  returning to newly built houses; handle affairs strictly  according to policies; make the accomplishments visible to the  public; and end various kinds of unhealthy tendencies. We  should conscientiously treat and appropriately handle the  problems that the masses have complaints and carefully  accomplish the good things. It is necessary to organically link  the reconstruction of one-storey houses with the deepening of  the housing reform coordinately in line with policies and to  encourage and guide the masses to accurately understand that the  individuals must undertake reasonable burden. It is necessary  to eliminate administrative interference and monopoly and to  open bidding and make competition on equal terms in  participating in the reconstruction of one-storey houses and  developing the real estate industry.    At the time of accelerating the reconstruction of dangerous,  shabby, and one-storey houses, the leading cadres at various  levels should experience in various aspects the weal and woe of  the masses and do more good deeds to help the people with  difficulties. Particularly, we should try every possible means  to help the enterprises whose production has wholly or partially  been suspended, the staff members and workers with low income,  and those with living difficulties; provide necessary relief for  the households with special difficulties; and ensure that all  households can live a good life. We should adopt necessary  measures to make the markets flourish and stabilize the prices  of goods. We should persistently do 20 deeds to improve the  livelihood of the urban and rural people and mainly do the  things that can directly benefit the people and that are closely  related to the people. It is necessary to continuously  strengthen the overall improvement of social order, deal strict  blows to various criminal activities, and make the people live  in peace and contentment.    10. Be Inspired With Enthusiasm And Creatively Carry Our  Work.    The key to making a high start in the 1994 work and to  making  new changes in various aspects hinges on the leading cadres at  various levels. It is not easy to create a new situation. The  situation is pressing. There are no routes of retreat. With  new ideas, new field of vision, greater courage, and greater  boldness, we should carry forward the spirit of pioneering  undertakings in the new situation and guide the broad masses of  the people to create a new situation in accelerating the pace of  development.    It is necessary to emancipate the mind. To make new headway  in our work, we should emancipate the mind. To emphasize the  emancipation of the mind, the leading cadres should be the first  in emancipating the mind, handle affairs resolutely in line with  the ideological line of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, thoroughly free  themselves from the restrictions of rigid and outdated ideas,  foster new ideas, and have the daring to be the first in the  world. We should give free reins and have the daring to do the  things that are conducive to the development of Tianjin and lose  no good opportunities. To emphasize the necessity to emancipate  the mind, we should see real results in our work. The leading  cadres at various levels occupy important positions. So, their  work performances not only have the bearing on their own  political achievements but also are related to the personal  interests of the 9 million people in the municipality. Facing  the heavy tasks, we cannot spend 1994 easily and steadily. We  should be ready to perspire, use energy, and lose weight. Some  comrades think that the tasks are heavy and they bear heavy  pressure. It is normal. The situation must not be submitted to  us. On the contrary, we should consciously suit the  requirements for the development of the situation. We should  think out new methods, pioneer new ways, vie with one another to  do things, select and bear heavy burden, do several concrete  deeds, and live up to the expectations of the party and the  people.    We should dare to aim high and win the first place. In  assessing the work in various fields, we should not compare  ourselves with what was achieved in the past, but should compare  with the advanced places in the nation and with the standards  the municipalities should attain. Tianjin dwellers are not  foolish, and those who are seated here will also not admit that  they are more foolish than others. Tianjin dwellers are able to  do a big cause. We should persist in high standards and set  strict demands on the work in all fields, should have a strong  spirit of admitting no defeat and a spirit of working with all  our might. The time cannot be delayed and all work should be  done hurriedly to create a first- class work.    We should stress on overall situation and unity.  Accelerating development is precisely the overall situation.  All our speeches and actions should subject to this overall  situation. The entire municipality should develop according to  a unified plan, and all the people there should make encouraging  remarks and support each other to form a concerted power. All  the remarks that are detrimental to unity should not be made,  and all the things that are detrimental to unity should not be  done. We should advocate the selfless spirit, face up to  difficulties, yield convenience to others, render service to  lower levels, find out shortcomings among ourselves, and  concentrate our efforts on our own work. We should  comprehensively carry out the system of being responsible for  attaining one's own work targets. We should give assignments to  everyone and let each level assume responsibility for its own  work. For the major matters that have a bearing on the overall  situation, we should allow everyone to air his views and listen  to the opinions of the masses before making policy decisions.  Once a policy is determined, it should be executed resolutely  to ensure its smooth implementation.    We should fully believe and depend on the masses. Over the  past several years, Tianjin has given rise to the basic work  idea of "doing everything for the people and relying on the  people to do everything." This idea must be carried forward.  On the final analysis, we must depend on the masses to fulfill  this year's arduous tasks and to realize our fighting goals.  Our determination and our methods are all from the aspirations  and wisdom of the masses. In establishing the socialist market  economic structure, we will certainly meet many new  circumstances and new problems. Under such a situation, leading  cadres at all levels must frequently go deep into the  grass-roots areas to set off the atmosphere of conducting  investigation and study and avoid subjectivism and making  mistakes that should not be made. We should make best possible  use of our political advantages and extensively launch voluntary  labor activities in order to fully mobilize the initiative of  the masses and reasonably exploit their initiative.    For the overall situation of accelerating the development of  Tianjin, and for the common interest of the people in Tianjin,  we should eliminate all resistance and should not hold on to a  post without doing any work. The basic quality of the ranks of  our cadres is good, and the overwhelming majority of our cadres  are competent. We sincerely hope that all cadres will stand the  test, perform their duties on their posts, run forward every  day, and make their due contributions to garner the support of  the masses.    While concentrating on carrying out reform, opening up, and  economic work, we should attach importance to the work of  propaganda, culture, public health, sports, environmental  protection, and family planning, and should strengthen the  building of spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the  legal system with a view to effecting a comprehensive progress  in society.    Nineteen ninety four is an extremely important year to the  acceleration of Tianjin's development. The people's aspirations  are ardent and the tasks are arduous. Let us closely rally  around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the nucleus. Let us unite as one, struggle arduously, and truly  attend to practical work under the correct leadership of the  municipal party committee in order to win a new victory in  Tianjin's reform, opening up, and various other undertakings in  1994!</p>

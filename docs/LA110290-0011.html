			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BENITEZ: ELOQUENT FLAMENCO  </P> <P> Slumped across a table on stage at El Camino College on Wednesday, Maria  Benitez and four other members of her Spanish Dance Company beat an intense,  steady rhythm on its surface.  </P> <P> Three guitarists nearby restricted their playing solely to percussive  accompaniment and soon the snapping fingers, stamping feet and forceful  chanting of the seated dancers added complexity to the ostinato without  diminishing its primal force.  </P> <P> Eventually, the chant led to song (dominated by the soulful Manolo Segura), the  guitarists turned melodic (and, alas, overamplified), while the dancers moved  from their chairs to center stage.  </P> <P> Answering the hand-claps of the stocky, feline Angel Atienza and the elegantly  proportioned but bland Alfonso Simo, Benitez unleashed flurries of eloquent  flamenco heelwork, her long arms sweeping rapidly through space -- her style  lighter and without the tension of her extended, superb "Solea" earlier in the  evening.  </P> <P> While Benitez changed from her red dress to a sleek pants outfit, the suite  passed to tiny, mercurial Susanna di Palma and the men, evolving from unison  line dances to flamboyant solos for the women and, later, brief dances for  nearly everyone -- including Segura and two of the guitarists.  </P> <P> Remarkable for its sense of atmosphere and its unpredictable interaction  between dancers, this hourlong "Flamencos de la 'Trinia' " (choreographed by  Mario Maya) set the seal on a performance already praiseworthy for skill and  intelligence.  </P> <P> Benitez remains a superb soloist -- feral, sensual, virtuosic, commanding. But  now the company's mixture of classic and offbeat repertory helps make its  program exceptional as a whole. LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

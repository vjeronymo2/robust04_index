			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero </F> from his office in Brasilia; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Good evening. You, Brazilian workers in any  position or activity, have just received your first salary in  URV's [real value units]. In practice it is the first time we  have felt the effect of the stabilization program in the  workers' incomes. I know, however, that people still have many  doubts, as a lot was said about alleged salary losses as a  consequence of the conversion of salaries into URV's. The  truth, however, is that no one has been able to demonstrate that  these losses have in fact taken place. On the contrary, in some  cases there have been salary gains. This is why I agreed with  President Itamar Franco that tonight I would address the nation  to explain the economic plan a little bit more.    For us workers, for most of us who receive a salary with  which to face family expenses, the economic program yields many  advantages. To receive a salary in URV's is to receive a salary  corrected daily according to inflation. Contrary to other  plans, our program began with the protection of salaries.  Housewives who go to the supermarket know better than anyone  else that salaries always lagged behind prices. No matter how  many salary increases or salary readjustment triggers were  applied, they never served to protect salaries.    This time it is different. With the URV salaries will run  hand in hand with the prices in real cruzeiros, at the same  speed. In addition, at this stage industrialists and  businessmen, along with the government, are converting  contracts, prices, and utility rates into URV's.    Well then, you may now ask yourselves: And the prices in  real cruzeiros? Don't they continue increasing every single  day? It is true, as I said before, that at this stage prices in  real cruzeiros continue to increase while salaries lag behind.  We need to stop this price stampede, because only a few  privileged people obtain gains with it. At present salaries are  already in URV's, and the prices that have already been  converted into URV's are ceasing to increase. Why? Because  whoever signs a contract in URV's stops readjusting prices.  Thus, the price of things remain the same.    The government remains alert, as with beer and medicines.  With the April salary you will be able to buy the same things  you bought with the salary of March, the first one that was  corrected. Today many products and services have two prices:  one in real cruzeiros, which continues to be readjusted, and  another in URV's, which remains stable and is also the measure  of the value of your salary. The result is that commerce has  increased its sales and people can buy goods in URV's with  credits, without inflation, and without black market quotations.    Soon, given that salaries and prices will both be expressed  in URV's, prices in real cruzeiros will no longer mean anything.  Soon we will arrive at the much expected moment. Instead of  only changing the name of the currency we will change the  currency itself. But this will take place when the URV complies  with its other role, which is to give producers and businessmen  the conditions to foresee their costs and thus stabilize prices.    The new currency will come when the URV finishes its work.  Only then will the new real come into circulation, substituting  for the URV, ending the real cruzeiro, and it will be the new  currency of a Brazil without inflation. It will be a strong  currency, like that of the developed countries; a currency that  is valuable because inflation will be low, the economy will  work, and salaries will have purchasing power.    We are making these changes without surprises, frights,  without hurriedness, carefully discussing each of the next steps  of the program. We will announce the implementation of the real  at least 35 days before it is put into circulation. We now have  a great chance, perhaps a unique chance to end an inflation that  is destroying Brazil. We have begun by putting the house in  order, balancing the government accounts, cutting expenses, and  chasing tax evaders to increase tax collection.    We would all like to have a higher minimum salary and see  all  salaries raised. But let us be honest -- right now that kind  of increase would be unrealistic, because it would further fuel  inflation.    Furthermore, it would bring a serious imbalance to the  government's budget. Just to give you an idea, an increase in  the minimum salary may ultimately cause the social security  system, and many state and city governments, to go bankrupt.  The Itamar Franco administration has never thought that it  could save the nation without the support of each Brazilian  citizen; that is, without the help of workers, businessmen,  housewives, students, and political leaders. We must all  shoulder this responsibility.    I once again appeal to political leaders, to all candidates,  to the members of Congress, and to the judicial branch about the  need for them to understand the stabilization program. Please  give this program a chance. Those economic packages that had  instituted shock treatments, price and salary freezes, bank  holidays, and even confiscation of savings were all approved by  Congress, which gave these programs the chance to be put to the  test.    It would be an enormous injustice if the first truly  democratic economic plan -- which does not contain either shock  treatments, surprises, or any form of violence -- should be  denied the same vote of confidence.    Congress -- which is sensitive to the feelings, anxieties  and  hopes of the Brazilian people -- knows that it should pave the  way for the implementation of a program that meets every  condition required to be successful. This program does,  however, need a chance to prove itself. Let us not deceive  ourselves or the public. Without economic stability, we will not  be able to increase salaries, correct injustices, or enable the  government to discharge its duties concerning health, education,  public security, and retirees.    This is the first time that a government, instead of  spending  more in an election year, is proposing a plan that reduces its  own expenditures so that the next government, irrespective of  who forms it, may inherit a sound economy.    All of those who are seeking to rule the nation beginning  next year should understand that they will be unable to keep  their promises if they assume a government that is undergoing an  economic crisis with a high inflation rate, a government which  would thus be rendered incapable of discharging its most basic  duties.    The Brazilian people will not tolerate it if selfish  interests prevent the implementation of the economic program in  the coming decisive weeks. The fact of the matter is that we  all know that. It is in the best interests of Brazilian voters  to put an end to inflation, and not in hearing once again  promises that will not bring solutions to the country's  problems. And the worst socioeconomic problem in Brazil today  is inflation. This is our main challenge, the target of our  struggle. With the help of God and of all Brazilians, we will  achieve our goal to build a better, more just country where  there is no inflation, and where money and salaries may reward  the efforts of the working class. Thank you and good night.</p>

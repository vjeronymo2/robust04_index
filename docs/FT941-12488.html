			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Now Europe goes private - The big sell-offs planned on the Continent this year The word privatisation sends pound signs flashing before the eyes of anyone who shared in the generous returns from the sale of Britain's state assets to the private sector in the 1980s. Many UK private investors will be hoping for similarly rich pickings from privatisation issues worth about Pounds 75bn which are planned by European Union governments and for which all EU nationals have an equal chance to subscribe. Almost every EU government plans to sell at least a few corporate assets soon. Many are in high-yielding sectors such as telecommunications, utilities, energy and finance. This means that some of the privatisation stocks could give investors almost the same yield available from a building society account, with the added benefit of potential capital growth - and a commensurate risk of loss. The planned sales include the French government's 51 per cent stake in the country's largest industrial company, the oil group Elf Aquitaine; KPN, the Dutch telecommunications company, due to be sold before the end of June; and the Italian government's projected disposal of its controlling stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big Rome-based financial services group. Will European offers be a good buy? So far, some issues have gone better than expected and none has flopped. In France, where the most ambitious continental privatisation programme is under way, the first two issues - Banque Nationale de Paris, one of the country's biggest banks, and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group - were over-subscribed heavily by both individual and institutional investors. Profits before costs, seen in early dealings, were 21 per cent and 11 per cent respectively on local applications. But will the European privatisations be similar to those in the UK? There are two main aspects: the initial pricing and subsequent performance. A study by the London Business School showed that an investor holding a basket of UK privatisation stocks*, bought at flotation and sold after one week, would have realised a 32 per cent increase in capital value compared with a market average of 0.2 per cent. By keeping the basket until October 1 1988, the investor could have increased the capital value by 166 per cent compared with a 77 per cent market average. This indicates that a substantial proportion of the total gain was earned in the first week, which suggests that the British government's pricing policy was highly significant in contributing to the high returns on UK privatisation stocks. Pricing policy across the EU is likely to vary between countries and assets. Moreover, the volume of privatisation stock could stretch international markets. A survey of 55 investment professionals around the world by Burson-Marsteller Financial, a UK investor relations practice, concluded: 'Respondents suggested that the number of privatisations currently or about to take place in European countries, such as France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands would put strains on international capital markets as they try to absorb the vast amounts being raised.' Others are optimistic. Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, says: 'The conditions for European equity markets are generally positive for the longer term. With interest rates falling and inflation running at low levels, the only nagging query is a general lack of growth for now.' He believes people will switch their cash and fixed-interest investments into the new issues. British privatisation stocks were popular partly because investors saw scope for improving productivity gains by cutting labour costs. But high unemployment across much of continental Europe could weaken the resolve of governments to confront organised labour. Last October the French government withdrew a pre-privatisation, cost-cutting plan at loss-making Air France in the face of an industrial dispute that caused chaos. Some equity strategists are suggesting that job losses of about 10 per cent across the Continent will be needed to match the rationalisations necessary for productivity gains shown by privatised companies in Britain. But some of the assets preparing to float do not have great scope for such gains. This is because they are run along commercial lines already - for example, Elf Aquitaine and the third tranche in Spain's Argentaria bank. *Cable &amp; Wireless, Amersham International, Britoil, ABP, Enterprise Oil, Jaguar, BT, British Gas, BA, Rolls-Royce and BAA.  ------------------------------------------- FORTHCOMING EUROPEAN PRIVATISATION ISSUES  ------------------------------------------- Country     Company           Sector  ------------------------------------------- France      Elf Aquitaine     Energy/Oil             Credit Local      Banking             AGF               Insurance             UAP               Insurance  ------------------------------------------- Italy       IMI               Banking             BCI               Banking             INA               Insurance  ------------------------------------------- Spain       Repsol            Energy             ENDESA            Utilities             Ence              Forest Prods             Telefonica        Telecomm  -------------------------------------------</p>

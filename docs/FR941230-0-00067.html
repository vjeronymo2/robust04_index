Review Under Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' because none of the listed criteria apply to this action. Consequently, this action was not submitted to OMB for review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule codifies the existing procedures for application of CAA section 308 and imposes no new impacts on large or small entities. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analyses has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An Information Collection document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1714.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA Mail Code 2136, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for this collection of information would be a one-time burden for each petitioner. The burden was estimated on the basis of the number of hours needed to complete a single petition, along with the associated cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Completing a petition was estimated to require 21 hours at a cost of $1482. This includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering materials supporting the patent license, identifying other interested parties, and composition of a statement of facts upon which the petition is based. EPA received no comments regarding this information collection requirement. ICR No. 1714.01 was approved by OMB, Control Number 2060&hyph;0307, on October 3, 1994. Unless renewed, ICR No. 1714.01 will expire on October 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 95  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Inventions and patents, Patent licensing, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 23, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

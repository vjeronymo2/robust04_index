			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (9): Eyes on foreign customers - Swiss banks believe the industry is over-competitive SWISS bankers have still not quite got over the audacity of the big US banks in making a business out of the provision of custodian services. From the Swiss point of view, custodian service has always been one of many functions carried out by bankers in looking after their customers' portfolios. And they, as bankers to the world's rich, had been doing it for decades before the Americans put a name on it and in the 1970s turned it into a profit centre. In fact, Swiss bankers acknowledge US banks were also responding to a new trend in investment - the desire of large investment institutions to hedge their risks by investing a portion of their assets in foreign securities. Perhaps their pique is related to the fact that they did not see the opportunity first. 'We were awakened only after the US banks did it,' Mr Ernst Balsiger, executive vice-president of Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), admits. Now their view is that the business, which for a while was highly profitable for a few banks, has become over-competitive. 'It is simply ridiculous,' says Mr Burkhard Gutzeit, head of securities operations and global custody at Credit Suisse in Zurich. 'This business is not profitable unless you are dealing in the billions of dollars, and the institutions are pressuring us to cut prices further.' The Swiss say that margins are becoming too thin to justify the investment required in the necessary electronic control and information systems. 'You have to invest Dollars 100m plus if you start from scratch,' Mr Gutzeit says. 'Then you can enhance the system up to a point, but it is like with cars, there comes a point when you have to buy a new one.' He and other Swiss bankers predict that these pressures will lead to the big European clearing organisations, Euroclear and Cedel, gradually taking over the global custody business from individual banks, as only these organisations will have the volume needed to support the immense cost of electronic system development. Moreover, he predicts, the European banking community will lose its legal struggle to prevent the big investing institutions from having direct access to the clearing organisations. That means many institutions will gradually abandon their banker custodians and deal directly with the clearing organisations for settlement and custody services. The response of the Swiss banks to this outlook has been typically thorough and cautious, with a view to providing service where it makes sense to do so and keeping all options open. Fortunately for them, they all have very large private banking businesses in which custody services remain part of the total package of fund management offered to high net worth individuals. Thus, they have to build up their custody capability anyway, and this capability can then be turned into a commercial product offered to institutions and to foreign custodians seeking sub-custodians in Switzerland. All the big three banks say they are committed to the local institutional market, and, to differing degrees, are going after institutions in other countries as well. In part, their interest in seeking foreign customers appears to be a response to the competitive threat from the big US custody specialists in the Swiss market. By all accounts, these incursions are modest so far, and the Swiss are confident that they can hold their own. But UBS, among others, wants to retaliate. 'US custodians are actively penetrating the Swiss market, so we have to use the same weapons. Our marketing plan is to penetrate interesting markets in the US. Their pension funds are investing more and more overseas,' says Mr Josef Landolt, senior vice-president for securities administration. But with the exception of SBC's large operation in London, the big three have tended to scale down their custodial operations outside Switzerland in recent years, preferring to contract out to sub-custodians and clearing houses in important foreign dealing centres. Mr Landolt makes clear that UBS's priority is to serve domestic institutions, including smaller banks. The big three are also members of the European clearing systems, Credit Suisse and SBC in Euroclear and UBS in Cedel. They are also the dominant shareholders in Intersettle, a system intended to serve all Swiss banks, taking over the settlement of their international securities transactions. The Intersettle system, developed at a cost of more than SFr60m, is now being tested, and is due to go into full operation in the first quarter of 1994. Mr Gutzeit believes Intersettle will gradually take away much of the banks' Swiss-based global custodial business, but, since it is at least owned by the Swiss banks, that is better than losing custom to the European clearing systems, in his view. Mr Landolt agrees that Intersettle could take away custody business, not only from banks, but also from Euroclear and Cedel, provided it offers a competitive service. 'Personally, I feel we will not channel our total business through Intersettle. I have the strong feeling that we can continue to attract business from the institutions.' Mr Gutzeit agrees. 'It is difficult to draw the line between institutions that need back office support and those that do not. We are strategically well placed because private clients demand a system that is close to what small institutions want.' Mr Landolt suspects that the trend among large investment institutions to split their asset management related contracts among many banks may soon fade. 'We think costs are higher if these services are unbundled,' he says. For example, if one bank is only a fund manager and another handles settlement and custody, both have to keep accounts and the fund manager has to check that the custodian has done what he was told to do. Mr Landolt accepts, however, that institutional customers will continue to demand to know the cost of each element of the service they are buying. However the business evolves, the Swiss are expecting it to be difficult for the next few years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Staffan Heimerson from Vienna] </F>   [Text] A report from Bosnia tonight says that 13 Swedish  and two Norwegian UN soldiers have been held by the Serbs at a  roadblock outside Sarajevo since Sunday. The Swedes were on  their way to Tuzla when they were stopped and landmines were  placed around them.    The nightmare in the intensifying conflict in Bosnia in the  last few days has been that in retaliation for the UN calling  for help from NATO planes or in revenge for the UN losing its  neutrality and taking the Muslim side -- in the view of the  Serbs -- the Serbs will deliberately start pointing their rifles  at the UN peacekeepers. And now it has happened: 13 Swedish UN  soldiers and two Norwegians are being held prisoner for the  third day at the Koviljaca road block northeast of Sarajevo on  the normal route to the main Swedish base in Tuzla. This  information came just after 2100 from the AFP news agency and it  was later confirmed by the leaders of the battalion. According  to the same source, the Swedes are trapped behind landmines.    The Swedes were driving a convoy of six vehicles carrying  essential supplies to the Swedish bases when they were stopped  for what was called administrative reasons on Sunday afternoon.  A few hours later the first aerial attack took place which was  to force the Serbs to ease the pressure on the encircled Muslim  enclave of Gorazde. The Serbian soldiers then placed landmines  around the Swedes and their vehicles.    In the war in Bosnia, UN soldiers of all nationalities are  living dangerously, but generally they have been able to avoid  harassment or acts of war deliberately directed at them. The  situation of the Swedes, however, is not so precarious. The  leaders of the battalion are hoping to send other soldiers  tomorrow, so that the soldiers, who are virtually imprisoned,  can be replaced.</p>

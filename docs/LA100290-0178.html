			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNRULY MOB OF BHUTTO BACKERS STALLS HEARING  </P> <P> An unruly mob today broke down police barricades and stormed the courtroom  where ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was to stand trial for corruption.  </P> <P> Dozens of people, including policemen and journalists, were injured in the  stampede, apparently aimed at delaying the court proceedings until after the  Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.  </P> <P> Hundreds of police, armed with steel-tipped batons and automatic rifles stood  by, prohibited by law from using force around the Punjab High Court.  </P> <P> Bhutto, pale and visibly shaken by the outburst, waited with her lawyers and  bodyguards in a room adjacent to the courtroom.  </P> <P> After more than two hours of pandemonium, Justice Rashid Aziz Khan adjourned  the hearing until Oct. 9, the day Bhutto is to stand trial before him on  another corruption charge.  </P> <P> Police blamed Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party for the melee.  </P> <P> Her lawyers accused police commandos of triggering the violence to deliberately  discredit the former prime minister and her party. The party seems to be  gaining strength since the army-backed caretaker government resurrected the  one-judge special tribunals to try members of Bhutto's ousted government for  corruption.  </P></p>

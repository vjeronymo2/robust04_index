In a letter dated May 8, 1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the Board to review the requirements of rule G&hyph;19 on suitability of recommendations. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In September 1992, the Board published a Request for Comments on a number of customer protection issues, including the application of rule G&hyph;19 to customer transactions. After reviewing these matters, the Board decided that rule G&hyph;19 embodies the appropriate general standard for dealers in making recommendations to customers. Nevertheless, the Board recognized there was a perception that certain provisions of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended. Accordingly, at the May 1993 Board meeting, the Board approved a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G&hyph;19. The draft amendments were approved at the November 1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from William H. Heyman, Director, Division, Commission, to Christopher A. Taylor, Executive Director, MSRB (May 8, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule G&hyph;19 generally requires that, before making any recommendation to a customer, a dealer must first determine that the proposed transaction is suitable for the customer. To strengthen rule G&hyph;19, the proposed rule change eliminates two provisions from the rule which, in effect, are exceptions to this general requirement. The first such provision permits a dealer to make a recommendation when a customer refuses to provide sufficient information about himself for the dealer to determine that the recommendation is suitable for the customer. The provision states that a recommendation can go forward in this case as long as the dealer has no reasonable grounds to believe and does not believe that the recommendation is unsuitable (the ``not unsuitable'' provision). Although the Board did not conclude that this provision was the cause of customer protection problems ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , there was no evidence that dealers relied on this provision to make unsuitable recommendations), the Board believed that the provision should be deleted to avoid any ambiguities regarding a dealer's obligation to make a suitability determination. Eliminating the provision also will prevent any future use of the provision as an excuse for unsuitable recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

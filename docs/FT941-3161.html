			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: Ski heaven Turning the other cheek has gone out of fashion, even on the piste. MasterSun  - which describes itself as a Christian ski organisation  - has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that a competing Christian ski company, Westfleet Services, has allegedly been economical with number 9 of the 10 commandments. The ASA has criticised Westfleet for advertising 'all-in' ski holiday prices which actually turned out to exclude ski hire, boot hire and insurance. MasterSun also took exception to Westfleet's slogan: 'The only Christian ski organisation providing you with a snow guarantee.' MasterSun says it provides a guarantee, too. God is omnipotent, after all.</p>

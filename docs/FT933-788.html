			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Congress defections bolster Yeltsin SERIOUS DEFECTIONS from the ranks of the defiant Russian parliament emerged yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin pressed on with his attempts to dismantle the old constitutional order. The main figures on both sides in the power struggle stressed their unwillingness to compromise. Mr Yeltsin said on television that he would not agree to the so-called 'zero option', which involves allowing parliament to sit until simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections are held. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, ruled out negotiations. However, support for Mr Khasbulatov and General Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president named by parliament as acting president, is dwindling. The number of deputies remaining in the besieged parliament building, according to Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, Mr Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, was down to between 170 and 180 from the more than 600 who turned up last week to the extraordinary session of the Congress of People's Deputies. Mr Volkov said the government had appointed a team to find jobs for those deputies who left and to pay their wages. A total of 76 had already agreed to be given jobs in the president's already swollen apparatus or in the government, he added, while 114 more had agreed to discuss such a proposal. Mr Viktor Barannikov, sacked as security minister by Mr Yeltsin and reappointed to the same post by parliament last week, was also said to have defected. The official news agency Tass reported that Mr Barannikov had asked for a private session with Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, at which he asked Mr Chernomyrdin to tell Mr Yeltsin that 'I have been and remain true to him'. Mr Barannikov said he had agreed to his appointment solely to oversee a peaceful resolution to the dispute. Defections have also come among regions whose councils pronounced themselves hostile to Mr Yeltsin's banning of parliament and assumption of full presidential powers. A meeting of some 40 regional council leaders in St Petersburg on Sunday joined the growing call for simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections, but according to Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, head of the Russian parliament's Chamber of Nationalities who attended, the meeting also called on parliament to negotiate with the president. Congress, briefly convened yesterday, received his report coldly and took no decision on it. Mr Khasbulatov said later there would be no negotiations, on this issue or any other. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and an adviser to Mr Yeltsin, attended the St Petersburg meeting and hinted that a restitution of parliament might be possible, but only after agreement on elections. Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the Constitutional Court, has pressed the 'zero option' on the parliamentary leadership. Yeltsin warning, Page 2 D-Mark up on Russian calm, Page 33</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: A capital role in London life LIBERTY has always been one of London's most idiosyncratic stores. It has that inestimable quality that can neither be bought nor artificially applied  -personality. Liberty has always been a one-off, part of London's folklore. Speak to many Londoners and you will find that Liberty holds a special place in their affections. John Lewis may be cheaper and more sensible, Harvey Nichols swankier, Harrods bigger, but no other store offers that magic combination which comes from a mock Tudor building, exotic merchandise and quintessential Englishness. It is London's very own theme park. Like Earl Grey tea, it may be oriental in origin, but it is today an integral part of upper-crust life. The roots of its quirkiness lie in its remarkable history and anybody interested not only in the store as it is today but its extraordinary role in the aesthetic life of Britain will be interested in The House of Liberty, Masters of Style &amp; Decoration (published by Thames and Hudson, edited by Stephen Calloway, Pounds 28, 224 pages), which is a history of the store and the role it has played in the aesthetic life of this country. Founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1875, it started life as an emporium, the outlet for Arthur Liberty's many enthusiasms, in particular for oriental textiles. Arthur Liberty was passionately interested in the decorative arts, a great believer in style and craftsmanship and, rather like Sir Terence Conran with Habitat, determined to share his enthusiasms with the great British public. In its heyday Liberty's was at the centre of this country's aesthetic life. At the time of the Arts and Crafts movement Liberty became a major patron, commissioning and selling on the shop floor pieces by such distinguished designers as CFA Voysey, Leonard Wyburd and George Walton. It nailed its cultural colours to the mast with its declaration in favour of 'fitness for purpose and the merits of simplicity in furnishing, not . . . false taste and false luxury.' It expanded from importing exotic Eastern textiles to commissioning new ranges especially for the store and became the store that anyone with any interest in the visual arts had to visit. It would only be fair to say that while today Liberty no longer stands at the cutting edge of modern design it has retained an adept feel for changing tastes and moods. It also still manages to imbue the commercial realities of retailing with a sense of excitement. Every trip to the store is something of an adventure. Where will their buyers have been this time? Indonesia? Yucatan? The Gold Coast? As one enters the doors, a sense of excitement rises. What will one find today? It is a sad comment on the state of retailing today that that alone makes Liberty outstanding.</p>

All trading  organizations, whatever their form of ownership, are obliged, as  previously, to accept one, three, and five coupon notes,  although in future they will be withdrawn from circulation.    Official sources say inflation in Ukraine reached 70 percent  a month by the end of 1993, and the largest bank note, 100,000  karbovantsy, is worth approximately $3 at the market rate.</p>

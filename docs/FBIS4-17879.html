			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Generals" column: "The </F> Two Countries' Armies Warily Are Getting Ready to Cooperate"  under general headline: "Israel Asks Russia To Influence the  Arabs"]    [Text] Yesterday for the first time in history Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held negotiations with Israeli  Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The meeting lasted longer than  planned, and General Rabin was therefore somewhat late at the  General Staff Academy, where he gave a lecture on the Israeli  "science of victory."    The Israeli Army has long been a subject of interest to some  Russian military leaders as a possible model for organizing  future Russian armed forces. Especially the process of raising  extremely combat-efficient troops with conscripts and  reservists, the organization of a really universal military  conscription system, and other features that set the Israeli  Army apart from the U.S. Army, which for several years has been  proffered to our military as the key model to emulate.    But even more than military cooperation with the Israeli  Army, Russia is interested in the Arab arms market. Gen.  Grachev admitted the similarity of the two countries' military  doctrines and accepted in principle an invitation to go to  Israel on an official visit, although its date has not been  fixed: "The question will be considered at expert level."  Since last summer an Israeli military attache -- Colonel  Mikha'el Shtiglits (before 1972, a USSR citizen) -- has been  working in Moscow. At the same time the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry is only planning to open its attache office in  Tel Aviv. Gen. Grachev announced that "only after the attaches  have elaborated on the problem will it be possible to talk about  the prospects for military cooperation."    As a result, these talks between Generals Rabin and Grachev  were devoted mainly to discussing the general political  situation in the Middle East. A high-ranking participant in the  negotiations on the Russian side told me that "matters of  military and technical cooperation have not been discussed."</p>

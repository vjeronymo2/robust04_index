			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / People: Clear-out of RHM board Tomkins, the new owner of Ranks Hovis McDougall, has not wasted much time sorting out the wheat from the chaff in the old RHM boardroom. It has dispensed with the services of all but one member of the old RHM board. The following RHM directors have resigned: former chairman Stanley Metcalfe, 60; managing director Paul Coker, 54; finance director David Hankinson, 53; and Pat Metaxa, 60. However, Sir Peter Reynolds, 63, a former chairman, remains on the RHM board. Except for Hankinson, who only joined the board last October, the departing directors are RHM veterans. Metcalfe joined the group in 1956 as a management trainee, Metaxa in 1962 as a wheat buyer, and Coker came into the group via Cerebos which he joined in 1964. All of them had lengthy service contracts and so will be due substantial compensation for loss of office. Metcalfe, for example, has four more years of his Pounds 347,000 a year contract to run. Tomkins' Bob Muddimer, who has been in day-to-day control of RHM since just before Christmas, has been appointed RHM chairman. Apart from Tomkins' Dennis Mulhall, who is RHM's chief financial officer, the vast majority of RHM's senior managers are still running the business.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYERS HEADED FOR NFL SHOULDN'T BE HIS CONCERN  </P> <P> I found USC football Coach Larry Smith's concern regarding junior football  players leaving school for jobs in the NFL interesting. May I respectfully  suggest he need not worry about these young men, but rather he should concern  himself with the large number of scholarship football players at USC who leave  after their senior years, without degrees and without jobs?  </P> <P> RALPH H.

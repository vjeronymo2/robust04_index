			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States  Administration today expressed its regrets over Japanese Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to resign.    White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that  "President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good  working relationship."    "We regret the decision" by Hata to offer his resignation,  Myers said in a statement.    Hata announced this morning on June 25 that he and his  cabinet will resign to avoid defeat in a parliamentary vote of  no confidence.    His announcement came less than an hour before the  parliament  was scheduled to open debate on a no-confidence motion that  appeared likely to carry.    Myers said that "the United States will continue to work  closely with the Government of Japan as only allies and friends  can at a moment of political change."</p>

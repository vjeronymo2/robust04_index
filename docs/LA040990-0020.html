			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ILLUSION' WEAVES A SPELL AT LATC;  </P> <P> STAGE: TONY KUSHNER DEFTLY ADAPTS A YOUTHFUL CORNEILLE'S SATIRE AT L.A. THEATRE  CENTER.  </P> <P> What are the real powers of sorcery? To alter? To define? To transport? Tony  Kushner and Pierre Corneille before him go for all three, which is only part of  the magic in Kushner's fanciful adaptation of Corneille's "The Illusion"  ("L'Illusion Comique") that opened Saturday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> Freely adapted it is, in the best sense. For Corneille, whose later, loftier  verse plays earned him the stodgy title of Father of French Tragedy, "The  Illusion" was a mildly satirical precursor to all that -- a glitch, written  when he was only 29. Yet, even then, it was burdened by a ponderous  17th-Century neo-classical style that kept the word comique out of 20th-Century  range. Kushner's achievement is digging under all the circumlocution to salvage  an ageless and universal idea, stripping the nugget of its ornamentation and  serving it up to us lingually lucid and lean.  </P> <P> There is some colloquial indulgence in the rewritten language, but it's mostly  judicious. We're in on the joke, which never goes too far. Simply put, this is  the tale of a rigid father, Pridamant (Alan Mandell), who, stricken with  remorse for having provoked his son to flee the family home, searches out the  magician Alcandre (an androgynous Mary Woronov) in the hope that he will help  him find out what happened to the wayward boy.  </P> <P> Alcandre does, and the ironic twist of the piece is that after several false  starts, passionate re-enactments, comic delusions and confusions, the truth is  revealed and Papa finds he doesn't like it. The lighthearted ending is a  cynical but honest lesson in selective affection.  </P> <P> All the fun, however, is in getting there. "The Illusion" takes us into  territory on which theater thrives: fantasy, witchcraft, transcended place and  time, aided and abetted here by David Schweizer's astutely playful direction,  Douglas D. Smith's bewitching sets and lights (crucial to the consummation of  this piece) and costumer Marianna Elliott's whimsy.  </P> <P> The entire play happens in Alcandre's cave, a forbidding place, watched over by  Alcandre's sinister amanuensis (Tom Cayler, garbed in a black outfit that seems  lifted from some Gustave Dore illustration) and where Pridamant watches on the  sidelines while Alcandre leads him through reconstituted events in his son's  life.  </P> <P> We watch the son (Jonathan Silverman) fall in love with a woman above his  station (Lea Thompson), kill one dandified suitor (Mitchell Lichtenstein),  fight a duel with another (the inimitable John Fleck as her ostentatious  fiance), marry the girl over her father's objections and the thwartings of her  jealous maid (Karole Lynn Foreman). Truth or apparitions? We'll let you savor  the surprises of the Corneille/Kushner ending. They're worth waiting for.  </P> <P> This "Illusion" is a fascinating hybrid of fantasy and humor, with the magic  remembering that it has feet of clay. It's not "The Wizard of Oz" exactly, but  . . . Mandell is sheer pleasure as the befuddled father who has never tasted  tears but who, after we discover that he has a heart, proves to be a man of  straw after all. Woronov's Alcandre looks like some Assyrian prince, with  skullcap and gold "beard," but this is a fundamentally benevolent wizard who  just likes to keep everybody guessing.  </P> <P> It's sometimes hard to believe that Silverman as the swashbuckling son isn't  playing Eugene Jerome (the role that launched him) playing Errol Flynn. But the  contemporaneous feel of the production ultimately makes this nice Jewish  all-American quality not only acceptable but positively endearing. Thompson is  everything a spunky Juliet ought to be and Foreman everything a sassy,  double-dealing and resourceful servant ought to be.  </P> <P> Cayler's Igor-ish amanuensis is a scene-stealer. But he and the other  scene-stealer, Fleck, can't help it. Attention is mother's milk to the richly  gifted Fleck, a bilious cross between Miles Gloriosus and the Cowardly Lion in  his golden Roman breastplate, flaming red locks and clunky golden boots.  </P> <P> His dazzle rivals Smith's setting, which is dominated by an ornamental gilt  frame whose ever-changing canvases (here's to the magic of rear projection)  range from dreamy classical landscapes to modern images -- none more poetic or  impressive than the last, which points to our quest for new worlds in space. It  is an inspired signature for a wise piece of work that never forgets to play as  it instructs.  </P> <P>  At 514 S. Spring St. Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays  and Sundays at 2, until May 27; $22-$26; (213) 627-5599.  </P> <P> </P></p>

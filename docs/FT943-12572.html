			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Slow end to air chaos forecast Air traffic controllers in Aix-en-Provence warned yesterday that service to and across the Mediterranean would only return to normal some time this morning after their three-day strike climaxed yesterday, a peak day for people ending as well as starting their holidays. A spokesman for the striking controllers said the average delay on flights from northern Europe to the Mediterranean was five hours. But some holiday-makers were worse hit, with 5,000 forced to spend Saturday night camped at the airport of Palma in Majorca, and with services to the island of Corsica also severely disrupted. Aix-en-Provence, one of France's five control centres, normally handles 2,400 flights a day. Its 11 controllers have been refusing to do overtime since July 11, and on Friday started a three-day strike, though they are required by law to provide a minimum service, allowing 50 per cent of flights through. But Nice airport said yesterday only 40 per cent of its scheduled flights were operating. The Aix controllers are demanding 26 more staff, shorter working hours and better pay. Despite rules that a controller should not have to guide more than 12 flights at a time, Aix controllers claim they are having to deal with more than 20.</p>

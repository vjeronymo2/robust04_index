			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy There is something perverse about an equity market which reacts positively to bad economic news in the belief that interest rates are bound to fall. There is no disguising the disappointment in yesterday's unemployment and industrial output figures. A particular blow is the accelerating rate of unemployment growth, but to conclude that this will lead to an early cut in interest rates looks like wishful thinking. Apart from anything else, a speedy cut would look like a gesture of desperation on the part of the authorities. The government does have some grounds for arguing that the latest figures do not provide a complete picture. The industrial output data are two months old and reflect a period when manufacturers were deeply gloomy. Yesterday's Chambers of Commerce survey was by no means so down-beat, particularly on exports. Weekly figures for cash in circulation suggest M0 has been growing quite strongly in January. It would be in character for the government to defer any interest rate cut until it has seen how January price rises affect the underlying inflation rate, especially since the December outturn of 3.7 per cent was on the high side. Least impressive of all is the notion that a rate cut might be on the way to help make next week's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction a success. If a rate cut is needed for that, the authorities will not stand much of a chance with the 1993-94 borrowing requirement. A rate cut around the budget would both offset the effect of any fiscal tightening and help get the funding programme under way. The intervening period may well prove frustrating, both for the economy and for financial markets.</p>

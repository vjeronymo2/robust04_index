			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Modesty could mean success: Kevin Brown assesses the triple election trial facing the UK government Midterm by-elections are always difficult, even for governments not mired in real or imagined scandal. But the Eastleigh poll, following the death of Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan, matters more than most for UK prime minister Mr John Major: it will be accompanied - probably on May 5 - by elections for two Labour-held Commons seats and thousands of local government seats and, in June, for 84 Taken together, the various elections amount to a three-part referendum on the government's standing - the biggest electoral test for the Conservatives since Mr Major pulled off an unexpected victory in the 1992 general election. Officially, only the parliamentary elections will be fought on national issues. A variety of local issues is already emerging in the council elections, and the Maastricht treaty will be central to the European campaign. But the results will be analysed with a single criterion in mind: can the Conservatives recover enough ground over the next three years to win another general election, or are they in so much trouble that only a change of leader can save them? It will not be a clean fight. The focus of Labour's campaign is allegations of 'Tory sleaze' and incompetence, much of which arises from the recent spate of disclosures about the private lives of Conservative MPs. Senior Tories accuse Labour of running a smear campaign. Conservative officials have already released details of seven alleged Labour smears; they threaten to publish further details from a 'lies file' held at Central Office. Both main parties allege policy differences between Liberal Democrat candidates in various parts of the country, and point to the party's disciplinary problems in east London, where members have been accused of racism. While the parties agree the campaign is likely to be dirty, a fog of disinformation is obscuring the battlefield as the campaign strategists play down their parties' chances. First, Eastleigh. The government is expected to try to minimise the impact of the by-election by holding it on the same day as the local elections. Conservative officials have little hope of holding the seat, which would fall to the Liberal Democrats on a swing of 11.6 per cent - much less than the swing they achieved in the Christchurch and Newbury by-elections last year. The Liberal Democrat leadership is playing down its chances on the grounds that its relatively thin resources will be stretched by the local and European campaigns. But it remains favourite to take the seat. Paradoxically, Labour has given the government a glimmer of hope by opting for a high-profile campaign, directed by the team that won Mid-Staffordshire from the government in a by-election in 1990. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, reasons that the government's problems have made Eastleigh a genuine three-way marginal. He will campaign personally in the constituency, along with other shadow cabinet ministers, in sharp contrast to the party's low profile at last year's by-elections. This strategy could go wrong if a split opposition vote allows the Conservatives to hold the seat, or if Labour trails in third. If that happens, Labour will console itself with inevitable victories in by-elections at Barking and Rotherham, where it is the sitting party. Second, the local elections. Early forecasts, based on Labour's lead in most recent opinion polls of about 20 per cent, suggest the Tories could lose dozens or hundreds of seats in metropolitan authority elections all over Britain. It may not be that simple. The Conservatives did so badly at the 1990 elections, when the seats at stake were last contested, that it would be hard for them to do much worse. Indeed, Labour's public stance is that its own party will do well to hold its ground. 'I am confident that our vote will go up, but we could be in the paradoxical position of doing well but losing seats because we are fighting on the 1990 results, which were spectacularly good for us,' says Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign organiser. Labour's problem is that it already controls most big authorities where the seats are being contested. In some, such as Hull, it holds every city council seat. In others, such as Birmingham, it is defending a tiny majority achieved on a flood tide of Labour votes. One important test will be London, where Labour did relatively badly in 1990. The party is playing down expectations of gains in Westminster and Wandsworth, the two flagship Conservative authorities tainted by allegations of gerrymandering. Privately, party strategists expect gains in both boroughs. There are also hopes of outright victory in outer London boroughs, such as Croydon and Ealing, which remained loyal to the Conservatives in 1990. However, Labour could lose seats to the Liberals in the south London boroughs of Southwark - part of which is a Liberal stronghold - and Lambeth, where Labour councillors face corruption allegations. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is playing down expectations of a big breakthrough. But Liberal Democrat strategists will be disappointed if the party fails to consolidate its successes across the south in the county council elections last May. Finally, Europe. Labour took 41 per cent of the vote in the last election in 1989, when it won 45 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared with 32 for the Conservatives and one Scottish Nationalist. This time, on June 9, it expects to pick up most of the 2m votes polled by the largely defunct Green party in 1989. No one will put a figure on Labour's target, but Ms Pauline Green, leader of the party's European MPs, dismisses projections that it will win 56 to 69 of the seats at stake. She concedes only that Labour is confident of doing 'very well', and expects to win more seats, including Herefordshire and Shropshire, where Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Tory MEPs, is standing. Privately, however, party workers are less circumspect. One claimed 'there is no such thing as a safe Conservative seat', and reported a Conservative MEP lamenting that the party's delegation might soon fit into a Brussels taxi. The Liberal Democrats are playing down claims that they could win up to a dozen seats. But officials admit that they are confident of taking three or more seats in the south-west, and possibly one or two in the south. If the government's worst fears in the three elections were realised, the Conservatives could be left with less than a dozen seats in the European parliament, severe losses in the local councils, and humiliating defeat in Eastleigh. A bad result in one of the three polls would not necessarily spell the end of Mr Major's premiership. Disaster in all three might. The key, however, is what would constitute disaster. The thinking in Downing Street is that mediocre results in the elections will seem a triumph if a rout of Conservative candidates is expected. For this reason, Conservative strategists are doing little to counter media speculation of a Tory collapse. It is a strategy that infuriates Mr Straw, who accuses the Conservatives of 'laying trails suggesting they are going to do extremely badly'. But a similar approach worked well in the last comparable round of local elections in 1990, when Mr Kenneth Baker, then environment secretary, manoeuvred Labour into targeting the Tories' London strongholds of Westminster and Wandsworth. Labour polled strongly across the country, but failed to extract full benefit from its performance because it did not take the two Tory flagships. The Conservatives are laying a similar trap this year. This time, Labour thinks it has the government's measure.</p>

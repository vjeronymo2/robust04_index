Downing Street's attitude was the major obstacle to ending the  current impasse, he said. The process required flexibility and  imagination, but the comments of John Major and other Ministers  suggested those qualities were lacking in Government circles.    Mr. Adams said: "Rather than seeking to remove the  roadblocks on the road to peace, Mr. Major and his collegues  appear determined to erect more." He welcomed President  Clinton's "positive and encouraging" attitude in his St.  Patrick's Day address and the continued interest by the U.S.  Government in helping the peace process. "This administration  has clearly shown its willingness to take a fresh approach to  this conflict and the means by which it can be ended," added Mr.  Adams.    But the Sinn Fein president attacked remarks in the House of  Commons by Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew who claimed that  the Irish Republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland  was an "anachronism."    Mr. Adams asked: "What of Britain's claim of sovereignty? Is  the Government of Ireland Act not an issue? Are we to accept  that there is no dispute over sovereignty? Has Mr. Mayhew not  simply dismissed the national aspirations of Irish nationalists?  How can there be equality if our aspirations are anachronistic?"</p>

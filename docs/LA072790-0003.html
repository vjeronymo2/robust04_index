			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPENING OF LIBRARY-MUSEUM RETURNS NIXON TO LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> I suppose that I should not find it surprising that Reagan, whose  Administration was involved in everything from illegal arms deals to supporting  terrorists, is praising Nixon's record.  </P> <P> While the activities of the Nixon Administration may seem somewhat tame by  comparison, that makes them no less repugnant. Perhaps we are as a nation  forgetting what responsible leadership means to such an extent that someday the  appalling actions of Nixon will seem commonplace, and historians will indeed  praise his achievements. However, if there is any justice (or indeed morality)  in the world, it will be the moral failing of the Reagan Administration that  will be recognized, not the dubious successes of the Nixon Administration.  </P> <P> JONATHAN KAPLAN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: McInerney suspended at 9p SHARES IN McInerney Properties, the Dublin-based construction company, were suspended on the London Stock Exchange at 9p yesterday, pending clarification of its financial position. As revealed last month, the company is in talks with certain non-bank creditors regarding a rescheduling of repayments due on sums amounting to some IPounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.35m). The discussions, the company said, had taken longer than originally anticipated, although some progress had been made. However, one creditor, whose debt amounts to IPounds 250,000, had taken action against McInerney in the UK courts. Depending on the outcome of the talks, the preliminary results could be materially altered, and the future of the company remained uncertain, directors said.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Setback for Israeli bank sale THE Israeli government's faltering attempts to sell its majority shareholdings in the country's four leading banks have suffered a setback with the collapse at the weekend of an agreement to sell Bank Mizrahi to Mr Gad Ze'evi, an Israeli businessman. The collapse leaves the government without any clear strategy for the sale of the banks - the other three are Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and Israel Discount Bank - with only 10 months to go until an effective deadline for their privatisation. Any bank unsold by October 1993 will fall under direct state control under the terms of the government's rescue of the banking system following a share collapse in 1983. The state spent Dollars 7bn buying up the majority of the banks' shares, but left management with the original owners under a preferential share system. Once sold, the government's shareholdings will have equal voting rights, taking the banks back into full private ownership. But the failure to divest by next October could lead to full nationalisation, just as the government is trying to reduce the state's role in the economy. Mr Ze'evi, who already owns the small Maritime Bank, agreed earlier this year to buy a 51 per cent stake in Bank Mizrahi, previously owned by the World Mizrahi religious movement, for Dollars 185m. But the Bank of Israel and the US Federal Reserve Board, which had to approve the sale of Bank Mizrahi's US subsidiary, delayed issuing Mr Ze'evi the necessary banking permits. One dispute arose over Mr Ze'evi's intention subsequently to sell some of the holding to other investors. He demanded the Bank of Israel issue him a permit by last Friday, but it refused. The government's strategy of placing through private tenders controlling stakes in the banks appears now to be in tatters. It had already been virtually discounted for Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, the two biggest banks, because of their size. The likeliest alternative is large-scale flotations on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</p>

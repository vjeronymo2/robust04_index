			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Yeltsin plans visit to Tokyo RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin is planning to visit Tokyo in the middle of next month, in spite of the continuing turmoil in Moscow, according to Japanese government officials, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Yeltsin has cancelled Tokyo visits twice in the past year, but Japanese officials say Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated that the president will visit Japan for a 'few days' from October 12. Mr Kozyrev met Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, in New York, where the two agreed that a Russian delegation should be sent to Japan to finalise details of Mr Yeltsin's visit. Japanese officials said Mr Yeltsin apparently wants to send a signal to opponents that he is confident enough of his hold on power to make the trip. The Russian president, they said, also did not want to damage relations with Japan by cancelling again. The previous cancellations arose from a territorial dispute between Japan and Russia over the Kurile Islands at Japan's northern tip, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japanese officials said Mr Kozyrev indicated that the Kurile dispute would be discussed during the Russian president's visit. The assurances by Mr Kozyrev about the visit next month have come as a surprise to the Japanese government, which had begun to think that a postponement was inevitable, given the conflict in Moscow over the past week. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, last night rejected a plea by his government to be evacuated by the Russians from the besieged city of Sukhumi, a source close to the government said, agencies report from Tbilisi. His refusal came as Abkhazian soldiers tightened their grip on the regional capital of the breakaway region of western Georgia, which has been cut off from the rest of the country after separatists broke a seven-week-old ceasefire 11 days ago. Mr Shevardnadze's chief of staff, Mr Vazha Lortkipanidze, said although the former Soviet foreign minister had been cut off by the Abkhazians he had not yet been cornered.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> FULLERTON LOSES TITLE GAME, 2-0  </P> <P> Cami Allen pitched a four-hitter and Palomar College took advantage of a key  Fullerton error in the sixth to score both its runs en route to winning the  state community college softball championship, 2-0, Sunday at Golden West  College.  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, Fullerton's Kristin Jacobs pitched a four-hitter to hand  Palomar its first defeat of the double-elimination tournament, 2-0, and force  the second game.  </P> <P> Palomar (39-6) opened the bottom of the sixth of the second game with singles  by Christie Westerlund and Kenda Leffler. Palomar got a big break one out later  when left fielder Dena Oburn dropped a soft line drive by Allen to load the  bases.  </P> <P> Westerlund, who went to third on Oburn's error, scored on Jodi Williams'  infield out. Leffler scored on Jessica Camacho's single.  </P> <P> Fullerton (39-12) threatened against Allen (28-5) in the seventh when, with one  out, Pita Licon walked and Christy Richmond and Debbie Wagner singled to load  the bases. But Kelly Hilliard hit into a double play.  </P> <P> "I felt we could hit against them, but we made too many mistakes," said  Fullerton Coach Margo Davis, who is retiring after 31 years at the school. "You  can't let a good team off the hook the way we did today."  </P> <P> Jacobs (35-9), who had 19 consecutive scoreless innings before Palomar scored,  scattered six hits in the loss.  </P> <P> In the first game, Jacobs gave Fullerton a 1-0 lead with an RBI single in the  fourth inning. Debbie Wagner, who doubled and moved to third on Hilliard's  sacrifice to start the fifth, scored Fullerton's second run on a bunt by Kelli  Johnson.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Lawyers, criminology  experts and relatives of the 24 Taiwan tourists murdered and  robbed on Qiandao Lake are scheduled to fly to Hangzhou May 8 to  hear a mainland Chinese briefing on the crime.    Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC], said the council agreed to the mainland visit  only after the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Friday [29 April] notified its Taiwan  counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) that  foundation personnel will be permitted to visit the boat where  the murders occurred.    Victims' relatives were barred from boarding the pleasure  boat when they were in the mainland earlier this month, a move  which was seen as an attempt by the mainland to cover up details  of the crime.    Yeh quoted ARATS as saying that SEF personnel will also be  given an oral report on autopsies performed after the crime,  apparently a compromise to Taiwan's demand for a written report.    The group will include law and crime experts, Yeh said, but  she declined to say whether active-duty police officers will be  part of the entourage.    Mainland authorities have arrested three suspects in the  murders but failed to clear up some remaining questions  surrounding the case.    SEF and ARATS are authorized by their respective governments  to handle private exchanges in the absence of official contacts.</p>

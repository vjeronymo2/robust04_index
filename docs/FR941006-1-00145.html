			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency does not have data or other information specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the question of how a candy-like appearance may contribute to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential for an iron-containing supplement product to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a hazard to a young child. FDA's tentative view,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, is that it may not be possible to objectively measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA requests comments on the use of ``candy'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``colorful'' coatings on iron-containing drugs and dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements and information on whether these types of coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make iron-containing products hazardous to infants and young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children because of their apparent attractiveness. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information received presents an objective basis for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps that FDA could take to limit the appeal of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products to young children, FDA will consider action in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Forms of Iron That May Be Less Toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NAS has reported that, during the period from 1970 to 1987,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food manufacturers increased their use of elemental iron (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finely divided metallic iron) by 120-fold and decreased their use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ferrous sulfate by 30 percent (Ref. 30). The increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of elemental iron in conventional food may be attributed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its low cost and minimal reactivity in food. FDA is not aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any reports of accidental ingestions or adverse reactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the few commercially available iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplements and drug products that incorporate elemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron instead of an iron salt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three basic types of elemental iron powders are marketed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in foods. The three types are reduced iron, electrolytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron, and carbonyl iron. The term ``carbonyl'' refers to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production process, not the composition of the product. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bioavailability of these various elemental iron sources is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent primarily on their physical characteristics, which in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turn depend on the manufacturing method. For example, higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative bioavailabilities of elemental iron are obtained with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller particle sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some evidence suggests that carbonyl iron may be a useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute for the more commonly used chemical compounds of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in reducing risk of accidental iron poisonings. Data from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies in animals suggest that carbonyl iron may be only 1/100th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as toxic as ferrous sulfate in single doses, i.e., the LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (lethal dose for 50 percent of the test group) of ferrous sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is approximately 0.30 g Fe/kg (Ref. 32) and the LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for carbonyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron is approximately 30.0 g Fe/kg body weight (Ref. 31). Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbonyl iron, in comparison with ferrous sulfate, appears to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a much larger margin of safety between the level that would provide adequate iron nutrition and the level that causes acute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity. Consequently, carbonyl iron may be inherently safer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. At the same time, data from human subjects indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overall bioavailability of carbonyl iron in supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional functions of iron is about 70 percent that of ferrous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate (Ref. 31). Thus carbonyl iron is reasonably as effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in providing iron in the amounts needed to achieve the nutritive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of iron. Its use may help to reduce the risk of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning in children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA specifically requests comments on the appropriateness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elemental iron as a source of iron in drugs and dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements, focusing on whether its use in iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products would decrease the risk of pediatric poisonings while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing desirable iron nutrition to those who need iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementation. The agency is interested in receiving data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential of elemental iron for acute toxicity in humans and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly in children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA will carefully consider any information it receives on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this subject. If the information is persuasive in establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the use of elemental iron would substantially decrease the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of pediatric poisoning while allowing for effective dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron supplementation, FDA will consider exempting iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that incorporate elemental iron from any regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that result from this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

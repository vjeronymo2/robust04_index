			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYOUTS R US: DUTCH ACQUIRE FAO SCHWARZ  </P> <P> After five years of reinvigoration in the hands of a small group of investors,  FAO Schwarz, the venerable purveyor of $4,500 life-sized stuffed giraffes and  other luxury toys, said Tuesday that it had been sold to a Dutch retailing  concern.  </P> <P> The Dutch firm, NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer (KBB), declined to disclose the  purchase price. The selling group included Peter C. Morse, the chairman; Peter  L. Harris, chief executive, and other investors and executives of the toy store  who acquired it in 1985. FAO Schwarz said it expects its 1990 sales to exceed  $50 million, up from $20 million in 1984.  </P> <P> The transaction is at least the fifth sale of FAO Schwarz and the second to  European owners since the firm's founding family sold it in 1963.  </P> <P> Morse is expected to step down as chairman. But Harris and his management team  are to remain, KBB said. In an interview, Harris refused to discuss terms of  the sale. But, he said, "there would have been no reason to sell it if there  wasn't a significant profit for the investors."  </P> <P> Originally opened in Baltimore in 1862, FAO Schwarz, on Fifth Avenue, was for  decades best known for being the most prestigious toy store in New York. It now  also has a flagship store in San Francisco and 15 other outlets around the  country, including one that opened less than two weeks ago in Beverly Hills and  one in Orange County's South Coast Plaza. Additional stores are expected to  open in Chicago, Boston and, eventually, Tokyo.  </P> <P> The firm's growth stagnated in the early 1980s, and its share of the toy retail  market plummeted as it continued to concentrate on expensive luxury toys.  Customers were intimidated by the high prices, and the toy market was  increasingly dominated by mass retailers such as Toys R Us and discount outlets  such as K mart Corp.  </P> <P> But the group headed by Morse, a Philadelphia investment banker, and Harris, a  Californian who is a former president of the Gemco retail chain, broadened FAO  Schwarz's inventory to include a wider selection of lower-priced items,  redesigned the stores, re-established a mail order catalogue and moved the New  York store from its home of 50 years to roomier and more modern quarters in the  General Motors building on Fifth Avenue.  </P> <P> The store's new home featured a one-minute shopping section -- where shoppers  in a hurry could pick up already-wrapped gifts -- a hair salon for kids and  plenty of display room for lower-priced, mass-market toys such as Barbie and GI  Joe. There was room, as well, for FAO Schwarz's traditional fare -- life-sized  stuffed animals, $500 rocking horses and toy sports cars that cost more than  some real cars. The store also sought to provide an outlet for new, smaller  entrepreneurial toy makers.  </P> <P> KBB, a publicly traded company, had sales in 1989 of $1.67 billion and a profit  of $43 million. KBB said FAO Schwarz is its first acquisition in the United  States. It owns several retail chains made up of over 1,200 stores in Holland,  Germany and Belgium, including the six-store upscale chain of De Bijenkorf  department stores in Holland and M&amp;S Mode, a women's clothing retailer with  more than 200 shops.  </P> <P> Arie Maas, chairman of KBB, said in a written statement that "FAO Schwarz is  the pre-eminent retailer of fine toys in the world, and we are committed to  building on FAO's tradition of excellence." KBB said its strategy "is to  acquire highly focused chains of specialty stores."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jennifer N. Toth contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FACTS ABOUT FAO SCHWARZ  </P> <P> *Founded in 1862.  </P> <P> *Most expensive toys include a $6,000 toy Jaguar automobile for children and a  14-foot-tall stuffed giraffe, around $4,500.  </P> <P> *The store has been featured in a number of movies, recently including "Baby  Boom" with Diane Keaton and "Big," where Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia dance a  soft-shoe routine on an outsize keyboard.

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE SERVICE CUTS DRAW PROTESTS  </P> <P> Nearly 500 people jammed into the Oceanside Civic Center to protest cuts in  police and fire service, and, when the emotional meeting ended early Thursday,  the City Council still couldn't decide what to do.  </P> <P> So the council called another meeting for this afternoon in the face of  mounting criticism of the city's plan to erase an expected $5.8-million budget  deficit.  </P> <P> The budget-balancing plan, among other things, calls for laying off 95  part-time employees and not filling vacant jobs, grounding the two police  helicopters, reassigning a fire engine company and reducing beach lifeguard  service.  </P> <P> Of the 45 speakers who assailed the reductions, most spoke strongly on the  city's 5-month-old helicopter program.  </P> <P> San Luis Rey Valley resident Barbara Smith told the council: "We want our  helicopters back. I'm not sure it's a case of want or need."  </P> <P> She said the helicopters are an essential tool of emergency response in the  heavily developed valley, where traffic delays the arrival of police vehicles.  </P> <P> "That helicopter is a godsend to us in the valley," Smith said.  </P> <P> Mildred Jenkins said the helicopters make her feel more secure at night. "There  is nothing more comfortable to me than to look out my bedroom windows and see  that helicopter," she said.  </P> <P> Several law enforcement officers also urged the council to save the  helicopters, arguing that they guide and protect ground units in dangerous  encounters.  </P> <P> "Don't put a price tag on my safety," said Oceanside Police Officer Steve  Regalado. "The helicopter is a tool that can fill the gap until we hire enough  officers."  </P> <P> Other speakers opposed the fire and lifeguard cuts.  </P> <P> Mark Alderson, representing the Oceanside Firefighters Assn., said removing one  of the city's six engines from service and reassigning the crew to paramedic  duty would hurt a fire department already stretched thin by city growth.  </P> <P> "The doctrine of doing more with less has been tested in the extreme in this  case," he said.  </P> <P> An Oceanside lifeguard, Tom Buckner, noted that city beaches are a summer mecca  for North County residents, and that hundreds of rescues are made each year.  Lifeguards, he said, "deserve the same consideration as other emergency  services."  </P> <P> After hours of protest that began Wednesday night and ended Thursday morning,  the council was undecided on what action to take. Council members agreed to  meet again at 2 p.m. today to review budget priorities and determine whether  some public safety cuts would be restored.  </P> <P> "It would seem we acted in haste," Councilman Sam Williams said.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Bagley said, "I would like to take a little more time and look at  this situation."  </P> <P> The projected deficit was caused by heavy city spending -- including for the  two police helicopters -- a miscalculated beginning balance and dwindling  revenue caused by the slow housing market and the recent deployment of  thousands of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> Initially, the city staff planned to lay off 87 temporary workers and leave  jobs vacant, but that number has grown to 95.  </P></p>

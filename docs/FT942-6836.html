			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (13): Message gets across - Advisers can help with moves It has taken a long time for the business community to accept the need for specialist advice on moving. Unlike footloose America, where the relocation industry shifts small armies of staff every year, UK companies have tended to maintain a stiff independence. Relocation, like cold showers, might be good for the constitution, but it is something one does privately and in complete acceptance of inevitable discomfort. Gradually, however, the message has worked through. Since the idea was brought across the Atlantic 20 years ago, a network of more than 60 consultancies has carved itself a niche in the market, with about 150 small operations geared to the more limited task of homefinding. However, last year the Inland Revenue threw a bombshell. A Budget announcement restricted tax-free expenses to Pounds 8,000 a head - about half the true cost of moving staff. As relocation had almost ground to a halt because companies could not afford to move or were no longer being driven out of London and other cities by high rents, this final straw cut business by 30 per cent last year. Recently, the threat has been dispelled through a carefully-worded government climbdown. Consultants and employers can continue to buy homes of staff at a guaranteed price without facing tax demands. Ironically, however, last year's potential disaster could end up as the making of the sector. 'All these expenses still have to be noted on each employee's tax form,' says Mr Andrew Finney, managing director of Hambro Countrywide Relocation. 'This shifts the focus of relocation from personnel offices onto finance officers' desks and will finally make companies aware of the real costs.' That will give consultants the chance to insist they can do it cheaper. 'We are no different to any out-sourcing service,' says Mr Finney. 'Companies can move themselves. But we do it better.' Around 70,000 people are provided with full relocation support by employers each year through house purchase guarantees, bridging loans, moving expenses and resettlement counselling. Relocation specialists still handle only around around 20,000 of these, says Mr Finney. 'But there are probably 250,000 moves for employment reasons each year, so the potential is enormous.' The range of consultants is vast. The Edinburgh-based Association of Relocation Agents lists over 140 members, from sophisticated commercial agencies to one-woman offices that try to find homes for long-distance movers. Black Horse is the market leader, moving about 6,000 people when the market peaked in 1992, although this may almost have halved since activity tailed away. Hambro has just narrowed the gap by swallowing Nationwide Relocation, pushing the combined total to around 2,500 fully-supported moves and about double that number of assisted relocations. Groups such as ARC and Hamptons make up the next layer, but a much larger number of smaller operators sit between them and the home-search brigade. They claim to offer greater local knowledge, something the big agencies are trying hard to combat in the search for business. Because of the slump, new products are being added almost by the month in the effort to gain an edge. The large agencies now offer a wide range of services from guaranteed house purchase - the biggest problem during the property slump - through specialised counselling to comprehensive project planning. PHH Homequity launched a computerised property database this month to help companies decide on the right level of mortgage subsidy for employees moving to more expensive areas. But Mr Liam Robson, corporate development manager at ARC, says his group already runs a similar scheme for matching movers to a similar area, using social and economic data. Finding a standard charge is becoming more difficult as groups compete for business. PHH declines to reveal its fee scale (or the number that it moves in the UK). ARC's charges range from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 2,000 a head, depending on the type and size of contract negotiated with a company. Hambro has widened its service base to cover movers who require a less extensive service. Fees can be as low as Pounds 250 a head compared with Pounds 1,250 for the full treatment. 'Since the tax threat cut business, the industry is generally becoming more market-sensitive,' says Mr Finney. But there is still a residual resistance to bringing in consultants. Companies often underestimate the complexity and costs of group moves, but individual moves are more likely to be handled in-house. Agencies are chipping away at this barrier, however. About half the sector's business in 1992 involved career moves, according to Black Horse. Fees are perhaps the major barrier to attracting business. Companies seeking to cut costs through relocation are often reluctant to take on the expense of a consultant. The average fee for a corporate property purchase is almost Pounds 1,400, while private customers pay a Pounds 1,500 flat fee plus just over 1 per cent of the purchase price, according to the ARA. Even paying staff to move sticks in the craw of some managers. 'But there is a simple counter-argument to companies who balk at relocation subsidies,' says Mr Finney. 'They can pay the average cost of Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 to move a manager or lay out the same amount with a recruitment agency for a replacement. 'They then have the on-going costs of familiarisation, as well, and will be getting an unknown quantity rather than a manager they know.'</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'RED' AUTHOR'S NEXT BOOK WILL BE VERY GREEN  </P> <P> Writer Tom Clancy, whose best-selling thrillers have made him the author  laureate of the defense community, reportedly has sold his next novel for more  than $10 million, perhaps the most ever for a single book.  </P> <P> The Baltimore-born author, reached at his home in Calvert County, Md., would  not confirm the figure but referred to it alternately as "this absurd amount of  money" and "really, really nice."  </P> <P> His agent was less understated: "This is the deal of the century," said Robert  Gottlieb of the William Morris agency.  </P> <P> Recent published reports say that other houses have been wooing Clancy with  offers of more than $10 million for the book, Clancy's sixth, leading insiders  to speculate that Putnam-Berkley got him by agreeing to an amount in excess of  that.  </P> <P> Gottlieb hinted that the signing price was greater than other recent deals,  such as the more than $30 million Stephen King reportedly received for his next  four books and Jean Auel's rumored $25 million to $30 million for three books.  </P> <P> With the big money, though, comes big expectations, Clancy said.  </P> <P> "You have to create a -- what is the figure they're saying -- $10-million  book," Clancy said. "There is a certain degree of pressure that attaches  itself."  </P> <P> The book is due March 1, 1991, Clancy said. Putnam expects to have it on the  shelves by that summer.  </P> <P> "I'm at the fiddling around stage," Clancy said. "I have my own way of working.  I work into it gradually, then the last two, three months, I work frantically."  </P> <P> The untitled book will continue the adventures of CIA operative Jack Ryan,  doing "the usual, trying to keep the world safe," he said.  </P> <P> Astonishingly enough, Clancy published his first book, "The Hunt for Red  October," a mere six years ago. And for a mere $5,000 paid by the tiny,  Annapolis, Md.-based Naval Institute Press.  </P> <P> That book, recently made into the current hit movie, is No. 1 on The New York  Times paperback best-seller list. His most recent book, "Clear and Present  Danger," was the top seller last year at 1.6 million copies.  </P></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Bhutto and Ciller make peace plea in Sarajevo In an attempt to draw attention to the plight of Sarajevo, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, and Mrs Benazir Bhutto, her Pakistani counterpart, yesterday visited the besieged Bosnian capital. In a joint statement, they said: 'It is shocking that this appalling human tragedy is being enacted in the heart of a continent which prides itself on its commitment to human rights and respect for human dignity.' Amid heavy security, the prime ministers, dressed in bullet-proof vests and military helmets, called on 'the world community to halt the destruction of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the killing of civilians'. Mrs Bhutto denounced the violation of the very principles that Europe claimed to represent, as well as of the United Nations charter which prohibits the violent change of borders. Their visit coincides with continued reports of increased military intervention by both Serbia and Croatia, which officially deny any role in Bosnia's violent partition.</p>

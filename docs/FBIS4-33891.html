			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 13 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central American  presidents today demanded a solution to the Cuban situation  within the framework of the inter-American system, but ruled out  taking this issue before the fourth Ibero-American summit, which  will be held in Colombia tomorrow and Wednesday, or that it will  be the subject of an agreement.    At the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Costa Rica,  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said that this is a  regional stand, although there may be details that they might  not agree on. Reina said that Central America would like to see  a "democratic transition" in Cuba, but attributed the  responsibility of seeking a solution to the OAS. "It is a  problem of the (inter-American) system, and we must find a  solution to this special case," Reina pointed out when consulted  on this issue, which was not included in the final document of  the Central American meeting.    The Honduran president and Costa Rican President Jose Maria  Figueres agreed, however, that the solution of the Cuban problem  "must come from within the Cuban family." Figueres said that  now that the bipolar world is a thing of the past and the Cold  War is over "we have an obligation to assess" our foreign  relations, among others, with Cuba, a country with which Costa  Rica broke relations in the 1960's, as did most of the Latin  American countries. "In these new times we want to be sure of  what we are doing," the chief of state said. He added that all  efforts must be made to ensure that Cuba will be able to move  forward "in a peaceful manner."    The chiefs of state, however, refused to say whether they  want to reestablish relations with Cuba, request an end to the  economic blockade imposed by the United States for more than 30  years, or call for Cuba's reinstatement into the OAS, from which  it was expelled in the 1960's.    A diplomatic source that requested anonymity, however, said  that the Cuban case could bring a surprise at the Ibero-American  summit, which will take place tomorrow and Wednesday in  Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), but refused to elaborate.</p>

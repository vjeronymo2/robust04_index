			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- The government on  Saturday carried out a regular reshuffle of senior Army and Air  Force officers featuring the appointment of Lt. Gen. Chang Song,  superintendent of the military academy, as commander of the  Korea-U.S. Combined Forces [CFC].    Chang, who will get his fourth star upon assuming his new  post, succeeds Gen. Kim Chae-chang as CFC commander.    Kim and five lt. and maj. generals were relieved of their  duties apparently for their past affiliation with Hana-hoe, a  private Army organization whose members monopolized key military  posts under the regimes of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.    The five sacked Hana-hoe generals included Pyo Sun-pae and  Kim Kil-pu, both corps commanders.    The shake-up also resulted in Maj. Gen. Yu Chong-kap, head  of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collection and security department,  being named as director of the Defense Ministry Intelligence  Agency and Lt. Gen. Choe Tong-hwan, vice Air Force chief of  staff, as director of strategy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    Those named to take over the duties of the dismissed corps  commanders were Maj. Gen. Kwak Tong-to, Army deputy chief of  staff for personnel, and Maj. Gen. Kim sok-won, Army deputy  chief of staff for operations.    In another step, Maj. Gens. Kim Hyon-su and Kil Yong-chol,  both division commanders who were former Hana-hoe members, were  relieved of their duties while another Hana-hoe general, Brig.  Gen. Min Pyong-kuk, a deputy corps commander, was somehow  promoted to maj. general and named as a division commander.    It has been learned that Gen. Kim Chae-chang and seven  Hana-hoe lieutenant generals relieved of their duties Saturday  will be placed on reserve status soon.</p>

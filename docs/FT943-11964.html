			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (5): The 'little by little' approach - James Harding looks at the risks and rewards of privatisation Privatisation reveals the paradox at the heart of Tunisian economic policy. In a country where the unemployed are feared as potential supporters of Islamic extremism, the risk is that privatisation could swell those numbers through the spread of private sector practices to former state-owned industries. But on the other hand, privatisation offers a dynamic stimulus to Tunisian prosperity and is seen officially as the most effective way to dampen the appeal of religious fanaticism. Commitment to economic liberalisation has been so tempered by a fear of social dislocation that the privatisation programme in Tunisia has been, as one western diplomat put it, 'excessively moderate in pace'. The banks, the bourse and foreign investors, which wait for the government to give a boost to this nascent market, privately wonder if vested interests in the administration also slow the pace. Forty-three companies have been privatised so far for TD176m. Sales of hotels account for half this figure, followed by mechanical industries, food processing and textiles. Most of the companies so far privatised are said to be no longer losing money and have shed little labour. Ministers insist that receipts from privatisation are not earmarked to cover the budget deficit; hence they see no need for what they consider as 'grand gestures' such as the public announcement of long lists of companies up for sale. Nevertheless, at least partial sell-offs are rumoured for state companies in the chemicals, cement, phosphates, shipping and refinery industries. Speculation about the sale of a stake in Tunis Air, the state carrier, has been rife since the government delayed a decision following what it felt was an unfavourable auditor's evaluation. Opinion is divided as to whether the state will choose the now apparently profitable and domestically well-known airline to spearhead the next round of sell-offs, or whether it will continue piecemeal privatisation which does not threaten adverse publicity. The financial infrastructure for more substantial divestment by the state is being put in place. Legislation to establish an independent stock exchange and securities watchdog is currently before the chamber of deputies and is expected to take effect from September. Traders on the bourse, on which 20 stocks are listed today in comparison with 11 in 1990, believe privatisation will encourage private sector companies to seek a quotation. A significant expansion in the volume of stocks would confirm claims, based on the growth of market capitalisation from Dollars 0.8bn in 1993 to Dollars 1.6bn in 1994, that Tunisia is an emerging market. Mr Ahmed Hadouej, president of the bourse, estimates that there are 200 companies in a position to consider coming to the market, even if many would be on a preferential share basis. Corporate tax rates of 35 per cent, tax-free dividends and avoidable capital gains tax mean that there is no substantial disincentive for private owners to meet the transparency requirements for the stock exchange. However, until privatisation boosts market liquidity, stockholder capital injection does not outweigh the advantages of individual control. Investment fund managers, a growing breed in Tunisia, also wait for the privatisation fillip. According to Mr Hadouej, there is now Dollars 300m in 15 open-ended funds and Dollars 300m in 65 closed-ended funds investing primarily in bonds, government bonds and treasury bills. For international investors, however, critical mass requires a weightier body of equities. On September 1, Tunisie Leasing, a local fund manager, and Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, will launch Tuninvest, the first fund for foreign investors aimed solely at Tunisia. Representatives of the fund predict an annual return of as much as 20 per cent based on bourse trading and equity stake purchases. Their only concern is an over-supply of capital which neither the small Tunisian exchange nor large companies reluctant to float would be able to absorb. Those eager to invest but anxious about the slowness of privatisation are encouraged by Mr Mustapha Nabli, minister for planning and regional development, to consider investment opportunities in infrastructure. The management of the 150km highway from Tunis to Sousse as a toll road requires Dollars 30m investment from a private company. Government plans to extend the network with a further 300km of motorway construction offer an investment opportunity of Dollars 600m over the next five to six years. Following the success of land reclamation from the northern inland lake in Tunis, the government will be seeking investors for reclamation of land around the southern lake and in Taparora in Sfax. Both projects will be open to private, foreign investors and, according to Mr Nabli, 'any formula is being considered'. This warm welcome for infrastructural investment contrasts with the cautious tone on privatisation. Mr Nabli, along with Mr Nouri Zorgati, finance minister, and Mr Mohamed Ghannouchi, minister for international co-operation and foreign investment, are thought to be keen supporters of economic liberalisation. Nevertheless, 'petit a petit' (little by little), which is anyway the favoured phrase of Tunisian officialdom, is nowhere repeated more frequently than in conversations about privatisation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    Foreign investments (in Dollars m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           1990     1991     1992     1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Energy sector              53      143      322      643* Tourist sector             16       11       29       35 Financial sector            1        8       10       12 Manufacturing              33       24       53       33 Total                     103      186      414      736  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Most of this figure is accounted for by investment in the British Gas offshore gas field at Miskar and the doubling of the capacity of the Algeria-Italy gas pipeline Source: Ministry of International Co-operation, Tunis  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

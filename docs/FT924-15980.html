			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Observer: Promiscuous program Thank heaven Sidney and Beatrice Webb didn't live to see it. After all, besides founding the London School of Economics, the prim Fabian couple returned from Stalin's Moscow in the 1930s extolling Soviet communism for eradicating 'spooning in the parks'. So they'd be appalled by the doings of the 4,000 folk inhabiting LSE's Lifemod computer simulation model - a population invented by the school's researchers in order to analyse the impact of tax and social security on UK incomes. Take Mr 62 for a start. Having had two children with Mrs 3678 who has now left him to marry Mr 1083, he has shacked up with Ms 2858, a single mum with two children and a third on the way. From the timing of her kids' arrival, it looks as though the caddish 62 was philandering with her beforehand. Another marriage that has fallen apart around two children is the one between Mrs 2072 and Mr 254, who had seemed so contented during their 11 years together. Even so, he has found solace with Miss 3454, a 42-year-old spinster, and they show every sign of being settled for life. Meanwhile his ex-wife, evidently something of a raver, has had another child in her early 40s without bothering to marry the father. What's worse is that such irregular goings-on are apparently essential if the model is to simulate the real behaviour of a typical group of 2,000 men and 2,000 women; 'assortative mating' is the researchers' term for it. But at least Lifemod's lascivious denizens don't live long enough to get a telegram from the Queen. Whatever their efforts to survive, they're killed off automatically at 96.</p>

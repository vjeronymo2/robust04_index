			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Union leaders 'support end to block vote' SIX out of 10 union leaders would support abolition of the union block vote at Labour party conferences, according to a survey disclosed yest-erday. The results will hearten party members who want a fundamental reappraisal of Labour's links with the unions. Until now senior union leaders have expressed caution about the depth of reforms due to be implemented by next year's Labour conference. The survey in New Statesman and Society magazine also indicated that eight out of 10 union leaders would support the introduction of a one-member-one-vote system for the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. Three quarters would back one-member-one-vote for the election of the Labour leader. The magazine pointed out that support for abolition of the block vote does not translate into backing for the abolition of party-union links. One of the respondents in the survey who backed abolition added: 'We need a reputable link mechanism before abolition.' One possible solution - the automatic conversion of members of unions which pay a political levy to Labour into individual party members - was backed by three out of 10 union leaders. But some respondents argued strongly that union members wishing to become party members should pay the full individual membership fee. In a series of questions on how union leaders rate shadow cabinet members, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, came first above Mr John Smith, party leader. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, was third and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, fourth. In last year's poll Mr Smith came first. The New Statesman said it seemed that the Labour leader had already begun to exhaust his honeymoon period. Questionnaires were sent to 100 union leaders and 36 were completed.

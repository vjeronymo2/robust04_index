			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Ludmila Semenyaka - Ballet Watching Ludmila Semenyaka we see Russian classical dancing at its grandest, purest. We are in the presence of a ballerina and one without peer in this country. On Saturday afternoon at the Coliseum, Semenyaka appeared in what I felt was the lost cause of English National Ballet's derisory Cinderella. By the beauty of her style - true in means, felicitous in utterance - she turned the dross of her role into gold. It was a prodigious exposition of those qualities for which the seasoned ballet-goer hopes against hope - and so often despairs of finding: exquisite training matched with expressive sensibility. It is one of the especial merits of the Petersburg/Moscow training system that it can shape artists to respond to the most searching demands of the academic dance. Schooling inculcates a physical response to every action that is both harmonious and noble in scale. Talent within the company is nurtured through constant guidance and coaching from former ballerinas, whose wisdom is itself a repository of generations of experience and perceptions about roles and steps. Semenyaka has been the pupil of certain of the greatest dancers of this century: Marina Semyonova, Galina Ulanova, Natalya Dudinskaya. Her art has an impeccable lineage, part of a vital performance tradition that can be traced in direct line to the illustrious ballerinas of the Petersburg Ballet in the 19th century. And it honours this ancestry at every moment - in the way steps are presented, in the aristocratic ideals that inform every gesture, every least motion. There results, as Saturday afternoon's audience happily discovered, a radiant authority that can transcend miserable choreography. Ben Stevenson's dances were opened out by Semenyaka's ideal physique and no less ideal classic sensibility. Simple, quiet, sure in outline and most divinely light, her dancing showed the steps as jewels rather than as the paste they so unutterbly are. It is was an interpretation that told us about Cinderella - down-trodden, trusting, then ecstatic at the ball - in terms of movement serenely spacious, pristine. Semenyaka found interest in moments that had passed for nothing at Thursday night's premiere. Cinderella, trying to save her mother's portrait, was suddenly a tragic figure; her slow reverence to the Prince at the ball spoke of all the wonder we hope to see in this touching scene. Not even the turgid final duet, when Cinderella is burdened with one of the most unflattering dresses ever laid on a balletic heroine, could defeat her, though the lumpen choreography had a good try. It was a radiant interpretation, and some reward for the past six months in which Semenyaka seems to have had her light hidden under ENB's bushel. Tim Almaas was an honourable and attentive partner for her, and gave credibility to a cardboard Prince. The surrounding performances were not to be recommended. Ludmila Semenyaka is scheduled to appear in ENB's Cinderella at the Festival Hall on July 29 and August 1 (evening)</p>

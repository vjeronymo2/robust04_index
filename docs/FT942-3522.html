			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nat Semi poised for growth after record year National Semiconductor reported record sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and the full year to May 29. The Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer has completed a three-year restructuring plan and is poised for growth, it said. Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 82.4m, or 63 cents a share before preferred dividends, on sales of Dollars 609m. This compares with net income of Dollars 46.2m, or 35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 558m last year. After payment of preferred share dividends, earnings per common share were 58 cents, against 33 cents last year. For the full year, National reported record net income of Dollars 264m, or Dollars 2.02 a share, more than double fiscal 1993's Dollars 130.3m, or 98 cents. After preferred dividends, earnings per share were Dollars 1.87 (preferred dividends were not applicable in fiscal 1993). Sales for the year were Dollars 2.3bn, up from Dollars 2.0bn. Increased sales and earnings reflect 'continuing progress in realigning our product mix, particularly in our analog and mixed-signal businesses,' said Mr Gil Amelio, president and chief executive. About 37 per cent of National's business is in analog chips, which process 'real world' signals such as sound, rather than the digital signals of the computer world. 'Strong market conditions throughout the industry also helped drive profitability over the fiscal year,' said Mr Amelio. During the year, the company completed the consolidation of its manufacturing operations, which began in 1992, and invested Dollars 271m in new facilities. 'We entered our new fiscal year with a strong (order) backlog, and as a result we foresee a milder seasonal dip in billings than normally experienced in the summer months,' said Mr Amelio. 'We expect to see continued improvement in gross margin throughout the year as we continue to focus on our recently defined strategic market segments, utilising our technologies for moving and shaping information,' he added.</p>

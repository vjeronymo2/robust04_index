			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POOR ISLANDERS LOOK TO EUROPE TO ASSIST IN MODERNIZATION;  </P> <P> AZORES HOPE TO CATCH WAVE OF PROSPERITY  </P> <P> Silt has built up in the harbor where whaling fleets once anchored. On shore,  factories stand derelict. Only a few tourists sip coffee at the Moby Dick Cafe  or wander around in the whaling museum.  </P> <P> Since the international whaling ban in 1983, things have been looking bleak for  Lajes do Pico and almost all the 250,000 people living in the Azores, the  Atlantic archipelago about 740 miles west of mainland Portugal.  </P> <P> But as a Portuguese possession, the Azores now are part of the European  Economic Community, headquartered in far-off Brussels, and that has rekindled  hopes for modernization and a return of some of the prosperity of old.  </P> <P> Even so, Azoreans are in a struggle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Among Europe's Poorest  </P> <P> With a per capita gross national product of $1,286 in 1985, they rank among the  poorest people in Europe, trailing Portugal, with $2,160, and Greece, with  $3,280. About 28% of islanders work the land.  </P> <P> "All through history, we've concentrated on one product -- wheat, then oranges,  now dairy products. And that's left us very open to crisis," said Carlos  Cordeiro, history lecturer at the Azores University on Sao Miguel, the largest  of the nine Azores islands.  </P> <P> Portugal's entry into the EEC in 1986 brought a new source of money. According  to government figures, EEC funds will increase from $41 million in the previous  three-year period to $511 million, or a quarter of the Azorean budget, for  1989-1992.  </P> <P> The U.S. Air Force base at Lajes on Terceira, the island in the middle, was  once a source of vital income for the islands and provided jobs for about 1,500  Azoreans.  </P> <P> But revenue from the U.S.-Portuguese base agreement is becoming less  significant as EEC assistance rises.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tourism, Farming Priorities  </P> <P> And Regional President Joao Bosco Mota Amaral has set his priorities: modernize  agriculture and fisheries and promote tourism.  </P> <P> Across the water from Pico, the capital of Faial island, Horta, is already  booming. Boat crews record their visits with graffiti on the docks, and private  yachtsmen pack Pete's Bar, ordering drinks in French, English, German and  Spanish.  </P> <P> Maria da Graca Sousa, director of two luxury hotels on Faial and Pico, said the  Azores will offer 3,000 beds by next year but cannot rely on tourism alone.  </P> <P> "The destiny of the Azores in tourism is not cheap," she said. "It costs a lot  to get here and it's a very specific market -- nature, walking and water  sports."  </P> <P> Profitable alternatives are hard to find, however.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sectors in Crisis'  </P> <P> "Nearly all our main sectors are in crisis. Meat and milk are products already  in surplus in the EEC," said Mario Fortuna, a leading Azorean economist.  </P> <P> After more than a year of negotiations, EEC officials recently authorized the  islands to set up a duty-free manufacturing zone on Santa Maria, the  easternmost of the Azores.  </P> <P> Under the plan, companies can operate tax-free through the year 2011, and the  government plans incentives for potential shareholders.  </P> <P> "We're hoping to attract manufacturers -- electronics, pharmaceuticals,  plastics -- all light and cheap to transport," said Fortuna, who is chairman of  the free-zone administration board.  </P> <P> "It was difficult to persuade the EEC to make an exception just when it's  trying to standardize countries for 1992," he said. "But if (the Azores) had to  use the same rules as regions in the heart of Europe, that would be unfair  competition -- exactly what the EEC's against."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costly Transport  </P> <P> The high cost of transporting goods and supplies to the Azores is a chief  problem, and island shopkeepers charge about 15% more for wares than stores on  the European mainland.  </P> <P> The Portuguese government in Lisbon plans to move about 140 air traffic  controllers responsible for mid-Atlantic operations from Santa Maria Island to  the mainland by 1990. That will mean a loss of purchasing power on the island  of 5,000 people and turn its main community, Vilo do Porto, into another Lajes  do Pico.  </P> <P> "Many shopkeepers here say they'll close their doors when the controllers  leave. They're not optimistic that foreigners will want to come and set up  business here," said Luis Pereira of the commercial radio station in Vilo do  Porto.  </P> <P> Because of their isolation, Azoreans are superstitious and religious on one  hand and open to travel, adventure and foreign ideas on the other. The latter  is a main theme of the novel "O Barco e O Sonho" ("The Boat and the Dream") by  the Azorean writer Manuel Ferreira.  </P> <P> Recently turned into a popular Portuguese television series, the novel tells of  two Azoreans who build a tiny sailboat to cross the Atlantic in search of a new  life.  </P> <P> They see the America of the 1950s as "a marvelous world over the sea . . . its  flag -- a shower of stars and dollars."  </P> <P> Emigration has always been a safety valve against poverty, famine and  unemployment on the Azores.  </P> <P> Between 1960 and 1980, about 160,000 Azoreans emigrated, mainly for the United  States and Canada. Today emigrants and their descendants in North America  number about a million -- four times as many as live on the islands.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe has spoken in support of including volunteers in the  Bundeswehr. Professional associations should be set up to  represent a high proportion of volunteers alongside professional  soldiers, Ruehe said in Hamburg this evening. He referred to  Denmark, where brigades with 5,000 volunteers were already in  existence for international missions.    Ruehe stressed that the Bundeswehr had to become more  "differentiated" to be deployed in a more versatile way. Belief  in an army that carries out only one mission is outmoded in view  of the changed international situation. Ruehe said it was  "nonsense" to talk of the danger of a two-class army. Every  section of the armed forces must receive the equipment and  structure needed for its task. The defense of Germany and the  Alliance would however remain the main mission of the Bundeswehr.    Ruehe spoke in favor of entering into a dialogue with Russia  and the other CIS states on nuclear security and the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons as soon as possible. He was  confident that there would be an enlarged membership of NATO  within the framework of the Partnership for Peace by the year  2000.</p>

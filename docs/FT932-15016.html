			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Bonds: Norway exploits good name with ambitious DM1.5bn issue NORWAY launched an ambitious DM1.5bn bond issue yesterday at a yield of just 12 basis points over five-year German government bonds in the face of a falling market. But support from lead-manager Deutsche Bank helped to keep the spread at its launch level by the close, despite widening at one point in the afternoon. Norway, with a AA1/AAA rating, has traditionally been one of the best-regarded names in the German market, according to one banker involved in the deal. But he added this may not have been enough to justify such a tight spread for a large transaction. The bonds were launched at an indicated yield spread of 12 to 14 basis points over the Bobl series 105, and were priced at the tight end in the morning. As the government market fell with the meagre cut in the German repo rate, the spread widened to 14 or more basis points at one stage. But, according to Deutsche, this was because brokers were failing to update prices on their screens as the market moved. Two Pounds 300m five-year deals from Japanese electricity companies came as expected, though they met different initial responses. With so much paper due, Kansai Electric Power benefited from being launched first, with SG Warburg and BZW as joint lead managers. The bonds had a yield spread of 47 basis points over gilts - wider than expected - and were reported to have sold well in the Far East and continental Europe. The issue moved in line with the gilts market, which fell by half a point on signs of strengthening in the UK economy. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) followed with its own Pounds 300m, five-year transaction, but at a spread of 40 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998. The pricing difference reflected Tepco's stronger credit standing. Tepco has a triple-A rating from both main US agencies, compared with the sole triple-A from Moody's for Kansai. And, as Japan's largest electricity company, Tepco has stronger name recognition among retail investors. But, coming after the Kansai issue and against a background of rumours that a gilt auction in the five to 10-year maturity range would be announced at the end of this week, the Tepco bonds found less support. During the day, the yield spread on the bonds - Pounds 200m of which were underwritten by lead-manager CSFB - widened to about 45 basis points, eradicating much of the difference with Kansai. Given the traditional pricing differential between the two companies in the bond markets, however, the gap was thought likely to widen again over time. With five-year sterling swap spreads at just under 50 basis points yesterday, both issuers are thought to have swapped into floating rate dollars at just over Libor, after taking fees into account. The Tepco swap was handled by Sakura Bank, while Kansai's involved BZW. The proceeds of both deals were then swapped into fixed-rate yen.</p>

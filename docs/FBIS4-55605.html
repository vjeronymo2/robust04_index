			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "D.S.": "Finance Ministry Proposes Shares in </F> Return for New Bonds"]    [Text] Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and  finance minister, has announced that he will initiate new  proposals for special State Treasury bonds, which would be  indexed on the basis of an indicator of industrial prices and  that people will be able to exchange for shares in enterprises  subject to capital privatization. Such instruments should make  the offer of sales of enterprises, banks, and insurance  institutions being privatized more attractive.    According to Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, the operation should  contribute to decreasing the level of public debt: "We cannot  tolerate a situation where, as a result of the transformation  process, the state will be left without any assets and with a  huge public debt," Kolodko stated. At this stage of the  initiative, the Finance Ministry refuses to reveal details of  the introduction of this new instrument. Dariusz Kostyrka,  deputy director of the Public Debt Department at the ministry  only reported that the ministry prepares plans for new bond  issues every year, after the Budget Law is adopted. This year,  there are plans for the following: a one-year issue in June (a  prospectus has already been signed), the continuation of  previously issued bonds (one is a two-year issue and the other a  five-year one), and a three-year issue scheduled for August.    The Securities Commission [KPW] has noted with satisfaction  the announcement of introducing yet another debt instrument.  However, according to KPW Press Spokesman Jacek Jonak, before  issuing such bonds, the ministry should consider whether all of  the commitments arising out of the second issue have been  implemented in accordance with what had been announced. The KPW  noted that, despite the creation of a legal framework (an  ordinance issued by the finance minister in 1989), there are  problems with exchanging bonds for shares. The legal provisions  provide that people can pay for State Treasury-owned shares with  bonds at a 20-percent discount in relation to the bonds' face  value plus interest payments.    Civil Rights Spokesman Tadeusz Zielinski has addressed the  finance minister and asked him to undertake decisive measures to  make the implementation of such operations possible. According  to Zielinski, the situation undermines citizens' confidence in  the state apparatus. "It is outrageous that, throughout the  four years, no proceedings were ever worked out that would  enable citizens to implement their claims on the basis of bond  ownership," Zielinski stated.</p>

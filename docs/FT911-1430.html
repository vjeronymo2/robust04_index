			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: American buys TWA UK routes JETS belonging to American Airlines, the large US carrier, will start flying out of London's Heathrow airport on July 1, after last-ditch opposition to its London route sale deal with Trans World Airlines, the heavily-indebted carrier, proved ineffective yesterday. American won approval last month from the US Department of Transportation for the purchase of TWA's three main London routes, although TWA was not permitted to sell American three less significant routes. Late on Thursday night, the Texas-based carrier also sealed an agreement with Mr Icahn, TWA's owner, over the purchase price and closed the deal yesterday. It will pay Dollars 445m for the three routes - the price it had originally proposed for the six-route sale. Mr Icahn appears to have had the whip-hand in the latest round of negotiations, with American anxious to gain entry into Heathrow by the peak summer season and to shut out any rival deal. The remaining obstacle to the TWA-American transaction came from TWA unions, together with the City of St Louis, the carrier's main operating base. These parties asked the aviation authorities to delay the route transfer until the courts could hear an appeal against the DoT decision. Yesterday afternoon, however, the Transportation Department denied the motion. TWA, meanwhile, has yet to reach agreement with some of its noteholders, having missed certain interest payments two months ago. The noteholders have a right to repossess at least 10 aircraft and some additional jet engines as a result of the default. Mr Icahn said he would be meeting unions, St Louis representatives, and debtholders in 'the next several days to discuss TWA's future'.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN TREASURE  </P> <P> I attended a performance of the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra June 23 at the  Biltmore Bowl in the Biltmore Hotel. It was a wonderful evening of musical  entertainment.  </P> <P> The orchestra, conducted by Carlo Spiga, played several distinctive selections,  and delightful singer/TV star Ann Jillian performed during the second half of  the program. I was lucky enough to be made aware of this orchestra through a  friend; The Times seems to seldom mention it.  </P> <P> It seems to me that Los Angeles has the population and potential to achieve the  equivalency of the Boston Pops right here. If more people knew about the Los  Angeles Pops Orchestra, I'm sure they would rather attend the concerts in  person instead of sitting home and watching the Boston Pops on TV!

Azcuenaga in L&amp;S Research Corporation, File No. 912&hyph;3004 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely to be false for maturing women than for users generally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18259 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

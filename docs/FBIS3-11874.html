What happened with the speech by Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus? In Colombia, we are interested  in learning the reaction. What happened?    [Alarcon] We are reporters, not diplomats; so we have to say  the speech by the Nicaraguan foreign minister was rude.    [Reporter] Nicaraguan or Costa Rican?    [Alarcon] Pardon me, Costa Rican.    [Reporter] Niehaus.    [Alarcon] Mr. Niehaus. Pardon me.    [Reporter] That is fine.    [Alarcon] The speech was rude and arrogant. It was  prompted, perhaps, by the agony of defeat. He called those  countries colonies of an imperialist, namely, the United States.  He said the best thing would be for the United States to  handpick the new OAS secretary general. He withdrew irately  from the hall, where the session continues.    The Argentine foreign minister spoke next to ask the  assembly  not to pay attention to the Costa Rican foreign minister's  remarks, which were uttered in the agony of defeat. Those in  attendance took that advice more seriously than Niehaus'  statements.    The assembly continues. We will enter the assembly to be  close to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, to carry her first  reaction, given the fact she handled this campaign. She was  truly the architect of the campaign of Cesar Gaviria Trujillo,  who was elected the new OAS secretary general this morning.</p>

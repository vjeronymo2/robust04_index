			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station Commentary] </F>   [Text] According to the news agency of AFP, Cambodian MPs  affiliated to the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] have proposed  the elimination of Khmer Rouge [KR] from the peace process and  the closing down of their representative office in Phnom Penh.  The Cambodian People's Party occupies 51 seats of the total of  120 seats in the Cambodian Parliament. Here is our radio  editor's opinion.    The Cambodian People's Party members of parliament's  proposal  to move the Khmer Rouge representatives out of Phnom Penh was  put forth after the Khmer Rouge refused to take part in the  ceasefire during the traditional new year festival, as proposed  by Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen last week.    The MPs are now preparing the draft law on the issue to be  submitted to the coming parliament meeting in order to  officially remove the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and to  outlaw the rebellious section. Vice Premier and Minister of  Home Affairs in the Cambodian Royal Government Mr. Sar Kheng,  told AFP that King Sihanouk approved the proposal to isolate the  Khmer Rouge. The king was reportedly disappointed when the  Khmer Rouge refused to cease fire. Mr. Sar Kheng is a member of  the Executive Committee of the Cambodian People's Party.    Reality shows that the Khmer Rouge always run counter to the  Cambodian peace process. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement  on Cambodia, the faction not only refused to implement the  commitment, but always tried to undermine the process. They  refused to participate in the elections, and take part in any  solutions put forth by the Cambodian Royal Government. While  Cambodian people concentrate on national reconstruction, the  Khmer Rouge conduct repeated sabotage activities.    The world still remembers the Khmer Rouge as extremely  barbarous criminals against their own people when they were in  power in the seventies. Since the restoration of peace in  Cambodia, the faction has committed many massacres against their  own nation and Vietnamese residents in the country. The Khmer  Rouge's refusal to cease fire during the Cambodian new year  festival once again proves their war-like nature. That is why  the proposal to oust the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and  from Phnom Penh will meet the aspirations of the Cambodian  people.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Taki two As if the visage of Taki Theodoracopulos beaming atop 'Atticus' were not unsettling enough, the society gossip who has just hijacked the Sunday Times column of that name seems disturbingly shaky on his classical antecedents. 'I guess it was inevitable I become Atticus,' the Spectator magazine's High Life columnist crows. 'Of all the distinguished journalists who have been Atticus, I'm the only one who was actually born under the Attic sky of Athens.' It all depends of which Atticus one speaks. Should Taki be referring to Titus Pomponius (109-32 BC), the symmetry is sadly less than complete, this Atticus having been Roman. A scholar whose main claim to fame was publishing a collection of letters penned to him by Cicero, it was his 23-year sojourn in Athens - rather than the sky 'neath which he was born - that earned him the moniker Atticus. So how about Herodes Atticus (circa 101-177 AD), celebrated orator and writer? A member of the second Sophistic movement, 'he sought to entertain and enlighten without referring to political matters' a glance at Encyclopaedia Britannica reveals. Which would rather cramp the style of the man who yesterday laid, with such gusto, into Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou.</p>

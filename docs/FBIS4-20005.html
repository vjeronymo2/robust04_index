			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giorgio La Malfa by G.F.B. in Rome; date not </F> given: "La Malfa: With Mariotto and Amato We Will Stay in the  Center"]    [Text] Rome -- [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Giorgio La Malfa, what  is your position vis-a-vis the Berlusconi government?    [La Malfa] It is very simple: We are in the opposition.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, the Segni Pact, which  includes  yourself along with Zanone and Amato, has the Michelini and  Tremonti lines, which maintain the need for cooperation.    [La Malfa] During the election campaign, we maintained that  the two groupings on the Right and Left are full of  contradictions because of the contrasts between the various  components of the two poles. However, the Right won the  elections, and therefore the government, even though I am  convinced that they will not manage to govern.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So, there will be collaboration with  the Berlusconi government?    [La Malfa] Neither Segni, nor Amato, nor myself have any  intention of changing our minds. We are neither on the Right  nor on the Left. We are waiting and watching.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, being at the center, with the  notorious Mattarella law [on election reform], there is the risk  of disappearing.    [La Malfa] I understand someone being concerned about the  lack of government posts and wanting to go with the majority.  We have to wait for public opinion -- which voted for the Right  -- to change its mind. If the Right shows that it knows how to  govern, there is always time to change one's mind. If, on the  other hand, it does not manage to do so successfully, as we feel  will be the case, public opinion will grow weary and will turn  back toward the center, which is governed by us.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You wish. Do Segni, Amato, and Zanone  share this view?    [La Malfa] It looks to me like they are thinking along the  same lines, and that it could end up that none collaborate with  any forces of the Right. We cannot work together with a  government that includes fascists in its ranks, a Berlusconi  with the open problem of the monopoly on private TV, and a  League that has yet to make it clear what sort of federalism it  wants to impose on the country. Therefore, in the confidence  vote, as things stand, we will have to vote against. Our dream  is to found a liberal democratic party capable of bringing  together all the nondenominationalist, socialist and Catholic  forces to the right of the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS]  and to the left of the ground currently held by the government.    [IL CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do Segni and Amato agree?    [La Malfa] Amato is very close to our way of thinking, while  Segni shares my position although he is more pessimistic about  the future evolution of the PDS.</p>

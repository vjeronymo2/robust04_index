			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc Of all the candidates in France's privatisation programme, Rhone-Poulenc, which is slated to follow BNP, must crave the freedom of the private sector. The company's transformation into a pharmaceuticals giant would have been difficult to achieve without government support. Yet access to equity has become a serious headache. The FFr14bn preference shares and other quasi-equity instruments which prop up the company's balance sheet could usefully be replaced with real equity. That will doubtless be near the top of the company's agenda once privatisation is out of the way. The weight of debt cuts both ways. Ordinary shareholders are heavily geared to any cyclical recovery in profits, but interest charges and the cost of servicing preference capital will take a large slice out of profits until the upturn comes. The worry is that the downturn consistently caught Rhone-Poulenc unawares. At the time of January's partial privatisation offer  -which bought the government's direct holding down to 43 per cent - the company was anticipating profits growth this year. The 11 per cent decline in first half net profits would have been worse but for a change in depreciation policy. Cyclical recovery in chemicals is the big prize, but it is still some way off. There is also the touchy question of healthcare reform in France, which accounts for a quarter of the company's pharmaceuticals sales. While the issue is unlikely to be addressed until after privatisation, it seems too much to hope that reform will leave Rhone-Poulenc untouched.</p>

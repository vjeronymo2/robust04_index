			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Division General Mario Rene Enriquez </F> Morales, Guatemalan defense minister, by Carmen Aida Ibarra and  Jose Ruben Zamora; place and date not given]    [Text] In this interview, Defense Minister Div. Gen. Mario  Enriquez Morales criticizes the meager contribution made by  Guatemalans -- especially politicians -- to the peace process  and says that talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] might last until 1995.    He also admits that the Army has made a major effort to  balance two different issues things: tolerance of officials  involved in the political-ideological arena with the  antisubversive campaign of those officials who remain in the  mountains fighting the guerrillas.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How far is the Army willing to go  vis-a-vis  negotiations with the URNG?    [Enriquez] Our desire for peace is genuine, but that does  not  mean we will leave it up to the URNG to do whatever it wants  with the Guatemalan Army. We are willing to go as far as the  URNG did in its response to the overall proposal and as far as  the government did in its response to that proposal.    They might want to ask for things beyond that point, which  could exacerbate the situation. The constitutional president of  the Republic is our commander in chief, and it will be up to him  to set the limits for the Army. As our commander in chief, I do  not think he will set us adrift.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] To accept...to what extent? Despite the  military's claim that they are apolitical and nondeliberative,  they are doing just the opposite.    [Enriquez] That is your view because we speak to the media.  Those who speak up the most are Gen. Enriquez, Colonel Morris  Eugenio De Leon, and our spokeswoman.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] It is not only my opinion. Gen. Pineda  Carranza and Gen. Balconi Turcios, among others, have also spoke  out recently, and their public statements have triggered various  comments, one of which is that the Army has entered the  political arena and is actively participating...    [Enriquez] We are speaking up because various national  sectors and participants are inviting us to different forums.  We believe that, as part of Guatemalan society, we must attend  all these events. We cannot withdraw from that area because the  Army is being criticized by its enemies. That is why we accept  all invitations.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What concessions are you willing to make  during the negotiations?    [Enriquez] We are concerned about and interested in all the  topics on the agenda. After all, we are Guatemalan citizens  first, soldiers second.    We are concerned about what might happen if a national  constituent assembly is formed and about the changes it might  make in the Constitution. We are interested in future  developments in the agrarian situation because it could trigger  a disaster, a social turmoil...because the potential for  violence exists.    We are also concerned about the issues of Indian peoples. We  hope the efforts to polarize Guatemalan society along ethnic  lines do not succeed, because we must preserve general peace.  There are some aspects of Agreement 169 that are  unconstitutional. They must be made to fit within the  Constitution.    We are even more concerned about issues that are closely  related to the Army and which concern us directly. That is  normal. Just as the Chamber of Agriculture has great interest  in the agrarian situation, we are very concerned about the truth  commission.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Why are you concerned?    [Enriquez] How could we not be? We have not become  belligerent, but we know well that some people seek to morally  destroy the Army as an institution through accusations made by  an illegal, clandestine, and illegitimate minority.    I think it would be unfair to omit the names of those who  have been URNG militants since 1960, or those of union leaders,  university students, and all those who became involved in this.    Too many parties were involved, including countries like  Cuba, where nearly everyone received training.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Mexico...?    [Enriquez] Mexico...well, there is no reason not to mention  that country just because they are being so nice and hospitable  to us. Reality prevails there. Aren't the guerrilla commanders  in Mexico. Do they not give refuge to the guerrillas? Did the  refugees not go there? Didn't the CPR [Communities of Resistant  People] go there when we entered Ixcan? It is a sanctuary for  subversion.    The URNG wants the commission to have some specific tasks;  for example, they want them to have judicial functions. In that  case its purpose would not be reconciliatory because it would  open wounds that have already healed. It would be a commission  of revenge.    Anyone who focuses on revenge keeps his own wounds open. The  URNG's wounds are undoubtedly still open because it did not gain  power and would like to destroy those who opposed their reaching  it; in this case, the Army.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] You have said that you will be tolerant in  the negotiations. Do you think it will do any good?    [Enriquez] I don't think it will do any good, but many think  it will. I would like to find someone who could convince me,  because I have said -- maybe too intensely -- that a truth  commission will not reconcile us.    I will say it again. Whether or not this commission is  authorized, I will say it today and always: It will not  reconcile us. There is international proof that will not  reconcile us.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Give us an example.    [Enriquez] What happened in Argentina? The Painted Faces  appeared and there was a serious confrontation. They were  killing each other in El Salvador. If general amnesty had not  been declared three days later, who knows what would have  happened...    With all those precedents, why are we going to get involved  in this? We do not fear the commission or the truth. We have  told them that we fear the truth that "you, who are clandestine  and illegal, want to apply against the Army."    In the case of the truth commission, we have a ceiling and a  floor. You can be fully assured that the ceiling does not  include our military personnel putting their heads in the main  plaza to have them cut off.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Your position that all sectors be tried,  including nations, could hinder an agreement, clarifications  could become unrealistic.    [Enriquez] It would be more unrealistic if all sectors were  not included.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But the armed conflict was between the  Army  and the rebels...    [Enriquez] That is what some believe: The Army and the  guerrillas were involved, no one else. That is untrue. It  cannot be. There were many actors here...Let everything come  out in the open.    Unions and political parties have been infiltrated. Donaldo  Alvarez Ruiz and Valiente Tellez were not soldiers. I am  certain there were death squads that were not created by the  military, either. So it is not just the Army and the URNG. It  is not just Guatemala. Mexico, Cuba, Russia, and Nicaragua were  involved. Isn't that where the arsenals came from?    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the nations that supported the  Army...?    [Enriquez] That's the bad part, no one helped us. We were  left alone, they wanted to finish us off once and for all.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How will the officers react if the  government accepts a commission such as that wanted by the URNG?    [Enriquez] I think the officers will not be pleased at all.  I  like to respond directly, which is why I say they will not be  satisfied. We are not willing to go to our deaths like little  lambs to the slaughter. We prefer to die fighting. We have  told the URNG this.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] One can perceive opposing attitudes in the  armed institution. On the one hand, you are playing in the  political arena with open and tolerant policies, while on the  other hand, the officers and soldiers are fighting the  guerrillas in the conflict areas with counter-subversive polices  because they remain in the area of confrontation. How can the  positions be reconciled?    [Enriquez] You are right. We learned this from the URNG.  They have a local and international attitude and yet another  attitude for their combatants. If we do not get smart, they are  going to beat us.    The soldier is trained to fight. The second lieutenant, the  lieutenant, the captain, and the major are trained to fight.  Meanwhile, the lieutenant colonel, the colonel, and the general  have to be prepared to work in the political-ideological arena,  not in the party aspect, to defend the Army.    We have always said that militarily we are superior, but  politically the URNG is ahead of us.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What specifically are you doing to  reconcile both viewpoints and attitudes?    [Enriquez] We are doing a lot in the Army. It is a lot of  work because we know that a military and political effort must  be made to consolidate peace in Guatemala.    Each officer and soldier knows that we have opened our arms  to peace, but they also know that as long as there is an armed  conflict, we must fulfill our constitutional duty to effectively  combat subversion.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How have officers in the conflict areas  reacted to the withdrawal of detachments from the resettlement  areas and to the orders that they must treat the displaced and  returning refugees as brothers when they have always seen them  as guerrillas?    [Enriquez] That shows you how the Army has changed, because  the message has reached all levels. The officers agree with  what is happening. You cannot imagine how the commander talked  to all those people when the soldiers withdrew from Tercer  Pueblo after so many years, so many dead and wounded, and so  many harassment attacks.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But if there are two viewpoints or  attitudes and no institutional position, there might be concern  that someone could suddenly come out and say there is dissension  in the ranks.    [Enriquez] I do not know if there is dissension in the  ranks.  A lieutenant in Playa Grande told me in front of 52 officers:  "General, I am very sorry we have left Tercer Pueblo." He spoke  to me about our dead and wounded and how we were giving up by  withdrawing from Tercer Pueblo.    I replied: "You are right. As a lieutenant, that is how you  must think, and I congratulate you. I am also sorry, but we  have to open our arms to peace, to those who return, and to the  CPR so we can begin walking on the path to peace. But that is  the way a military man must think," I told him.    A candle must not be so close that it burns the saint's  statue but not so far away that it doesn't illuminate it. They  were given the urban area of Tercer Pueblo, but we were left on  the outskirts, because that was the agreement and because  constitutionally we can be there.    We removed the Cuarto Pueblo detachment from where it was  because the CPR were very close, 1,200 meters away, and we  placed it at the border with Mexico. Now they say we have them  surrounded because we are in Mayaland, Monaco, Xalbal...but  that's life.    Nevertheless, I can assure you that our position is unified.  It is the same for everyone. It is one of opening, even though  the desire to fight must continue to exist among our people  until all of this ends.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do the changes in the Army also include  cleaning up the institution, as you recently told the media?    [Enriquez] I told the media and I also told the officers  that  I want the Army to take a bath with the best soap. I also told  them that it would be "an external bath, because I cannot go  into your consciences."    Nevertheless, I warned them that "you will pay for any error  that you individually or any group of you commits and that  compromises the armed institution. The law will be enforced.  Let us hope it falls with greatest severity on those who commit  the error."    That is what we must do. We are determined. All the  commanders know this. We will not tolerate anything.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] When you spoke of a cleanup, you also said  you wanted to solve the crime against anthropologist Myrna  Mack...    [Enriquez] I believe that has already been solved.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There are still the masterminds...    [Enriquez] That is what Helen Mack says, right? If we follow  that line of thinking, all of a sudden [former President]  Vinicio Cerezo will have to go to jail because he was the  leader. I would have to go to trial if anything happens  anywhere and a soldier is to blame. That should not be so.    In this case, a person has already been tried. I do not  think  he was following orders because if he had been, he would have  said so a long time ago.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Let's talk about your views on the  agenda. What are the most important topics, and which are the  most likely to be sticking points?    [Enriquez] The truth commission is important, but that issue  is now separate from human rights. The most important issues  are the strengthening of civilian power, the role of the  military in a democracy, and the land issue. I think the land  issue will be a difficult one.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the constitutional reforms  being discussed at the negotiating table?    [Enriquez] That is the third most important issue. We have  tried to probe a little into the changes they are seeking  because the URNG says the Constitution is antisubversive.    They may want to make many changes, and of course they are  not going to have a large enough presence at the national  constituent assembly to make them. That could pose a serious  problem.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Could the land reform issue be a part of  the agreements, or would it have to discussed at the constituent  assembly?    [Enriquez] This must be dealt with constitutionally because  private property is expressly recognized in the Constitution.  Furthermore, the talks are between the government and the URNG,  which means the legislative and judicial branches have no say in  the negotiations.    The only thing the government can do with its legislative  powers is promote action in that direction. It cannot offer or  guarantee that this or that will be done, because approval or  rejection of any reform falls under the authority of other  branches of government.    The URNG wants to change the Constitution, including the  Army's mission. Apparently they want to remove the clause on  domestic security, so the final decision belongs to the  constituent assembly, not the executive branch.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Would the next issue be the Indians?    [Enriquez] We focus a lot of attention on that issue because  it is a significant problem in our society. It is easily  exploited by those who are talented at making the best of  contradictions.    While it is true that the indigenous communities in our  country have lived -- or have been forced to live -- apart from  the rest of society, I do not believe it is part of a policy  promoted by the government or the Coordinating Committee for  Agricultural, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations  [CACIF]. What worries us is the fact that they have become  quite ideological.    These are the most important issues. Once we manage to  overcome the military issue and the other more difficult  matters, once I hear the URNG say "cease fire," then I can say  we are going to attain peace.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion of the behavior of  all the other sectors of our community regarding the peace  process?    [Enriquez] As of just recently, I would say it has primarily  been indifference. It was as if the people really believed that  the only two players were the guerrillas and the Army, like you  said before, and that everything would end when they decided to  stop fighting. Period. That is really not the way it is.    I find that they have become more aware and now realize that  the subversive attacks were directed at the government and the  system in Guatemala with the objective of completely changing  everything. They know now that the Army, as the nation's armed  force and legitimate defender of the Guatemalan State, was  obliged to fight them. That is precisely what we have done. We  have carried out our mission, and we are determined to  accomplish it.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion about the political  sector?    [Enriquez] The only thing I can say about the political  sector is that I hope the parties grow stronger and, as rightful  institutions, they meet the people's expectations for the coming  elections.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do you mean growing stronger in their  present form?    [Enriquez] When I say grow stronger, I mean I hope the  members choose their leaders wisely. If they do, they will not  have to regret it later and say that their leaders did not meet  the expectations they created.    Now there are elections for deputies, and the general  elections are almost here. The people must think carefully  about who they will vote for. If they do not, we are going to  see the same problems all over again and it will be the voters'  fault alone. We do not vote.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What can you say about the politicians'  participation in the peace process?    [Enriquez] Their contribution is almost imperceptible.  There were representatives from the political parties when the  talks began, but they gradually disappeared. Lately the  politicians have said nothing about peace or a cease fire. The  media has been bolder in writing about these issues.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There is light at the end of the tunnel  now  that the Human Rights Agreement has been signed. Many feel it  is the beginning of peace. Objectively speaking, how realistic  is it to hope for peace in the next few months?    [Enriquez] I do see light at the end of the tunnel; so much  so that I, as defense minister, would dare express my honest  enthusiasm and delight about the Human Rights Agreements.    The agreements not only bring international verification,  which is a firm step toward peace, but they also include a  statement by the government and the URNG of their willingness to  attain peace in December, before the end of the year.    If there is no political willingness, however, it is logical  to conclude that the talks will grind to a halt. That is also  true. Nevertheless, I do not believe that any further delay  would benefit anyone, not even the URNG.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Based on what you believe will happen, not  on what you would like to see, would you venture to say that a  peace agreement will be signed in December?    [Enriquez] If you ask me what I would like to see, then I  say yes, I hope peace can be signed in December or earlier. If  you ask me what I think will happen, I would have to say that  when I was overly optimistic in the past, I was disappointed. I  would rather not be so optimistic this time. I think the peace  talks could go on into part of next year.    [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Where could the stalemate arise?    [Enriquez] Practically everything is behind schedule. They  were supposed to start talking about the displaced persons on 8  May, but they have postponed that until 21 or 24 May. There you  have a fortnight already, and they will surely postpone other  issues.    I am sure they will encounter obstacles on some issues. I  only wish it were a matter of saying: "This is as far as we can  go." Then they could go on the record as saying that the URNG  wants this or that and the government wants that and the other.  But that is not the way it works. They prefer to go on  fighting over each issue.</p>

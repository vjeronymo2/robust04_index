			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER BED TO THE RESCUE AS OCCUPANTS FLEE HOME  </P> <P> A water bed extinguished a fire and probably saved a man's home from burning,  fire officials said.  </P> <P> An electrical short in a small oscillating fan started a fire Thursday in the  bedroom of a mobile home owned by Ken Lloyd, fire officials said. Lloyd and  three other occupants were sleeping in another room when they were awakened by  a smoke alarm, and they fled.  </P> <P> The fire spread to the water bed, causing it to rupture and douse the blaze,  said Lt. Gary Pipes of the Arlington Fire Department. He said the fire caused  an estimated $5,000 in damage.  </P> <P> "It's fair to say the fire would have been more substantial," Pipes said.  </P></p>

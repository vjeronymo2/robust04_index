			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> John Huston's dazzling Prizzi's Honor (ABC Sunday at 8 p.m.) is like "The  Maltese Falcon" set in Brooklyn and done as an Italian opera; it's a  resoundingly comic love story with sobering underpinnings. Jack Nicholson is a  raffish Mafia hit man caught between the sultry Kathleen Turner and the  aggressive Anjelica Huston. One of Huston's very best.  </P> <P> Rancho Deluxe (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is that offbeat, under-appreciated  1975 comedy-Western starring Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston as a pair of  contemporary, small-time rustlers.  </P> <P> Director Fred Schepisi and writer-star Steve Martin's Roxanne (CBS Sunday at 9  p.m.) updates "Cyrano de Bergerac" with much humor, charm and poignancy; Daryl  Hannah is a delight in the title role.  </P> <P> Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (NBC Sunday at  9 p.m.) is a TV movie repeat that finds Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner trying to  foil an assassination attempt at the "Russian/American Unity Games."  </P> <P> Although the 1984 Teachers (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) suffers from awkward  shifts between satire and slapstick and the intensely earnest and  heart-tugging, it does cut to the core of classroom malaise. Directed by Arthur  Hiller, the film is held together by the all-out performance by Nick Nolte as a  weary but still conscientious social-studies teacher.  </P> <P> From Here to Eternity (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is Fred Zinnemann's 1953  classic from the James Jones novel about military life in Honolulu. Burt  Lancaster stars.  </P> <P> Cannery Row (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is another instance when Nick Nolte  is better than the film, a loving and gentle adaptation of the John Steinbeck  novel which plays well but lacks punch. Nolte, however, is a splendid Doc,  strong yet kindly, lonely but determined to be his own man.  </P> <P> Reckless (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) afforded Aidan Quinn a flashy 1984  film debut in that year's Brando-Dean role as a surly, inarticulate but  vulnerable rebel in a bleak Pennsylvania steel town. Quinn and local rich girl  Daryl Hannah work up a steamy romance but the film is essentially fantasy.  </P> <P> Margot Kidder was never better than in Donald Shebib's warm and funny 1981  Heartaches (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) as a gaudy, man-crazy peroxide  blonde factory worker. Holding their own, however, are co-stars Annie Potts and  Robert Carradine.  </P> <P> Don Coscarelli's Phantasm (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a thoroughly scary  experience that centers on two young brothers menaced by a creepy undertaker.  </P> <P> In the chilling The Entity (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), Barbara Hershey is  outstanding as an already struggling single parent caught in a battle between  psychiatrists and parapsychologists over the true nature of a mysterious evil  force besieging her.  </P> <P> Dog Day Afternoon (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), one of director Sidney Lumet's  best, stars Al Pacino as a bombastic, none-too-bright loser desperate to  finance a sex-change operation for his lover (Chris Sarandon).  </P> <P> Although little known, Robert M. Young's Alambrista! (Channel 28 Friday at  11:30 p.m.), a raw, unforgettable account of the plight of a Mexican illegal  alien, is one of the key American films of the past 15 years.  </P> <P> Prince of the City (Channel 13 Saturday at 8 p.m.), one of Sidney Lumet's  worst, stars a miscast Treat Williams as an NYPD detective whose decision to  inform on his corrupt colleagues raises a thicket of moral issues, handled  heavily.  </P> <P> Mariette Hartley excels as the founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in the  fine 1983 TV movie M.A.D.D.: The Candy Lightner Story (Channel 7 Saturday at 9  p.m.).  </P> <P> Fernando Solanas' Tangos: The Exile of Gardel (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.)  is a sensual, bittersweet 1985 study of a group of Argentine exiles living in  Paris and rehearsing a show inspired by the haunting music of Carlos Gardel,  the legendary tango singer.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

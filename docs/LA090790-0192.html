			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOING IT ALL;  </P> <P> HEDGECOCK IS CAST IN ROLE OF TALK-SHOW HOST TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF  </P> <P> When radio listeners tuned in to KSDO Thursday morning, they heard a somewhat  breathless announcement that there shortly would be a news flash about the  California Supreme Court's decision on former Mayor Roger Hedgecock's appeal of  his 13-count felony conviction on campaign-law violations.  </P> <P> What made the announcement so unusual was the person who made it: Roger  Hedgecock, ex-mayor, radio talk-show host and namesake of The People Vs. Roger  Hedgecock.  </P> <P> As illustrated by that blurring of the line between reporting the news and  being the news, Thursday's "Roger Hedgecock Show" was unorthodox even by the  admittedly loose standards of talk-show radio.  </P> <P> Throughout the morning, Hedgecock acted as master of ceremonies for a spirited  dialogue on his case, interviewing his own attorney at length about the meaning  of the high court's decision amid accepting congratulatory calls from listeners  and fielding on-air questions from a studio full of news reporters.  </P> <P> "I was fish and fowl at the same time, and it was a pretty strange  combination," Hedgecock joked later. "I was just showing you my versatility."  </P> <P> Though the Supreme Court's ruling dominated the four-hour program, Hedgecock's  other on-air duties and normal radio talk-show fare occasionally intruded.  </P> <P> Even as he promised listeners that they would get the news about his 5-year-old  case "live -- at the same time I do," Hedgecock also was chatting with viewers  and guests on subjects as disparate as racism, voting patterns and underwater  photography. Moments before the 9:30 a.m. ruling, Hedgecock calmly noted that  it was time to take a break for "traffic, news and weather."  </P> <P> When the subsequent news bulletin reported that the Supreme Court had reversed  the 4th District Court of Appeal, without explaining precisely what that meant,  Hedgecock chuckled softly as he told listeners, "I'm probably as perplexed as  you are as to what that means."  </P> <P> Hoping to clear the confusion, Hedgecock launched into a lengthy telephone  interview with his attorney, Charles Sevilla, struggling to remain somewhat  objective about the topic.  </P> <P> "There's some confusion here in the newsroom as to what the Supreme Court  ruling actually is in my case," Hedgecock said. "It didn't strike anybody  around here as something we could understand. A lot of legal terms were used.  So we'll turn now to my legal expert, Chuck Sevilla, who joins us now on the  KSDO news line. . . . What's up, Chuck?"  </P> <P> Sevilla, who was being handed faxed pages of the court decision even as he  interpreted it for his client's listeners, told talk-show host Hedgecock what  citizen Hedgecock wanted to hear: that he had been "unconvicted" of 12 felony  perjury counts and that the remaining conspiracy count was "hanging by a  thread" pending a court hearing.  </P> <P> As Sevilla detailed the ruling, Hedgecock interrupted to remind him of plans  for an afternoon news conference -- a matter the two proceeded to discuss as  casually as two people arranging a lunch.  </P> <P> "Let's shoot for 2 (p.m.)," Hedgecock told Sevilla.  </P> <P> Calling the ruling "a pretty good victory on the road to getting this  straightened out," Hedgecock said: "My first thought was relief that we're  finally getting somewhere. From my standpoint, finally -- five years later."  </P> <P> While he predicted vindication on the remaining conspiracy count, Hedgecock  kept his characteristic cockiness in check during most of the 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.  show. One of the few moments when his temper flared came when a newspaper  reporter suggested that the ruling might be interpreted as simply an evasion of  justice due to legal technicalities.  </P> <P> "We're not talking about technicalities," Hedgecock angrily shot back.  "Directing a jury verdict is not a technicality -- it's a kangaroo court.  Tampering with the jury, pressuring the jury with booze and stories . . . is  not a technicality."  </P> <P> Then, it was time to get back to those phone-in lines to accept congratulations  and wishes of good luck from, among others, Rosie in Chula Vista, Chris and  "Dan on his car phone." Typical of most callers, Dan simply said, "I hope this  is the end of it for you."  </P> <P> By day's end, Hedgecock summarized his dual role as news maker and news  commentator as "pretty peculiar, even for me."  </P> <P> "Here's the subject of the hot, breaking news that shoved even the Middle East  aside sitting in a studio, talking about underwater photography," Hedgecock  said. "And then talking about your own case in what was virtually an on-air  news conference. It was tough to know which side of the microphone I was on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF THE LEGAL WOES OF FORMER MAYOR ROGER HEDGECOCK  </P> <P> * Feb. 9, 1984: The J. David &amp; Co. investment firm is sued by an investor  who claims that the owner, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli failed to return a $1.2  million deposit. Hedgecock friend Nancy Hoover, who was Dominelli's business  aide and girlfriend as well as a former mayor of Del Mar, provides the link for  what prosecutors alleged was a conspiracy to illegally funnel thousands of  dollars into Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign.  </P> <P> * Feb. 27, 1984: The state's Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) begins  an investigation into Hedgecock's finances.  </P> <P> * April 9, 1984: The D.A. opens a criminal investigation.  </P> <P> * May 22, 1984: District Atty. Edwin Miller files a civil suit against  Hedgecock, political consultant Tom Shepard and others, claiming the mayor and  his advisers concealed as much as $357,000 in "laundered" campaign  contributions from the now bankrupt J. David &amp; Co. and Hoover.  </P> <P> * June 5, 1984: Hedgecock wins the mayoral primary but is forced into a  November runoff.  </P> <P> * June 30, 1984: The first grand jury to look into Hedgecock's finances is  dismantled without returning an indictment.  </P> <P> * July 30, 1984: A second grand jury begins hearing the first of 82 witnesses.  </P> <P> * Sept. 19, 1984: The grand jury indicts Hedgecock, Hoover, Shepard and  Dominelli on felony conspiracy and perjury charges alleging that they schemed  to circumvent city campaign donation limits.  </P> <P> * Sept. 28, 1984: Hedgecock and three co-defendants plead not guilty to all  charges.  </P> <P> * Oct. 15, 1984: The FPPC files a $1.2 million suit against Hedgecock, Shepard,  Hoover, Dominelli, and others, citing more than 450 violations of the city's  campaign laws. The FPPC asks for for nearly $1 million in penalties from  Hedgecock alone.  </P> <P> * Nov. 6, 1984: Hedgecock overwhelmingly wins reelection and proclaims: "One  down and one to go."  </P> <P> * Nov. 15, 1984: The grand jury again indicts Hedgecock, charging him with two  more counts of perjury because he did not report a $3,000 payment from  Dominelli in Dec. 1981.  </P> <P> * Dec. 3, 1984: Opening arguments begin in the first Hedgecock trial.  </P> <P> * Jan. 22, 1985: Hedgecock takes the stand, emphatically denying he had any  knowledge of the so-called conspiracy and saying the perjury charges stemmed  from "good-faith" mistakes.  </P> <P> * Feb. 13, 1985: Jury votes 11 to 1 for conviction on all counts. Superior  Court Judge William L. Todd Jr. declares a mistrial and prosecutor Richard D.  Huffman declares that the D.A. will retry the case.  </P> <P> * Feb. 20, 1985: The D.A. files two additional felony perjury charges and a  misdemeanor conflict of interest charge against Hedgecock.  </P> <P> * Aug. 20, 1985: Opening arguments begin in the retrial.  </P> <P> * Oct. 9, 1985: Hedgecock is convicted on 13 felony conspiracy and perjury  counts.  </P> <P> * Oct. 15, 1985: A lawyer representing one of the jurors delivers to Hedgecock  atty. Oscar Goodman and Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller a letter detailing a series of  alleged incidents in which bailiff Al Burroughs Jr. purportedly talked with  jurors about the case in violation of court rules. A sworn statement by another  juror corroborated some of the details.  </P> <P> * Dec. 10, 1985: Hedgecock resigns as mayor and is sentenced to one year in  jail, shortly after a ruling by Todd that jury-tampering allegations did not  affect the Oct. 9 verdict nor did they entitle Hedgecock to a new trial.  </P> <P> * April 25, 1988: The San Diego-based 4th District Court of Appeal orders a  lower court by a 2 to 1 vote to hold a hearing on whether Hedgecock's  conviction should be overturned because of the jury-tampering allegations.  </P> <P> * Aug. 19, 1988: The California Supreme Court agrees to review Hedgecock's  conviction.  </P> <P> * June 12, 1990: After a backlog of appeals which delayed the hearing of the  case for nearly two years, the California Supreme Court listens to Hedgecock  lawyer Charles Sevilla argue that his client was deprived of a fair trial  because of judge's errors and jury tampering by a court bailiff. During the  one-hour hearing, Dep. State Atty. General Robert Foster countered that those  claims should be dismissed and Hedgecock should serve the year in County Jail  he was sentenced to.  </P> <P> * Sept. 6, 1990: By a 5-2 vote, the California Supreme Court reversed 12  perjury convictions because of faulty jury instructions by Todd. The court  ordered additional hearings on the jury tampering allegations in connection  with the conspiracy conviction. The conspiracy conviction, if upheld, could  still mean jail time for Hedgecock.  </P></p>

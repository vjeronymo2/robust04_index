			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter (2): Smaller companies put at risk by insider dealing plans Sir, The proposed UK legislation on 'insider dealing' has all the hallmarks of taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. For the objective of catching the tiny minority (1 per cent?) of sharp operators, the whole UK investment industry's future appears to be put in jeopardy at a time when the City of London is trying to become the financial centre of Europe. For nearly 50 years UK fiscal policies have favoured investment in housing rather than industry and by institutions rather than individuals. Regular deficit financing by UK governments and generally lax funding policies have led to constantly higher rates of inflation than our main industrial competitors. This in its turn has resulted in a significantly higher price for long-term capital and consequently a lower level of investment by our industry. To these existing burdens the government now apparently wishes to turn investment based upon knowledge and regular appraisal into a crime. Isn't it about time that the mandarins of Westminster and Whitehall got off our backs and out of our pockets and gave the country a chance? P G Evans, Bramley, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG26 5BP</p>

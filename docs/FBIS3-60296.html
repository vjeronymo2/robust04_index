Their dumping into the  sea was halted in response to international protest against the  disposal of a small amount in the Sea of Japan on October 17.  The authorities said that they had no other choice at that time.    Experts in the Environment Protection Ministry of Russia say  that in recent years the total amount of LNW in navy ships and  repair yards has been stable at 18,000 to 20,000 cubic meters a  year. However, as utilization of nuclear submarines continues in  the coming years, that amount is expected to increase by 20 to  30 percent by the year 2000.    Russia has just one facility which meets international  standards and is capable of neutralizing all kinds of LNW at a  rate of 22.5 cubic meters per hour. It is installed in the  Atomflot enterprise, Murmansk, and serves nuclear icebreakers.  To neutralize all the LNW of the Northern Fleet the enterprise  would need nearly 2 Bn rubles in 1994.    The Northern and Pacific Fleets have one special-purpose  tanker each which carries LNW neutralization units but their  performance does not meet international standards. The  upgrading of the units would cost nearly 3 Bn rubles.    Experts believe that if funds for these projects are made  available soon, by the end of the first quarter of 1994 the LNW  neutralization would be less of a problem and by the end of the  next year there would be no need to dump LNW in the sea.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: Pro and con the shadow budget Sir, Labour's tax proposals provoke a curious response from some of your readers. (Letters March 21 and 22). Mr Peter Brown and his Top Pay Research Group obviously do not believe in the market. Why should employers grant extra pay increases to those earning between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000 a year to compensate for the increased tax in Mr John Smith's shadow budget when Mr Brown says there are a record number of qualified staff on the dole? We won't. Mr Tyler forecasts that Mr Smith's budget will cause a collapse in those services consumed by above average earners. I shall just save less, and if instead the money is spent on consumption by the less well-off it will probably help my business. Simon Haskel, chairman, The Perrotts Group, 63a Ockendon Road, London N1 3NL</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STOLZ STILL PONDERING NEW MEXICO STATE JOB  </P> <P> Denny Stolz, former San Diego State football coach, said Wednesday night that  he was encouraged by a two-day visit to New Mexico State but likely would not  make a decision about whether to coach the team there before the end of the  weekend.  </P> <P> Stolz said talks would continue over the next few days to resolve several  issues, mainly concerning the school's financial commitment to football.  </P> <P> "It's very clear that football is very, very important to the people there,"  Stolz said after returning from a trip to campus in Las Cruces, N.M. "I was  very impressed."  </P> <P> Stolz said he was told he was the school's first choice and that it is his  understanding the job is his if he wants it. Stolz has been out of football  coaching since he was fired at SDSU last November. He was later appointed men's  golf coach.  </P> <P> New Mexico State is looking to replace Mike Knoll, who was fired Sunday after  an 0-11 season. Knoll was 4-40 in four seasons.

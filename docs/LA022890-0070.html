			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS HAD KEY ROLE IN PUSHING VOTE IN NICARAGUA, U.S. SAYS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE KREMLIN PERSUADED MANAGUA TO ABIDE BY ACCORDS CALLING FOR  ELECTION, OFFICIAL ASSERTS.  </P> <P> In the first concrete payoff in Latin America from warming U.S.-Soviet  relations, Moscow played a key role in persuading Nicaraguan President Daniel  Ortega to hold the election that swept him from office, a senior State  Department official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The official, who briefed reporters on the understanding he would not be  identified, said the Soviet Union pressed Ortega's government to abide by last  year's Central American peace accords, which called for contested elections.  </P> <P> The action came after the Bush Administration made it clear that Soviet  behavior in Central America would have an important impact on overall relations  between Washington and Moscow, the official said.  </P> <P> Washington has been alternately pressuring and cajoling Moscow concerning  Central America for the past year, he said, noting that Bernard Aronson,  assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, made his first  official trip to Moscow, not Latin America.  </P> <P> "We believe that the Soviet Union played a constructive role in encouraging the  Sandinista government to hold these elections and to hold a dialogue with the  opposition," the official said.  </P> <P> "In an unprecedented way, both sides (the United States and the Soviet Union)  have been keeping their side of the bargain, which was, from the beginning, to  use our respective influence with our respective friends in the region to try  to press the Central American peace process forward," he said.  </P> <P> He noted that just three days before Sunday's election, the Soviet Foreign  Ministry issued a statement pointedly calling attention to Sandinista promises  to abide by the outcome of the election and to relinquish power if defeated.  </P> <P> The Soviets have substantial clout in Managua because Ortega has been heavily  dependent on them for both economic and political support.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Ion Bourliai, deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Latin  American department, told a news conference that the Soviet Union is willing to  continue its economic aid to the new Nicaraguan government to be headed by  President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union said it would respect the results and today we are confirming  this position of ours," Bourliai said. "Our relations in the trade and economic  field are determined by corresponding agreements. The Soviet Union is prepared  to meet its obligations in the future if the Nicaraguan side supports this  position."  </P> <P> Moscow has been providing about $333 million annually in economic aid to  Nicaragua on a credit basis, plus 25 million tons of wheat and rice free of  charge, Bourliai said.  </P> <P> In Washington, the senior State Department official said he was "very  encouraged" by Bourliai's pledge to respect the election results. As for the  promise of continuing aid, the official said that was between Moscow and the  Chamorro government.  </P> <P> "The new government will need economic assistance badly," the official said.  "The United States will not be able to meet all of their needs by any means."  He said he assumes Chamorro "will accept aid from whatever source."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration is  determined to help Nicaragua rebuild its shattered economy. But he gave no  indication of the size of the U.S. assistance, nor did he suggest where the  government would obtain the money.  </P> <P> The senior State Department official said that no decision will be made  concerning aid to Nicaragua until U.S. officials confer with Chamorro's chief  economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga, who is scheduled to arrive in Washington  on Monday.  </P> <P> "We will develop an aid package for Nicaragua that will be significant and  meaningful," Fitzwater said. "The democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan  people deserve our support and they will have it."  </P> <P> However, other officials conceded that the election upset in Nicaragua, coming  on the heels of the overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the  ouster of dictator Manuel A. Noriega in Panama, will stretch the  Administration's $15-billion foreign aid budget to the breaking point.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said after a White House meeting with President Bush and  other congressional leaders that the Administration should establish an  "emergency democracy fund" to channel foreign aid to Nicaragua, Panama, and  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "You're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars" over a four-year to  five-year period, Nunn said. "After all, we spent trillions and trillions of  dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, defending the free world waiting for  this day, and now that we've arrived at this day, I think we should not be  shortsighted in our approach."  </P> <P> Nunn is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will help shape  the Pentagon's proposed $295-billion budget. But when asked if the democracy  fund should come out of defense appropriations, he shrugged and did not answer.  </P> <P> Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the  foreign aid program, said that money for increased aid to Eastern Europe and  Panama must come from reduced Pentagon spending. However, the Administration  has made it clear that it is reluctant to reduce military programs until it is  convinced that the current diplomatic thaw continues.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this report.  </P></p>

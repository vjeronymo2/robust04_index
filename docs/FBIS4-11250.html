			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Livia Ferrari] </F>   [Text] The foreign trade promotion program proposed by the  Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MICT) does not take  into account the international rules that were ratified in the  Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT).    In the opinion of the Association of Brazilian Exporters  (AEB), for this reason it will not be accepted by the  multilateral trade organ.    The program provides for the creation of fiscal incentive  mechanisms, which contradict the GATT Code of Subsidies. The  third article of the Code condemns the creation of foreign trade  incentives based on "export performance" [preceding two words in  English]. Despite this, the MICT project foresees that in order  to have the fiscal incentives approved, enterprises will take  minimum export commitments.    The matter was analyzed yesterday during a meeting of AEB  entrepreneurs, for whom the project must be subject to external  auditing for evaluation of specific conflicts with GATT  principles.    AEB President Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes is concerned  that the program proposed by the government -- despite the fact  that it is more generalized than the previous one (described in  Draft Bill No. 3721/93, which provided for incentives for  automobile exports only) -- will artificially create unequal  competition conditions for various industrial sectors.    Pratini de Moraes said: "The old Befiex (an export fiscal  incentive program created by Pratini de Moraes himself, when he  was minister of industry and commerce, during the Medici  administration) was a good program, and fulfilled its objective  more than 20 years ago." In his opinion, the best way to  support Brazilian foreign trade is to eliminate the tax burden  on exports.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sale of Somex equity continues THE MEXICAN government has sold nearly 82 per cent of the equity in Banco Mexicano Somex, the country's sixth largest bank, for Dollars 846m, equivalent to 29 times last year's earnings, and a record 4.63 times book value. A group of investors headed by Mr Eduardo Creel, the former Inverlat broker, and Mr Vicente Aristegui, the former Chrysler Mexico chief, paid Dollars 3.42 a share for a controlling 51 per cent at 5.2 book value. The group has the option to buy a further 30.62 per cent of Series B stock at a lower price, which would bring total revenues from the privatisation to Dollars 846m. Somex has assets of Dollars 5.38bn, and had profits last year of Dollars 36m. It has 329 branches across Mexico, less than half the number operated by Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. The bank has had difficulties with poor loans and a high proportion of subsidised (and often non-performing) mortgage loans. Until now, it has not been considered one of the most attractive banks. However, leading members of Mexico's financial community appear determined to buy a bank before it is too late, and in the ensuing competition have bid up the prices. Only six more banks remain in government hands, of which only one, Banco Internacional, has national coverage. The government hopes to have sold these banks by the middle of this year. The second and third bids for Somex were at 4.15 and 3.73 book value respectively, greater or equal to the winning bids for the four largest banks already sold.</p>

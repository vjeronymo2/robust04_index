			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australians welcome Chinese decision to cut wool tariff China is understood to have decided to reduce the tariff on Australian shorn greasy wool from 15 to 10 per cent - the second concession the country has made to the Australian wool industry in recent months. The decision has not yet been formally announced in Beijing, but is likely to be part of series of tariff measures unveiled by the Chinese government next month. However, the decision - effective from January 1 and 'in recognition of the exchange rate effects of the recent float of the Chinese currency' - has become common knowledge and was formally welcomed yesterday by the Australian trade and primary industries ministries. In November, China agreed to reduce the tariff on Australia processed wool from 20 to 15 per cent. The latest move will be subject to review in 12 months time. Yesterday, Australian government officials described the latest move as 'another step in the right direction' and said that they would press for further tariff breaks. China has become an extremely important market for the beleaguered Australian wool industry. In the first 10 months of 1992-3, the country was the largest single importer of Australian wool, with volumes rising by some 60 per cent of their equivalent levels in the previous year. Top-level discussions aimed at securing tariff reductions have been under way for several months.</p>

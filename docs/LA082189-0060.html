			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SALE TO CHINA PUSHED;  </P> <P> REP. LAGOMARSINO PRESSES STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA FIRM  </P> <P> California Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) has been urging the State  Department to let a small California company sell custom-made television  surveillance systems to China, where they could be used to keep watch on  political dissidents.  </P> <P> State Department officials say, and Lagomarsino confirms, that the congressman  recently called Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger seeking a  special waiver that would exempt the company, Quintron Systems Inc., from the  Bush Administration's recent ban on the sale of military-related equipment to  China.  </P> <P> "It strikes me as absurd to be selling something like this to China at this  point," commented one U.S. official familiar with Lagomarsino's request. "I  can't imagine anything more offensive to a large number of Americans."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Lagomarsino, a conservative Republican who is a  senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Times that he  sought to help the company because of its financial difficulties and that he  did not realize the goods involved were surveillance systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't Know What It Was'  </P> <P> "I knew it was some kind of electronic equipment, but I didn't know what it  was," Lagomarsino said.  </P> <P> "I just knew that it was an order for several million dollars (of goods) that  they (Quintron) would not be able to sell elsewhere."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino told The Times that he now plans to review the Quintron request to  see if it involves goods that should not be sent to China.  </P> <P> "It was my impression that this was low-technology equipment," he said. "It  wasn't clear to me. I'll have to take another look at it."  </P> <P> Eagleburger did not respond to requests for comment on Lagomarsino's efforts.  One U.S. official explained that Eagleburger and other State Department  officials want to avoid alienating Lagomarsino, who is the ranking Republican  on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee for Latin America.  </P> <P> However, he and other U.S. officials said that they do not believe the  exemption will be granted.  </P> <P> In the weeks after China's People's Liberation Army launched its bloody assault  on Tian An Men Square in Beijing in June, the Chinese regime began to air  selective TV footage of the activities of student protesters taken by  surveillance cameras on Beijing streets and inside buildings. The regime has  long had surveillance cameras inside foreign diplomatic compounds.  </P> <P> According to U.S. officials, the items Quintron wants to sell to China are  being identified as "television monitors with sensitive optics components such  as image intensifiers and converters." Because of the potential military use of  such equipment, its sale to China or any other Communist country requires the  approval of the State Department's Office of Munitions Control.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Bryan E. Thompson, chairman and president of Quintron  Systems, described the equipment at issue as a "surveillance television  system."  </P> <P> "Basically, what it's built for is surveillance of factories and that sort of  thing," Thompson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Made to Chinese Requirements  </P> <P> He also said that his company has custom-designed the equipment for Chinese  requirements but did not say what those requirements are. Quintron previously  has done business overseas with South Korea and Saudi Arabia, he said.  </P> <P> The Chinese enterprise to which Quintron is selling the surveillance systems is  Poly Technologies Inc. U.S. officials have identified Poly Technologies as one  of the two major Chinese trading companies that buy and sell arms for the  Chinese armed forces. The firms are controlled by Chinese military leaders, and  He Ping, president of Poly Technologies, is the son-in-law of China's paramount  leader, Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> Material submitted to the State Department lists the final user of the TV  surveillance systems as an organization called the Beijing Institute of  Information, about which little is known.  </P> <P> Thompson said he was told that Quintron's equipment will be used not by the  Chinese government but by a university or research group. Chinese universities  and research institutes are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.  </P> <P> "Those things (the surveillance systems) can be used for only one purpose,"  said one State Department official, who said that he does not believe the  request for a waiver by Lagomarsino and Quintron will be approved.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino said he began trying to help Quintron obtain a waiver from the Bush  Administration's restrictions on sales to China about three weeks ago.  </P> <P> "They asked us to help them," he said. " . . . All I know is they represented  to me that if they couldn't make the sale, they might go under."  </P> <P> Quintron Systems is a small, privately held company in Santa Maria, in  Lagomarsino's congressional district. According to Thompson, the company has  220 employees and sales of about $15 million a year.  </P> <P> Thompson said that it would be "a disaster" if his company is not permitted to  ship the surveillance cameras to China.  </P> <P> He said that Quintron has signed a $2.125-million contract to sell the  surveillance systems to China. The deal, the first the company has concluded  with Beijing, was signed long before the bloody Chinese army crackdown on  pro-democracy demonstrators last June 3-4. In response to that assault,  President Bush ordered a suspension of all U.S. military sales to China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Timing Was Bad'  </P> <P> "Our timing was bad," Thompson said mournfully. "These (Bush Administration)  sanctions hit two weeks before the commodities were to be shipped. . . .  </P> <P> "The problem is that these (surveillance) systems were custom-made to Chinese  requirements. They've been sitting on the dock since June 25, and we can't ship  them.  </P> <P> "We can't collect a penny until (the TV systems) get on board the ship,"  Thompson added. "We've borrowed money from the bank to handle the cash flow  until we can ship."  </P> <P> Both Lagomarsino and Thompson compared Quintron's request to one made earlier  by Boeing Co. Last month, the State Department granted a waiver of the Bush  Administration's sanctions to permit Boeing to sell four commercial jetliners  to China. The navigation systems for those jets have potential military uses  and therefore are on the State Department's munitions control list.  </P></p>

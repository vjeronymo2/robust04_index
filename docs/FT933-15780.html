			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Britton to pay Pounds 32m for Taco BRITTON GROUP, the packaging company formed last October after the acquisition by Firstland Group of Gelpack Industrial, is to treble its size with the takeover of Taco, a privately owned polythene maker, for Pounds 31.6m in cash and shares. Britton shares were suspended at 13 1/2 p. It is raising Pounds 33m via a Pounds 15m placing with institutions, a 1-for-1 rights issue at 10p raising Pounds 13.2m, and an intermediaries offer to raise a further Pounds 4.7m. The group recently reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.32m for 1992. Mr Simon Beart, finance director, said this was due to withdrawing from oil and gas. Gelpack has sales of Pounds 13m and operating profit of Pounds 1.4m. 'The enlarged group will be the second largest extruder of polythene film in the UK. We are now a substantial player with an ungeared balance sheet,' he said. All the company's existing shareholders, which include Mercury Asset Management with 17 per cent and Royal Insurance with 9 per cent, are taking up their rights. Mr Beart said 10 new institutions had been brought on board to widen the ownership of the enlarged group. The acquisition of Taco includes Pounds 5.4m of debt. If Taco achieves profits before tax and interest of Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 30 1994, the vendors will receive another Pounds 5.5m. In the year ended April 30 1993, Taco reported sales of Pounds 28.6m and profits before tax, interest and non-recurring costs of Pounds 4.4m. Britton's shares will be relisted on August 2 if shareholders approve the deal at an EGM on July 29.</p>

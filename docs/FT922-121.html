			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: New issues set to boost Shanghai THE fortunes of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, long seen as the laggard to its southern competitor in the Shenzhen special economic zone, are set to receive a boost in coming weeks with the largest issue in China of 'B' shares. About USDollars 400m of stock in two companies will be offered to international investors, and more is on the way. The Shanghai exchange plans to list 11 other companies shortly. 'B' shares are shares which only foreigners can own but they are afforded the same rights of ownership as 'A' shares which are reserved for Chinese nationals. Currently there is only one 'B' share company listed on the exchange, Shanghai Vacuum. This was the first company in which Beijing allowed foreigners to own stock since the communists came to power in 1949. Investors will be offered 24m 'B' shares in Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical Company, representing nearly 30 per cent of Dollars 8 a share. Shanghai Chlor-Alkali is one of the country's largest chemical companies and the issue will raise around Dollars 200m. The second large offering is for Shanghai Tyre and Rubber, China's biggest tyre manufacturer. Some 17m 'B' shared will be offered at a price of about Dollars 11.40 to raise around Dollars 200m. the leaders of the two syndicates - SBCI Asia for Shanghai Tyre and N. M. Rothschild and Smith New Court - are vying for the honour of bringing to the international market the biggest China offering. The depth of international investor interest in China is underlined by the amount of money so far raised for various 'China funds'. At the last count there were 18 funds dedicated to either direct or portfolio investment in China. Total funds raised amounted to nearly Dollars 1bn. Analysts in Hong Kong said that there was still a strong 'novelty' interest in mainland Chinese stocks. But, they added, there was also a good fundamental reason for investing in the Chinese mainland. China has the potentially the world's largest economy and, with the recent move towards faster economic reform by Beijing, it was set to grow at an increasing rate, they said. The injection of foreign capital in China's large state industries serves two purposes. It relieves the central authorities from the responsibility of funding their capital expansion and it also lowers the tax rate dramatically on the companies concerned. The Shanghai municipal government redefines a state industry as a foreign joint venture if 25 per cent or more of its capital is foreign owned. This allows the municipal taxation authorities to reduce taxes on profits from 55 per cent to 15 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Guest Commentary" by Theo Waigel, finance minister and </F> Christian Social Union chairman: "Bugging Campaign: The FDP  Must Join In"]    [Text] The apartment of the normal citizen is sacred to  all of us. However, that of the drug boss and gangster king  must not remain closed to the police. Just as in other  rule-of-law states around us, the police must be able in the  future to bug German apartments for reconnaissance purposes if  new crimes are being discussed there.    Therefore, I appeal to the delegates of the Free Democratic  Party [FDP] congress, which begins in Rostock next week, to give  a signal for the introduction of the great bugging campaign in  Germany. The population and certainly the majority of the FDP  followers expect this from their party. Therefore, I hope that  at the end of the week, the path will be free so that the police  can combat crimes even more successfully on the basis of clear  rules of the rule-of-law state, which make arbitrariness  impossible.    The past has clearly shown that, without the great bugging  campaign to gain evidence, we cannot successfully combat  international crime in the long run. Therefore, we must act  together.</p>

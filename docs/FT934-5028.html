			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Valuation rules for tax purposes to be simplified  -Oil and gas supplies Rules governing the valuation of oil and gas for tax purposes are to change. The chancellor wants the rules to reflect commercial practice more closely, while ensuring that income assessed for tax fully reflects the value of the oil or gas produced. The changes proposed are: a simpler rule for valuing gas disposed of on a non-arm's length basis; a measure to facilitate the sale of landed North Sea oil on special (CIF) terms; a reduction of 24 hours in the time allowed for nominating crude oil sales for petroleum revenue tax (PRT); an improvement to the rules allowing companies which do not trade in oil to be excluded from the PRT nomination scheme; a more flexible approach to the valuation of certain crude oil disposed of non-arm's-length. The changes apply primarily to PRT. A corresponding value will also being taken into account, where appropriate, for corporation tax and royalty purposes. When UK-produced gas is disposed of other than in a sale at arm's length - for example where it is sold by the producer to an associated marketing company - the amount of income brought into charge for PRT and corporation tax is the 'market value' of that gas. One of two statutory methods may apply for determining market value. The gas is either valued on the same monthly basis as applies for crude oil, or the producer may elect for a valuation under a long-term pricing formula in accordance with detailed rules in the existing legislation. The rules are becoming increasingly difficult to apply satisfactorily to gas disposals. A simpler rule is to apply for the valuation of light gases such as ethane and methane. The new rule will follow normal arm's-length principles and will enable the market value of gas to be determined on the basis of all the relevant factors surrounding the particular disposal. Valuations will continue to be made on a long-term basis where appropriate. The existing system of elections will cease after 31 December 1993. The PRT rules allow tax relief for the cost of transporting oil or gas only as far as the nearest reasonable place of delivery in the UK or abroad. Given these rules, arm's-length sales of landed North Sea crude by PRT-liable producers to a more distant buyer, on terms which require the seller to meet the delivery costs, are unlikely to take place since the full sale price is taxed but the additional freight and other costs are disallowed. From January 1 the PRT price of oil sold on such terms will be the price at which the oil would have been sold at the nearest reasonable place of delivery. Mr Clarke proposed a new petroleum revenue tax (PRT) option for companies with interests in North Sea oil or gas fields that have not yet recovered their costs and that have a pipeline largely intended to transport production from other fields. Companies with such field interests will be able to elect that a proportion of the pipeline expenditure be excluded from PRT relief and that in return tariffs for transport and other services be received free from PRT if they are paid by PRT-exempt new fields.</p>

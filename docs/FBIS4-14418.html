The widening of commercial and economic ties that has  begun now should become a stable tendency. Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said this at Hungarian-Russian  intergovernmental negotiations in Budapest on Thursday. The  negotiations of the delegations in an enlarged composition was  preceded by a one-on-one conversation between the Russian prime  minister and his Hungarian counterpart Peter Boross.

Positively assessing the level of  interaction between Russia and Hungary in foreign policy,  Chernomyrdin said that the ensurance of stability and  consolidation of security in Europe should become the main  tendency of that interaction.    Russia proposes the creation of an integrated European  security system on a basis of cooperation and equality regarding  the consolidation of cardinal political role of CSCE, the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as a top  priority.    During the negotiations the Russian side noted that NATO's  initiative "Partnership for Peace" had become an important step  in shaping universal European structure of military-political  cooperation.

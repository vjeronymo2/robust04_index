The Guatemalan Information and Press Department of the Army  [Dide] reports that yesterday at 0120 a gang of criminals  cowardly attacked with rifle fire and RPG-7 rocket launchers the  troops guarding communities in the area of (Mayalan),  (Ixcanche), where five soldiers were killed and three more were  seriously wounded.    This took place a few kilometers away from the last  repatriation depot, which makes apparent, the Guatemalan Army  states, the lack of resolve to reach a peaceful agreement for a  solution to the domestic armed conflict.    Dide reports the soldiers killed are Corporal Efrain  Gonzalez  Ramirez; Soldiers First Class Luciano Perez Chua and Jesus  Arturo Najera Perez; and Soldiers Second Class Valdemar  Hernandez Jimenez and Edgar Benjamin Guevara.    The Guatemalan Army is informing the local and international  public opinion of this cowardly act by URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] criminal terrorists so that the people may  judge and condemn these stateless people, identified by the  limited outlook of their criminal minds.    The Guatemalan Army bulletin adds that it deeply regrets the  death of the five soldiers who gave their lives to the  fatherland in the line of their sacred duty, and the Army  extends its sincerest condolences to family and friends, praying  for Christian resignation.</p>

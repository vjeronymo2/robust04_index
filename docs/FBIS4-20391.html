			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Guodong (2621 0948 2767), Legal Work </F> Committee of the Standing Committee, People's Representative  Committee of Minquan County, Henan Province: "Severely Combat  Feudal Superstitions Leading to the Commission of Crimes"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Feudal superstitions, a kind of  decadent ideology, had already been contained over a vast area  during the early years of New China. However, these days the  recurrence of feudal superstitions has again become in certain  areas a public menace to social security.    The Obnoxious Growth of the "Fortune-Telling  Craze." Fortune-telling, predicting the so-called "lucky or  unlucky fate" by means of planchette or palmistry, has in the  olden days been the way some people made a living. Nowadays, we  again see their footmarks almost everywhere, from Chongqing's  first avenue to in front of the Yellow-Crane Tower in Wuhan,  from the shores of Yueya Lake in Dunhuang to the roadsides on  Qingdao's Laoshan Mountain. In Shaoyang County of Hunan  Province, there is Heyecun Village with 1,900 people of whom an  astounding 13 percent make a living by fortune-telling. In  Minquan County, Henan Province, a peasant woman became mentally  deranged when divination for her came up with a bad omen. She  first killed her husband and then herself. In the Nantang  district of Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, it happened  within not quite one year that eight girls lightly believed in  the nonsense of the fortune-teller and committed suicide.    Outrages Committed by the "Witch Doctor Gang."  According to statistics, approximately 1.8 million witch doctors  operate in the various cities and villages; they pretend to be  inspired and able to control demons. They practice black magic;  they "eliminate misfortunes and heal sicknesses" for people, and  they practice quite openly. About 71 percent of them are  illiterate or semi-literate. In the countryside, 73.9 percent of  sick people ask a witch doctor to cure them, and, as a  consequence, a large number of people are harmed by them. A 59.2  percent of male witch doctors have violated women, and 10.6  percent of the witch doctors have caused the death of people. A  peasant woman in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, believed a  witch doctor when he told her that she is "bound to die on 7  July, unless she prevents the calamity by finding someone to  take her place." She thereupon poisoned the son and daughter of  a peasant. A couple in Mengjin County, Henan Province, believed  a witch doctor when he told them, "your daughter is a `star of  disaster,' a `patricidal woman,' only a show of blood can ward  off your disaster." The peasant thereupon cruelly killed his  daughter with a sickle and displayed her corpse at the street  corner.    Stirring Up Trouble With "Geomancy." In recent  years feudal clan power is raising its head in the rural areas,  and such activities as "cleansing the landscape," "identify  one's clan cemetery," and "repairing the ancestral temples" are  being taken up one after the other. In the end, every  opportunity is given the practitioners of geomancy "show off  their specialty." They not only obstruct the spread of science  and technology in the rural areas, but constantly stir up  disputes and armed clashes between neighbors, thus constituting  a hidden menace to social stability. In a certain county of  Jiangsu Province, it was due to the absurd nonsense of the  geomancer who said: "If you grow grapes in your courtyard, your  women will give birth to `grape-like monsters' [hydatids], that  the practical and useful technique of grape-growing in that  courtyard was never allowed to be spread. When the chief of the  Ma clan died in a certain Taipingxiang village, his descendants  asked in a geomancer who found a "`dragon and phoenix  propitiated" plot in the cemetery of the Li clan, which the Ma  clan forcefully occupied by mere strength of their superior  numbers, but as a result a big fight ensued, and it all ended  with one person dead and five injured.    Deceiving People With Ghost Stories Under the Pretext  of Doing "Missionary Work." China's Constitution guarantees  its citizens freedom of religious beliefs, but strictly forbids  to confuse people's minds with "religious missionary  activities," thereby sabotaging the society's production and  orderly daily life. Many kinds of religious activities that have  a strong feudal superstitious coloring are poisonous to the  extreme for the uninformed masses and are cause of great  tragedies. A villager by the name of You Shengji in Sixian  County, Anhui Province, posing as a "believer in Jesus," started  a so-called "religious training class," for the alleged purpose  of spreading the message of the Holy Bible. He loudly  proclaimed: "The spirit borrows my physical body to be married  with people, you are all wed to the spirit." This deceitful  nonsense provided him with opportunity to rape or deduce 16 of  his female followers. A peasant of Xiangcheng County, Henan  Province, a believer in the "White Robe Religion," followed the  entreaties of his daughter: "The last day is near, earlier death  is the way to paradise," and cut off her head.    Setting Themselves Up as Emperors and Kings and  Inciting to Riot. Some reactionary elements are taking  advantage of legitimate religious organizations to wantonly  conduct inflammatory counterrevolutionary propaganda. They  enlist believers, assume titles of kings and emperors, oppose  state policy and state law, and wait for an opportune moment to  unleash a rebellion. Peasant Li Chengfu and his cronies in  Fudicun Village at Funiushan Mountain [Henan Province] started a  fund drive ostensibly to rebuild the Hongchun Temple at  Laomanchang, the site of an old Tang Dynasty temple, but  actually to set up a "Wanshun [all-favorable] Heavenly Kingdom."  On the pretext of geomantic inspection, he visited six counties  and recruited soldiers, bought horses, and organized a  counterrevolutionary armed force. According to his slogan:    "Not the intercalary seventh month, but the intercalary  eighth month is right, that is when we will start our fight."    His secret plan was to start a rebellion in the intercalary  eighth month [of the lunar calendar] which will occur in 1995.  He was later punished according to law by the public security  organs. In Yongcheng county in the east of Henan Province there  was a "howler sect" [hu han pai 0729 0815 3175], a religious  organization, that called its leader "the Living Christ." They  distributed a large amount of reactionary propaganda and loudly  proclaimed they will rule all the world. Before they were  suppressed in July of 1993, they had established over 100  activity centers and had several hundred core members.    New Characteristics of Present Feudal Superstitious  Activities    The deceit was in the past carried out by the activity of  single persons, but it has now developed into the action of  organized groups. In "simultaneous operations" they recruit  followers, continuously expand their contingents, and form a  professional stratum. They also do not use only one type of  tricks, such as fortune-telling, necromancy, geomancy, but are  "experts in one thing and good at many." Their operations get  more and more comprehensive and modernized. In some places, for  instance, fortune-telling is done by means of a "computerized  fortune-telling sutra." The pattern of their activities has also  changed from the former sedentary, localized way to dashing  around to commit their crimes hither and thither. The periods of  activities have changed from the former preference for the slack  farming season to regular activities in all four seasons of the  year, and membership has changed from formerly being in the  majority older people to now a combination of old, middle-aged,  and young people.    According to the analysis of parties concerned, the  resurgence of feudal superstitions in the 1990's started in the  economically developed southeastern coastal regions. The Central  Committee of the Communist Youth League found out in an  investigation at Lufeng County in Guangdong Province that  various types of feudal superstitious activities were now being  conducted completely openly on a very widespread scale, and that  a surprisingly large number of people were working in the  production and sale of articles used for feudal superstitious  purposes. In Jieshizhen township a man called his factory  "People's Bank of the Underworld," and had over 200 persons  working especially to manufacture various kinds of articles for  feudal superstitious purposes, which he widely marketed  domestically and abroad. One item in the records of the Shanghai  Public Security Bureau said, that over 2,000 people in Shanghai  from in and around the three counties of Chongming, Chuansha,  and Jiading are specially engaged in feudal superstitious  activities. A news item broadcast in July of 1992 by the Central  Broadcasting Stations said that it was considered fashionable by  some people in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, to build during  their lifetime luxurious mausoleums for themselves, for which  the maximum expenditure had been as much as several hundred  thousand yuan.    Feudal superstition finds a market already among middle  school students. An investigation by the Youth Center of the  China Welfare Association revealed that 60 percent of the middle  school students believe that man's life is determined by fate.  They pray: May the light of Buddha shine everywhere, may a  Bodhisattva make his power felt, and are boy scouts that kneel  in prayer before Buddhist altars. One student, in the second  class of higher middle school, had on his desk the following  motto for his personal guidance: "Having not yet passed my  examination, I still need a Bodhisattva's assistance." A very  bright student in lower middle school in Anhua County, Hunan  Province, was told by the fortune-teller that he was not  destined for book studies. He thereupon secretly took 400 yuan  from home and went to a place in the southeast, as directed by  the fortune-teller, to engage in business. The result was that  after eight days he begged to be allowed home again.    There are rather serious incidents of even some party  members  and cadres participating in, supporting, and organizing feudal  superstitious activities. Somewhere in Yuzhou City, Henan  Province, some party cadres participated in temple construction  and collected money from the peasants to build an earth god  temple, a temple to the goddess, etc., for each village at least  one. A village party secretary in Fangcheng County did not call  a doctor when his wife fell sick, but determined that she was  possessed by an "evil spirit." To "suppress the evil spirit" he  went to Wudangshan Mountain [in Hubei]" and brought back a  "spirit-venerating statue" and a "treasured sword," which he  displayed in the main room of his house. On the first of every  month he also went to the village temple to burn incense and  pray to ward off the illness. Moreover, the RENMIN MINZHU BAO  reported in November of 1993: In recent years, some personnel  from a powerful organ of the National People's Congress also  began to play the "mystery chain" game [shen bi lian 4377 4434  6969].

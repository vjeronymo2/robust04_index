			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mishaps, bad luck and gaffes - Enterprise Oil's failed bid for Lasmo Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, must be wondering whether he should have consulted an astrologer as well as his merchant bank advisers, SG Warburg and Robert Fleming, before launching his hostile bid against Lasmo, its fellow explorer. Ten years ago Enterprise planned to celebrate its separation from British Gas with a July 'independence day' party. But its plans were scuppered when a hostile RTZ built up a 30 per cent stake. With hindsight it must seem to have been tempting fate to have the bid deadline coincide with another 'independence day' party planned for last night to celebrate the company's first 10 years. However, the bid was plagued from the beginning by a series of mishaps and bad luck that caused investors and analysts alike to focus as much attention upon Enterprise as its target. The initial announcement was bungled, with a series of leaks robbing Enterprise of the valuable element of surprise. It was followed by a gaffe in which Mr Hearne justified the bid by saying that oil exploration was a big boys game which required critical mass. The statement was jumped on by critics as a sign of corporate arrogance, if not personal megalomania. Last night Mr Hearne said he could not identify a single event or point at which the bid became sidetracked. But the remarks over company size clearly stuck in investor's minds. One industry figure has observed that 'unfortunately Graham Hearne has done for the phrase 'critical mass' what John Major has done for 'back to basics''. Mr Hearne yesterday put a brave face on the defeat, saying that the company would 'get on with other opportunities'. These could include the possibility of other hostile bids. 'When you have a conviction that an acquisition is in the interests of the company, you should in no sense be deterred by the process.' He also rejected the charge by Lasmo that in making the bid Enterprise effectively admitted that it had a dearth of medium-term exploration and development projects. 'There are quite a few opportunities in the pipeline,' he said. Mr Hearne doubted whether the other charges made by Lasmo, including questions about Enterprise's accounting standards and dividend policy, would come back to haunt the company. However, most analysts doubt that Enterprise will be able to go back to business as usual. Although the failed bid should have little impact on Enterprise's finances, with fees to advisers amounting to only about Pounds 5m, the company did spend Pounds 159m on acquiring the stake of almost 10 per cent in Lasmo. Mr Hearne last night described it as 'an investment, which as with all investments we will keep under review'. It was already showing a paper loss last night of about Pounds 30m. That purchase, however, has called into question how the company could have misread investor and industry sentiment so badly. Mr Hearne said the responsibility rested with him and expressed confidence that the board would continue to support him. He also denied that a management shake-up was in the offing. But Enterprise's reputation as not only the biggest, but one of the most successful, companies in the exploration and production sector has clearly been tarnished. Mr Hearne said Enterprise executives and the advisers 'worked in harmony throughout' the bid. However, there was speculation last night that there were deep divisions between the various advisers and company executives over the bid strategy, in particular the share buying scheme launched last Wednesday. Analysts last night speculated whether the blame would be laid solely on the advisers, or whether it would extend to Mr Hearne and Mr Julian West, the corporate development director who was also closely associated with the deal. It would seem likely that the board may review Mr Hearne's dual role as chairman and chief executive. All Mr Hearne would say last night was 'that is a matter for the board'. The bid has also raised questions about whether the company's past success has left it arrogant. One institution said it was the 'arrogance' of the Enterprise presentation which caused it to vote against the deal. Some investors were also struck by the poor performance of the Enterprise camp. Another institutional shareholder yesterday said that of the two competing chief executives, 'Graham Hearne appeared much more anxious. Joe Darby was much more relaxed.' Relaxation, however, was clearly at the forefront of Mr Hearne's mind last night, as he prepared to spend an 'evening dancing with the Mrs'.</p>

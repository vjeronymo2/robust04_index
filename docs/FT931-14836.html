			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt cheered by Siemens results BOURSES were mostly stronger yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT brightened on unexpectly strong results from Siemens, which posted higher 1991-92 profits and a 2 per cent gain in net for the first three months of the current year, against expectations of a 5 to 10 per cent decline. The stock rose DM5.90 to DM578.90, enhanced by short-covering. The DAX index added 7.24 to 1,523.74 as German market turnover fell from DM4.3bn to DM3.7bn. Volkswagen, which had hit DM254.40 in late trading on Wednesday, recovered to close at DM259.40, 90 pfg higher on the official session. Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities said that spending cuts announced on Wednesday were not deep enough and would not produce the savings required to make the shares attractive at this level. The speciality retailer, Douglas, rose DM15 to DM426 on a 7 per cent gain in group turnover for 1992. Allianz showed little reaction to car insurance losses, the result of car thefts, gaining DM8 at DM1,956. PARIS rallied on hopes of lower interest rates, and the CAC-40 index ended 21.01 higher at 1,803.54 in turnover of FFr2.6bn. Interest rate-sensitive stocks were in the limelight as Eurotunnel jumped FFr2.10 or 6.9 per cent to FFr32.70 in heavy volume of 3.9m shares. Paribas put on FFr16.90 or 4.8 per cent to FFr371.90 and Suez added FFr12 to FFr265. Rhone-Poulenc CIs fell FFr15 or 2.2 per cent to FFr511 as investors were disappointed to read in a French newspaper that the company expected its 1992 operating profit increase to be a little less than its previous forecast of 10 per cent. AMSTERDAM was lifted by technical trading ahead of today's expiry of futures options and the CBS Tendency Index rose 1.0 to 97.40. Nedlloyd gained 80 cents to Fl 27.30 on reports that the company's pension fund had increased its holding to over 9 per cent through the purchase of Mr Torstein Hagen's 5 per cent stake. KLM rose 90 cents to Fl 25.50 on news that it was to cooperate with JAL, the Japanese airline, on routes out of Amsterdam to Madrid and Zurich. DAF put on 20 cents to Fl 8.30 after its UK truck unit reported improved 1992 sales. MILAN ended higher ahead of the close of the account today, on continued expectations that the cabinet would approve fiscal incentives for equity investors. The Comit index rose 9.33 to 468.18 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's heavy L293.4bn. However, savings shares came under pressure on fears of a negative announcement regarding the convertibility of savings shares into ordinary shares. Savings shares in Credito Italiano lost L146 or 7.1 per cent to L1,903 while Banca Commerciale's savings shares slipped L134 or 3.7 per cent to L3,504. After the close, Iri said that savings shares in Credito Italiano will not be converted into ordinary stock prior to the bank's privatisation. MADRID rose on strong foreign interest and the general index put on 3.92 to 223.98 in high turnover of Pta24.5bn. Electrical utilities showed some of the best gains on hopes of lower interest rates, with Iberdrola Pta18 higher at Pta718. Tabacalera rose Pta115 to Pta4,315 on reports that it planned to sell a 50 per cent stake in its Royal Brands subsidiary while Telefonica advanced Pta65 to Pta1,245. ZURICH transferred its attention from financials to industrials as the SMI index rose 27.6 or 1.3 per cent to 2,104.3. Dealers said that foreign money was mostly attracted to the banking and insurance sectors, and Winterthur rose another SFr80 to SFr3,020. TEL AVIV recovered strongly after three days of profit-taking. The blue chip index jumped 4.37 or 2.15 per cent in turnover of Shk177m COPENHAGEN closed 2.5 per cent lower on fears that the prime minister, Mr Poul Schlueter, might be forced to resign following the release of a damaging judicial report on a refugee scandal. The KFX top-20 index fell 1.92 to 75.17. STOCKHOLM closed lower despite a drop in money market rates. The Affarsvarlden General index slipped 7.9 to 922.6 in turnover of SKr866m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 14                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1071.73    1072.75    1073.98    1075.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1152.19    1152.39    1153.04    1153.14  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Jan 13     Jan 12     Jan 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100            1063.02    1071.43    1069.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200            1144.79    1152.84    1155.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1075.64    1077.85    1077.34    1076.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1154.62    1156.96    1155.71    1154.08  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jan 8                 Jan 7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1080.25               1081.92 FT-SE Eurotrack 200             1167.34               1171.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1077.92 ; 200 -  1157.49 Low/day: 100 -  1071.69  200 -  1151.75  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] BANGKOK, June 22 (AFP) -- The Australian embassy in  Rangoon Wednesday denied a report that it had conveyed an offer  from a private Australian aid group to help Burma's junta  develop border areas.    Ambassador Stuart Hume, reached by telephone from Bangkok,  said that, contrary to the Radio Rangoon report, he had conveyed  no such offer in talks Friday with Burma's minister for border  areas development, Lieutenant General Maunt Thint.    Hume said he had raised the general question of access of  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to people in the border  areas, including zones inhabited by former insurgents.    "We sought an assurance from the minister that NGOs were  free  to work in the border areas, which are frequently the most  disadvantaged and where humanitarian needs are often the  greatest," Hume said.    The minister responded that NGOs were "welcome," the  ambassador said.    Some 10 NGOs are currently working on projects in Burma.  NGOs  set up their own projects in areas in need, rather than  participating in programs put together by the ruling junta,  Rangoon-based diplomats said.    Australia and other Western nations have restricted  assistance to Rangoon as a means of pressuring the junta to  introduce democratic reforms.    Canberra ended all official assistance to Rangoon after the  military seized power in September 1988, killing thousands of  people as it crushed a nationwide pro-democracy movement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] There were clashes between Arabs and IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers in the territories today. In  Gaza, six residents were wounded by soldiers' fire, including an  eight-year-old child who was wounded in the head and is being  treated at al-Shifa' Hospital. [passage omitted]    Serious clashes took place in other parts of Hebron too. Ten  residents were wounded by fire and blows during these clashes.  Yoram Binur reports:    The incidents in Hebron today were particularly grave.  Fatah's youths arrived at the central town square, erected  roadblocks, and threw stones at the soldiers. Palestinian  sources reported that 10 wounded people reached the town's  hospitals. The debris of the Razzaq family's house in Hebron,  where the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] wanted members  were killed, became a site of pilgrimage today. The visitors  were presented with the remnants of the missiles the Army fired  at the building, as well as the live ammunition left there. In  leaflets disseminated in Hebron today the Hamas takes pride in  the fact that its members do not surrender.    In Nabulus, clashes between residents and the Army continued  today too. Tension in the territories is mounting, and among  other things, the IDF is again sealing off alleys and doorways  which were opened as a goodwill gesture in the framework of the  peace agreement.</p>

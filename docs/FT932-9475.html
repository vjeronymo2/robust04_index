			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Gloom is Tokyo's corporate rule  -Some upturn is expected this year JAPANESE corporate culture regards conformity as a virtue. It is a virtue that will be in ample abundance over the next few weeks when the majority of Japanese companies announce dismal results for the year to March. Manufacturers, service companies and financial institutions are expected to report reduced profits for the third year running. Brokers have forecast that companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange will report profit falls of 20 to 30 per cent. The reason is the weakness of business and consumer confidence between April 1992 and March this year. Despite an emergency government spending package of Y10,700bn (Dollars 96bn), announced in August, business confidence worsened throughout the year. The Bank of Japan's diffusion index, which measures short-term economic prospects, fell from minus 5 in February 1992 to minus 49 by February this year in the manufacturing sector and from a positive indication to minus 33 in the non-manufacturing sector. The dramatically-altered business environment forced companies to adjust their strategies. As a result, the fall in profits in fiscal 1992 will reflect not only the effects of lower demand but restructuring charges as companies positioned themselves for recovery. Consumer confidence declined not only because of the sagging economy but also because of indications that the system of lifetime employment, long taken for granted, is no longer sacred. Personal consumption actually rose 0.8 per cent in fiscal 1992, according to estimates by BZW, the securities company. But this is a low figure for Japan, where growth in consumption had been running at 3 to 4 per cent in previous years. A seemingly insatiable thirst for material goods in the years of asset inflation in the late 1980s has been replaced by a mood of frugality. Motor manufacturers suffered a sudden halt to demand for luxury cars, just as they had invested in new plants and state-of-the art automation to meet expected strong demand. Electronics manufacturers discovered that minor redesign of existing products no longer lured consumers into replacing TV or audio sets. Meanwhile, the fall in business confidence led to a sharp drop in capital spending, notably by financial institutions. BZW estimates that capital expenditure in fiscal 1992 was down by 5.7 per cent, in contrast to high growth in capital investment in the so-called 'bubble' years, when companies competed to invest in new manufacturing and communications equipment. The decline in capital expenditure was reflected in a fall in machine tool orders in 1992 of 35 per cent, according to the Japan Machine Tool Builders Association. Computer manufacturers, telecommunications and office equipment manufacturers were all affected by the drop in capital spending. The slowdown of the Japanese economy means companies that are not competitive overseas and are dependent on domestic demand will be hard hit, says Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at BZW. Another feature will be the negative effects of restructuring and cost-cutting measures by Japanese companies. Many managers conclude they have more employees, notably white collar, than they need or can afford. A recent government survey found that 80 per cent of major companies in and around Tokyo set about restructuring to cope with the recession. Companies ranging from NKK, the steel manufacturer, to Japan Airlines and IBM Japan, have introduced voluntary early retirement programmes to encourage staff to look for a second career. Such measures are being supplemented by transfer of staff to subsidiaries and sometimes to unaffiliated companies. The extent of the restructuring is reflected in the number of industrial sectors applying for government employment adjustment subsidies. These can be used by companies to pay staff while production is halted or while they are on temporary secondment. But the recent strength of the stock market, up 26 per cent since January, will bring windfall profit gains or, at least, lower valuation losses on corporations' stock holdings. Yet, despite difficult times, it is unlikely many companies will reduce dividends to reflect lower profits. They are desperate to avoid this because it would undermine their ability to tap the equity market for funds, Ms Matsui says. The consensus is the outlook for this fiscal year is better, but not dramatically so. There is a growing optimism about recovery towards the end of this year. But opinion is divided on the extent of it and how soon it is likely to be reflected in corporate earnings. Estimates for the recovery in earnings of non-financial companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange range from a moderate 5 per cent increase, from BZW, to a more upbeat 14 per cent, from Salomon Brothers. The impact of the yen's appreciation against the dollar is also of concern, although here opinion is again divided. The only certainty seems to be that, while more pain in adjusting to the new reality is on the horizon, fiscal 1993 cannot be worse than 1992.</p>

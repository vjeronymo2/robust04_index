			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: 'Management fads' show high rate of failure Sir, The debate in your letters column stimulated by Christopher Lorenz's article on systems thinking and the learning organisation ('Bending minds to a new learning circle', Management, February 17), is in danger of becoming a chronicle of current 'flavour of the month' management concepts. The problem with all new management concepts is their alarmingly high failure rate. Mr Lorenz's article touched on the the reason for this: 'companies will rush to adopt (management fads) in a half-baked way'. Simon Greenly (Letters, March 2,) refers to a survey - produced by AT Kearney and reported by Paul Taylor ('Such an elusive quality', February 14) which provides facts on why 80 per cent of total quality programmes fail. It is because management fails to set challenging but achievable goals or target tangible benefits. In our experience, this failure is common to many improvement programmes, not just total quality. Most companies focus on applying the technique, not on the benefits it provides. Successful companies focus on the benefits of using the technique as the tool in their armoury for change. The evidence shows you don't need to be a learning or total quality or any other kind of organisation to improve - jump on a bandwagon and you may get taken for a ride.

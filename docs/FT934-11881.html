			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: S Korea to open its procurement market SOUTH KOREA has agreed to open its government procurement market to international competition during intensive negotiations in Geneva aimed at completing the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. This includes the sensitive construction sector. Offers are now awaited from just four of the 12 countries engaged in negotiations on opening government procurement contracts to international competition: Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and Israel. As negotiators yesterday completed the latest round of procurement negotiations, they talked with increasing confidence of resolving differences ahead of the December 15 deadline for agreement on the Round. A new draft of a procurement text is due to be circulated at the end of next week, with a report due in two weeks on the outstanding obstacles. A final week of negotiation will start on November 15. Over the past week, improved offers have also been tabled by Japan, the US, and the European Free Trade Association countries of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria. South Korea has agreed to open all government procurement contracts in goods and services, all construction contracts, and all contracts for goods from para-statal organisations. This follows agreement early this week by Japan to open its scandal-ridden construction sector to international competition. Japan has apparently increased the list of services contracts it is willing to open to international tender, and has added 47 para-statal entities to the list of organisations to be bound by the agreement. Differences still exist about the threshold above which contracts must be open to competition, but there appears to be convergence on the issue. The US, which initially pressed for extremely low thresholds, has raised its proposal to SDR355,000 (Pounds 335,000) for contracts for goods and services, and SDR4.5m in construction contracts. It has raised its proposed threshold for contracts from central government entities to SDR100,000, in line with other offers on the table. Japan remains out of line on this issue, but has agreed in principle to lower its proposed SDR15m threshold for construction contracts. Apart from the thresholds issue, differences remain on how companies might challenge a government if it reneges on its commitment to give foreign companies fair access to procurement contracts, and how they might win compensation. Differences have to be resolved on rules that would bind non-government organisations to the new procurement regime.</p>

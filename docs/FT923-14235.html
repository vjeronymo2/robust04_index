			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / HK airport financing under fire THE International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airline industry grouping, yesterday attacked the way Hong Kong planned to finance its multi-billion dollar airport project. It asserted there were better ways to fund the scheme than trying to raise HKDollars 4.3bn (Pounds 290m) between now and 1997 through a charge levied on airlines using the colony's current international airport. On the eve of Mr Chris Patten's arrival today to assume the governorship of the colony, Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, speaking in Hong Kong yesterday, called on the government to reconsider. He claimed plans to treble charges at Kai Tak, Hong Kong's existing international airport, were discriminatory. He said the proposals were made because the government wanted to pay back loans on the airport too quickly and was demanding an unrealistic 15 per cent return on the airport investment. Mr Eser said that to reduce the cost to users, the government could allow airlines to take equity in the airport or use alternative sources of finance to fund the project - such as Kai Tak's recurrent profits and the tax the government levies on departing visitors. However, Mrs Anson Chan, a senior civil servant, said it was fair that those who benefited from the new airport should pay for it. If the airlines paid less taxpayers would have to pay more. Iata argued that airlines should not pay until the airport came into use. It cited an International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendation that airport users should not be charged for facilities and services they do not use. The government responded that the new airport represented an expansion of Hong Kong's international aviation facilities and that for any utility, prices for existing services rise as the construction of new capacity is embarked on. Officials pointed out that Kai Tak would close when the new airport at Chek Lap Kok opened. In a related development, Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-funded daily, sought to put the blame for any delay in the airport's construction with Britain. In a commentary on unsuccessful Sino-British talks held this week in Beijing it said it was unreasonable for the UK to ask China to accept a financial plan that was short of details and did not have a ceiling. 'If there is any delay, Britain should be blamed for being too careless when drawing up the financial plan which is not in line with the memorandum of understanding,' the newspaper said.</p>

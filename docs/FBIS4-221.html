			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Guy Rogers] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 4 SAPA -- Transkei military  leader Gen Bantu Holomisa should "come clean" on allegations  that some of his cabinet ministers and MP's are seeking to gain  control of 100,000 ha [hectare] of state-owned land before the  elections, says the National Party [NP]. An NP statement on  Sunday quoted news reports as saying some sales in this  connection had already been approved by the Transkei cabinet.  "This is exactly the kind of corruption which thrives under  military dictatorships." General Holomisa should immediately and  publicly state if these allegations were true and what his role  was in the affair, the NP said.    "If these allegations are true it will confirm our suspicion  of massive abuse of power by the Holomisa government."</p>

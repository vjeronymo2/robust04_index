			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah has met the above Federal requirement by promulgating the criteria at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.100 through .600, which determine when a permit change must be processed as a ``significant'' permit revision. Under Utah's program, at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;226, a significant permit revision is subjected to all of the permit application information requirements at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;300&hyph;100, 645&hyph;300&hyph;200, 645&hyph;301, and 645&hyph;302. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the criteria for determining when a permit change must be processed as a significant permit revision is existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400, which requires that, when a permit change is ordered by the Division, rather than proposed by an operator on its own initiative, the permit change must be processed as a significant permit revision. As set forth at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;211 through 645&hyph;303&hyph;213, division-ordered permit changes are required when the review of a permit reveals that a change in the permit is needed to ensure compliance with the State program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) does not require that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  specific kind of permit revision be processed as a ``significant'' revision, it does not require that a permit revision ordered by a State regulatory authority be processed as a significant permit revision. Therefore, Utah's proposal to delete from its program the requirement at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400 that all permit changes ordered by the Division be processed as significant permit revisions is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2). Therefore, the Director approves the proposed deletion and recodification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on March 27, 1994, by telephone conversation, that it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;905). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;902). It responded on March 30, 1994, that it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;912). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP responded to OSM's request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Director's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above finding, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on March 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director approves Utah's revisions of its significant permit revision rules, including the deletion of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400 and the recodification of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.500 and .600 as Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;303&hyph;224.400 and .500, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director approves the rules as proposed by Utah with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

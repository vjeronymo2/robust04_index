			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seyfali Akhundov: "A Free Zone Is Worse than </F> Coercion"]    [Text] Sakhalin Oblast--The administration of  Sakhalin Oblast has submitted a request to the central  authorities of the Russian Federation to introduce a border  regime in the region. In the opinion of the leadership of the  oblast, a 5 kilometer border zone will stop unscrupulous  businessmen and poachers who are exploiting the natural wealth  of Sakhalin in their own selfish interests, fishing for valuable  marketable species of fish in coastal waters, and conducting  raids on the spawning grounds at the mouths of Sakhalin  rivers.    In accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation on the  State Border, the administrations of the krays and oblasts that  adjoin foreign borders of Russia were given the right to  determine the rules for the presence of citizens on their  territories. Henceforth, in order to acquire the right to be in  the rayons of Sakhalin Oblast, those who enter the 5 kilometer  border zone will have to register here. Foreign citizens will  have to secure the approval of competent organs.    In the opinion of the deputy governor of the oblast, Viktor  Gurevich, these measures are intended first of all to subdue  poachers--citizens of Russia and CIS countries--and do not have  a direct bearing on the illegal fishing business by Japanese  fishermen in Russian territorial waters. "Japanese economic  expansion is not threatening Sakhalin," said Gurevich to an  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, "and you cannot lure them here  for all the money in the world" (the Japanese--S.A.). While the  toughened border regime in Maritime Kray and other rayons  adjoining the Sino-Russian border has a political character--the  prevention of purposeful assimilation of Chinese in Russia--the  actions of the Sakhalin administration are the result of  economic reasons. It is necessary to prevent the illegal export  of valuable maritime products from the peninsula.    Ocean delicacies are the only articles of income for the  meager budget of the oblast. However, Sakhalin does not receive  1 kopek for the sale of fish and ocean products on account of  the state order. According to Gurevich, the situation in the  oblast is catastrophic, and the workers of budget organizations  have not received their pay for half a year already. The quota  of delicacy fish and ocean products allocated to Sakhalin by the  Government of the Russian Federation is enough only to exchange  them for fuel and vital products. According to the latest  calculations, the cost of the consumer basket in South Sakhalin  is R150,000. Prices here, given the same rates of pay as on the  mainland, are higher than Moscow by a factor of five. "The  Russian Government is doing everything to convince residents of  the Far East that these territories are not necessary to  Russia," declared Gurevich.    The introduction of a border regime on the peninsula of  Sakhalin will most likely bury the free economic zone that was  established here. The result of this economic experiment is  already that the counters of local stores, which were always  filled with fish and ocean products, have become empty. The  unpopularity of the SEZ [Free Economic Zone] at one time became  one of the reasons for the defeat in municipal elections of  Vyacheslav Fedorov, a former governor of the oblast and  apologist of a free economy.</p>

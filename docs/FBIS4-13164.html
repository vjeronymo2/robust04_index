			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin has praised the efforts that President Husni  Mubarak and the Egyptian Government are exerting calmly and away  from the media spotlight to help the PLO and Israel reach  agreement over establishing peace in the region.    In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM to be published  in its 17 April issue, Rabin said that in a telephone  conversation following the Israeli bus blast, he and Palestinian  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on the need to continue the peace  process, because it is the best response to the enemies of peace  by the Israeli and the Palestinian sides.    The Israeli prime minister affirmed that the objective of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region  at the end of this month is to boost the multilateral talks and  to attend the signing of the agreement on implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, if they reach  agreement.    Rabin clarified that the peace efforts with the Palestinians  must proceed simultaneously along two parallel roads,  concentrating on the negotiations to reach agreement on  implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to confirm  that violence and terrorism will not hamper the negotiating  process or attempts to reach agreement to implement the  Declaration of Principles.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in his interview  with AL-AHRAM that agreement was reached between the Palestinian  and the Israeli sides in a meeting in Cairo recently that  anything that is agreed upon during the talks will be written  down and initialed.    He pointed out that what Israel is trying to do with the  Palestinians is to find a formula for peaceful coexistence  without any clear or dividing lines, because there are no  dividing lines in reality. In this context, he mentioned the  corridor linking Gaza and Jericho.    Rabin said he would head for Moscow on April 24 to meet  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. This visit will be preceded by  another visit by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to Moscow.  But Rabin ruled out the possibility of a meeting between him  and 'Arafat then.    Rabin said that Israel tried to start secret talks with  Syria  but that Damascus refused to cooperate, despite the fact that  none of the agreements between the Arabs and Israel since 1977  could have taken place had they not been preceded by secret  talks.    Answering a question on relations between Israel and the  Arab  countries, Rabin said that peace between Egypt and Israel broke  the hostility between Israel and the Arab countries. He stated:  Undoubtedly, Egypt is the biggest and most important Arab  country. Peace with Egypt has proven that peace can be  established and preserved.    On the siege imposed on Gaza and the West Bank towns, the  Israeli prime minister denied that there are any instructions  banning the entry of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip. He  said he agreed to exclude doctors, nurses, and Palestinian  employees of international organizations from the ban on  entering and leaving the occupied territories.</p>

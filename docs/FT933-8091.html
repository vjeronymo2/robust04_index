			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Dole attacks Bosnia moves as 'invitation to dictators' SENATOR Robert Dole, leader of the minority Republicans in the US Senate and a possible opponent of President Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election, yesterday delivered a fierce attack on the UN and its role in the Bosnian conflict. He criticised the terms of the Bosnian peace settlement now being negotiated in Geneva, calling it - in reference to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  -'an invitation to the brutal dictator in Belgrade' to continue oppressing his own people and to launch a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Albanian population in Kosovo. 'It's also going to be an invitation to other dictators or would-be aggressors lurking in the shadows of the former Soviet Union. How many thugs around the world will RSVP to that invitation? How many of those thugs have access to chemical or nuclear weapons?' he said at a meeting of the National Governors' Association in Oklahoma. Mr Dole opposed the UN embargo on arms shipments to the former Yugoslavia. Many have argued this leaves Bosnia at a disadvantage to Serbia, which has access to the arms of the former Yugoslav federal army. 'Bosnia is being gobbled up defenceless because of an arms embargo that violates the very principles of the UN.' Some of Mr Dole's harshest criticism, however, was reserved for the UN and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, its secretary-general, whom the US senator accused of being more concerned about who was in charge than about getting things done.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The consolidated claims in question arose from two organization-wide audits of the Maine Department of Education, conducted by the Maine Department of Audit for the periods between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988 (ACN: 01&hyph;93245) and July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989 (ACN: 01&hyph;13035&hyph;G). The audits were conducted pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A&hyph;128.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In reviewing the State's administration of programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Part B) (formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act) for the period between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988, the auditors found that the State's administrative costs under the Part B program exceeded the allowable maximum by $354,211.63. The auditors determined that, due to the differences between State and Federal fiscal years, $65,325 of this amount had previously been questioned in the June 30, 1987 audit report. Consequently, for the period between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988, the auditors questioned administrative costs in the amount of $288,886 (the difference between $354,211 and $65,325). Additionally, during this same State fiscal year, the auditors found that the State had charged personnel costs to various Federal programs for employees who had not worked exclusively on those programs, questioning $77,700 in Part B personnel costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 14, 1991, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), issued a program determination letter (PDL) stating that the administrative cost finding had been addressed in a previous PDL (dated March 27, 1991) and that the personnel finding was not being sustained due to insufficient information in the audit report. However, upon further review and follow-up by the Department's Regional Inspector General for Audit with staff of the State Auditor's office and upon review of their workpapers, it was determined that there was no support for the charging of 100 percent of two employees' time to several different Part B programs. On June 29, 1992, the Assistant Secretary for OSERS issued a Program Redetermination Letter (PRDL) seeking recovery of $311,840 in fiscal year (FY) 1987 funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the State's administration of programs under Part B and under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (the Perkins Act), for the period between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989, the auditors found that under the Part B program the State incurred $50,580 in administrative costs in excess of the allowable maximum. Additionally, the auditors determined that personnel costs for a number of employees who did not work exclusively for the Handicapped-State Grant Program funded under Part B, and the Vocational Education Basic Grants Program funded under the Perkins Act, were charged entirely to those Federal programs. In total, the auditors questioned $133,140 in personnel costs incurred in the period between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 25, 1992 the Assistant Secretary for OSERS and the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) issued a joint PDL seeking recovery of $140,852 in FY 1989 funds. Of that total, $90,272 was disallowed in a joint finding between the Assistant Secretaries for OSERS and OVAE, related to salary charges under Part B and the Perkins Act. Specifically, the Assistant Secretaries determined that in FY 1989, $44,832 awarded under Part B and $45,440 awarded under the Perkins Act had been used by the State to pay administrative salaries without the required supporting documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 29, 1992, the State filed a timely request for review of the Assistant Secretary for OSERS' determination in the PDL for ACN: 01&hyph;93245, with the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ). Upon joint motion by the parties, on March 16, 1992, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) assigned to this matter stayed the proceeding for purposes of mediation. On September 25, 1992, the State filed a timely request for review of the Assistant Secretaries for OSERS' and OVAE's determinations in the PDL for ACN: 01&hyph;13035&hyph;G. Upon joint motion by the parties, on October 22, 1992, the ALJ stayed the proceeding for purposes of mediation, and consolidated the two cases. On March 12, 1993, the ALJ granted a Joint Motion to Stay the Proceedings for Settlement Discussions, filed by the parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the course of ensuing settlement discussions, the State submitted documentary evidence not previously seen by the auditors relevant to both the Part B excess administrative cost and the personnel salaries issues raised under the Part B and Perkins Act programs. As a result of settlement discussions, the parties tentatively agreed to a settlement under which the State would repay a total of $125,635 to the Department in full resolution of all issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the Part B excess administrative costs determinations contained in both PDLs, during mediation and settlement discussions the State was able to demonstrate that it had expended $12,863.27 of excess administrative costs in FY 1987, and $55,817.84 of excess administrative costs in FY 1988, for a total of $68,681.11 in excess administrative costs. Under the tentative Settlement Agreement, the State will submit revised SF&hyph;269s to the Department reflecting its reconciliation of certain administrative costs expenditures for FYs 1987 and 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to both Assistant Secretaries' determinations of unsupported charging of personnel salaries, in the course of mediation and settlement discussions the State submitted documentation not seen by the auditors demonstrating to the Assistant Secretary for OSERS that the majority of two salaries questioned in the PDL for ACN: 01&hyph;93245 were properly expended under Part B. Additionally, the State agreed that its charging of a $44,832 salary to the FY 1989 Part B grant was erroneous. The State proposed to offset the improper salary charges with what it believed to be allowable administrative expenditures that had not previously been charged to the Part B grant but that had been incurred during the fiscal years at issue in these audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 14, 1994, the Assistant Secretary for OSERS filed a Notice of Withdrawal of Claims and Reduction of Amount in Dispute covering disallowances in the June 29, 1992 PRDL for ACN: 01&hyph;93245 and in the August 25, 1992 PDL in ACN: 01&hyph;13015&hyph;G, in which the Assistant Secretary reduced the Part B claims in this consolidated appeal to $45,272 for the June 29, 1992 PRDL and to $115,046 for the August 25, 1992 PDL. The latter total included disallowances under the Perkins Act for which no reduction of claim was included in the June 14, 1994 Notice. As a result of the June 14, 1994 withdrawal notice, the disallowances for both cases totalled $160,318.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the tentative Settlement Agreement negotiated between the parties, the State has agreed to repay $125,635 to the Department in full resolution of the issues raised in both the PRDL and the PDL. Of this amount, $45,272 would be in full settlement of the claims under Part B contained in the June 29, 1992 PRDL. And, $80,363 would be in full settlement of the claims under Part B and under the Perkins Act contained in the August 25, 1992 PDL. Of this amount, $63,664 settles the Part B disallowance and $16,699 settles the Perkins Act disallowance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the repayment of funds, the State has agreed to submit to the Department revised Financial Status Reports for fiscal years 1987 through 1993 reflecting proper coding of excess administrative costs to the grants during each of the years within that period. The State has also provided an assurance in the tentative Settlement Agreement that it will not shift excess administrative expenditures forward, to fiscal years after FY 1992, that are related to disallowances either in the June 29, 1992 PRDL or in the August 25, 1992 PDL. Finally, the State has certified in the tentative Settlement Agreement that it is currently in compliance with all requirements of the statutes and regulations pertaining to the practices and procedures that gave rise to the disallowances in question in this consolidated appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the authority provided in 20 U.S.C. 1234a(j)(1), given the documentation submitted by the State, the certification and assurances provided by the State, and the estimated litigation risks and costs of proceeding through the appeal process, the Department has determined that it would not be practical or in the public interest to continue litigation of this case. Rather, under the authority provided in 20 U.S.C. 1234a(j)(1), the Department has determined that a compromise of this claim for $125,635 would be appropriate. The public is invited to comment on the Department's intent to compromise this claim. Additional information may be obtained by writing to Adina Kole, Esq. or Daphna Crotty, Esq., at the address given at the beginning of this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Program Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  20 U.S.C. 1234a(j)(2). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald R.

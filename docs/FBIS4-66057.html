			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Kessler and Dorothea Siems: "React </F> Flexibly--Government and Business Join Ranks in Foreign  Trade--Germany's Exporters Remain Skeptical"]    [Text] Hans Messer, former head of the Frankfurt family  enterprise Messer Griesheim, on his most recent trip to Hungary  had originally planned only to drop in briefly to see German  Ambassador Otto-Raban Heinichen. He stayed longer than planned.    In no time at all, the head of the diplomatic mission had  called important ministry officials and managers. The chairman  of the foreign trade commission of the German Association of  Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) met them the very next day.  According to Messer, a year ago such a prompt response "would  have been unthinkable."    This exceptional service is soon to become the rule. The  chancellor and ministers, diplomats and association  representatives, all want to help the shaken German export  industry. While formerly the entrepreneurs of the Federal  Republic were "always individual fighters," as Tarun Das, chief  of the Indian Industry Association, recalls, "they now regularly  bring along their politicians." Only rarely does a firm from  Germany still risk the leap into a new foreign market.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt says that politicians  must  "actively support" German enterprises in conquering foreign  markets. According to Helmut Kohl's chief economist, promoting  the export industry will be at "the very top of the priority  list" until the end of the legislative period.    The days are past when German politicians displayed a noble  reserve and praised the advantages of free trade at  international conferences. In the future, says Rainer Haungs,  the economic spokesman of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union] parliamentary caucus, who himself  has a medium-sized business, the government and associations  "will interfere more than previously." Ludolf-Georg von  Wartenberg, chief manager of the Federal Association of German  Industry (BDI), summarizes the new trend, where worldwide  competition by enterprises has long been supplanted "by  competition of nations."    The secret model: the Japanese. They have always  concentrated  on concerted action in foreign trade. As Japan researcher  Hanns-Guenther Hilpert of the Munich Ifo-Institute for Economic  Research found out, Tokyo has very purposefully "supported"  expansion of Japanese enterprises "in the growth markets in  Southeast Asia." The result: In 1993, Japan achieved an export  surplus of $56 billion in trade with its neighbors--more than  with the United States. By contrast, Germany's share in global  exports dropped from 11.3 to 10.2 percent in the past years. In  the booming developing countries of Southeast Asia alone, the  Japanese invested 58 billion German marks [DM] per year, the  Germans a mere DM2 billion.    German corporation managers are alarmed that all trading  nations are meanwhile re-arming. U.S. President Bill Clinton  only recently declared exports to be the most important goal of  foreign policy. As an internal strategy paper of the U.S.  Department of Commerce states, "we have had good experiences due  to aggressive government support."    Now the Germans want those, too. They promote foreign  [trade]  fairs, establish joint offices and trade centers--and travel.  Above all, travel.    Last year, Rexrodt twice visited the People's Republic of  China. Chancellor Helmut Kohl added to his Japan trip a quick  visit to South Korea. And even Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and  his colleague in the Environmental Ministry, Klaus Toepfer,  promoted German enterprises abroad: Kinkel in the rising Vietnam  market, and Toepfer during a visit to the former trade hub of  the Near East, Lebanon.    Bonn also intends to support the export industry  financially,  much more so than to date. Thus Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl  assured industry of support for the Asia-Pacific Commission of  German Industry (APA) established last year.    As it did recently at the first international conference in  Bangkok, APA is looking for new ways to improve the presence of  Germans in the world's Number One growth market. Under the aegis  of the land-owned Suedwestdeutsche Landesbank (SuedwestLB), in  the spring of 1995 a German House will open its doors in  Singapore, and will not only provide consultation and contacts  to medium-sized businesses, but also offices and machine shops.    This new Bonn activity is surely important, and the many  travels, congresses, and seminars are well-meant. But it is not  yet certain by far whether the new joining of ranks between  politics and industry will be successful. German export policy  is still lacking sensible financing tools, and the laender are  often competing with each other beyond the German borders. The  enterprises themselves must "recognize their opportunities,"  says Otto Graf Lambsdorff, FDP [Free Democratic Party] economics  spokesman. Although political pressure is appropriate, it cannot  substitute for the lack of competitiveness.    The government's new activism is not even well-received by  the enterprises. After the recent flops on large orders, such as  those of the ICE [Intercity Express] consortium in Texas and  South Korea and of Dasa in refurbishing the Saudi airfleet,  German enterprises continue to feel left in the lurch, despite  all the chancellor's and ministers' travels. An exclusive poll  by the Ifo-Institute among 704 enterprises and managers for  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE showed that over half of industrial enterprises  have a low opinion of the Federal Government's foreign trade  policy.    German enterprises, be they medium-sized or on the top floor  of German industry, demand of the government, above all, better  financing conditions. Of the top managers polled by the  Ifo-Institute, 70 percent plead for interest subsidies when it  concerns the new markets in East Asia, Latin America, and India.    How it could work in the future was demonstrated by Siemens  with the subway order in Canton, China. The electric/electronics  corporation procured for its partners, short of foreign  exchange, a loan financed half and half with German budget funds  and via the capital market. Siemens now hopes for similarly  favorable financing in the race for expansion of the commuter  transport system in Shanghai.    Siemens managers calculate that--if low interest rates  continue--the German export industry in 1994 alone could finance  orders worth DM1.5 billion with cheap development aid credits.  Upshot of the calculations: "That has a stimulating effect on  the employment situation."    True, Minister Rexrodt rejects the close linking of  development aid to export orders and hence refuses his approval  of respective industry applications. But pressure from industry  is growing. The top corporations are annoyed that countries such  as Japan and France support their exporters with much more  generous credit assistance.    Not only large enterprises feel the subsidy race. For  example, a North Rhine-Westphalian machine builder had no chance  in China with an order worth 23 million [as published] because  the Dutch competition could offer it at half the price. The  reason: The Chinese received 45 percent of the export value as a  present, in the form of development aid.    Small businesses in particular suffer abroad from the darker  sides of German federalism. The land rulers and their economics  ministers not only compete with Kohl and Rexrodt, but also fight  each other fiercely.    Just recently, Bavaria presented itself at the technology  fair in Bangkok as the 13th largest export country of the world.  Baden-Wuerttemberg's Minister President Erwin Teufel traveled  with over 100 enterprise representatives to China--no Western  visitor before him had ever taken along that many. Even  Saarland's Finance Minister Hans Kasper went on a selling tour  in the People's Republic and garnered orders worth millions for  Saarland enterprises. Especially piquant: The Saarberg  subsidiary Interplan, and the mining subcontractors Walter  Becker and Preinfalk not only beat out the Japanese, but also  the competition from North Rhine-Westphalia.    Such particularism, argue the members of the Asia-Pacific  Commission of German Industry heatedly, must finally stop. In  the future, the activity of the Federal Government, laender, and  industry must "be bundled and implemented purposefully."    And if at times it does not work out, as with ICE, says  Johannes von Thadden, head of the foreign trade chambers at  DIHT, then "we will react quite flexibly." Since TGV has been  beating ICE in many markets, the German Foreign Trade Chamber  organizes purchasing seminars in Paris with the French  manufacturer--so that German enterprises at least have a chance  as ancillary suppliers.</p>

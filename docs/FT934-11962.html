			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 20,000 after JR East suspension THE Nikkei average fell below the 20,000 level for the first time in three months as pessimism spread following the suspension of trading in East Japan Railway shares in the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 184.82 lower at 19,838.78, having opened at the day's high of 20,012.80. However, the mid-morning announcement of JR East's suspension prompted selling, depressing the index to the day's low of 19,686.97 in the afternoon. Stock exchange officials suspended JR East for the rest of the session as a rush of orders blocked the computer system, preventing trading of other shares on the TSE. Traders said the confusion which resulted prompted investors to turn to the over-the-counter market. The OTC average rose 17.46 to 1,612.36. Investors wanting to trade JR East shares rushed to the Osaka and Nagoya exchanges, forcing officials to halt trading there briefly. Volume totalled 279.6m shares, against 257m. Declines led advances by 685 to 303, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 13.36 to 1,631.95, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.06 at 1,288.96. Railway stocks were weak, with Tobu Railway falling Y45 to Y742 and Tokyu Y35 to Y785. Game makers fell back on prospects of lower earnings, with Nintendo losing Y270 to Y7,670 and Sega Enterprises declining Y100 to Y9,200. Large-capital issues continued to lose ground, with Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock, off Y2 at Y333 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dipping Y6 to Y677. High-technology shares retreated on profit-taking: Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y40 to Y1,460 and Sony Y50 to Y4,850. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 300.78 to 21,681.24 in volume of 11.8m shares. JR East closed at an offered price of Y598,400. Roundup THE REGION produced three new highs and significant gains in senior markets. HONG KONG talked of renewed demand from the US and Japan as the Hang Seng index rose 112.30, or 1.3 per cent, to 8,903.20, and turnover moved up from HKDollars 5.2bn to an estimated HKDollars 6.3bn. The advance was broadly based but the new listing, Yaohan, was the day's most active stock with HKDollars 453m worth of shares changing hands. It closed at HKDollars 3.325, up 24 per cent from the issue price of HKDollars 2.68. AUSTRALIA saw a strong performance by BHP, up a net 25 cents at ADollars 17.20, and an inflation figure within expectations as the All Ordinaries index gained 12.6 at 2,068.3. Turnover more than doubled from ADollars 306.8m to ADollars 645.3m. Brokers said BHP was supported by news that the Dai Hung 4 appraisal well off the coast of Vietnam had produced good results. The new highs came in NEW ZEALAND, BANGKOK and KARACHI. New Zealand nudged to another four-year closing peak, although Fletcher Challenge's run higher was checked by profit-taking. FCL ended 7 cents down at NZDollars 4.03 as the NZSE-40 capital index closed 5.22 up at 2,118.23. BANGKOK's SET index shot up by 34.90, or 3 per cent, to 1,193.18 in active turnover of Bt15.19bn as new funds from Japan drew local investors back to the market in force. KARACHI took its winning streak to the 13th straight session as the KSE index rose 19.77 to 1,542.40. SINGAPORE's blue chips led the uptrend ahead of the trading of Singapore Telecom shares next week, and the Malaysian budget tomorrow, the Straits Times Industrial index finishing 13.35 higher at 2,107.41. Malaysian speculative stocks provided the bulk of activity. In KUALA LUMPUR itself, the KLSE composite index fell on profit taking from an intraday record high of 941.47 to close at 934.53, still up 4.68. TAIWAN ended off its highs after gains in speculative shares failed to boost the overall market. The weighted index was finally 12.46 up at 4,103.63, after reaching 4,134, and turnover swelled to TDollars 32.46bn. Among the speculative counters, Hong Yi Fibre was the day's limit up at TDollars 111.50 and Tera limit up at TDollars 28.70.</p>

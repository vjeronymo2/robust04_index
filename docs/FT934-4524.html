			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / British stance will disappoint Reynolds Statements by the prime minister and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, rejecting the notion of their being 'persuaders for a united Ireland' will be a bitter disappointment to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Reynolds' proposals for a 'united Ireland by consent', and active British involvement in that aim, are central to the peace formula that he intends to discuss with Mr Major in Dublin today. Although Dublin officials were yesterday emphasising that they still hoped for progress, the statements cast further gloom on Mr Reynolds' aspirations for 'peace by Christmas'. One of the main concessions Mr Reynolds seeks is is a statement by London supporting 'self determination of the Irish people based on consent freely expressed, north and south'. This would guarantee a majority veto in Northern Ireland to any change, but would also give nationalists the satisfaction of an all-Ireland dimension. Like London, Dublin is convinced that the IRA is ready to end its military campaign. But it is convinced that Britain will have to do more than simply demand a unilateral republican ceasefire. A clue as to why Dublin has such faith in its formula lies in a recent speech by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, who said: 'Partition was brought about by a British act of parliament for which not a single Irish vote was cast. The consent of the Irish people was never sought and has never been freely given. That is the nub of our problems.' Dublin officials have made little effort in the past week to disguise their exasperation with Downing Street and their concern that Mr Major's 'understanding' with the Ulster Unionists is the main obstacle to progress on their own formula.</p>

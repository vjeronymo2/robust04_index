			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Necker Calls For Strategy To Improve </F> Germany as Industrial Center"]    [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- The German economy is recovering  slowly but steadily. This is how German Industry Federation  (BDI) President Tyll Necker described the cyclical situation a  day before the BDI annual meeting begins.    According to Necker's analysis, recovery is primarily  attributable to orders received from abroad. He said he was  glad that orders received increased 12.9 percent. This was,  however, no reason for euphoria. Investment at home and  consumption continued to be slow, he said.    Regarding investment, the slow-down had ended, but there was  still no improvement. Necker said that this was attributable to  high taxes and charges and to the fact that in many areas,  existing capacities were not fully utilized. He said the  production level was currently less than 10 percent below that  of 1991, the year of economic boom. Necker: "If you come from  the dark, gray is a light color."    The BDI president believes that a slow and steady upward  trend, which is currently taking shape, is better than a flash  in the pan. According to Necker, the change of mood in industry  is attributable to the moderate wage policy. A change of  thought has also taken place among policymakers. The decrease  of public debt has at least been envisaged as a long-term goal.    The BDI president said the cost reduction programs in  companies were taking effect, so that wage unit costs had  decreased. Low interest rates and price increase rates were  also having a positive effect. Even though the conclusion of  the GATT round had not yet borne fruit, business and industry  were glad that a trade war had been averted, said Necker.    Commenting on the situation of individual branches, he said  the automobile sector should show more interest in orders  received than in the number of registrations. An increasing  demand would also lead to a production increase. In the  engineering sector and in electrical engineering, the cycle was  stimulated by foreign demand. In the chemical sector, orders  received and employment had considerably increased.    Necker appealed to politicians, trade unions, and employers  to continue to improve the competitiveness of Germany as a  production center. In his view, such a strategy includes the  following points:     -  Germany must reduce costs, instead of  redistributing them. This holds true not only for industry, but  also for the public sector.    -  The innovative ability of industry  and society must be increased.    -  Deregulation must be carried out  wherever possible. Necker: "The brake blocks must be  removed!"    -  Unemployment must not be combated with defensive  strategies. It is necessary to create more jobs, instead of  distributing the shortage by other means.     Necker said that owing to changes inside and outside the  German borders, management conditions in Germany had changed.  Companies, politicians, employers and employees, and the whole  society had to take this into consideration. Not only products  and services but also the framework conditions for production  and management were facing international competition. If it was  necessary to create new jobs, instead of jeopardizing existing  ones, these changes had to be met in an offensive way.    Necker said that at its annual meeting, the BDI wanted to  conduct an open discussion with all democratic forces. At the  meeting today, Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free  Democratic Party), Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf  Scharping, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic  Union), and IG Metall Metal Workers Union Chairman Klaus Zwickel  will speak.</p>

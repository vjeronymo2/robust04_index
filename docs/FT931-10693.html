			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Tales of war and the unexpected - Fiction REBEL by Bernard Cornwell HarperCollins Pounds 9.99, 308 pages THE NIGHT by Terence Stamp Phoenix House Pounds 14.99, 228 pages THE BLACK COOK'S HISTORIAN by Graeme Rigby Constable Pounds 13.99, 175 pages RAVEN by Thomas Strittmatter Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 9.99, 249 pages OLD SOLDIERS never die, especially not heroes of historical sagas. They simply go on for ever, enjoying a vigorous shelf life long after the last trumpet has sounded, the last battle been won. And when the battle is Waterloo, as it was for Richard Sharpe after a dozen best-selling novels by Bernard Cornwell, there was clearly nothing for his creator to do but put the old boy out to grass and go back to the drawing board again with a different soldier, different war, different country altogether. Rebel is the result, the first in a Sharpe-like series intended to chronicle the American civil war through the eyes of Nate Starbuck, a refugee from Yale Divinity School, who has come south in pursuit of a woman and finds himself stranded in Richmond just as the first shots are fired at Fort Sumter. Nate's father is a fire and brimstone Yankee preacher, loathed all over the South (and by Nate himself) for the virulence of his opposition to slavery. Rather than be tarred and feathered as his father's son, Nate elects to join the Confederate army instead, enlisting in a private regiment raised by the father of an old Yale friend. They shoulder arms and march towards Bull Run, where Nate's brother is serving on the other side . . . It's the formula much as before, in fact, a nice picture of fighting on the front, lots of action between the covers, plenty going on to keep the reader thoroughly absorbed. The author is not quite in the Margaret Mitchell class  -he cannot match the tension and excitement of Gone With The Wind - but the book is perfectly convincing all the same, a sure-fire best-seller if ever there was one. No doubt Rebel Yell will follow in due course, and Johnny Rebel after that and - well, you could almost name the rest yourselves. Less predictable is Terence Stamp, who after three volumes of autobiography has decided to try his hand at a novel, and a rather unusual one at that. Billed as a philosophical comedy, The Night tells the story of a dinner party in Holland Park, and of the eight somewhat freaky people who attend it. Chief among them is Zeno, an actor/pop singer with a background not unlike Stamp's own, who is into circadian rhythms and 16 different kinds of herb in his Ayurvedic toothpaste. There is also Captain Toby, about whose private life the less said the better, promiscuous Fleur, homosexual Mr Rose and ladies' man Nick, who has been known to get through 14 women at one time, and only two of them disappointed. Quite a night, by the time it is over. Stamp enjoys himself hugely at his characters' expense and as a welcome bonus reveals a closet intellectual beneath his own handsome exterior. He is into equinoxes, reincarnation, Jung, RD Laing, dukkerinas, Jim Morrison and the earth's electromagnetic field, among other concepts. His characters may not always seem entirely believable to the average reader, but the author moves in exotic circles, so what appears markedly eccentric to the rest of us may well seem quite normal to him. The Black Cook's Historian is an unusual story as well. It charts the career of an 18th century Englishman sold to the press gang and forced to work as galley slave to the cook of the title. Not for long however, because the cook poisons their captors and takes command of the ship himself, setting all the slaves free. They sail away to establish a new Carthage, taking the Englishman with them. It is an intriguing tale, told with a poet's eye for detail, and has already won the Constable prize, awarded biennially for the best unpublished novel from the north of England. Thomas Strittmatter's Raven is a first novel from Germany (translated by Ian Mitchell) and reads like it too. Its theme is adolescence and early adulthood, as experienced by a bunch of misfits glimpsed first at school, then in a series of low-grade jobs leading nowhere. There are quite a few jokes along the way, but the author's disjointed style and rambling, nihilistic approach leave one wondering what on earth it's all about in the end.</p>

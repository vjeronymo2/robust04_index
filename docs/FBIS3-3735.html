The session holds that 1993 was a year of victorious  advance along the road of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, in which China scored significant achievements  in reform, opening up, and modernization construction and opened  up a new situation in the work of all fields. The report gives  a factual summation of the work in the past year and puts  forward positive and prudent tasks for the coming year. The  session has decided to approve the report.    The session points out: This year will be crucial for  accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic  system and maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. To  successfully fulfill the various tasks established by the  current session, we must carry out the work in all fields across  the country under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line; must comprehensively implement the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and must  subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability; seeing to it that  reform, development, and stability coordinate with and promote  each other.    The session emphasizes: We must steadfastly take economic  construction as the central task and shift the focus of economic  construction to improving economic efficiency. Agriculture is a  major issue having a vital bearing on the overall national  economic situation and social stability. Therefore, we must  take practical and effective measures to strengthen the role of  agriculture as the foundation of national economy -- giving  particular attention to the production of grain, cotton, edible  oil, meat, sugar, and vegetables; actively assisting the  development of village and township enterprises; developing the  rural economy in an all-round way; earnestly implementing  programs to aid the poor; reducing peasants' burdens; and doing  everything possible to increase peasants' incomes. We must go  all out to improve the performance of large and medium  state-owned enterprises, continuing to change the operating  mechanisms of state enterprises, actively carrying out the pilot  project for establishing a modern enterprise system,  strengthening the internal management of enterprises, building  up the vitality and stamina of enterprises for further  development, striving to preserve and increase the value of  state-owned assets, and bringing into play the role of state  enterprises as the mainstay of the national economy. We must  strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  energetically adjust economic structure, maintain a rational  investment scale, strictly control commodity price rises, firmly  curb inflation, and strive to strike a basic balance between  total supply and demand of the national economy. We must open  the country wider to the outside world and expand cooperation  and exchanges with foreign countries. We must continue to  improve the people's livelihood on the basis of economic growth.    The session points out: In view of the relatively large  number of reform programs to be launched this year, we must make  meticulous preparations to ensure the smooth implementation of  reform programs. We must take the overall interests into  account, correctly handle the relationship between the central  and local governments and national and local interests, and  harness the enthusiasm of all sectors. We must summarize  experiences in good time and properly resolve problems and  contradictions cropping up in reform. We must reinforce  discipline to ensure strict enforcement of orders and  prohibitions.    The session urged: We should further strengthen socialist  democracy and legal institutions, conscientiously protect  citizens' legitimate rights and interests, ensure smooth  progress in reform and development, and promote overall social  progress. We should redouble our efforts to promote diligent  and clean administration, prevent corrupt practices  institutionally, and wage a resolute struggle against all kinds  of corrupt practices. We should promote the practice of  building the country through thrift and hard work, and oppose  extravagance and waste. We should continue to carry out  in-depth education on the legal system among all citizens so as  to heighten the legal sense in all segments of society. Leading  cadres at all levels should take the initiative in studying and  abiding by the law, strictly enforce the law, and safeguard the  dignity of the law. Governments at all levels must learn to  manage economic and social affairs through legal means and  exercise the reins of governance according to law. Acting in  accordance with the law, we should resolutely fight against  various criminal activities that seriously jeopardize people's  lives and property and hurt modernization, and earnestly  exercise comprehensive management over public security. We  should maintain and improve the system of autonomy for minority  regions, safeguard unity among various nationalities and  national unity, and promote common prosperity among various  nationalities. We should heighten the national defense  awareness of all people and intensify efforts to modernize  national defense.    The session urged: We should unswervingly uphold the  principle of carrying out two tasks simultaneously and paying  equal attention to both, and strengthen socialist spiritual  civilization. We should arm people across the country with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and strive to nurture a new type of  citizen with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education,  and a strong sense of discipline. We should devote great  efforts to developing science and technology, education,  cultural services, health care, and physical culture; promote  the close integration of science and technology with the  economy; and do a good job of educational reform and  development. We should firmly implement basic national policies  on family planning and environmental protection, and exploit and  utilize natural resources in a rational way.    The session pointed out: We should continue to firmly  implement the principles of "peaceful reunification and one  country, two systems" while actively advancing the great cause  of reunifying the motherland. To ensure the smooth change of  governments and smooth transition in Hong Kong and Macao, we  should lose no time in making all kinds of preparations for our  country's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong and Macao on the basis of the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of  China," the "Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative  Region of the People's Republic of China," and relevant  decisions by the NPC and its Standing Committee. Sino-  Portuguese cooperation on the Macao issue has proceeded  smoothly. The responsibility for the termination of talks  between representatives of the Chinese and British Governments  on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements rests entirely  with the British side. The Preliminary Working Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [SAR] should extensively unify Hong Kong compatriots and  make all kinds of preparations for establishing the Hong Kong  SAR and the first government and legislative body there in  accordance with the "Decision of the National People's Congress  on the Method for Forming the First Government and Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region." The  Chinese Government and people are determined and able to resume  the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule and to  maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. We  uphold the principle of one China in solving differences between  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait through increased contacts  and consultation. Realizing the peaceful reunification of the  motherland is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, and  any attempt at or action of splitting the motherland is useless.  We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities, especially the  Taiwanese people. We hope the Taiwan side will place national  interests above everything else and work with us toward  developing cross-strait relations and promoting the peaceful  reunification of the motherland.    The session pointed out: We should steadfastly carry forward  the independent foreign policy of peace, resolutely oppose all  forms of hegemonism and power politics, and maintain and develop  friendly relations and cooperation with other countries on the  basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China  attaches importance to human rights and is willing to attend  discussions on the human rights issue held by the international  community on an equal footing. However, it will never allow any  individual to interfere in its internal affairs under any  pretext. Along with people in other parts of the world, the  Chinese people will continue to contribute to establishing a new  international political and economic order that is just and  rational, to safeguarding world peace, and to promoting common  development.    The session urged people of all nationalities across the  country to work in concert, enthusiastically carry out reform,  rely on themselves, carry out arduous pioneering work, and  strive for new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization  under the CPC's leadership and under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line.</p>

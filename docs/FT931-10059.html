			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (17): Recession hits corporate scene hard - Fourteen companies left the FT500 while 28 slipped down the table / Nordic region THE recession hit the Nordic corporate scene hard during 1992. Fourteen companies in the region departed from the FT500 last year as a result and there were only three new arrivals. The severity with which the slump affected market capitalisation was underlined by the fact that 28 of the 40 Nordic-owned companies appearing in the 1992 FT500 dropped down the table from their rating in the previous year. By far the most successful sector turned out to be - as in 1991 - pharmaceuticals and health care. In overall 32nd place Astra, the Swedish company, easily topped the other Nordic entries in the FT500 with a market capitalisation of Dollars 11.70bn plus a 32 per cent improvement in turnover to Dollars 1.681bn and a 40.2 per cent jump in profits to Dollars 608.6m. It was followed by Swedish food and health care conglomerate Procordia with a Dollars 6.77bn valuation in overall 67th place. It recorded a 197 per cent profits increase to Dollars 590.8m though only a 4.1 per cent growth in turnover to Dollars 6.79bn. Novo-Nordisk, the Danish health care product company also performed well during 1992 with a rise up the FT500 table to 165th place from 209. It recorded a 28.2 per cent improvement in its profitability to Dollars 254.7m and a 16.2 per cent growth in turnover to Dollars 1.407bn. However, it was Gambro, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, which enjoyed the largest leap in the table of Nordic companies - up from 454 to 375  - with a 30.7 per cent growth in turnover and a 36.4 per cent profits increase. But the Swedish investment company Investor also achieved a clear improvement moving from 260th position to 196, mainly as a result of its merger with Providentia. Freia Marabou was a new entrant in 317th position as was the Norwegian shipping group Lauritzen coming in at number 340. The Swedish defence group Nobel Industries returned after an absence from the table in 1990 to 426th position. The largest drop down the FT500 table was suffered by Svenska Handelsbanken  -a fall from 183rd to 465 - followed by Skanska, Sweden's biggest construction group, which dropped from 169th position to 391 with a 12.6 per cent decline in its turnover and a modest 8.7 per cent profit improvement. Other notable setbacks were suffered by Norway's Saga Petroleum (down to 332 from 242); Danisco, the Danish food product conglomerate (a fall to 345 from 286) and Unidanmark, the Danish insurance group (down to 443 from 234). The most striking failure in 1992 came from the crisis-ridden Nordic financial sector. Of the 15 companies which dropped out of the FT500 in 1992, all but three of them (the Swedish forestry group MoDo, the Danish engineering company FLS and Nokia, the Finnish industrial conglomerate) were either in banking or insurance. Finland's two largest private commercial banks - Unitas and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki - both failed to stay in the table. So did Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Nordbanken in Sweden as well as the Swedish finance companies Hufvudstaden and Lundberg. Most of the leading Nordic insurance companies have also vanished from the top FT500. Both Sweden's Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP have dropped out as have Baltica Holding and Hafnia in Denmark. Among the Nordic countries Sweden has suffered the most significant loss of companies in the FT500. As many as eight went in 1992, reducing the number to only 21, a drop of nearly a third. By contrast Denmark performed more strongly. There are 10 Danish companies in the list, more than Finland and Norway put together. Carlsberg, the brewers, were the top Danish company in 158th position, a drop of 15 from its 1991 placing but it suffered a 6.3 per cent drop in its turnover to Dollars 1,634.5m and only a modest 8 per cent profits growth to Dollars 198.7m after a loss the previous year. A P Moeller, the Danish merchant shipping company that is made up of two parent companies - D/S af 1912 and A/S D/S Svenborg - secured 171st and 173rd places. Den Danske Bank returned to profitability but dropped from 184th to 204th. Finland's representation in the FT500 fell to a mere two companies - both from the paper and pulp sector - Kymmene and Repola. The picture was more stable in Norway with the Bergesen shipping group only just squeezing in at 500, having dropped 177 places. This left eight Norwegian companies in the FT500 headed by Norsk Hydro in overall 93rd position followed by the pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed, Freia Marabou and Saga Petroleum.</p>

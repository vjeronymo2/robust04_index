			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDY ORDERED ON CINEMA PROJECT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILWOMAN SAYS TRAFFIC FROM VAN NUYS COMPLEX WOULD SPILL INTO  NEIGHBORHOOD.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has ordered developer Ira Smedra, embroiled in a  dispute over development of a Studio City carwash site, to prepare an  environmental impact report for a Van Nuys project opposed by nearby residents.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously Tuesday to require Smedra to prepare the report  for a cinema complex that he wants to build in the 16300 block of Sherman Way  in western Van Nuys. In August, the council ordered Smedra to study the  environmental impact of a mini-mall that he wants to build on land occupied by  a now-closed Studio City carwash, gas station and restaurant.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the Van Nuys area where Smedra wants to  build an eight-screen cinema, restaurant and commercial center, said traffic  from the development would spill into surrounding neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Picus was particularly critical of Smedra's plan for handling parking at the  complex, which she said would discourage theatergoers from using the parking  lot. The plan allows parked cars to block others in when the lot gets full. The  drivers would leave their keys with attendants to permit the double-parked cars  to be moved.  </P> <P> "I believe that young people going to the theaters will not use that valet  parking," said Picus, who said her concerns were prompted by complaints from  neighbors.  </P> <P> But Smedra said in an interview that Picus misunderstood his parking plan. He  said that if the 663-space lot were to fill up, late arrivals would leave their  keys with attendants and pick them up again when they leave the show.  </P> <P> "It's the thing to do these days, the politically popular thing," said Smedra,  referring to the council's decision to require him to prepare an environmental  impact report. "Unfortunately some council members don't want to work with  developers."  </P> <P> Smedra has filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court to overturn the  council's August demand that he present an environmental impact report for the  project at the Studio City site. He said he will consider filing another suit  to reverse Tuesday's council decision.  </P> <P> He said environmental impact reports are "very costly, very time-consuming."  </P> <P> The Studio City suit, filed Oct. 13, contends that Smedra followed all city  rules and met all city staff requirements in proposing and planning his  mini-mall.  </P> <P> Picus said she decided to bring the Van Nuys project directly to the council  Tuesday, rather than waiting for it to be brought to the council through the  normal committee process, because she had been told that the Building and  Safety Department intended to allow it go forward without an environmental  impact report.  </P> <P> Instead of the report, Smedra would have had to meet certain other conditions.  Most of those conditions would have involved providing additional parking and  widening streets, Picus and Smedra said.  </P> <P> Officials from the Building and Safety Department knowledgeable about Smedra's  project could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geng Jun (5105 6511): "Changes in the Functions, </F> Organizational Structure, and Personnel Composition of the State  Planning Commission"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--New changes  have been made in the functions, the organizational structure,  and the personnel composition of the State Planning Commission,  which also has the reputation of being the "general staff  headquarters" of the State Council in the management of the  national economy.    The State Council recently approved the "Scheme for Changing  the Functions, the Internal Structure, and the Personnel  Composition of the State Planning Commission," which was  formulated through careful consideration over more than one year.    The State Planning Commission originally had 24 subordinate  departments and bureaus. If the part being merged into the  State Administration of Commodity Prices is included, there were  33 departments and bureaus. According to the new scheme, in the  future, the State Planning Commission will have only 22  functional departments, including the General Office, the Policy  Research Office, the Long-Term Planning and Industrial Policy  Department, the National Economic Comprehensive Management  Department, the Regional Land Management Department, the Science  and Technology Department, the Department for Investment in  Fixed Assets, the Department for Use of Foreign Funds, the  Finance and Banking Department, the Key Construction Department,  the Department for Comprehensive Use of Raw Materials and  Resources, the Department for Mechanical, Electrical, Light, and  Textile Industries, the Department for Rural Economy, the  Department for Price Supervision and Inspection, the Department  for Market and Price Regulation and Control, the Price  Management Department, the Foreign Economic and Trade  Department, and the Social Development Department. The number  of personnel in the State Planning Commission will be reduced  from more than 1,500 to 919.    After the structural reform, the State Planning Commission  will remain the highest-ranking department for the comprehensive  management of the national economy within the State Council.  Its functions will be strengthened in the following aspects:  Considering and formulating the long-term and intermediate-term  plans and major policies for national economic and social  development; forecasting, monitoring, analyzing the trends in  the operation of the national economy and announcing major  economic information; considering and arranging the distribution  of major productive forces and the development of local  economies, supervising the implementation of such arrangements,  and coordinating things in this regard; exercising comprehensive  and coordinated employment of such economic levers as financial  appropriation and credit arrangements in order to strengthen  macrocontrol over the national economy; supervising and  controlling the overall price level in the whole country; and  guiding the state reserves of major products and major  production materials that have a vital bearing on the national  economy and the people's livelihood.    The new scheme defines 11 [as received] functions of the  State Planning Commission. That is, giving advice; maintaining  the balance; adjusting and controlling the market; guaranteeing  the projects; studying the strategy; and formulating policies.  In the future, the State Planning Commission will base its work  on the development of the market economy, will make up for the  deficiencies of the market economy, and will guide, foster, and  control the market. Therefore, it will play a more important  role in the state's macroeconomic control.</p>

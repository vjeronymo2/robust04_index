In its commentary published today, the paper refers to the  current controversy over the question of the boycott, which came  into the open following the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement in September. The paper notes that the basic  prevailing conviction is that a settlement in the region will  have to lead to normal relations over a certain period of time,  something that the direct parties to the conflict acknowledged  from the start when they joined the multilateral talks for  economic regional cooperation.    The paper emphasizes that there was a general conviction  that  certain criteria governed the lifting of the different types of  boycotts as the settlement process progressed, but this  conviction has been somewhat shaken recently.</p>

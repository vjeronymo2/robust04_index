			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Goode proposal unworkable Sir, There is a fundamental flaw in the reasoning behind the Goode Committee's proposed minimum solvency requirement for occupational pension schemes ('Big pensions reforms urged', Octo-ber 1). Owing to the different investment profiles needed for ongoing pension schemes and for transfer value calculations, generally equities and gilts respectively, it is obvious that in the long term the proposed minimum funding requirement will nearly always exceed the projected accrued liability on a prudently assessed basis. This is simply due to the lower expected level of returns on gilts. This goes against what appears to be common sense, but it is a fact of life. The result of having to maintain such a solvency standard is likely to be a need for less volatile and lower yielding investments than are currently used, thus increasing the financial inefficiency of pension provision in this way. In fact, final salary pension schemes could become as inefficient and expensive as money purchase schemes. A further problem is that, if trustees wished to continue to have an efficient investment policy, the required margin in the funding target to ensure that the solvency requirement causes few difficulties would lead to an excessive level of funding under the surplus regulations. Let us hope that this is one area where common sense will prevail. As I identified in my presentations at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries' convention in Harrogate last month, a rigorous minimum funding standard such as is proposed by the Goode Committee would be unworkable in practice.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 19 , 2-7 May 94] </F>   [Text] President Leonid M. Kravchuk signed a decree, which  makes amendments to his June 12, 1993 Decree "On Measures To  Reduce Cash Circulation".    Considering earlier amendments, which were made by his  decrees of July 6, 1993, and October 22, 1993 the Decree's  latest tenor looks like this.    With a view to normalize currency regulation and reduce  money  emission rates    1. All juridical persons in Ukraine, irrespective of their  proprietorial form status and kinds of activities, as well as  natural persons including Ukraine's citizens, foreigners and  stateless persons, who are subject of business activities,    -- should effect one-time settling among themselves for  commodities, works, services and securities, the value of which  exceeds six minimal wages, on a cash basis only. Banks are  authorized to supply, within a calendar month, cash to  enterprises, organizations and institutions, which employ up to  3,000 personnel, for their current needs, in amounts within  fifteen minimal wages, and to those, which employ over 3,000  personnel, in amounts within thirty minimal wages. Cash, which  is needed for service trips, is not included in the above  current needs and is supplied by banks in accordance with the  established order;    -- should store cash at their counters within the  established  limits. Procedures for cash limits and control over their  observance are determined by the National Bank of Ukraine;    -- are entitled to keep at their cash counters sums in cash,  which exceed the established limits, only for payments of wages,  social welfare bonuses, stipends, pensions, and only for  periods, not greater than three work-days, including the day of  cash supply by banks.    Validity of paragraph 2 of this Article does not extend to  settling by collective agricultural enterprises and farmers with  trade organisations and institutions.    Provisions of paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article do not  extend  to natural persons, who are subjects of business activities.    2. Limits for cash balance for juridical persons should be  set by commercial banks servicing them based on settling data  submitted by them. In case of such settling data lacking, the  said limits are set by commercial banks on their own.  Commercial banks effect cash supply only on presenting to them  relevant substantiation, and exercise control over cash  application, as has been specified.    3. Juridical and natural persons, who are engaged in  procurement of agricultural products, wild fruits and berries,  herbs, waste paper and fabrics, glass containers and scrap from  the population, as well as juridical persons, who carry out  mortgage operations, are entitled to get cash to the full extent  of their settling with the population.    Trucking and automotive delivery enterprises and  organisations (which specialize in rendering transportation  services), which are engaged in inter-regional carriage, are  entitled to get cash to pay for fuels, which are purchased  beyond the boundaries of their location regions.    Control over advance sum spending (payments for fuels) is  exercised by the commercial banks.    Sums, which are due to citizens for products, which they  sell, may be remitted to their savings accounts only of their  own free will.    4. Banks should provide to juridical persons, who are  engaged in insurance activities, means to pay insurance sums  (insurance compensations) against insurance agreements of  voluntary and compulsory insurance, on a non-cash basis, except:    -- sums, payable to citizens in cash upon expiration of  their  insurance agreements or the agreements' preterm termination;    -- compensations payable to citizens in the form of  insurance  sums and insurance indemnities.    5. Enterprises, institutions and organisations including  those engaged in trade, which have permanent monetary returns  and which use them to pay wages, pensions and to purchase  agricultural products, are entitled to retain cash at their cash  counters for only three work days preceding payment terms  without limitations on cash spending.    6. Control over observance of this Decree's provisions by  juridical persons with the exception of commercial banks, and by  natural persons, who are subjects of business activities, is  exercised by the commercial banks, state taxation service  bodies, bodies of the state auditing service and the Ministry of  the Interior of Ukraine.    7. Sales of manufactured goods to citizens by trading  organisations and other enterprises and organisations, as well  as settling with natural persons, who deliver for commission  commodities (for units or batches, irrespective of their kind or  denomination) in excess of 200 minimal wages, should be effected  through Ukrainian banks' checks or through remittance of payment  orders to the depositors' personal accounts.    Check issuance by banks and money transfer to the citizens'  personal accounts in excess of the above stated amount of  minimal wages, are effected free of charge.    8. State taxation inspection bodies, based on materials of  their audits and documents, submitted to them by the commercial  banks, state auditing service, Ministry of the Interior of  Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine, should impose financial  sanctions, in the form of penalties in amounts of excessive  settling operations or extra-limit cash sums at cash counters,  on enterprises, institutions and organisations, which are guilty  of non-observance of this Decree's provisions, irrespective of  their proprietorial form and kind of activity, as well as on  natural persons, who are subjects of business activities and who  are guilty of similar offenses.    Liability for violation of requirements stated in paragraph  2  of Article 1 of this Decree involving exceeded sums of one-time  settling is incurred on juridical and natural persons, who paid  in cash.    In case of this Decree's violation by commercial banks,  financial sanctions in the form of penalties are imposed on them  at the National Bank's suggestion:    -- for cash payment without due reasons, in amounts of sums  unduly paid.    Penalties, provided for by this Article, are levied to the  state budget as unappealable.    9. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine together with the  National Bank of Ukraine should define procedures for  implementing this Decree's provisions.    [signed] L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine    [dated] Kiev, April 29, 1994</p>

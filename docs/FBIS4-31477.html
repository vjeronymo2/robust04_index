			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Presenting Thursday in the Sejm  the strategy for Poland, a government-approved document  outlining major policy lines to be implemented till 1997, Deputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said the  plan was comprehensive, dynamic and addressed to all Poles.    The plan sought to continue positive trends achieved under  previous cabinets and to solve problems that had piled up and  went unsolved. The present government had a different  perception of many issues than its predecessors had had, was  guided by a different set of values, and wanted to alleviate the  social costs of transformations under way in Poland, Kolodko  declared.    The cabinet expected to create 350,000 to 400,000 new jobs  by  1997, reducing unemployment by an equal number of people. A  successful implementation of the plan will mean an increase in  real wages by 11 percent over the coming four years, Kolodko  added. Average old age pension will grow by 12 to 13 percent  over that period.    The expected growth in the GDP over four years till 1997 is  22 percent. Consumption will grow by 15 percent, investments by  a higher figure. Exports are to grow twice as fast, which shows  that the strategy for Poland assumes export-led growth assisted  by strong investment component.    The plan assumes stability in the economic system to ensure  that government economic and financial policies are predictable  and readable to both the business community and ordinary  citizens.    Kolodko appealed to the opposition parties to join in the  effort of formulating solutions to major national problems, such  as the reform of the social security system, reduction of the  public debt, Poland's integration with the European Union, and  transformation of the Polish agriculture. "These are not  problems facing the government, or the opposition, they are  national problems," the minister remarked.    The strategy for Poland signals our determination to  continue  the process of reforms and charts their future course, Kolodko  stated. Integration with the European Union is a historic  process and we want to speed up its pace. We expect our  partners in the West to honour their commitments and agreements  signed with Poland.</p>

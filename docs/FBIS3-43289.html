Hydro-Congo announced,  according to state radio, that petrol and diesel fuel supplies  must be limited to 30 litres (eight U.S. gallons) per vehicle  per day, while selling in jerrycans is totally forbidden.    The latter measure aims to counter the flourishing black  market of recent weeks, which has seen a litre of fuel selling  for 1,000 CFA francs (3.4 dollars) instead of the official 600  CFA francs (two dollars).    Political trouble has led to the closure of the rail link  from the capital to the west African nation's oil city,  Pointe-Noire, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) to the east, which  has a refinery.    Bacongo, an opposition stronghold in the capital, was calm  Monday, following clashes on Friday between armed supporters of  the government and the opposition which left four people dead,  according to witnesses. Relative calm was reported from other  parts of the capital, but sporadic shooting was heard overnight  in the Talangai district in the north of the city.    Several women's associations called Monday for an end to the  violence, which has left at least 93 people dead since early  December, according to a tally compiled from hospital reports.</p>

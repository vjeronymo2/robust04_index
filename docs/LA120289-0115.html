			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICE DEVELOPS PLAN TO SLOW MAIL -- ON PURPOSE  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service is developing a controversial plan to provide slower  delivery of first-class mail.  </P> <P> Claiming that its customers prefer consistency over speed, the Postal Service  wants to shrink the geographic zones in which it provides overnight delivery of  first-class mail. More mail would be aimed for two-day and three-day delivery  zones.  </P> <P> Under the current system, a letter dropped in a mailbox in downtown Los Angeles  before 5 p.m. will be delivered the next day to locations as far away as San  Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Oxnard and Bakersfield.  </P> <P> The new zones might increase the delivery time to two days for letters from  downtown Los Angeles to San Diego and to Bakersfield.  </P> <P> As much as 20% to 30% of the nation's first-class mail could be shifted into  slower delivery schedules, according to Postal Service officials. In exchange,  they promise that the reliability of delivery would be improved.  </P> <P> The proposed change already has drawn criticism, however. The consumer advocate  for the independent Postal Rate Commission said the proposal would "degrade  first-class mail service," and he has invited state officials to intervene in  hearings next week on the issue.  </P> <P> "You might also wish to inform your congressman of your comments," the  commission's consumer advocate, Stephen A. Gold, said in a letter to the  consumer protection offices of all 50 states. A copy of his letter was made  available to The Times.  </P> <P> Gold said Friday he had taken the unprecedented step of inviting each state to  become involved in the issue to ensure that the proposal was fully aired before  being adopted.  </P> <P> "We didn't think this case was getting the notice it should have gotten," he  said. "We felt that unless there is grass-roots involvement, this thing would  just sail through. Maybe it should sail through, but we want to be sure people  are going in with their eyes wide open."  </P> <P> The New York Consumer Protection Board has asked to intervene in the case. "We  believe that postal service customers oppose any additional delay in the  delivery of first-class mail," the board said.  </P> <P> Despite the hearings, the Postal Rate Commission has only an advisory role on  this issue. Final decisions on delivery schedules are up to Postal Service  management. The Postal Service can simply ignore any finding by the commission.  </P> <P> Postal Service officials have been discussing the new delivery zones with  customers since October. They expect to announce the new delivery zones next  year, with the changes to be phased in between February and September.  </P> <P> Generally, overnight delivery zones would be redrawn along metropolitan lines  and would conform to local business marketing patterns.  </P> <P> For example, "a store in San Diego would not consider Los Angeles part of its  local trading area," said Greg Whiteman, director of the Postal Service office  of market research and systems management. Mail between the two areas, which  now moves overnight, might be put into the two-day delivery category.  </P> <P> The new zone plans will be drawn by Southern California division managers and  their colleagues among the nation's 73 postal divisions, Whiteman emphasized.  </P> <P> "We're meeting with our customers, banks, insurance companies, cruise lines,  telephone companies, and other major mailers to find out what they desire,"  said David Mazer, communications manager for the Los Angeles division. "Then we  will sit down with our counterparts in the rest of the basin and see what is  best for all our customers."  </P> <P> In return for slower service for some mail, the Postal Service would promise a  higher rate of accurate deliveries. The current target calls for delivering 95%  of the mail on time. The ratio of success is high in overnight zones -- about  95 of every 100 letters deposited in a mailbox before 5 p.m. currently are  delivered the next day.  </P> <P> But in a two-day zone, such as the region extending from Los Angeles to the  Mississippi River, only 88% to 90% of the letters are delivered on time. The  same performance applies to the three-day delivery, which covers letters  between any two locations in the continental United States.  </P> <P> "We need to provide the level of consistency the market needs," Whiteman said.  </P> <P> An 88% success ratio "is not good enough," he said. "We need to get the level  of performance up to the high 90s."  </P> <P> The Postal Service plan is generating growing opposition among business groups.  </P> <P> The American Bankers Assn. and its postal service committee "have mobilized  into action to fight this plan and need the help of bankers everywhere," the  association said in its weekly newspaper to bankers.  </P> <P> Noting that the Postal Service also is seeking higher rates in 1991, the ABA  said "the end result may well be that banks will pay more for less service."  Gas and electric utility companies "could lose overnight service in some  important areas," the Council of Public Utility Mailers, a trade group, said in  a filing with the Postal Rate Commission.  </P> <P> Postal officials were miffed at the efforts by Gold, the rate commission  consumer advocate, to involve state officials in the issue. They initially  suggested that he might be violating a federal law by allegedly using public  funds to lobby Congress.  </P> <P> "It was an absurd way of trying to embarrass me, and had nothing to do with the  issue of delivery standards," Gold said. The Postal Service acknowledged in its  most recent filing with the rate commission that no one had ever been  prosecuted under the law.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Regulatory regime provides underlying theme to document The theme underlying Oftel's consultative document is the regulatory regime which will hold sway after 1997 when the price cap mechanism is reviewed. In introducing about 70 pages of arguments and options Mr Cruickshank says: 'It may well be appropriate to move towards a regulatory framework which relies less on detailed intervention by the director-general in setting interconnection charges and rests more on him specifying the framework and allowing BT certain pricing freedoms within that, subject to a number of restrictions on anti-competitive behaviour.' Overtly, however, the paper is concerned with changes which can be made in a shorter time, to counter a growing tide of criticism since the duopoly review in 1991. Complaints: The industry complains that interconnection charges are not based on appropriate economic principles, that the access deficit contribution (ADC) is uncertain and complex, and that universal service issues are not clearly addressed. It also complains that Oftel has neither the power nor the will to force dominant operators to comply with the regulatory regime. BT has the only network covering the whole of the UK and the ADC is designed to help compensate BT for losses in accepting, routeing or delivering competitors' calls. It is not identical with the 'universal service obligation' (USO) which requires BT to guarantee an economic service to the isolated, old or infirm, although the access deficit includes most of the costs associated with BT's USO. In practice, only Mercury Communications, BT's principal competitor in the UK, pays ADCs and then only for part of its international traffic. The starting point for Oftel is areas that will not change before 1997. These include the cap on BT's prices, which is currently calculated as the retail prices index minus 7 1/2 per cent. Oftel says: 'It is delivering clear benefits to customers today . . . incentive regulation allows both BT's customers and its shareholders to benefit from improvements in efficiency. It would be wrong to undermine this incentive.' It also intends to retain BT's obligation to charge a geographically averaged tariff - essentially, the same prices to all customers regardless of location or market sector. 'This is vital to ensure that as competition develops in a somewhat fragmentary way, all customers benefit from this competition and not simply those in certain market sectors or geographic areas,' it says. Interconnection and ADCs: Oftel is equally emphatic about what will change - the ADC element of the interconnection charge. It says: 'The ADC regime will either change or be abolished as part of this current review.' The greater part of the paper is taken up with analysis of reform options of the ADC regime. Most of these would continue a system of close regulatory control of interconnection charges. 'Such regulation is inevitably very complex, it tends to be risk averse and intrusive. It is therefore for serious consideration whether the UK regulatory regime should now start to move towards a framework more suited to a competitive marketplace.' Oftel's preferred option involves BT setting its own interconnection charges. It suggests three variants which depend how competitive the network and retail markets are: 'The retail market is competitive but network bottlenecks remain. Oftel polices anti-competitive behaviour using licence conditions dealing with unfair cross-subsidies, undue discrimination, accounting separation and a possible new general provision on anti-competitive practices.' 'Were retail competition insufficient for Variant 1, a retail price cap and a requirement on BT's retail operations to make a reasonable rate of return could be introduced.' 'A further variant, closer to current market conditions, places a price cap on BT's network operations with, possibly, a price cap on BT-Retail.' Oftel asks: 'To what extent is it feasible or appropriate to have a less interventionist regime as the basis for setting interconnection charges? . . . Are the variants proposed feasible and within what timescale?' Policing competition: The prospect of a less interventionist regime raises questions about policing anti-competitive behaviour. There have been complaints that the existing regulatory regime has been inadequate in dealing with offenders and that its limitations will become increasingly obvious as competition grows. Oftel says that the principal problem it has experienced to date lies less in the scope of its powers but in enforcement procedures. It adds: 'A large number of complaints against licensees are resolved during the process of investigation or turn out to be unfounded. It is common for operators to change their behaviour unilaterally during the course of an investigation rendering the application of enforcement powers redundant.' It goes on to say, however, that general competition legislation carries with it a problem of timing. The time taken to complete an investigation reduces the ability to counter anti-competitive behaviour. Furthermore, there is no power under UK legislation either for the regulatory authorities or the affected parties to seek injunctive relief while an investigation is being carried out. 'In the time it takes to assemble all the information needed to carry out a Competitive Act investigation, to negotiate a licence modification, or even make an order or provisional order against an operator for contravention of a licence condition, the damage to competitors is done and cannot subsequently be undone,' Oftel says. It asks whether a new general licence condition prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour would be effective. Encouraging competition: The paper asks how to improve competition, pointing out that BT's market dominance - and particularly its scale and ubiquity - presents new competitors with substantial obstacles. Much current assistance to new competitors is provided through a waiver of the ADC which allows competitors to use BT's access network - connection to homes and businesses  -at a level of charges less than those allowing BT full recovery of costs. Oftel therefore discusses ways in which the ADC regime might be reformed to continue to provide assistance to competitors. It makes plain that it believes that until competition is more fully developed in the UK market there should be an explicit scheme of assistance, that it should be focused on new entrants rather than established businesses and that it should be available to network operators and to other forms of telecommunications businesses. Universal service: Oftel takes a detailed look at the USO, pointing out that with the development of new technologies, the definition is likely to change. At present BT is required to meet all reasonable demands for basic telephone services, including rural areas. But with the growth of multimedia and the information highway, what constitutes a basic service is arguable. At the most sophisticated it could involve individual access to a broadband, multiservice network allowing access to all services with 'band-widths of the order of 20 megabits per second (a high rate of information transmission) in both directions. This would enable virtually unlimited access to information including two-way high-definition video services'. Oftel says the whole industry should contribute to funding of the USO and that the mechanism for doing so should be clear and fair. A Framework for Effective Competition.

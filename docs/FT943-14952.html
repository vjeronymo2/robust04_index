			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher revokes scrip dividend Albert Fisher has revoked its scrip dividend alternative because a recent slump in the food processing and distribution group's share price means the cash dividend is worth substantially more to shareholders. Albert Fisher's shares have fallen from 56p at the beginning of June, when the scrip alternative was offered, to yesterday's close of 47p, up 1p on the day. The shares slumped from 63p in April, after the group announced a Pounds 51m rights issue to fund its purchase of Rahbek, a Danish-based seafood company. Analysts were critical at the time of the decision to issue high-yielding paper for an acquisition, but the rights issue was taken up by 90 per cent of existing shareholders - well above market expectations. There seems no specific reason for the continuing downward drift in the group's shares, although recent concern over high fish prices may have been a factor. One analyst said low produce prices in the US, where the group does significant business, had still not turned the corner. The Stock Exchange said all scrip dividend proposals had a get-out clause, so shareholders would not be disadvantaged by a fall in the share price, but said such cases 'were fairly few and far between'. All shareholders will receive the interim dividend of 1.85p per share for the six-month period to February 28.</p>

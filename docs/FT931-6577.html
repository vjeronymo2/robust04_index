			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 37m motorway improvement scheme The Secretary of State for Transport has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING the contract for the widening of the M6 motorway improvements between junctions 30-32, in Lancashire, valued at Pounds 37.5m. The works comprise the widening of the dual three-lane M6 motorway, between junction 30, which is the interchange between the M6 and the M61 at Blacow and junction 32 at the interchange between the M6 and the M55 at Broughton, to dual four-lane motorway standard. The work will be achieved by a combination of asymmetrical and parallel widening with a short section of off-lane replacement. Extensive environmental features include earth mounding and noise attenuation measures. Junctions 30 and 31 will be remodelled. Junction 31 is the junction of the M6 with the A59 and will include the realignment of the trunk road and roundabouts together with two new slip road bridges over the River Ribble. A new underbridge, together with provision for new south facing slip road stubs associated with a possible future junction 31A, are to be constructed. In addition, 15 bridges will be either demolished, demolished and reconstructed, widened and redecked or refurbished and extended. Hard shoulders, which have discontinuities at all bridges, will be made continuous throughout. Scheduled for completion in December 1994, the project also involves new lighting and motorway signalling erected on gantries. The consulting engineer for the development is Rendel, Palmer and Tritton.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tate turns sour Whatever one thinks of Tate &amp; Lyle's profit warning, the company deserves some credit for the way in which it was announced. A formal statement is more honest and open than dribbling out the information selectively to analysts, even if it does mean more abrupt swings in share prices. The 6 per cent fall in Tate's share price looks excessive when profits growth will still be in the mid-teens this year and the dividend is unaffected. It has a certain logic just the same. Tate is rapidly acquiring a reputation for not delivering on promises. Its failure to recover as quickly as expected from last year's setback in the US fructose market follows earlier disappointment with two high value-added products, Sucralose and Stellar, and the unexpected departure of Mr Stephen Brown as chief executive in March. Tate's strategy of focusing on its basic commodity business has two significant drawbacks. It is forcing the company into markets like eastern Europe where pay-back periods are long, and it subjects profits to the whims of politicians. The US fructose market would be less crowded if ethanol were allowed as a petrol additive and the North American Free Trade Agreement ratified, though the latter provides for only a gradual reduction in Mexican import tariffs. But one cannot count on these developments. Tate's historic yield of 4 per cent is only limited compensation for the uncertainty; Dalgety and United Biscuits offer more.</p>

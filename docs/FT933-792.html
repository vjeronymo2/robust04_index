			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / GrandMet surprises City with Pounds 175m restructuring GRAND Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, sprang another surprise on the City yesterday by announcing a Pounds 175m restructuring provision and issuing an upbeat statement on trading conditions and profits. The announcement follows Friday's unexpected promotion of Mr George Bull to the position of chief executive. It was widely applauded as an attempt to improve communications by a group renowned for its complex accounting arrangements. GrandMet said most of its operations were performing well and forecast that profits before exceptional items and tax for the year to September 30 would be about 5 per cent higher than last year's figure of Pounds 871m. The group's shares rose 10p on the news to close at 403p, reflecting relief among many investors, who had feared a fall in profits. The restructuring will involve the loss of about 3,000 jobs, many in the US, and is expected to yield annual savings of about Pounds 80m for two years. Around half the provision will involve cash outlays, to be completed by the end of next year. About Pounds 65m of the restructuring provision will cover the closure of four plants and the loss of 600 jobs at Green Giant, the frozen vegetable division of Pillsbury, GrandMet's US food manufacturing subsidiary. A further Pounds 60m will go towards the closure of unprofitable stores and asset write-offs by Pearle Vision, the US optical retailer owned by GrandMet. The remaining Pounds 50m will be used to reduce costs and staff levels across the group's other operations. GrandMet said that though many world markets remained weak, IDV, its drinks division, expected double-digit growth in operating profits this year. IDV had increased market share in the US and was benefiting from improved conditions in Britain. Pillsbury's sales volumes remained flat, though pricing pressures on Green Giant had recently eased. Excluding the restructuring plan, operating profits in food were expected to be above last year and to show a 'substantial' increase after currency translation. Burger King, the fast food subsidiary, enjoyed further sales growth, though sales at Chef &amp; Brewer, the UK pub division, would be down on last year. GrandMet said it was changing its accounting treatment of results from its Brazilian drinks business to adjust for hyper-inflation. This would result in a restatement of last year's pre-tax profits, which would be reduced by Pounds 12m to Pounds 859m.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The total amount of U.S.-made auto parts which 11  Japanese automakers purchased (through local procurement and  imports) in fiscal 1993 reached $15.54 billion, a 14.1 percent  increase over the previous fiscal year. A slight increase in  each automaker's purchase of U.S. parts is due to such factors  as the leveling off of local production in the United States and  a slump in exports following the yen's appreciation. Although  automakers have spelled out a goal of increasing the annual  purchase of U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994, under  the current situation it is impossible to also expect a sharp  increase this fiscal year. Because it seems difficult for them  to achieve the goal, this will likely affect the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, which are now in progress.    Fiscal 1993 is the second year of implementing the  "voluntary  plans" [for purchasing U.S. auto parts], which were announced by  each automaker after Japan-U.S. summit talks in early 1992.  Nissan Motor Co.'s purchase of U.S. parts reached nearly $3.5  billion in fiscal 1993, a 48 percent increase over fiscal 1992.  This increase is the largest among Japanese automakers. Its  imports of U.S. auto parts remained at the same level as the  previous fiscal year due to a decrease in imports following the  yen's appreciation. However, local production in the United  States increased by 21 percent thanks to good sales of its  popular cars, and the percentage of local procurement of parts  increased sharply.    Toyota Motor Corporation -- whose purchasing goal for fiscal  1994 accounts for one-third of the "$19 billion" -- purchased  U.S. auto parts totalling $4.65 billion in fiscal 1993, a 4.9  percent increase over the previous fiscal year. The increase  rate sharply dropped compared with (a 41.1 percent increase) in  fiscal 1992. Both Honda Motor Co., and Mitsubishi Motors  Corporation purchased more U.S. parts in fiscal 1993 than in the  previous year. However, the purchase of U.S. parts by Japanese  automakers as a whole increased slightly in fiscal 1993 due to a  drop in exports and a slump in domestic sales.    It is expected that major automakers' local procurement of  U.S. parts in the United States will increase steadily in fiscal  1994, the final year of the voluntary plans. This is because  Toyota started operations at its second plant in Kentucky in  March and because Nissan intends to start full-fledged operation  of its plants to produce 450,000 cars annually in the United  States. However, since small automakers are still facing a  tough situation, it is observed that "it is difficult for them  to increase purchases of U.S. parts to more than $3 billion in  total during one year," (according to an executive of a major  automaker).    During U.S. President Bush's visit to Japan in 1992, the  Japanese automobile industry announced that it would target a  goal of $19 billion for its purchase of U.S. auto parts for  fiscal 1994." Based on the goal, each automaker separately  spelled out this March a purchasing plan for fiscal 1996 and  1997. Because the U.S. Government has demanded further increase  in Japanese automakers' purchase of U.S.-made parts, a delay in  their purchasing plan due to a slump in the Japanese automotive  market will likely have a delicate influence on future  negotiations between Japan and the United States.</p>

A group of 60 guerrillas seized a stretch of the road about  mid-way between the port and the capital early Friday.    The guerrillas proceeded to hold up cars and rob their  occupants, the police official said. [passage omitted]    Government forces were sent to the area and traffic was held  up as the two sides exchanged fire.    After some 30 minutes the government troops managed to repel  the guerrillas, who retreated into nearby forest, and cars were  allowed pass, the police officer said.    The officer had no information on casualties.    Another police officer said that the guerrillas were  "probably angry" because the government forces had recently  attacked their bases in Kompong Speu Province which lies between  the capital and the Sihanoukville.    Government forces bombarded Kompong Speu Province Saturday  with leaflets urging the guerrillas to defect, a military  official said.    One of the leaflets carried an appeal from co-premiers  Prince  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen which urges the guerrillas " to  stop following the belligerent policy of the Khmer Rouge  hardliners which will be disastrous for the national society of  the whole Kingdom of Cambodia" and called on them to defect  quickly.    Printed on the other side of the leaflets were several  colour  photos of a smiling Ranariddh shaking hands and handing out  clothing to guerrillas who had defected.    The text of a second leaflet from the military called on the  guerrillas to desert as soon as possible to avoid a "forthcoming  confrontation".    Meanwhile Thai immigration officials said they had closed  the  border crossing at Poipet as government forces attacked nearby  Khmer Rouge positions in northwestern Banteay Meanchey Province.  It was the first reported clash after a three day lull in the  fighting in the area.    Government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas had clashed daily  since  Thai military officials reported the government had launched an  offensive on the guerrillas' bases starting New Year's day.    Meanwhile Minister of Tourism Veng Sereivut said Saturday  that "specific measures" were to be taken to ensure security  along the road to Sihanoukville.    He refused to elaborate but said the defence and interior  ministries had been instructed to do everything possible to  maintain security along the vital road. [passage omitted]</p>

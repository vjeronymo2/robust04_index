			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Likud faces period of feuding over selection of new leader SUDDENLY, the familiar self-assurance of Israel's Likud leaders, cultivated over a decade-and-a-half in power, evaporated, Hugh Carnegy reports. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister for seven of the last nine years, managed to prop up a smile, but the crumpled features of his colleagues at the party's election headquarters told the story. The Likud, which swaggered into government under the late Menachem Begin in 1977, had now suffered the kind of defeat it then inflicted on the Labour party. The party's total of 32 seats in the Knesset (parliament) was eight less than it won in 1988 and the lowest it has held since 1969. Mr Shamir, in a rare show of emotion, appealed for unity in a flailing speech to party workers in which he vowed that the Likud and its vision of a 'Greater Israel' would bounce back. But in the short term it is more likely that the party will be riven by internal feuding over the succession to Mr Shamir which began well before Tuesday's vote. At 76, the tenacious Mr Shamir may yet hang on awhile in an effort to hold the party together. But he himself signalled that he will not go on indefinitely. 'I am at the end of my personal road,' he said. The election loss must be laid largely at his door. The master for years of reactive leadership, he was found hopelessly wanting when the challenges to Israel of the last two years demanded initiative. He lost the confidence of many Likud supporters by his stalling approach to the Middle East peace process. He allowed the economy to drift when it faced the burden of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union and he did nothing to prevent his potential successors fighting a bitter public battle. The consequence was that more than half the 250,000 immigrant voters plumped for Labour and its allies. Significantly, it also appears that thousands of the Likud's old bedrock supporters among Sephardi (oriental) Jews in hard-up Israeli development towns defected. The senior candidates to succeed Mr Shamir will be Mr Moshe Arens, the outgoing defence minister, Mr Ariel Sharon, housing minister, and Mr David Levy, the foreign minister. But the party may look for rejuvenation to Mr Binyamin Begin, son of Menachem Begin and a charismatic figure, who has already said he would stand.</p>

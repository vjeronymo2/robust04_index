			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Under the idyllic volcano - On Safari Among the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, Nevis is one of the smaller islands. It is sister island to St Kitts. Nevis is very much the little sister, a village of an island, 9,000 people clustered around a dormant volcano with the sea lapping at their feet, writes Michael J. Woods. Nevis is in the group known as the Leeward Islands, which seems to mean little for the wind blows constantly, especially up in the hills, and keeps the humidity at comfortable levels: the perfect climate for the active, I thought, for I am a restless soul and cannot be doing with endless days on the beach. Like many of its neighbours, Nevis has a history of sugar plantations dating from the 17th century. The remains of some of the sugar estates are still being found. I visited several in the company of a local guide, David Rollinson. Each had a windmill built like a nuclear silo to withstand the battering of hurricanes and the agitation of earthquakes - the price to be paid for living on an otherwise perfect island. Jim Johnson, another guide, led me to a sugar mill ruin he had only recently discovered, buried in a secondary growth of jungle. The remains of the private chapel were almost filled with living pillars of weeping fig stems. The weeping fig is a fast-growing and prolific tree, and there is a great spreading example at the entrance to Montpelier Plantation Inn which was my home for the week. It casts dense shade over the front of the main building, once part of a sugar factory. The great house no longer exists but is notable for being the place where Nelson married Frances Nisbet in 1787. The Montpelier is perfectly located on a saddle on the lower slopes of Nevis' volcano. It has such a relaxing atmosphere that I could feel my resolution to be active seeping away as each day passed. Like many similar islands, Nevis has suffered from the damage caused by imported mammals. Goats, sheep, pigs and donkeys do little for the indigenous flora while mongooses, and the rats they were brought in to control, have eliminated the native agoutis, iguanas and edible frogs. While the bird life is limited, there were enough fish to satisfy anyone. To see them, Julian Rigby took me in his boat across the two-mile strait to St Kitts. Fish, mainly small and in electric blues and yellows, played and fed among the coral and sea fans. Occasionally I would glimpse something more subtle, a flat fish rippling beneath the sand, for instance. Sometimes it was more sinister: when five larger, almost circular fish, in silver edged with blue, swam through in line astern, every inhabitant of this underwater world fled. St Kitts was also the location of my most active exploit of the week, climbing Mount Liamuiga. This is St Kitts' volcano, 3,700ft high and topped with cloud forest. The route we followed was carved out of the mountain-side through the rain forest by slaves in 1690. Greg Pereira drove us in his Landrover through steep cane fields to the edge of the forest where we stopped for a picnic breakfast. We were already promisingly high. From here he pointed to our destination on the crater rim, 1,000ft below the summit proper. The forest was cool and delightful, full of tree ferns and palms. Some tall trees had buttress roots and others had been overtaken by strangler figs, while the ground was green with soft club moss. The path steepened until, at times, we were climbing ladders of roots. But the views both over the island and down into the forested crater, with its occasional sulphur-fringed fumeroles, were worth the climb. On my last day I went to find Nevis' water source, up a track spiralling around the mountain. But, after an hour or so, the attraction began to fade and I found visions of a cool dip and a leisurely lunch by the pool at the Montpelier floating into my mind. The sun seemed to get hotter and the hills became increasingly steep. I never did reach that spring. Michael Woods was a guest of Montpelier Plantation Inn, PO Box 474, Nevis, West Indies, (tel: 809-4693462). His visit was arranged by Caribbean Connection (UK tel: 0244-341131), whose prices for seven nights at Montpelier start at Pounds 946 per person, including flights and breakfast.

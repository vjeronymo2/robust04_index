			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The Long View: When brass is greener THAT VULGAR people should make a lot of money by going into 'trade' has long been deemed offensive by the more refined classes in Britain. But there are more interesting trends behind the present explosion of protest over the rewards of top businessmen. The same resentment, after all, is apparent in less elitist America, where executive pay has reached extraordinary levels. Once, you had to create a business rather than run it in order to become truly rich. But not any more. Remember that the average wage in Britain, the would-be sweatshop of the European Community, is Pounds 16,500 a year. The rate of earnings growth has slowed from about 6 per cent in 1992 to 4 per cent at the latest calculation. Last year, however, the average director of a constituent company of the FT-SE 100 index received some 13 per cent more even though, on average, profits fell and dividends stagnated. This is no more than the continuation of an established trend. Throughout the 1980s, the pay of top executives of listed companies rose roughly twice as fast as that of humble workers. We have been seeing a step change in differentials. The opportunity for this arose in Britain from 1979 onwards when top salaries ceased to be restrained by pay controls and there were high marginal income tax rates (which favoured non-pay benefits). The primary reason for the shift, however, is to be found in the changes in corporate ownership patterns which have presented executives with hitherto undreamt-of power because of the bizarre strategy of institutional shareholders. Pay levels of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1m are now quite common for big company bosses. Moreover, they are positioned to make extravagant raids on company pension funds, being granted retirement incomes vastly out of proportion to the contributions paid on their behalf (although the Pounds 75,000 cap on eligible salary imposed in 1989 will, gradually, restrict this bonanza). Finally, these pay levels do not even reflect high contractual risks because vast compensation packages are paid out even to executives who have cost shareholders dear. In an earlier phase of capitalism, companies were run by proprietors. They would direct the strategy and, as owners, would have a clear long-term commitment. However, they would hire managers to run the factories. A good manager was worth a decent salary, and might even be encouraged to wear a bowler hat, but he would not be allowed to get above himself; he called the proprietor 'sir' (or, in a family company, 'Mr John' or 'Mr Richard') and could be replaced easily. It is quite different in the modern public company. Some 60 per cent of the shares are, in a typical case, owned by institutional investors. They do not have the time or the inclination to act as proprietors. They treasure the right to sell at will, a freedom they would lose if they were to enter into commitments and thereby become 'insiders'. In place of proprietors, we now have recommended boardroom structures. These have been defined clearly recently by the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. Guidelines have been laid down for the chairman and the non-executive directors. Compensation committees and audit committees are supposed to keep boardroom greed under control and ensure that distant shareholders are properly informed. It is proprietorship by proxy, and the clear message from the grotesque pay spiral is that it is not working. Who exactly are these proxy proprietors, the non-executive directors? There are two pools. One is a group of professional directors and advisers, of highly variable experience and status and of uncertain effectiveness. The other consists of senior executives who are encouraged to take up non-executive directorships in other companies. They are classic cuckoos in the nest. The idea is that they can pass on their wisdom and spot trouble in the making. Perhaps, but they are managers playing at being proprietors, and it is dangerous to muddle up the roles. It is plainly in their self-interest to encourage the pay spiral, which they are doing with some vigour. They may, of course, consider that they are being given nods and winks by the institutional shareholders, whose bosses are themselves benefiting from exactly the same widening of differentials. For instance, I liked the story of George Greener, the chairman and chief executive of the life insurance company Allied Dunbar. Greener, who ekes out an existence on the modest salary of Pounds 660,000, took on another responsibility recently within the parent BAT Industries. He did this without extra remuneration because - a spokesman explained - money isn't everything. His near-namesake Sir Owen Green, who has just retired as chairman of BTR (where he was paid a pittance of Pounds 217,000) has attacked rampant greed in the boardroom. But are top managers really any greedier than they ever were? What appears to have changed is that they have the opportunity. One or two leading institutional shareholders, such as PosTel and Gartmore, appear at least to be seeking more information about what is being decided in the remuneration sub-committees. But the institutions will have to organise themselves properly, and lay down appropriate benefit scales, if they are to gain control of top executives' pay. Managerial capitalism is taking over from proprietorial capitalism. The rewards are being diverted to where the real power is. For a glimpse of the future, look at the pay packages worth tens of millions of dollars being enjoyed by top US executives. To head this off, British institutions will have to form strategic commitments to companies and be ready to supply control and direction. The top executives of the companies should be made to feel a little scared, and should judge that it is appropriate to say 'sir' when speaking to their owners. But perhaps, to soothe bruised egos, they could be permitted to wear bowler hats.</p>

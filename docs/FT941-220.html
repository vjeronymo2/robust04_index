			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Belgium trims key interest rates: Economic watch Belgium yesterday became the latest country to follow the downward trend in European interest rates by trimming two of its key money market rates. The central bank cut its central rate from 6.15 per cent to 6.05 per cent and its end-of-day rate to 7.55 per cent from 7.65 per cent. The central rate is an overnight lending rate for primary dealers of government debt. The end-of-day rate is an overnight lending rate for all other banks. The Belgian cut follows the fall in the German repo rate from 5.80 per cent to 5.76. 'There has been greater political stability, the Belgian budget control has been completed and we have had business surveys showing a big increase in confidence,' said Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque. West German construction will experience a 1.5 per cent rise in activity this year after a 0.5 per cent decline in 1993. French retail sales fell an estimated 3.8 per cent last November compared with the average of the three previous months.</p>

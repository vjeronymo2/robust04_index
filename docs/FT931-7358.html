			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Clinton and Major agree on Bosnian air-drops President Bill Clinton last night secured a general endorsement from Mr John Major, the British prime minister, for Bosnian air-drops, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. After White House talks, Mr Major described air-drops as 'an imaginative way' to bring relief. Earlier he said he was 'not remotely concerned' about retaliation against British troops in Bosnia. Missions will be 'safe, effective and will not draw the US into the military conflict,' said Mr Clinton. He hoped other nations would join in the operation. He said he did not expect the UK to participate since it 'has done its part' by providing troops to help relief convoys get through.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tour operators The 20 per cent fall in Owners Abroad's share price since it escaped the clutches of Airtours amounts to an unusually swift judgment. The shares are still higher than before the bid was launched, but the scramble to accept Thomas Cook's 150p tender offer hardly amounts to a vote of confidence in the long-term prospects. Since Airtours has also suffered a bout of post-bid depression, the conclusion must be that some of the mud thrown during the fight has stuck. Yet the prospects look brighter than at the turn of the year. The odds on a recovery in consumer spending have improved and both report good early-season bookings. Since the government declined to refer the bid to a monopolies inquiry, both are free to squeeze independent operators and improve vertical integration by buying more travel agents. That leaves plenty of scope for organic growth and piecemeal acquisitions. During the bid, Owners also promised more savings from its alliance with Thomas Cook. Bid costs - anything up to Pounds 10m for Airtours, less than half that for Owners - might take the shine off the shares. More importantly, by highlighting the scope for price competition the bid did no favours to the sector. An all-out price war looks unlikely this year while bookings are well up with expectations and Thomson's market leadership is unchallenged. Whether the same holds true of next year remains open. The market has recognised as much.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Carlton The rehabilitation of Carlton Communications continues apace. Yesterday's 15 per cent annual profits improvement underpins the share price recovery that has occurred over the past two years. Carlton's troubles were never as dire as first depicted. In retrospect, its problems stemmed more from a clumsy shift from first to second gear rather than a slamming into reverse. Appropriately, for a company specialising in visual entertainment, Carlton now offers highly visible earnings growth. The video cassette division continues to grow strongly after a near-50 per cent rise last year, while Carlton promises that a raft of new video equipment will jolly profits along too. Carlton Television will start broadcasting next month. Although it will hardly contribute in the current year, it may add Pounds 20m to profits by 1994. Carlton should also benefit from a currency kick this year which may enable it to surpass its historic profits peak of Pounds 127m - even though earnings may not do the same until 1994. That said, one wonders how deep the market's renewed love affair with Carlton can be. Carlton's historic rating is now sandwiched between the likes of Wellcome and Glaxo. Should the quality of earnings from Hollywood be rated as highly as those derived from the frailties of human health?</p>

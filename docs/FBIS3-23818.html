			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former Georgian Minister of Defense Tengiz </F> Kitovani by Victor Mironov, under the rubric "Personalities;"  place and date not given: "A Georgian of Pro-Russian  Orientation"]    [Text] Tengiz Kitovani is truly a multifaceted man. A  politician who at one time was acting prime minister; a military  commander who until last May headed the Georgian Ministry of  Defense; a man who has also dabbled in both sculpture and  painting. In Tbilisi, though, he is known as A GEORGIAN OF  PRO-RUSSIAN ORIENTATION.    In personal contact, Tengiz Kalistratovich is a very  friendly, albeit reserved and laconic interlocutor. He saw me in  a modest room in a small hotel located on a quiet Moscow  street.    [Mironov] What capacity do you have now?    [Kitovani] I am merely a deputy to the Supreme Council of  Georgia.    [Mironov] What is the purpose of your visit to Moscow?    [Kitovani] After the Abkhazian events I decided to get some  rest. I went to Germany, and from there to Moscow--to see my  friends, move away from political affairs, relax.    [Mironov] What is your appraisal of the recent meeting  between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze?    [Kitovani] I have been waiting for this meeting for a long  time. It should have taken place earlier--then perhaps we would  not have had tragedy in Abkhazia and perhaps the entire country  of Georgia as well. Two years have been wasted in this respect.  A meeting should have taken place as soon as Shevardnadze  came--or, to be precise, returned--to power in Georgia. Now it  is a very belated step. With Georgia on its knees and out of the  ruble zone, this rendezvous will at best result in a formal  warming in Russian-Georgian relations. It is impossible to  refute the fact that currently Tbilisi has suffered a complete  defeat in the domestic political arena and at the world level.    [Mironov] Are there prospects for a final and mutually  acceptable settlement in the Georgian-Abkhazian issue?    [Kitovani] Resolution of this problem depends to a very  great  extent on Russia and its policy regarding its southern neighbor.  The search for a solution to the problem should have been  conducted not in Geneva but in Moscow, within the framework of a  trilateral dialogue. I am afraid that Abkhazia is irretrievably  lost for Tbilisi. But this is only half the trouble--next is the  problem of the Tskhinvali region.    [Mironov] Mr. Kitovani, what is your opinion of the Georgian  leader's policy?    [Kitovani] In his two years of rule Shevardnadze has made a  great many mistakes. However, the roots of the fault lie in the  period when he was still a party boss. This is when active steps  should have been taken toward resolving overdue problems  regarding both the Abkhazian and the Ossetian people. That is,  these issues have been awaiting settlement for a long time--way  back under the communist regime headed by Shevardnadze. The  current Georgian leader is called a reformer, although no  reforms came about during his time. His policy remains the same  as it was when the USSR existed. In principle, it has not  changed. Shevardnadze, in particular, maintains that he has  become a Christian and has forsaken communist ideas. In reality,  however, he remains the same communist he has been for a long  time. A man who for 60 years believed in communist ideals and  principles cannot suddenly change his mentality.    [Mironov] Where do you see Georgia's political priorities at  this difficult stage of its development?    [Kitovani] Historical experience shows that Georgia as a  Christian state always gravitated to Byzantium. After the  disintegration of the Byzantine empire the banner of Orthodox  faith was picked up by Russia. I think that instead of looking  toward West Europe and the United States, Shevardnadze should  have oriented himself toward Russia and walked in step with its  political course. I myself have always believed in this, and  therefore in Georgia I am frequently accused of being a man of  pro-Russian orientation. But it is not accidental that our  ancestors believed it necessary to maintain friendly relations  with the Russian people. This is the policy Georgia should have  conducted--seeing Russia as the main ally and friend of Georgia.    [Mironov] Whom do you respect in the Georgian political  establishment?    [Kitovani] I very much like my namesake Tengiz Sigua. In my  opinion he is a very smart economist and politician.    [Mironov] And in Russia?    [Kitovani] In response to this I can only express my deepest  regret that Yegor Gaydar has left the Russian political scene  for now.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Markets: Paying the price of mortgage certainty - Serious Money SHOULD homeowners fix their mortgage rates? The building societies are falling over themselves to offer fixed rate deals at the moment, and those who suffered from the high rates of the late 1980s may be tempted. But as a hardened cynic, my suspicion is that the time when fixed rate deals are widely available is the very time when borrowers should ignore them. Obviously, all depends on the future direction of interest rates. And while there may only be limited scope for rates to fall very far this year - the UK is at the mercy of the Bundesbank's determination to squeeze inflation out of the German economy - there is the chance of significant falls over the next couple of years. What sort of fixed rates are on offer? Alliance &amp; Leicester is offering 9.99 per cent, fixed for two years; Bristol &amp; West will lend at 10.5 per cent for two years, or 10.75 per cent for five; Cheshire will fix the rate at 9.39 per cent for six months, followed by 10.39 per cent till end 1997; the Chelsea is offering 10.25 per cent till September 1995; Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester will lend at 9.9 per cent for two years; N &amp; P is offering 10.75-10.85 per cent till 1995 or 1997; Nottingham Building Society is offering 9.1 per cent fixed till August 1, 1993; TSB will lend at 10.15 per cent for three years, or 10.25 per cent for five. In all cases, readers should check carefully for arrangement fees, compulsory buildings insurance, and restrictions on the type of mortgage which applies (some rates are only available on endowment or pension mortgages). Given that mortgage rates have been as high as 15.4 per cent within painful recent memory, all those rates may seem highly attractive. They also look good when one considers that the average interest rate on three month money has been 12.25 per cent since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. But things may have changed for good following the UK's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System. If the ERM discipline works, then the UK should face a period of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. The key is what level of real rates (interest rates minus inflation) investors are prepared to accept. After a period of negative real rates in 1979-80, real rates have settled into a band between 4 and 8 per cent for much of the Conservatives' period in office. For the moment, with interest rates at 10.5 and retail price index inflation at 4 per cent, the real rate is 6.5 per cent. Now, of course, one can argue about the best index for measuring inflation. If one excludes mortgage payments, the inflation rate is a rather higher 5.7 per cent, reducing the real interest rate to 4.8 per cent. That is still a pretty decent return. High real rates, in essence, represent the level of investor fears of the prospects of future inflation. If investors expect inflation to come under control, at least in the medium term, then one would logically expect interest rates to fall. Real rates might not fall dramatically. Simon Briscoe, analyst at Greenwell Montagu, believes that financial deregulation and the greater sophistication of consumers means a greater propensity to borrow. A price has to be paid for this, he argues, and that price is strongly positive real yields. Nevertheless, if real rates only fell to the bottom of the recent range (ie 4 per cent), then interest rates could easily drop to 8 per cent on current inflation levels. That indeed is the prediction of Greenwell Montagu for the end of 1993 (although the broker's inflation forecast for that period is 3.5 per cent, implying a real rate of 4.5 per cent). Some encouragement for borrowers may also be found in the gilts market. Traditionally, the yield on gilts has been higher than on short term deposits, to compensate investors for the risk of making a long term investment. This is known as a positive-sloping yield curve. Since around 1984, however, short-term interest rates have been higher than yields on long gilts, creating what in the jargon is known as an 'inverted' yield curve. In part this may have been caused by the government's healthy financial position in the late 1980s, which allowed it to repay many gilt issues. By creating a shortage of long gilts, this may have pushed gilt prices up (and yields down). Now, however, the government is back in financial deficit and is set to sell around Pounds 2bn of gilts a month. Gilt yields, however, are only at 9-9.5 per cent, well below base rates. If the historical tradition repeats itself, and the yield curve becomes positive, or even merely flat, then there is scope for short term interest rates to fall to 9 per cent. Even with the margin over base rates set by building societies, that means that mortgage rates could easily fall to 9.75-10 per cent. And if Greenwell Montagu is correct, then mortgage rates could be 8.75-9 per cent by the end of next year. Of course, such optimistic predictions about inflation and interest rates may be wrong, and borrowers may well be attracted by the certainty that fixed rates provide. But they should be aware that such certainty may have its price.</p>

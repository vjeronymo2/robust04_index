			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Brittan and Kantor try again on Gatt deadlock THE SCOPE of the Uruguay round package of global trade reforms will hinge critically on significant deadlock-breaking initiatives from top US and European Union trade officials when they meet in Washington next week, according to trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which oversees the Uruguay Round, told a meeting of all trade negotiators that it was 'particularly urgent that the major trading powers bring to the table a decisive contribution that will enable us to achieve the balanced package necessary to conclude the round.' He warned of the danger that participants in the negotiations will withdraw conditional market opening offers 'unless there is a determined and vigorous effort next week to move the market access package forward decisively'. The comments add weight to an increasing awareness that the Kantor-Brittan meeting in Washington on Monday and Tuesday next week will play a critical part in shaping the final Uruguay Round package. Negotiators remained confident yesterday that agreement will be reached by the December 15 deadline, but emphasised that the outcome of the Washington talks would determine whether it would be a 'big agreement', or more modest in its scope. Both the US and the EU have assembled large technical teams to back their top trade negotiators in the event of any breakthrough in Washington. These will cover farm trade, trade in goods, financial services, subsidies and dumping rules. Trade negotiators who only a day earlier were praising US President Bill Clinton for his success in winning Congressional support for the North American Free Trade Agreement were yesterday fiercely critical of issues being raised by the US which are jeopardising progress towards an agreement. The US was criticised in particular for putting conditions on its offer dealing with trade in financial services, and for wanting to insulate its tax authorities from multilateral discipline if they were ever to discriminate against foreign companies. Mr Sutherland complained that these moves 'may prove utterly counterproductive'. Several countries have threatened to withdraw their offers in financial services if the US does not change its position. These include India, Malaysia and Hong Kong. 'Unless there is an urgent review of these positions, not only will the effort we have made to improve existing offers falter, but the important progress that we have already made may begin to unravel,' said Mr Sutherland. He called on the US to tackle 'domestic interests who may take unrealistic positions on what it is possible to achieve in this first multilateral negotiation.' Mr Les Samuels, the US Treasury assistant secretary responsible for tax policy, is due to arrive in Geneva on Monday to explain the present US position, and to listen to reactions. Judging from the views expressed by trade negotiators yesterday, Mr Samuels must expect some uncomfortable discussions. The US has also been attacked for trying to weaken proposed anti-dumping rules.</p>

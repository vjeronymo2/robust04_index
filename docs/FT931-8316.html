			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: South China Morning Post lags at mid-term SOUTH China Morning Post Holdings, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which publishes Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, has reported slower first-half profits but plans to pay an unchanged interim dividend. Net profit for the six months to ended December fell to Dollars HK253.8m (USDollars 32.8m), a 5 per cent decline from the Dollars HK267.3m recorded in on 1991. The interim dividend is being held at 6 cents a share. The profits decline was a result of the acquisition of loss-making Chinese language newspaper Wah Kiu Yat Po. An additional factor was a substantially increased tax bill, due to the company having had fully utilised tax losses that had resulted in minimal tax over the previous five years. Tax increased from Dollars HK37,000 to Dollars HK34.8m, but the company predicted that net profit for the full year would exceed the 1992 level. After years of inactivity, the publishing group recently signed up a Dollars HK500m deal to sell its premises in Quarry Bay to Swire Pacific, moving its printing and distribution oper-ations to the New Territories. The company has also purchased a 15 per cent stake in the Bangkok Post in Thailand, while it is currently endeavouring to turn around the ailing Wah Kiu Yat Po. Kong Wah Holdings, the Hong Kong consumer electronics group, has ventured into China's container port development through a joint venture with a Shenzhen-based concern, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. The venture, Shenzhen Harbour City Industrial Development, will have an initial capital of about 160m yuan (USDollars 27.7m). It will develop container terminals and a warehouse complex in the development zone. The Chinese partner is Nanhai Oil Shenzhen Development and Service.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND WORKERS RATIFY PACT GIVING FIRST RAISE IN 7 YEARS  </P> <P> The Disneyland workers who do everything from operating rides to sweeping Main  Street voted by a wide margin Saturday to accept the company's latest contract  offer, which includes the first hourly pay increase for them in seven years.  </P> <P> The vote was 886 "yes" to 493 "no," 64.2% of the total ballots, well above the  51% needed to approve the new three-year contract.  </P> <P> But the voting left reaction mixed among many of the workers.  </P> <P> "The people who voted 'no' are mad and those who voted 'yes' were motivated by  short-term profits," said Ross Jones, an eight-year employee who voted against  the company proposal. "They paid more for the Muppets than they did for their  own workers."  </P> <P> But others were more satisfied.  </P> <P> "This has gone above all that I expected," said Miles Ketchum, 20, who has been  with Disneyland for two years.  </P> <P> Union negotiators had urged the 2,400 Disneyland workers to approve the  company's latest contract offer in speeches before the balloting in morning and  evening sessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Members of 5 Unions  </P> <P> The employees are represented by a coalition of five unions and make up 30% of  Disneyland's full-time, permanent staff of 8,000. Disneyland's offer included a  5.5% pay increase for two 18-month periods in the three-year contract, said Tom  Ramsay, a spokesman for Disneyland.  </P> <P> For example, a senior ride operator now making $9.94 an hour would get an  immediate raise to $10.48. A culinary worker now making $8.54 an hour would get  $9.  </P> <P> The contract also includes an additional 25-cent-an-hour increase for job  foremen.  </P> <P> In other concessions from the company: A provision allowing management to force  workers to switch jobs was dropped. The company also agreed to drop a plan to  cut back on health benefits.  </P> <P> Five years ago, workers went on a 22-day strike that bruised an already  volatile relationship with management. That action, which pitted strikers  against employees who stayed on the job, was the longest strike in the park's  history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lump-Sum Bonuses  </P> <P> In their previous contract, which expired midnight Thursday, workers had agreed  to accept lump-sum bonuses instead of across-the-board pay increases. Once  again, the pay increase became a key issue.  </P> <P> By Friday morning, Disneyland negotiators had abandoned their initial offer of  a 1.5% pay increase for each of the next three years. That proposal had been  rejected by union representatives, Ramsay said.  </P> <P> The result of the negotiations pleased many of the employees Saturday.  </P> <P> "This is the best contract I've seen in a long time," said Michele Relation,  who has been a Disneyland employee for 20 years.  </P> <P> "The contract can do no wrong," said Margie Jones, who has worked at Disneyland  for two years.  </P> <P> "The pay increase definitely helps. I thought it was a wonderful contract," she  added.  </P> <P> Workers at Saturday's meeting said they had been worried about the possibility  of a strike and had hoped that negotiations between their representatives and  Disneyland would not sour.  </P> <P> "It's been quite stressful. I kept hoping that they would just keep talking,  and they did. This turned out to be quite fine. I think everybody is happy  now," Relation said.  </P> <P> The new contract also gives some part-time workers benefits that they had  wanted, including holiday pay and health benefits. Previously, such workers  were paid regular time during holidays and they were not included in health  packages.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co., which owns Disneyland, marked record earnings for the year.  </P></p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Progress in N America trade talks TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday concluded their weekend talks in Mexico City aimed at ironing out remaining differences over the North American free-trade agreement without announcing any big breakthrough, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The ministers said there had been progress and that they would meet again this week to build on the momentum. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, suggested the negotiations would draw to an end soon. But she added that a number of key texts - including those on cars, textiles, financial services and investment - had not been completed. Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said his country had difficulties with the rule of origin proposed by Mexico and the US in the textile sector, but would try to obtain relief with tariffs. The talks are reported to have advanced a number of substantive issues, with progress made negotiating texts on agriculture, government procurement, foreign investment and energy. The agriculture text was almost finished, a senior Mexican official said. Under US trade law a completed text can be presented to the US Congress 90 days after it has been initialled by the trade ministers. If President George Bush intends to send Congress the agreement a few days before the November 3 presidential elections the deadline for negotiations is the beginning of August.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Two banks expect rates to stay down The assumption that UK interest rates will rise to 6 per cent before the end of the year has been challenged by two leading City banks. A report today by Midland Global Markets, the foreign exchange wing of Midland Bank, forecasts interest rates will fall by the end of the year to 5 per cent from the current 5.25 per cent. And a Lloyds Bank report says the world has entered a period of low inflation and low interest rates and it expects no rise in UK rates this year. These predictions run against the grain of the sterling futures markets, where dealers are predicting base rates will rise to 6 per cent at the end of the year as the Bank of England seeks to counter inflationary pressures. A Gallup survey found that growing concern about inflation was prompting most City fund managers to revise interest rate expectations upwards. Midland Global markets says these fears are overstated, and the output gap will be sufficient to stave off any inflation threat for at least two years.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While other methods suggested by commentators also require a current accrual of interest, the noncontingent bond method requires interest accruals based on a rate that is implicit in the debt instrument and provides a means of determining whether payments are appropriately treated as interest or principal. The IRS and Treasury believe that the noncontingent bond method is the most appropriate method for achieving this purpose. For example, methods that require accrual at a fixed rate for all debt instruments often will over-accrue or under-accrue interest on a particular debt instrument. In addition, the methods may not always provide an appropriate measure of the interest and principal components of a payment. Because of the inaccuracies under these methods, the IRS and Treasury rejected these methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Projected payment schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The projected payment schedule for a contingent payment debt instrument is determined as of the debt instrument's issue date. Except in the case of a contingent payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is due, the projected payment schedule remains fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument and any income, deductions, gain, or loss attributable to the debt instrument are based on the schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The projected payment schedule for a debt instrument consists of all noncontingent payments and a projected amount for each contingent payment. The proposed regulations provide rules for determining the projected amount of each contingent payment included in a projected payment schedule. Under the proposed regulations, contingent payments are either quotable contingent payments or nonquotable contingent payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A quotable contingent payment is a contingent payment that is substantially similar to a property right for which forward price quotes are readily available. In general, the projected amount of a quotable contingent payment is the forward price of the property right. If a contingent payment is substantially similar to an option and forward price quotes are not readily available for the option, the projected amount of the payment is the spot price of the option on the issue date, if readily available, compounded at the AFR from the issue date to the date the payment is due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations, a property right includes a right, an obligation, or a combination of rights or obligations. For example, options and forward contracts are property rights. More complicated contingent payments are constructed from combinations of rights and obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A contingent payment is substantially similar to a property right if, under reasonably expected market conditions, the value and timing of the amount to be paid or received pursuant to the property right are expected to be substantially the same as the value and timing of the contingent payment. It is irrelevant for purposes of testing substantial similarity whether the property right must be settled in cash or in property or whether the credit rating of the issuer is different from the party giving the price quote. It is also irrelevant whether a property right is available in the same denomination as the measure of the contingent payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

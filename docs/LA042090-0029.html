			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN RALLIES TO KNOCK OFF CHAPMAN, 5-2  </P> <P> Faced with the prospect of falling from second place in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. standings, and three outs from suffering its first  shutout of the season, Cal State Northridge rallied for a tie, then defeated  Chapman College, 5-2, in a 12-inning baseball game Thursday at Hart Park in  Orange.  </P> <P> Mike Sims, the No. 9 hitter in the Northridge lineup, slapped a bases-loaded  double in the top of the 12th to drive in a pair of runs and snap a 1-1 tie. A  run-scoring single by Greg Shockey and Kyle Washington's sacrifice fly closed  out the four-run rally and made a winner of Craig Clayton (10-3), who pitched a  five-hitter in going the distance.  </P> <P> Clayton, a right-hander, struck out seven and allowed just one unearned run.  Chapman starter Pete Coleman (6-5) matched Clayton pitch for pitch, but, with  two out in the ninth, he walked Scott Sharts, and Denny Vigo and Eric Johnson  followed with singles to tie the score.  </P> <P> Although he suffered cramps in his forearm in the late innings, Clayton never  thought of leaving the game. Between the sixth and 12th innings, Clayton  allowed just one infield hit. But with a 1-2 count on Chris Cutliff, the  leadoff batter in the 12th, Clayton threw his glove and the ball to the ground  and began to massage his forearm.  </P> <P> "It was stuck in one position," Clayton said. "It was the only way I could get  (my hand) open."  </P> <P> Cutliff hit the next pitch over the left-field fence for his second home run of  the season. Clayton walked the next batter, but the two pitchers warming up in  the bullpen weren't needed as Clayton struck out Rod Klopfer and got Mark  Landeros to hit into a double play to end the game.  </P> <P> With the win, CSUN (26-15, 13-6 in conference play) held on to second in the  CCAA, a game ahead of Chapman (23-16, 13-8).  </P></p>

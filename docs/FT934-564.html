			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Russia signs dual citizenship pact Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed the former Soviet Union's first dual citizenship accord, making Turkmenistan the former empire's only member to shed some of the near-fanaticism with which most have asserted their separate nationalities. The agreement allows Turkmenistan's 400,000 Russians, representing about 10 per cent of the republic's population and 40 per cent of its capital, to hold dual citizenship, something that most of its former Soviet brethren have rejected. The accord was reached during a state visit by Mr Yeltsin one day before a summit in the Turkmen capital of the Moscow-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, which groups most ex-Soviet republics. It is the first such meeting since this month's Russian parliamentary elections, in which the nationalist Liberal Democratic leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, made an unexpectedly strong showing. Analysts have expected Mr Yeltsin to use the summit as a forum to press CIS leaders to be less resistant to Moscow's economic and political influence, with the justification that the alternative could be a purely imperialist Russia. In citing the agreement, the Turkmen president, Mr Sapurmurat Niyazov, has in some ways helped Mr Yeltsin move further ahead in Moscow's slow redigging of its roots in the ex-Soviet southern rim. For his part, Mr Yeltsin also may have progressed towards co-opting, or at least undermining, some of Mr Zhirinovsky's nationalist support. Mr Zhirinovsky, who has advocated reabsorption of much of Moscow's defunct empire, won 37 per cent of the vote among the roughly 7,000 ethnic Russian officers serving under contract to the Turkmen army. The result, a stronger showing than Mr Zhirinovsky achieved in Russia itself, in part reflected a desire among the much-needed officers - the backbone of Turkmenistan's security forces - to improve their comparatively spartan living conditions and status two years after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Since then, Mr Niyazov has appeared on national television offering the officers free flats and other benefits. Mr Yeltsin gave some indication that he might seek similar agreements with other CIS partners. The Turkmen agreement was 'a sign of great friendship between two peoples', he said. Diplomats said that, for Mr Niyazov's part, the accord was at least partly an attempt to stanch the emigration of ethnic Russians from the republic. Just last spring, there were about 11,000 ethnic Russian officers in Turkmenistan. 'The government has been well aware that it needs Russian skills,' said a diplomat in Ashkabad. 'We are seeing Russians wanting more and more to go. Every time they look up and see Niyazov's face on a poster, it reminds them that they are no longer in charge, and it makes them uncomfortable.' However, the citizenship agreement does little or nothing to counter-balance harsh housing laws that Mr Niyazov has enacted and that have had the effect of making it almost impossible financially for Russians to go. About 18 months ago, Mr Niyazov banned the sale of flats for 10 years, removing one main way in which ethnic Russians have been able to earn the cash they need to start a new life outside Turkmenistan. Then, in the summer, he banned flat or home rentals, taking away an alternative to which some Russians had turned for a steady cash flow while they made new lives for themselves in Russia.</p>

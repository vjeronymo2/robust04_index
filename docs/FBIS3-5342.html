			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to the South Korean Munhwa Broadcast  Network, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher confirmed  that the demand on the abolition of South Korea's National  Security Law [NSL] is a U.S. official position -- not that of an  individual person. In response to a question, he clarified that  the United States will advice [chongyong] South Korea to repeal  the NSL, even though it is a touchy issue. He added that the  reason for such a U.S. demand is the possibility that the law  might be abused.    The final confirmation by the U.S. secretary of state came  after the puppet Foreign Ministry's announcement that Deputy  Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard's comment was his own  personal view, not a U.S. official position.</p>

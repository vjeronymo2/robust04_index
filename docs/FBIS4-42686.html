			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There has been further criticism from abroad  concerning the presence of ministers from the National Alliance  in the Italian Government. Yesterday we had the bitter  criticism by European Commission President Jacques Delors and  the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, who both  accused Chamber of Deputies Speaker Irene Pivetti of having an  anti-Semitic background. [passage omitted] Let's turn to the  reactions in Italy. Stefano Bellini reports:    [Bellini] Following the concerns expressed by Francois  Mitterrand and Andreas Papandreou, another high profile figure  -- Jacques Delors -- has also expressed concern. With anger in  my heart -- these were his words -- I read the interview given  by Gianfranco Fini on the positive aspects of fascism until 1938  and on the loss of European cultural identity as it was being  freed from Nazi fascism.    These opinions have brought a wave of criticism. The widow  of Giorgio Almirante said Delors's views were a disgusting  attack. Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center  thundered that Italy is a serious country which merits respect.  The Italian Foreign Ministry said that the president of the  European Commission's views were personal and did not involve  any government.    Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio defended Irene Pivetti and  rejected the accusations of anti-Semitism made against her.    Rosa Russo Jervolino is of a completely different opinion  and  she has rejected the offer made by the leader of the National  Alliance to join the ruling coalition. Achille Occhetto said  Delors's remarks were not meddling and that the European  right-wing parties could draw comfort from the success of the  Italian Right.    This is what Gianfranco Fini told Luce Tommasi:    [Begin recording] [Tommasi] Fini, what do you say to Jacques  Delors and to Israel, following the reassuring comments made by  Peres?    [Fini] I don't think that I have to give any reply. I am  happy that Shim'on Peres has stressed that there is no hostility  on the part of the Israeli Government toward the Italian  Government. More than ever I am convinced that the concerns of  Jacques Delors will diminish shortly when everyone has  understood what the guiding values of both the government and  the National Alliance are. [end recording]    [Bellini] Furthermore, Fini has given assurances that the  National Alliance will not join the same grouping as Jean-Marie  Le Pen's extremists in the European Parliament.</p>

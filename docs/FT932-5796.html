			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Computer market Sir, I was encouraged to read ('Dispute over future of stock dealing system', May 29/30) that the Stock Exchange is considering a computer system which would eliminate the need for marketmaking. At present, marketmakers appear to believe it is acceptable to charge wide bid-offer spreads on securities such as penny shares and warrants, arguing that they can't make a profit on a relatively large variety of low-volume transactions. Perhaps a computer can make a profit in such a situation? M E R Robinson, 26 Fairfield Close, Grove, Wantage, Oxon</p>

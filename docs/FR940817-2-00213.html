Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from July 25, 1994, through August 5, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on August 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By September 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos.

Specifically, the LCO and surveillance requirements are revised to clarify that both shutdown cooling system (SCS) suction line relief valves shall be OPERABLE and aligned to provide overpressure protection not only during reactor (RCS) cooldown or heatup evolutions, but also during any steady state temperature periods maintained in the course of RCS cooldown or heatup evolutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments provide further clarification of the Technical Specifications and represent an additional operating limitation. Incorporating the noted clarification will not change the bases or assumptions contained in the safety analysis for this system. The most limiting low-temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) transients, the starting of an idle reactor coolant pump (RCP) and the inadvertent actuation of two high pressure safety injection (HPSI) pumps into a solid RCS, are not affected by the proposed clarification. Therefore, the proposed amendments do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clarifying the applicability of the LCO's and surveillance for steady state periods achieved and maintained during either a heatup or cooldown evolution does not modify the design or operation of plant equipment. No new or different failure modes will be introduced by incorporating this clarification into the LCO and surveillance requirement. Therefore, the proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clarification will enhance LCO 3.4.8.3 and Surveillance Requirement 4.4.8.3.1 for heatup and cooldown evolutions by ensuring operators are aware of this applicability during periods of steady state conditions. This clarification does not involve a change to safety limits, setpoints, or design margins. As such, the proposed amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety at PVNGS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The normal air supply (the Instrument Air System) to the ADV is maintained between 105 to 125 psig. Currently, nitrogen from the accumulator is reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV. The increased minimum pressure in the accumulator will still be reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limitation on maintaining the nitrogen accumulator at a certain pressure is to ensure that a sufficient volume of nitrogen is in the accumulator to operate the associated ADV. Maintaining a higher minimum pressure ensures that sufficient nitrogen will be available to maintain the unit at HOT STANDBY for four hours and an additional 9.3 hours to reach COLD SHUTDOWN under natural circulation conditions in the event of failure of the normal control air system.

This action statement would be entered if more than one of the required four degraded voltage relays on either 4.16 kv bus is inoperable or not energized. If the eight hour allowed outage time is not met, the unit is placed in Hot Standby within six hours and in Cold Shutdown within the next thirty hours. Technical Specification 3.8.3.1 currently allows eight hours to restore a 4.16 kv bus in the event of a loss of power to that bus. The loss of degraded voltage relays on that bus does not impact plant nuclear safety any more than the loss of the bus itself. Furthermore, even with the loss of all four degraded voltage relays monitoring one 4.16 kv bus (for example, due to a blown 125 vdc circuit fuse), the loss-of-voltage relays on that bus, and the degraded voltage relays, as well as the loss-of-voltage relays monitoring the other bus would be unaffected. None of the UFSAR chapter 15 accident analyses are affected by this proposed amendment. The existing TS requirements and those components to which they apply are not altered by this TS amendment. There are no changes to the maintenance, surveillance, and/or qualification of any component/function in Table 3.3-3. Therefore, the addition of this proposed eight hour action statement to Table 3.3-3 entry VIII B does not increase the probability of occurrence or the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard 2--Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TS requirements and the components to which they apply are not altered by this amendment.

Specifically, TS Section 4.7.2.c.1 requires the verification of each automatic valve in the flowpath actuate to its correct position and each AFW pump automatically start upon receipt of each AFW actuation system test signal; TS Section 4.7.2.c.2 requires verification that the AFW system is capable of providing a minimum 300 gallons per minute nominal flow to each leg. This request is one of a series of proposed license amendments that would eliminate the need for mid-cycle surveillance outages by extending 18-month frequency surveillances to every refueling outage (nominally each 24 months).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The AFW System reliability and monthly surveillances provide assurance that undetected system degradation will not occur between 24-month surveillances. Therefore, the AFW System will continue to perform its safety function and there will be no significant increase in the consequences of accidents.

The allowed primary-to-secondary operational leakage from any one steam generator is proposed to be reduced from 500 gallons per day (gpd) to 150 gpd.

Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no tube support plate [TSP] restraint) at room temperature conditions show[s] burst pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of outer diameter stress corrosion cracking with voltage measurement as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on intersections pulled from BVPS [Beaver Valley Power Station] with up to a 2.7 volt indication shows measured burst pressure in excess of 6600 psi at room temperature. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications show[s] burst pressures in excess of 6300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety factor requirements of RG [Regulatory Guide] 1.121. As stated earlier, tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the proximity of the TSP. Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100 percent through wall electric discharge machining (EDM) notches, 0.75 inch long, provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Since tube to TSP proximity precludes tube burst during normal operating conditions, use of the criteria must retain tube integrity characteristics which maintain a margin of safety of 1.43 times the bounding faulted condition steam line break (SLB) pressure differential. As previously stated, the RG 1.121 criterion requiring maintenance of a safety factor of 1.43 times the SLB pressure differential on tube burst is satisfied by 7/8 inch diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes less than 8.82 volts regardless of the indicated depth measurement. The plugging criteria (resulting in a projected end-of-cycle [EOC] voltage) compares favorably with the 8.82 volt structural limit considering the extremely slow apparent voltage growth rate of indications at BVPS. Using the established methodology of RG 1.121, the structural limit is reduced by allowances for uncertainty and growth to develop a beginning-of-cycle (BOC) repair limit which should preclude indications at EOC conditions which exceed the structural limit. The non-destructive examination (NDE) uncertainty component is 20.5 percent and is based on the EPRI [Electric Power Research Institute] Alternate Repair Criteria (ARC). A bounding growth allowance of 40 percent will be applied. This value is conservative for BVPS Unit 1. The BOC maximum allowable repair limit should not permit the existence of EOC indications (when the 40 percent growth and 20.5 percent uncertainty allowances are applied) which exceed the 8.82 volt structural limit. By adding NDE uncertainty allowances and an allowance for crack growth to the repair limit, the structural limit can be validated. Therefore, the maximum allowable BOC repair limit (RL) based on the structural limit of 8.82 volts can be represented by the expression: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RL + (0.205 X RL) + (0.40 x RL) = 8.82 volts, or the maximum allowable BOC repair limit can be expressed as: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RL = 8.82 volt structural limit/1.605 = 5.5 volts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is reasonable that this repair limit (5.5 volts) could be applied for IPC [interim plugging criterion] implementation to repair bobbin indications greater than 1.0 or 2.0 volts independent of RPC [rotating pancake coil] confirmation of the indication. The analyses were performed based on a 1.0 or 2.0 volt repair limit. Duquesne Light Company has chosen to use a steam generator tube repair limit of 1.0 volt. Conservatively, an upper limit of 3.6 volts will be used to assess tube integrity for those bobbin indications which are above 1.0 volt but do not have confirming RPC calls. This 3.6 volt upper limit for non-confirmed RPC calls is consistent with other recently approved IPC programs for the two other plants with 7/8 inch tubing that currently implement IPCs. Since the upper bound for repair of non-confirmed RPC is limited to a value far less than the limit associated with a full alternate criteria, the establishment of the repair limits are [is] judged to be independent of the pulled tube data base used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conservatism of the growth allowance used to develop the repair limit is shown by the most recent BVPS eddy current data. The average voltage growth for all indications was 16 percent while the average voltage growth for indications greater than 0.75 volts at BOC was 6 percent. The largest overall voltage growth in a particular steam generator was found in the ``A'' steam generator, which had an overall average growth of 25 percent. Only two tubes had an absolute voltage growth which exceeded 1.0 volt for Cycle 9. The maximum absolute voltage growth in the 1993 inspection was recorded to be 1.18 volts. Each of the last three inspections, which included 100 percent of all hot leg tubes, showed decreasing voltage growth trends in each successive inspection for all categories; overall voltage growth, growth of BOC indications less than 0.75 volts, and growth of indications greater than 0.75 volts. The decreasing voltage growth rate trend data indicates that DLC has good control of the ODSCC [outer diameter stress corrosion cracking] occurring in the BVPS Unit 1 steam generators and also implies that atypical voltage growth of a few indications is unlikely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously established that a postulated main SLB [steam line break] outside of containment but upstream of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) represents the most limiting radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the interim plugging criteria, it will be determined whether the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the end of Cycle 11 are [is] projected to be such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. A separate calculation has determined this allowable SLB leakage limit to be 6.6 gpm in the faulted loop. This limit was calculated using the Technical Specification RCS [reactor coolant system] Iodine-131 activity level of 1.0 micro Curies per gram dose equivalent Iodine-131 and the recommended Iodine-131 transient spiking values consistent with NUREG-0800. The projected SLB leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC leakage. The log-logistic probability of leakage correlation will be used to establish the SLB leak rate used for comparison with the 6.6 gpm faulted loop allowable limit. Due to the relatively low voltage levels of indications at BVPS and low voltage growth rates, it is expected that the actual calculated leakage values will be far less than this limit. Additionally, the current Iodine-131 levels as of May 1994 at BVPS are about 1000 times less than the Technical Specification limit of 1.0. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of the criteria requires the projection of postulated SLB leakage, based on the projected EOC voltage distribution for the upcoming cycle. Projected EOC voltage distribution is developed using the most recent EOC eddy current results and a voltage measurement uncertainty. Data indicate that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would result in through wall cracks long enough to leak at steam line break conditions. Draft NUREG-1477 requires that all indications to which the IPC are applied must be included in the leakage projection. Tube pull results from another plant with 7/8 inch tubing with a substantial voltage growth data base have shown that tube wall degradation of greater than 40 percent through wall was readily detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum through wall penetration of 56 percent (42 percent average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded bobbin voltage from the EOC eddy current data. Based on the BVPS pulled tube and industry pulled tube data supporting a lower threshold for SLB leakage of 2.8 volts, inclusion of all IPC intersections in the leakage model is quite conservative. The ODSCC occurring at BVPS has historically resulted in relatively low voltage levels and has exhibited decreasing voltage growth trends over the last three inspections. BVPS has not identified ODSCC as a contributor to operational leakage. The current leakage levels at BVPS are negligible (less than 1 gpd). In order to satisfy the requirements of draft NUREG-1477, EOC 10 eddy current data will be used to calculate the projected SLB leakage according to draft NUREG-1477 methodology. Leakage calculated using the recommended EPRI leakage correlation will also be provided. Duquesne Light Company is requesting that the NRC review and approve the EPRI SLB leakage calculation methodology. Sufficient justification is included to establish acceptability of the EPRI leakage correlation based on criteria provided by the NRC in the February 8, 1994, Industry/NRC working meeting on the voltage based criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to assess the sensitivity of application of the voltage based criteria upon SLB leakage, the EOC 9 eddy current results were used to calculate postulated EOC 10 leakage using both the NUREG-1477 methodology and EPRI correlation assuming that a 1.0 or 2.0 volt plugging limit were implemented at the BOC 10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Results indicate SLB leakage of 0.46 gpm and 0.044 gpm using the NUREG and EPRI methodologies with an assumed probability of detection (POD) of 0.6 for a 2.0 volt repair limit. Since Duquesne Light Company has chosen to limit the voltage based plugging limit at 1.0 volt, EOC 11 SLB leakage is analyzed to be approximately 5 percent lower than the calculated SLB leakage with a 2.0 volt repair limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, implementation of the interim plugging criteria does not adversely affect steam generator tube integrity and implementation will be shown to result in acceptable dose consequences, therefore, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube interim TSP plugging criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident outside of the region of the TSP elevations; no ODSCC that has been identified at the TSP has been detected outside the thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Duquesne Light Company will implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd per steam generator to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The technical specification limits on primary-to-secondary leakage at operating conditions are to be a maximum of 450 gpd for all steam generators, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with the longest permissible crack is exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The single through wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.43 times the steam line break pressure differential and SLB pressure differential alone are approximately 0.57 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will provide for detection of 0.41 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.62 inch long cracks at the lower 95 percent confidence level leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical crack lengths for SLB conditions using the lower 95 percent leakage data. Additionally, this leak-before-break evaluation assumes that the entire crevice area is uncovered during blowdown. Partial uncovery will provide benefit to the burst capacity of the intersection. Analyses have shown that only a small percentage of the TSPs are deflected greater than the TSP thickness during a postulated SLB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steam generator tube integrity continues to be maintained through inservice inspection and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously developed is not created. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria is demonstrated to maintain steam generator tube integrity commensurate with the requirements of RG 1.121. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences of steam generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam generator tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The EOC distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not adversely impacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing the combined effects of loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) on the steam generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators at some plants. This is the case as the TSP may become deformed as a result oflateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plate due to the combined effects of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential that partial through wall cracks in tubes could progress to through wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the BVPS reactor coolant loop piping, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line break or the pressurizer surge line break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the conditions at BVPS for smaller breaks. The results of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation. The LOCA and SSE tube collapse evaluation performed for another plant with Series 51 steam generators using bounding input conditions (large break loadings) is considered applicable to BVPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addressing RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria is supplemented by: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage normalization, a 100 percent eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements for the larger indications left inservice to characterize the principal degradation as ODSCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduces the RCS flow margin. Thus, the implementation of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased tube plugging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any Bases of the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension, are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven pump).

The proposed change requires the operability of the motor-driven EFW pump whenever the unit is above the cold shutdown condition and any steam generator is relied upon for heat removal. With this change, the motor-driven EFW pump is now required to be operable in a condition not previously specified, constituting an additional requirement not previously specified.

The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement.

The proposed changes to the actions required when both of the EFW trains are inoperable and the auxiliary feedwater pump is unavailable no longer require an immediate plant runback, that is currently required, which could introduce a plant transient, thus resulting in an increase in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operations also incorporate and Allowable Outage Time for the turbine-driven EFW pump steam supply valves which was not previously specified. The 7 day AOT is reasonable based on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The redundant steam supply (from the opposite steam generator) to the turbine-driven EFW pump is operable, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The motor-driven EFW pump is operable, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The probability of an event occurring that would require the inoperable steam supply valve to actuate is relatively low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes to the surveillance specifications clarify the proper conditions required for the operability test of the turbine-driven EFW pump, and revise the requirement for the verification of proper EFW flow path valve alignment. The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance requirement. The proposed changes state that the EFW pumps and their associated flow paths shall be operable when the RCS is above the cold shutdown condition with any steam generator relied upon for heat removal (motor-driven EFW pump) and when RCS temperature is greater than or equal to 280 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (turbine-driven EFW pump). This specification requires that the flow paths be properly aligned to maintain operability and is as restrictive as the current TS 4.8.1.c. The revised specification incorporates a new requirement to verify proper alignment prior to relying upon any steam generator for heat removal. This allows the operator flexibility in determining the method of verification. Some methods that could be considered as fulfilling this requirement would include manual valve alignment checks, or a flow test verifying a level decrease in the `Q' condensate storage tank with a corresponding level increase in both steam generators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change does involve an incremental reduction in the margin of safety since the extension of the EFW Allowable Outage Time from 36 hours to 72 hours does result in a slight increase in the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) as calculated in the ANO-1 Probabilistic Risk Assessment. The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension, are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven EFW pump).

The current logic only has four possible combinations. Changing the minimum number of SRAS channels required to be operable from four to three does not significantly reduce the available actuation combinations. Operation with one channel inoperable will still provide a 2-out-of-3 logic (three possible trip combinations). With the current SRAS logic, operation with one channel in bypass does not meet the single failure criterion for proper SRAS operation. Amendment No. 168 prevents that condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowing continued operation with three operable channels is consistent with the original Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications (prior to Amendment No. 168). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note (f), which describes the current logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed.

Therefore, removal of note (f) cannot affect either the probability or consequences of a postulated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the change in the minimum number of channels required to be operable, Action statement 4 will be revised to allow a limited period of two hours when a second channel may be placed in bypass for performance of surveillance testing. This is acceptable due to the installation of the auctioneering circuit and restoration of the full SRAS logic. Prior to the implementation of the short term modifications and Amendment No. 168, Action Statement 2 also applied to the SRAS. That Action Statement allows two hours of operation with two channels out of service. However, Action Statement 2 requires one of the two channels to be placed in the tripped position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postulating a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] and an additional failure, while in an action statement that specifies a maximum allowed outage time, is beyond the design basis of Millstone Unit No. 2. However, with one SRAS channel in bypass and one in the tripped position, an additional failure (such as the loss of a DC vital bus) following the onset of a LOCA could result in a false SRAS signal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From an overall safety perspective, the potential consequences from a false SRAS at the onset of a LOCA are more severe than those from the failure to automatically generate an actuation signal. Proposed Action Statement 4 would require actuation of the remaining channel (following a LOCA and a loss of DC bus as a second failure) to initiate the SRAS. The existing operation procedures instruct the operator to ensure that the SRAS actuation occurs when the refueling water storage tank level decreases to a predetermined value. In the unlikely event that a LOCA occurred while a Action Statement 4 and no SRAS was generated at the appropriate time due to an additional failure which prevents one channel from tripping, the SRAS would be manually initiated by the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of time that Millstone Unit No. 2 would operate under Action Statement 4 (with two SRAS channels in bypass) is approximately 6 hours per month. This is based on the requirement to conduct monthly channel functional tests for the three operable channels. The probability of a LOCA occurring during these surveillance, while in Action Statement 4, with a subsequent failure of the remaining 2-out-of-2 SRAS logic, is very low. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sensor Cabinet Auctioneering <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed new Technical Specification 3.3.2.2, which establishes the requirements for the ESFAS sensor cabinets power supply drawers, permits 48 hours to restore an inoperable sensor cabinet power supply drawer to operable status. A power supply drawer renders it inoperable, or if either its normal or backup power is not available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing Technical Specification 3.8.2.1 contains an 8-hour action statement for restoring the power sources (VA-10, 20, 30, and 40) if they become inoperable. The proposed 48-hour action statement for the power supply drawers is appropriate since the sensor cabinet would remain functional if either normal or alternate power was not available. However, a LOCA and an additional failure while in the action statement could result in a false SRAS, since two channels would supplied from a single DC power supply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to Amendment No. 168, operation with an inoperable power supply drawer could continue indefinitely, provided the provisions of Technical Specification 3/4.3.2 were followed. Operation with a power supply inoperable for an indefinite period of time places all the signals associated with that sensor cabinet in the tripped condition. This creates a 1-out-of-4 tripped condition for SRAS. In this condition, the single failure required to be postulated could result in a false SRAS actuation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This 48-hour action statement is consistent with other action statements for ESFAS such as Action Statement 1 of Table 3.3-3. Also, this is consistent with the current wording of Action Statement 4 which allows 48 hours to restore an inoperable channel to operable while operating with the modified 2-out-of-4 logic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSI Trip Button Addition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manual trip buttons provide a mechanism for the control room operator to initiate an MSI trip. The proposed Technical Specification change will require that a plant shutdown be initiated if either channel is out of service for more than 48 hours, and establishes a requirement for surveillance testing every refueling outage. Including the trip buttons in the Technical Specifications and establishing operation and surveillance requirements ensures their operability commensurate with their safety significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the changes to Technical Specification 3/4.3 do not increase the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

This change only affects the number and combinations of actuation channels necessary to initiate a SRAS. There is no change to the source or types of initiators, nor is there a change to the automatic response resulting from a SRAS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note (f), which described the modified logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed.

Therefore, removal of note (f) cannot create a new or different kind of accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Action Statement 4 restores the ability to operate for an indefinite period of time with one channel in bypass and for a limited period of time while two channels are out of service. The change from the original action statement to require that both channels be in bypass will prevent a false SRAS in the unlikely (and beyond design basis) event of a LOCA with an additional failure of a DC bus while in an LCO [limiting condition for operation]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sensor Cabinet Auctioneering <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of a Technical Specification for the sensor cabinet power supply drawers does not create a potential for a new or different kind of accident. This new specification implements more restrictive operating requirements for the sensor cabinets. These are necessary to ensure that the sensor cabinets are energized from their primary power supply. The new specification does not affect the initiation of a SRAS signal nor the type of signal produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The auctioneering modification does bring two vital AC facilities together via isolation devices.

Therefore, no new or different accident scenarios are created by the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater operability check, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation of these [SSCs]. The heating and heater control subsystems of the SLC system will continue to function as they were designed. The proposed change does not alter the heating limits or the method for maintaining SLC solution temperature. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5* does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The potential for a decrease in the margin of safety, under this proposed change, would be associated with periods during OPCON 5* when the SLC system was not operable. Allowing the SLC system to be inoperable during OPCON 5* with the vessel level at least 22 feet above top of vessel flange, represents no reduction in the margin of safety since the SLC System is not designed to terminate an inadvertent criticality event with a greater volume of water in the reactor. Having the SLC system inoperable in OPCON 5* with reactor water levels at normal operating volumes, does not significantly reduce the margin of safety because of the number of other design and operating features which act to prevent inadvertent criticality events. Adequate shutdown margin is maintained through design and administrative controls; including, Shutdown Margin Demonstration, Technical Specification 3.1.1, defueling and refueling procedures, and refueling interlocks. In addition, the Reactor Protection System monitors for recriticality and actuates the Control Rod Scram function if a significant reactivity addition is sensed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater operability check, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Adequate controls are in place, independent of the 18 month heater operability check, to ensure that the temperature of the sodium pentaborate solution is maintained above 70 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F. These controls include Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.a.1, which checks SLC solution temperature daily, a control room alarm on low and high temperature, and the ambient temperature conditions in the SLC area which prevent rapid changes in SLC solution temperature. Operability of the 'B' heater is not needed to maintain SLC solution temperature, and the operability of this heater is verified at the time when chemicals are added to the SLC tank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The change proposes to eliminate two containment isolation valves on the BIT bypass line whose function has been rendered obsolete by a previous amendment to the Operating License. The bypass line will be cut and capped to assure containment integrity, therefore eliminating the need for these containment isolation valves. Intermittent opening of the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves, thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps.

Currently, an orientation deficiency with the inboard BIT bypass isolation valve exposes its stem packing to the non-isolable side of the valve. The modification corrects this problem by removing both isolation valves and capping the pipes to assure integrity of the Containment and Safety Injection System. Additionally, removal of the isolation valves removes the potential for containment leakage resulting from valve degradation. Finally, removal of the BIT bypass line and its associated isolation valves does not inhibit the ability to test the SI pumps since a previous modification approved in an Amendment to the Operating License removed the functional requirement for the BIT. Consequently, the SI pumps may be flow tested with the BIT inservice, rendering obsolete the function of the BIT bypass line. Intermittent opening the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves, thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints do not affect any precursor for any design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, the probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HPCI and RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations are provided to ensure automatic closure of each system's primary containment isolation valves for a HPCI or RCIC steam line break. The isolation occurs when a very small leak has occurred. If the small leak is allowed to continue without isolation, offsite dose limits may be reached. As a result of the environmental qualification program, the environmental responses of the reactor building to high energy line breaks were analyzed. TVA used computer modeling techniques to predict the temperature response of various reactor building zones to high energy line breaks. The results indicate that the setpoints for the HPCI and RCIC temperatures switches should be lowered. The lower setpoints assure the timely initiation of a closure signal to the primary containment isolation valves. Therefore, assuring the maximum allowable temperatures are not exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints are in the conservative direction and provides the same or earlier detection and isolation of HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed trip level settings are high enough to ensure that spurious trips do not occur from normal or transient system operation and low enough to ensure that line breaks are detected and isolated before design conditions are exceeded.

The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the HPCI/RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations does not involve any modification to plant equipment or changes in operating procedures. No new failure modes are introduced. There is no effect on the function or operation of any other plant system. No new system interactions have been introduced by the change. The results of a break in the HPCI or RCIC steam lines remain as before. The HPCI or RCIC steam line area temperature switches will still detect a break due to an increase in area temperature and provide an initiation signal to close the system primary containment isolation valves to prevent reactor coolant loss. The proposed change will conservatively serve to detect and mitigate HPCI and RCIC line breaks more expeditiously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change will not reduce the margin of safety. The proposed change ensure that HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks are isolated at the same or lower steam line area temperatures. Computer modeling techniques were utilized to predict the temperature response in various areas through which the HPCI and RCIC steam lines pass. The revised setpoints are established above the maximum expected normal room temperatures to avoid spurious actions due to ambient conditions and below the analytical limits to ensure timely pipe break detection and isolation. Substantial margin exist between the maximum temperature expected in each area and the minimum actuation temperature determined for each temperature switch. With the substantial margin between maximum temperatures for the areas and the minimum actuation temperature of the switches, the maximum temperatures cannot result in actuation of the switches. The design and function of the affected components has not been changed. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The loss of a single 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply will result in a loss of control power for the 480-volt and the 4160-volt shutdown board that it serves. Loss of control power results in loss of only those engineered safeguards supplied by its respective shutdown boards.

This small increase in risk is associated with the probability and consequences of a 250-volt plant DC power supply malfunction while it is supplying shutdown board control power. The increase in risk associated with extending the AOT was analyzed in a Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) and determined to be approximately 0.3 percent. This small increase in risk is determined to be insignificant and well within the uncertainty bounds of the PSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS change does not change the function of any plant structure, system or component.

These changes require that the reactor coolant average temperature (T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> avg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) be no lower than 540 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F during critical operation.

Additionally, the change in Table 4.1-1 entitled, ``Minimum Frequencies for Checks, Calibrations and Tests,'' adds the requirement for T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> avg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  instrument check frequency to be reduced to 30 minutes when the T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> avg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  banks are above zero steps. Furthermore, the revision to the Bases indicates that the minimum temperature for criticality provides assurance that the reactor is operated within the bounds of the safety analyses. Also included is an administrative change to correct some typographical errors on page 3.1-25 of the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of issuance:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> July 25, 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of the date of issuance to be implemented within 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amendment No.:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 149 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Facility Operating License No.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DPR-64: Amendment revised the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of initial notice in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29630) The Commission's related evaluation of the amendment is contained in a Safety Evaluation dated July 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No significant hazards consideration comments received: No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of application for amendments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 3, 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brief description of amendments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments revised the Technical Specification (TS) for Combustible Gas Control (3/4.6.4.1) by changing the surveillance frequency for performing the channel functional test to once-per-quarter and the channel calibration to once-per-refueling.

The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By September 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos.

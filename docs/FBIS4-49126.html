			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 30 (XINHUA) -- A delegation from  the American Chamber of Commerce here departed today on its  annual trip to Washington to urge unconditional extension of  most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China.    According to the chamber, the lobbying group, led by  Chairman  Gerald Murdock and President Frank Martin, will make it clear  that "the chamber has been, and continues to be, adamantly  opposed to any conditions placed on China's MFN."    Murdock said, "while we believe the promotion of American  values is and must remain an important part of American foreign  policy, the current annual MFN debate, featuring human rights as  the defining issue in our China policy, is both  counterproductive to the overall relationship and ineffective in  fostering long-term human rights improvements."    He said his chamber will fully endorse the view expressed in  Washington this week by Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan  that "continuous, constructive dialogue and engagement with  China "is the best solution."    "Linking human rights or other conditions to a worldwide  standard of trade is not in the interest of either country,"  Murdock said.    He said, "over the past several years, the human rights  situation in China has improved significantly."    The delegation will meet with relevant U.S. officials in  Washington from May 2 to 6. Six members of the American Chamber  of Commerce in Beijing will join those from Hong Kong for a  total of 23 delegates, the largest mission to date.    In another development, Chief Secretary Anson Chan described  her meeting with U.S. Vice-President Al Gore on Friday [29  April] at the White House as extremely useful and interesting.    Anson Chan said, "we had a good discussion about the MFN  issue, how this might impact on the U.S.-China relationship and  on conditions in Hong Kong."    She said Hong Kong in the 21st century will matter to the  Chinese mainland, Asia and the rest of the world.    "It will matter to U.S. business as a prosperous, open and  externally-oriented market, as a gateway to China and as a  business center for East Asia as a whole," Anson Chan added.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks drop sharply Japan's leading banks reported sharply lower profits yesterday as the industry cut back on problem loans which it admitted would be a burden for at least three more years. The 11 leading commercial banks reported an average fall of 22.2 per cent in pre-tax profits for the six months ended September, while non-performing loans rose by an average of 9.6 per cent. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the country's largest bank, suffered a 44.3 per cent fall in net profit, blaming the decline on loan write-offs of Y164.2bn (Dollars 1.5bn). The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to report an increase in net profit, partly a result of unusually low earnings last year. The banks lifted their provisions for losses, which have mostly arisen from reckless property-related lending during the late 1980s, and they sold bad loans to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established to speed up the write-offs. The level of non-performing loans ranges from 1.9 per cent of loans at Mitsubishi Bank to 5.39 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. But the institutions use a narrow definition and generally do not count the loans of affiliates. It is estimated that the non-performing loans figure is about double the Y9,248.4bn announced for the 11 banks yesterday. The fresh provisions and write-offs, which totalled Y996.8bn, are a departure from Japanese banking traditions and follow pressure from the Bank of Japan. It fears that bad loans are restricting the banks' ability to lend and slowing economic recovery. The banks have covered their loan losses through sales of equities, but the weakness of Tokyo stock prices over the past month means they might book losses on securities holdings over the second half to the end of March. Banks were confident yesterday that the worst of their bad loan troubles was over, but many of the institutions reported an increase in the share of property industry loans to total loans during the period, though commercial property prices are still falling in large Japanese cities. Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial specialist at Salomon Brothers, said the banks' ability and willingness to lend was still in doubt, as their business profits were under pressure and they will find difficulty in tackling problem loans over the next year. 'The finance ministry is giving the impression that nothing is wrong, and the banks are giving that impression, but their non-performing loans are still rising. It is time for a new approach by the authorities,' Ms Ogawa said.</p>

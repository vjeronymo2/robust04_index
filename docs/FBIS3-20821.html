			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jansa Will Not Resign"] </F>   [Text] Janez Jansa, Slovene defense minister and president  of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, stated for STA  [Slovene Press Agency] yesterday that he is not contemplating  resignation, that he has never surrendered a battle, and that he  is not going to do it now. However, considering the present  balance of power or the relations among the parties in the  parliament, some changes in the government are possible. Jansa  emphasized yesterday that his supposed resignation is obviously  a planted rumor since nobody had talked to him recently about a  possible government reshuffling.</p>

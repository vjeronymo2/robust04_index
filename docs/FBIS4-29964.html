			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Environment ministers and  senior officials from 17 Asia-Pacific countries began a two-day  conference Tuesday [21 June] to discuss ways of promoting  regional cooperation in tackling environmental problems.    Participants in the environment congress for Asia and the  Pacific (Eco Asia `94), under way in Omiya outside Tokyo, also  include delegates from the Asian Development Bank and 10 other  international organizations.    The conference participants are discussing recent global  trends for sustainable development, in keeping with decisions  made at the 1992 earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. The theme of  that summit was "Ecologically Sustainable Development."    Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, the  keynote speaker, said the political and economic basis for  resolving environmental issues should be radically altered in  the region, which contains more than half the world's population  and is undergoing rapid urbanization and economic growth.    But a Chinese delegate said prices for the region's primary  products are low and growth can now only be guaranteed if the  region's resources are used to excess.    The Chinese delegate said this can only be remedied if  developed countries cooperate by supplying funds and technology  to developing countries.    A Canadian delegate recommended devising targets for the  preservation or improvement of the environment, while a delegate  from the United Nations University suggested the setting up of a  center for the supply of information on the environment and  technology.    On Wednesday, delegates will discuss a long-term outlook for  the region, strategies to cope with urbanization, and  cooperation among regional government authorities and agencies.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Lenders watch their security crumble: A development which sums up the problems of the leasehold system EVEN without estate agents' hype, Stone Manor, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, must have seemed an attractive proposition 10 years ago. It provided affordable flats in a listed Cotswold stone building, with quiet gardens and views over the River Severn. Now the development is a sad illustration of almost everything that can go wrong with the English leasehold property system. Building societies could lose more than Pounds 1m, and up to 150 residents are threatened with homelessness because Stone Manor's upkeep was neglected for years. Its landlord is now in liquidation. Mr Rodney Morant, chief solicitor of Nationwide building society, which has seven borrowers at Stone Manor, says that the combination of decaying leasehold flats and bankrupt landlords is an intractable national problem. Stone Manor was built as a workhouse in 1837 and has been used as a billet for troops, an old people's home and a municipal store before it was bought in 1980 by Mr Peter Emms, a builder, to convert into residential property. The 45 flats and 14 houses which he sold on long leases were not expensive, largely because the conversion was of a basic standard. Cheap softwood was used for doors and windows, no damp-proof course was installed, and roof tiles were salvaged from elsewhere. The Cotswold limestone used in the original construction is attractive but is prone to erosion and needs attention. Unlike most developments, the lease makes no provision for monthly maintenance charges or a management company to oversee maintenance. The landlord is responsible for repairs when demanded by leaseholders, who are obliged to pay their share of the bills. There was no regular maintenance system, so very little was done. When the landlord's company, PL Emms (Properties), went into voluntary liquidation in 1989 the liquidator took responsibility for Stone Manor's upkeep. By that stage repair work was long overdue. Now the flats and houses are unsaleable because of the disrepair and the potential liability of buyers for big bills. Four chimney stacks are dangerously unstable, 90 per cent of the masonry needs attention, the window frames are rotten, and many flats are damp. No local estate agents or solicitors will touch the place. One unit is on the market for Pounds 15,000 and there are still no takers. The liquidator has to sell the freehold to satisfy shareholders, but must first make it sellable by renovating the building. Estimates are between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 1m - up to Pounds 20,000 per flatowner, which is more than some paid for their flats and more than any of them can afford. The liquidator has the power to demand the money. If residents do not pay he can apply to court for forfeiture of their leases, which would leave them homeless and the lenders with no security on their loans. The only way for lenders to recover their investment would be to pursue homeless ex-residents for payment. The residents could take over the freehold for a nominal Pounds 1, set up new leases and a management company and carry out repairs themselves, possibly using cheaper contractors. An estimate for immediately essential repairs is Pounds 5,000 per flat. The residents' association wants to take over the freehold, but would then have to persuade all residents to agree to change the leases and find the money for renovation. It has turned to the building societies for help with both - as a source of further funds, and as a means of applying pressure on residents who will not co-operate. About 14 lenders, mostly building societies, are involved in Stone Manor, with exposures ranging from a few thousand pounds to more than Pounds 250,000. The societies are considering lending about Pounds 5,000 to each leaseholder to make the flats saleable and therefore protect their own security. Many residents would normally be turned down for further advances because they already have mortgage arrears, low incomes, or have negative equity on their property. Some could not afford an increased mortgage and would need special terms. But building societies have a duty in law to invest prudently to protect the savings of their investors. In cases such as Stone Manor they must decide whether it is prudent to lend more in the hope of being able to secure part of the original loans, or whether to write off the debts and leave residents to sort themselves out. Mr Morant says: 'It is a question of whether we can throw money down what is an apparently bottom-less pit.' Planned changes in the law would allow leaseholders to force landlords to sell freeholds. That, and a new type of flat ownership called common hold, which does away with leases, might help others in the same situation if they see the problem early enough and decide to take management of the property into their own hands. But the changes will not protect flatowners against arguments with neighbours over money and priorities or paying for maintenance. Mr Anthony Learmonth, the lawyer acting for the residents, says the real difficulty is not the law but its application. 'If things are done properly the machinery already exists to ensure that leaseholders have control over their properties. 'There is no doubt that there are some absolutely appalling leases around. That is not the fault of the leasehold system, it is the fault of the lawyers who draw up and approve those leases,' he said.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Management: Take care when rewarding the high-flyers - Performance-related pay has been adopted enthusiastically by the CAA Performance-related pay is not for everyone, as Britain's Civil Aviation Authority demonstrated last year. In negotiations over its new pay scheme the CAA, a government body that regulates air traffic, said the priority for 3,000 well-paid employees such as air traffic controllers and aircraft inspectors was to follow set procedures and routines rather than showing their individual mettle. 'The prime concern is safety and we therefore did not want to encourage people to behave exceptionally,' says Terry Moseley, director of remuneration and staff relations at the CAA. 'Rather, we want a performance-related pay scheme (PRP) in areas where we could reasonably acknowledge better than expected performance.' But Moseley warns: 'A PRP scheme is not a substitute for managers encouraging and motivating their staff. It is a reinforcement agent.' The CAA is an enthusiast for PRP - along with others which include John Lewis Partnership, the retailer, and ICL, the computer company. A hallmark of all of them is that they have integrated their PRP into well-developed schemes which involve regular assessments of employees' work and offer the means to improve performance. Vicky Wright, director of remuneration consulting at Hay Management Consultants, says: 'Just offering PRP in itself is generally not good enough. Employers have to define what a job is, communicate that to the employee and devise processes which enable people to improve their performance and then design a PRP system which reflects that.' The CAA's current scheme, introduced after protracted and robust negotiations with the CPSA, NUCPS and IPMS civil service unions, replaced an existing Civil Service PRP scheme. Moseley says it was a 'dreadful mechanistic system' which, for example, allowed a standard performer who got three annual 'satisfactories' at the annual appraisal an automatic bonus. The performance-related pay review in the new scheme is separated from the annual appraisal by around six months so that a discussion of strengths and weaknesses can take place when pay is not directly an issue. While PRP is influenced by the annual appraisal, it is not determined by it. Moseley says that since the old scheme was linked directly to the annual appraisal it distracted people from properly discussing their jobs. Negotiations with the unions over abandoning the old PRP system in 1990-91 were lengthy and a new deal was won only after it was agreed to lift the company's pay scales by 17 per cent over two years. The new scheme, which could be substantially modified in the next few years when the CAA moves towards devolved pay bargaining, incorporates some 2,500 junior and middle management and clerical and administrative staff. A further 1,200 engineers were to have been included this year, but they are covered by two pay scales and making the necessary adjustments could not be accommodated within the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling. There are three components to the pay system: These are: An annual negotiated increase for everybody. Movement through the pay scales. The pay structure consists of salary bands with only two fixed points, a start rate and a job rate. The start rates for bands one to four, which cover junior and clerical staff, is 90 per cent of the job rate and for bands five to 12, which covers middle managers, is 85 per cent of the job rate. Movement through salary bands is determined by performance. In addition, performance-related, non-consolidated lump sum bonuses, not normally exceeding 5 per cent of the individual's job rate, may be awarded to those whose overall performance is much better than the standard performance level. Moseley says it is not easy to define precisely what managers are looking for. 'It is an assessment by a manager. We have issued guidelines that we believe should be used and then left it to the managers.' In its first year the scheme is 'generally satisfactory' he says, with 890 out of the 2,500 eligible for merit awards receiving either a lump sum or a faster progression through the pay scale for their efforts during 1992. The average award was Pounds 330. The size of the pot, he says, is important. 'If the budget were too large the managers would not have to think so hard about who receives awards: the largesse could be spread wider and thicker and the concept of what constitutes better than expected performance would be diminished,' he says. At present the amount available is 1 per cent of the salary bill. Moseley says: 'We do not expect an award to change a person's standard of living because, after all, it is a bonus and may not be repeated. For those who do not receive bonuses we do not want awards to be of such magnitude that they become disgruntled. 'We defeat the object of the scheme if rivalry is engendered because we rely heavily on teamwork and co-operation to be effective.' A previous article on PRP appeared on November 3.</p>

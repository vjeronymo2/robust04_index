			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES  </P> <P> I find it rather hypocritical that a law that makes it illegal for "two of more  persons" to conspire "for the purpose of depriving any person or class of  person" from exercising their constitutional rights is used against the one  organization that is trying to protect someone's rights ("Justices Rebuff Foes  of Abortion," front page, May 22).  </P> <P> We have declared the yet-to-born human a non-person just as we did with the  blacks in the mid-1800s.  </P> <P> When good people put their lives and livelihood on line to defend those who  have no voice, they are persecuted.  </P> <P> It is the doctors and nurses who perform abortions who are in fact the "two or  more persons" who conspire to grossly deny someone of their happiness, and it  is they that should be receiving the condemnation of society.  </P> <P> Anything can be justified, even the taking of an innocent life, if you redefine  life to fit your purposes, but the truth still remains that a rose by any other  name is still a rose and murder by any other name is still murder.  </P> <P> HARRY H. WILSON  </P> <P> Cerritos  </P></p>

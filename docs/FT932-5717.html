			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: NZ commission criticises bank's accounting policy THE New Zealand Securities Commission has sharply criticised former Bank of New Zealand directors over accounting procedures surrounding a controversial NZDollars 200m (USDollars 108.7m) scheme to insure against bad debts. The commission said the directors had used 'creative accounting' systems which led to a NZDollars 66m over-statement of profits in 1988-89. However the report cleared the directors, Fay, Richwhite, a New Zealand merchant bank and a former leading shareholder in BNZ, and BNZ's lawyers and accountants of allegations of fraud and conspiracy. These allegations, which led to the commission's seven-month enquiry, were made under parliamentary privilege by Mr Winston Peters, a former government MP. The report says there was no evidence to support other allegations by Mr Peters that Fay, Richwhite had improper influence over the bank, or that the insurance scheme was used to falsify the 1987-88 accounts by concealing NZDollars 200m in bad debts. Fay, Richwhite ceased to be a leading shareholder in BNZ when the bank was sold to National Australia Bank in November. All the directors at that time resigned following the takeover. The bank posted a NZDollars 189m net profit in 1988, but this slumped to a NZDollars 649m loss in 1989 due to bad debts of NZDollars 1.3bn. The report said the bank had sought to insure against expected bad debts of NZDollars 200m. In March 1988, European Pacific Banking, a company registered in the Cook Islands tax haven, was set up to ensure that profits were not distorted by a large one-off loss. Its parent, European Pacific Investment, was partly owned by the BNZ. European Pacific Banking refused to co-operate with the Securities Commission during the enquiry. Its lawyers said Cook Islands law prevented material from being disclosed. The commission said this was unsatisfactory, and that the scheme was most unusual. It said it amounted to an investment and could not properly be called insurance. The commission also took exception to BNZ's accounting treatment of the scheme, and other items which allowed the bank in the year to March 31 1990, to boost profits before tax and extraordinary items by NZDollars 66m.</p>

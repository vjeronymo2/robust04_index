			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that in order to give answers to  the inquiry by members of the Great State Hural delegating the  National Democratic and Social-Democratic Parties in reference  to the prime minister concerning the ensuring of the activities  of the centralized power system there has been taken place a  meeting of the Standing Parliamentary Committee on Development  of Economics and Politics in the Sphere of Infrastructure. At  the meeting took the floor the Minister of Power, Geology and  Mining Industry B. Jigjid.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Federal Police, PF, agents -- who have been on  strike for more than one month -- have closed the PF offices in  three states. Even passport issuance has been suspended.    In Salvador, Bahia State, the gates to the PF office were  closed all day today. No one could enter the building. This  ballet dancer should have left for a tour of Germany today, but  she was unable to get a passport despite having insisted very  much on the need to have it.    In Belem, Para State, the gate opening to the patio of the  PF  office was also closed. The policemen cordoned off the building  and did not allow anyone in, not even the PF superintendent and  the PF inspectors. Nothing functioned here today.    In Rio de Janeiro, the PF central office at Maua Square in  the downtown area remained closed. The passport issuance  department also remained closed.    In Sao Paulo, some PF agents demonstrated in front of the PF  headquarters. A large number of people became angry at finding  the doors to the passport issuance department closed.    The PF agents suspended their activities entirely when  President Itamar Franco reported that he will not meet their  demands. The police inspectors also decided to suspend passport  issuance.    At the Guarulhos International Airport in Great Sao Paulo,  only two PF inspectors are controlling the passengers' luggage  and passports.    Some 80 landing and takeoff operations are scheduled for  today. The situation has been calm all day long, but the  movement will increase later on tonight, when there will be  flights every 15 minutes.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What sort of  activities are hindered by this strike?    [Lauro Trapp, president of the PF Agents Union] Mainly the  activities in the areas of passports, registration of  foreigners, and renewal of permanent residence permits. Airport  supervision has been entirely abandoned. [end recording]    President Franco has summoned a meeting to discuss the PF  situation. The government has considered calling on the Army to  ensure free access to the PF facilities. [passage omitted]    It was decided during the two-hour meeting that the justice  minister will address the nation to explain the PF situation.  As an intervention has not been announced, the demonstrators  have already left the PF central headquarters here in Brasilia.</p>

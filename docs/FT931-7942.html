			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Spic-O-Rama - New York Theatre John Leguziamo is a prodigiously talented young performer whose recent one-man play Spic-O-Rama reveals that he is on the way to an excellent writing career. In Spic-O-Rama, which played at New York's Westside Theatre, Leguziamo portrays, in turn, six members of the Gigante family of Jackson Heights, Brooklyn, as they prepare for their eldest son's wedding. Everything about Spic-O-Rama, from its title to its pre-show disclaimer that 'this Latin family is not representative of all Latin families . . . if your family is like this one, please seek professional help,' to Leguziamo's appropriation of stock types for their comic and tragic value, makes clear that he is not going to pander to those who have called his work politically incorrect. The Gigantes are, as their name suggests, larger than life, but what makes this play effective satire is that it springs from Leguziamo's unflinching societal observation. Spic-O-Rama wants editing - it's too long and becomes heavy-handed - but Leguziamo's performances and energy carry the evening. Roy Arcenas' set places us in an archetypical urban wasteland of dented chrome, graffiti and chain-link fences. In bounds nine-year-old Miggy Gigante, sporting trendily oversized jeans, and tranquiliser-worthy excesses of energy. Miggy begs us to take him away from his family of 'monsters, freaks and weirdos': 'you don't have to go to a third-world country to adopt me - I'm here]' Slide shows and musical montages keep the play moving while Leguziamo is offstage changing costumes. He next emerges as teenaged Raffi, a would-be Shakespearian actor, who claims he's the bastard son of Laurence Olivier. Desert Storm veteran Krazy Willy wonders why he's not considered a hero for having shot at 'people who look like us except they have towels on their heads'. Leguziamo's characterisations are all remarkable, but materfamilias Gladyz, who minds the family launderette, is his greatest feat. Her bitchy prattling about a life trapped in endless cycles of spin dryers and baby-making is the production's most acidly funny segment. Two unsubtle portraits blunt Spic-O-Rama's effectiveness. Wheelchair-ridden brother Xavier spouting bile about his screwed-up family is an obvious and heavy-handed symbol, and, having met the rest of the family, it is absolutely no surprise that father Felix, who gives an overlong wedding toast at the play's end, is a sexist lout. Despite sell-out audiences, Spic-O-Rama played only a limited engagement in New York, largely because Leguziamo's talents are in demand. He is appearing in the film Super Mario Brothers with Bob Hoskins, has filmed both Spic-O-Rama and his previous series of monologues, Mambo Mouth, for Home Box Office cable TV, and is working on his first screenplay.</p>

"Since the International Olympic Committee [IOC] has had the  intention of making a new breakthrough in popularizing Olympism,  the Olympic Games should be moved out of the circle of developed  countries and a Third-World country should be awarded the games  in the near future," he said.    The Chinese Olympic chief made his statement when he  reviewed  China's sports in the past year at a press conference following  the announcement of a vote for the top ten world athletes of  1993.    He said Beijing's close loss of 43-45 votes to Sydney in the  Monte Carlo IOC vote to choose the host city for the 2000  Olympics last September was by no means a tragedy for China's  sports. On the contrary, Beijing's bid was fruitful and  significent, because it has helped to spread the Olympic spirit  among the largest population of the world.    Answering the question if China would bid again for the 2004  games, he said the Chinese Olympic Committee would take into  full consideration both the world and domestic situation before  making any decision.    "Many foreign friends and IOC members as well as our  domestic  suporters have written to me, wishing that we bid again for the  2004 games. I'd like to thank them for their warm  encouragement, but there is still a lot of time before we make  our decision," he said.    An IOC weekly bulletin last December said that 14 cities are  interested in bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games -- Cape Town,  Durban and Johannesburg of South Africa, Beijing of China,  Dusseldorf and Aachen of Germany, St. Petersburg of Russia,  Buenos Aires of Argentina, Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro of  Brazil, Stockhom of Sweden, Seville of Spain, Istanbul of Turkey  and San Juan of Puerto Rico.    He Zhenliang said, "The IOC wishes China could try again for  the 2004 games, but it's not time yet to make any formal  decision."</p>

However, they are far from being the thousands who were  expected and who came when Meciar was last dismissed from the  premier's seat in 1991.    Since this morning parliament has been debating the motion  of  no confidence in the government proposed yesterday by the  Christian Democratic Party (KDH). Most of the speeches so far  have been made by deputies of the governing HZDS-SNS (Slovak  National Party) coalition, condemning yesterday's speech by  Kovac in which he fiercely criticized Meciar.    KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky said in the parliamentary  corridors that the opposition was waiting for a speech by  Meciar. "Then I shall make my appearance," he said.    HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak called for an agreement between HZDS  and the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and for a compromise date of  July for early elections. (The HZDS wants a June date, the SDL  an autumn one).    However, he said it was unlikely that the HZDS and SDL would  go into an open coalition before parliamentary elections,  because the SDL wanted to share in the government only on the  basis of new elections.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakhstan's Deputy Foreign Minister Bulat  Nurgaliyev told INTERFAX that the Kazakh-Russian treaty on  friendship, cooperation and reciprocal aid, signed on 23 May  1992, made it possible for Russia to use army bases in  Kazakhstan and for Kazakhstan -- to use army bases in Russia.    According to Nurgaliyev, Article 4 of the Russian-Kazakh  treaty provides for the joint use, in mutual interests and on  mutual agreement, of army bases, shooting ranges and other  defensive facilities on their territories, as well as the use of  defensive facilities on each other's territory.    Now that it was ratified by both the Kazakh and Russian  legislatures, the treaty prevailed over the national  legislations. Nurgaliyev felt there was nothing new or  controversial in Yeltsin's order on Russian military bases  outside Russia.    Nurgaliyev failed to see as unacceptable long-term strategic  deployment of units under the Russian flag in Kazakhstan. If no  Russian troops remained on Kazakh territory, he said, it would  be more difficult for his republic to keep up its defensive  potential.    In Nurgaliyev's view, Kazakhstan and Russia shared strategic  interests in the field of defense and agreement would soon be  reached on the Sary-Shagan and Emba missile ranges (near the  Balkhash lake and the city of Aktyubinsk, respectively).</p>

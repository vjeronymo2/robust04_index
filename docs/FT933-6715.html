			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Friendly society members face levy LANCASHIRE &amp; YORKSHIRE Assurance, a friendly society, has told 67,000 policyholders that it has imposed a 12 per cent levy on their investments from August 1 to create a Pounds 10m compensation fund, pending a High Court hearing. More than half the policyholders at the troubled society - some 39,000  - have suffered as a result of a Pounds 4.3m property write off on investments in its Capital Secure fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash deposits and gilts. A further 7,000 could be eligible for compensation if the High Court rules that their policies qualify as tax-exempt. The society, which continues to pay claims on maturing policies, said in December that it would stop writing new business until the court ruled on whether compensation should be paid. In a letter to policyholders, Mr John Ramsden, chairman, said the court hearing had been delayed from July to September which meant the society had to consider steps 'to protect the interests of the members as a whole'. Mr Bernard White, treasurer, said that because L&amp;Y was a mutual society, members would be liable to pay the compensation were the High Court to decide that the society had to pay up. He said the society's actuaries had estimated that contingent liabilities at December 31 1992 amounted to Pounds 8.3m and that the society was being prudent in levying Pounds 10m to allow for further property falls. This is the first time a friendly society has imposed such a levy, according to the Registry of Friendly Societies. It means that even those who are expecting compensation are paying the levy. L&amp;Y said the Pounds 10m would be returned to members if the High Court ruling did not require it to pay compensation. The money has been raised by reducing all unit prices on the society's benefit funds by 12 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Morgachev, Vladislav Golubev, under the </F> rubric "Market of Nuclear Technologies": "U.S. and Russia  Combine Forces in Space Power Engineering"; first paragraph is  source introduction]    [Text] Specialists are combining the near future of  space hardware and the use of nuclear power units and propulsion  systems. The first such units have already been developed and  are "aloft," and the second generation is under development.  That field is one of the fields in which Russian firms still  have undisputed preeminence, which has enabled them to enter the  American market with their advances and begin collaboration with  American science centers and firms. The vice-president of the  science center Kurchatov Institute, Academician Nikolay  Ponomarev-Stepnoy, who just returned this week from the United  States, told KOMMERSANT DAILY that President Clinton's  administration continues to support that collaboration.  Commenting here on the situation is KOMMERSANT DAILY reviewer  Sergey Morgachev and expert Vladislav Golubev.  <H5>  Technology </H5>   Of the two types of space nuclear power unit under study  since the 1960s (see the sidebar at end of article), specialists  (both Russian and U.S.) now prefer small nuclear reactors.  Russian firms that have been on that road from the very  beginning have, at this point, achieved a 10-year lead over  their American competitors, who have been investing their money  primarily in work involving radioisotope generators.    Back in the times of the USSR, two groups of developers of  space nuclear reactors came about in Russia, and they developed  two models -- the Topaz and the Yenisey (which is now depicted  in the external market as the Topaz-2). Those units are roughly  equivalent in their main parameters, although they have certain  design features that differ. There are no American or other  foreign units like them.    Topaz: designed by the state enterprise Krasnaya Zvezda  (in Moscow); conceptual work and some tests performed by the  Physics and Power Engineering Institute (in Obninsk). Yenisey:  designed by the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building (in  St. Petersburg); conceptual work and some tests performed by the  Russian science center Kurchatov Institute. The NPO Luch (in  Podolsk), which is involved in fuel cells, is participating in  the work being done by both groups.    It's natural that those two groups of companies are  competitors --only the Topazes have gone aloft into space up to  this point (in 1987 and 1988), as have the Krasnaya Zvezda units  that preceded them. But the collaboration with the United  States, which has already produced commercial results, has so  far centered on the Yenisey. At the same time, there is also  interaction between the two "teams." At present, studies of the  new models of the nuclear units are being done jointly.    Russian firms also enjoy a large advantage in work being  done  in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles. That work,  which was being done intensely in the USSR in the '60s and '70s,  is continuing now, albeit on a much smaller scale. Low-thrust  jet engines, which can be used for maneuvering vehicles in  orbit, already exist in actuality in the form of experimental  models.    Russian organizations now involved (or once involved)  in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles: the science  center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), NPO Energiya (Kaliningrad),  Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes (Moscow), the  Design Bureau of Chemical Machine Building (Voronezh), the  Physics and Power Engineering Institute (Obninsk), NPO Luch  (Podolsk), the Scientific Research Design Institute of Power  Engineering (Moscow). Some of the work has been done at the  Semipalatinsk testing grounds (Combined expedition of NPO Luch,  the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes, and the  Kurchatov Institute); at present, the status of the facilities  at the testing grounds is the subject of talks between Russia  and Kazakhstan.  <H5>  Commerce </H5>   The good sense of a collaboration with the United States on  nuclear power units and nuclear engines for space is evident.  For the Russian firms, it represents the receipt of the first  tens of millions of dollars and the prospect of larger  contracts. For the American agencies, it represents an  opportunity to cut spending on military and civilian space  programs (the program under discussion now for the creation of a  new nuclear reactor could cost nearly $1 billion; the program  associated with a mission to Mars, $200 billion). For American  firms, it represents an opportunity to reduce the costs of  operations, which would enable them to "breach" their government  funding. There's also interest on the part of potential  commercial users of nuclear energy sources for space (the  Motorola company).    The U.S. administration, which is treating space programs  with a good deal of reserve, has still not made a decision about  the full-scale funding of the program for the nuclear power  unit, and certainly not about the Mars program or the nuclear  engines for it -- even though in NASA circles and American  aerospace firms right now, people are trying to move the idea of  a mission to Mars, which only recently was considered totally  science fiction, to a practical plane. At the same time,  however, a number of companies (such as Space Power, Rockwell  International, General Atomic, Aeroget, General Electric,  Westinghouse, Grumman, Thermo Electron, Rasor Associates,  Teledyne, TRW, Martin Marietta, and POD Associates) are  conducting research in both areas.    Russian firms are being brought in on the work on nuclear  power units through the firm International Energy Technologies  (INERTEC).    The INERTEC company was set up, on the Russian side, by  the science center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), the Central  Design Bureau of Machine Building (St. Petersburg), NPO Luch  (Podolsk), and the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal  Processes (Moscow) and, on the U.S. side, by the International  Scientific Products (ISP) firm. In turn, ISP was created by four  American science centers (including the well-known Los Alamos  Labs and Phillips).    At present, several contracts exist between the Russian  firms  and ISP. In the context of one of them, two Yenisey (Topaz-2)  reactors are at a laboratory center of Phillips, where ISP  specialists are conducting stand tests of them. The units were  delivered to the United States without a fuel charge, for  temporary use and on the condition that the right of property  belongs to the Russian firms, with no transfer to the United  States of technology or right to open the units. According to  that contract, the Russian firms received $13 million (funding  was by the U.S. Department of Defense); under discussion is the  delivery for temporary use of four more units, which could bring  in an additional $20 million (the customer could be a different  agency). In another contract, several series of tests are being  conducted on a stand belonging to the Institute of Nuclear  Reactors of the Kurchatov Institute center. The final point of  that stage consists of flight tests of the Yenisey and several  maneuvering engines -- including those developed by the  Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes and the  Kurchatov Institute -- on an experimental satellite that is to  be launched some time in 1995-1996.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Launches of Space Vehicles With Nuclear Power-Supply Units                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Country                  |Number of launches       |Year of last launch      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Radioisotope generators                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |USSR-Russia              |4                        |1969                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |U.S.                     |22                       |1977                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nuclear reactors                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |USSR-Russia              |35                       |1988                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |U.S.                     |1                        |1965                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      If things get as far as the opening in the United States of  a  full-scale program on a nuclear power unit, the Russian  contracting parties have some big opportunities to take part in  that program, and the amount covered by the contracts could be  on the order of as much as $100 million. At present, in yet  another contract, Russian firms that are members of INERTEC are  participating in preliminary studies of a reactor of higher  power (see the table below).

[Sidebar]     -  Nuclear power-supply units for space vehicles are  either radioisotope generators or small nuclear reactors. Work  on them and other units began in the USSR and the United States  in the '60s. The first such units had a very low limit of the  power that was actually achievable (on the order of 5 kW), which  is why at present the key direction being taken is the "reactor"  direction. Units that produce 6 kW have already been developed,  and research is under way to develop new units that produce as  much as 100 kW. At 25 kW and above, reactor units have an  advantage over all other energy sources in a key area -- ratio  of power to mass, with a very large service life (the duration  of operation). Nuclear reactors are especially effective for  orbital vehicles with large energy requirements and for  nonorbital flight.        -  Nuclear engines for space vehicles have been under  development in Russia and the United States since the '60s, but  the work was gradually cut back in connection with the  successful development of chemical engines. Both in Russia and  in the United States, there are experimental models of orbital  maneuvering engines in which nuclear energy is converted into  electrical energy for ionization, heat up, and acceleration of  the working medium. The concepts of a nuclear "sustainer" engine  with direct heat up of the working medium in the reactor or with  conversion of the energy to electrical energy are being studied.  It is felt that for use in interplanetary flight -- to Mars, for  example -- engine power will have to be 10-100 MW.</p>

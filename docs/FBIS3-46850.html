			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Marichu A. Villanueva] </F>   [Text] President Ramos has issued four executive orders  [EO] that will implement the Philippine program of reducing  tariff rates of 15 groups of products effective January 1994 in  compliance with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).    The president issued EO 145 up to 148 which he signed on  Monday, 27 December -- all of which will take effect 1 January  1994 except EO 148, which takes effect 30 days after publication  of the directive in two newspapers of general circulation.    For this purpose, the president approved the modified rates  of duty as provided for under the Tariff and Customs Code of  1978, as amended, to implement the 1994 Philippine schedule of  tariff reductions on the 15 articles included in the accelerated  and normal programs of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff  (CEPT) scheme for the AFTA.    The 15 groups of products included in the CEPT scheme for  accelerated tariff reductions are: vegetable oils, cement,  chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastics, rubber  products, leather products, pulp, textiles, ceramics and glass  products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, and,  wooden and rattan furnitures.    In EO 145, the president said that the six member states of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed  that there is a need to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers  that only serve to impede intra-ASEAN trade. The six member  countries of the ASEAN includes the Philippines, Indonesia,  Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and Thailand. The ASEAN member  countries have agreed to improve the existing Preferential  Trading Arrangements (PTA) in this regard.    To boost economic cooperation and intra-ASEAN trading, the  ASEAN member countries have agreed to do this through the CEPT  scheme which set a time frame of 15 years beginning January 1993  to reduce tariff rates from zero to five percent.    EO 145 says that products identified by the Philippines for  accelerated rate reduction under the CEPT scheme for the AFTA,  tariff rates (MFN/PTA) [expansion unknown] of 20 percent or  below shall be reduced to five percent and zero by 1 Jan 2000,  while tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above 20 percent shall be reduced  to five percent and zero by 1 January 2003.    For products identified by the Philippines for "normal rate  reduction," the tariff reduction to five percent and zero shall  be done in two stages, namely:    -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) of 20  percent or below, tariffs shall be reduced to five percent and  zero through a seven-year program starting 1 January 1996 up to  1 January 2003; and,    -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above  20  percent, tariffs shall be reduced to 20 percent by 1 January  2001. The subsequent reduction of tariff rates from 20 percent  to five percent and zero shall be done within seven years, with  the minimum rate of reduction set at five percentage points  every two years starting 1 January 2004 up to 1 January 2008.    EO 146 amends EO 43, series of 1992 by modifying the margins  of preference (MOP) and the applicable ASEAN Preferential  Tariffs on certain items included in the coverage in the  Philippine Exclusion List. In EO 43, the rates of duty of  certain imported articles as provided for under the Tariff and  Customs Code of the Philippines of 1978, as amended, provided a  minimum level of 25 percent MOPs in certain items in the  exclusion list.    EO 147 modifies the rates of duty on certain imported  articles as provided for in the Tariff Code to implement the 10  percent (MOP) granted by the Philippines under the agreement on  the Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) among developing  countries as set forth in the Philippine schedule of concessions.    The agreement on the GSTP was ratified by the Philippine  Senate on 2 September 1991 but the government has yet to  implement this international trade pact it inked with 47 other  developing countries.    EO 148, modifies the rates of duty on certain imported  articles as provided for under Presidential Decree 1464, as  amended, otherwise known as the Tariff Code of 1978.    Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the president is  empowered to amend tariff rates in case Congress is not in  session. Congress adjourned for the Christmas holidays and will  not resume sessions until next month.    In the case of cane or best sugar and chemically pure  sucrose  in solid form, including raw sugar, not containing added  flavoring or coloring matter, the existing duty rate of 70  percent was reduced to 60 percent effective 1 July 1994 and down  farther to 50 percent by 1 July 1995.    Prawn feeds remained at 20 percent import duty, as well as  gelatin, pharmaceutical grade and closed sterile water system  for inhalation, both at 10 percent. Unassembled starter motors  will remain at three percent.    Vulcanized rubber thread and cord will remain at the present  30 percent duty rate until July 1994 but will be reduced to 20  percent by 1995.    Pile fabrics of 100 percent polyester staple fibers used in  the manufacture of paint rollers measuring 2-1/2 to 3 inches in  width will be reduced to 10 percent.</p>

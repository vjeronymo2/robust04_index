			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KANKAI editorial staff: "Good or Bad </F> Minister--All Depends on How Much Budget He Can Acquire"]    [Text] Bureaucrats Bewildered by Non-LDP Minister    Within the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT],  bureaucrats are unable to conceal their bewilderment at the  inauguration of its new minister, Takenori Kanzaki. The ministry  has been so used to serving LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]  ministers that the appearance of the new Komeito minister seems  to be causing constant bewilderment over how to cope with him.    Not to mention such operational activities as mail, savings,  and postal life insurance, the ministry also administers  telecommunications-related policy fields such as electric  communications and broadcasts. These telecommunications-related  activities are the infrastructure for the upcoming  information-oriented society; therefore, for the time being, the  ministry does not have any task over which the ruling and  opposition camps have to confront each other.    The Ministry of Education and the Environment Agency have  been causing sharp ruling-opposition confrontations, the former  by producing textbooks which show different positions on the  "war of aggression" as expressed by Prime Minister Hosokawa at  the Diet and the latter by taking up in its administration the  position of avoiding Minamata disease [an organic mercury  poisoning stemming from eating fish polluted by mercury  discharged into the Minamata River, Kumamoto Prefecture]  compensations against the will of the coalition cabinet.  However, such is not the case with the MPT. Yet the appearance  of a minister from a somewhat mysterious party called Komeito is  bewildering to MPT bureaucrats who have been accustomed to the  one-sided rule of the LDP's 1955 system. .    Minister Kanzaki is a high-ranking official who is rumored  to  be next head of Komeito. What delights the MPT officials is that  they have a new minister who has a great future as a politician.  The MPT has been hailed as a government office that has handled  telecommunications for the last 10 years or so, and the status  of its ministers has kept rising under the LDP regime. For  example, its ministerial post has been assumed by those becoming  a minister for the second time. However, before then, many of  its ministers were rather secondary in status who retired from  the political world with service at the MPT as their last post.  For that reason bureaucrats are not particularly unhappy about  the young and promising Minister Kanzaki, although he is from a  different party.    Mr. Kanzaki was born in Tianjin, China, in 1943 in the midst  of the Greater East Asia War. After the war, he returned to  Japan and was brought up in Chiba City. He was such a brilliant  student that he passed the national bar examination while he was  still a junior at the Law Department of the University of Tokyo.  He has an exceptionally clear head, and at a press conference  after his first cabinet meeting, he spoke of accumulated  deficits in posts and telecommunications activities, citing  exact figures by simply relying on a lecture he had received  from the administrative staff without a note. Agape with  surprise were reporters who were used to the notion that it was  sufficient to remember only approximate figures.    Reportedly in the same class with him in the Legal Research  and Training Institute were reportedly Hokkaido Governor  Takahiro Yokomichi and United Social Democratic Party  Representative Satsuki Eda. His judgment as a politician is  sharp, and he moved up at high speed from the post of deputy  secretary general to the post of Policy Board chairman, then to  that of Diet Affairs Committee chairman, and to the post of MPT  minister. However, as to his career as a Diet member, although  he was elected to four consecutive terms after his first victory  in 1983 in the Fukuoka first district, his residence, if he  were an LDP member with this much experience, he would probably  have barely become a parliamentary vice minister at best.    In the Justice Ministry, he worked as a public prosecutor  for  14 years at district public prosecutor's offices in Yokohama,  Naha, etc. He wrote books such as A Ban on Offering  Profits. Partly because he was temporarily transferred to  the Foreign Ministry, he is conversant with the European and  Middle East affairs. He is thus a man of international  perspectives who once served as director of Komeito's  International Affairs Bureau.    As mentioned, the minister has a career with which nobody  can  argue, and he is a hope of Komeito; however, he has constantly  bewildered MPT bureaucrats whose contacts so far have been only  with the LDP. First, concerning his religious belief, when he  was asked at a press conference, "Are you a member of Soka  Gakkai [a Buddhist organization whose connection with Komeito  has been a subject of controversy]?" He quickly responded with  the following clear-cut answer: "I became its believer when I  was a middle school student. My parents did not get on well, but  they reconciled after joining Soka Gakkai. Seeing them restoring  their good relationship, I also joined it. It was fortunate for  me to meet Honorary Chairman Taisaku Ikeda. He is my teacher of  life."    No LDP minister revealed his religious beliefs as clearly as  he did, and so the administrative staff was startled all the  more. The administrative staff's bewilderment began with its  preconceived notion that Soka Gakkai rejected the existence of  other religions.    Concerning the NHK [Japan Broadcasting Corporation] morning  radio gymnastics program, it, in fact, began in the beginning of  the Showa era at the instruction of the MPT (then the Ministry  of Communications) to its subordinate organization NHK. For this  historical background, it is said to be customary that the MPT  minister attends the "National Radio Gymnastics Festival" held  every year during the summer. The festival this year opened in  Hiroshima City, and as customary Minister Kanzaki attended it.  Local organizations such as the Chugoku Regional Bureau of  Postal Inspection, the Chugoku Regional Bureau of Postal  Services, and the Chugoku Radio Regulatory Bureau, and NHK  opened a welcome banquet to thank the minister for coming all  the way from Tokyo to visit Hiroshima.    This annual banquet is usually held at a first-rate  restaurant within the compounds of a Shinto shrine in the city.  However, in consideration of the minister's special background,  they are said to have changed the place of the banquet to a  next-class restaurant in a business district in the city. Soka  Gakkai is a congregation of the Nichiren orthodox sect of  believers. The Buddhist monk Nichiren criticized other Buddhist  sects, saying that "the Shingon sect leads the nation to a ruin;  the Zen sect is a demon; and the Jodo sect deserves no  mentioning." However, he did not criticize Shinto. On the  contrary, he adopted the manifestation-of-the-prime-noumenon  doctrine [which regards Buddha and the national goddess as one  body], even viewing that the national deity is a guardian spirit  for Buddha. There is a mountain called Shichimenzan near the  Kuon Temple built by the Buddhist monk Nichiren on Mt. Minobu in  Yamanashi Prefecture. It is said that there is even a shrine  dedicated to this guardian spirit in Shichimenzan. Therefore,  people say that we should be careful not to hurt the feelings of  Soka Gakkai when handling Buddhist sects except the Tendai sect  where the monk Nichiren practiced asceticism; however, we need  not worry about its feelings too much when handling other  religions.    There are so many religions around the Japanese people that  they are rather insensitive to them. They should be careful in  this regard. For example, Daruma, whose formal name is  Bodhidharma, is the symbol of the Zen sect. Some specific post  offices place an "eyeless" Daruma statue in an "indoor Shinto  altar" and pray for achieving savings campaign goals. Because  "the Zen sect is a demon," Soka Gakkai members dislike this  practice, and we may say that it is rude to them to follow the  practice. Minister Kanzaki does not appear to be that sensitive,  though....  <H5>  Need To Change From Manipulated Marionette </H5>   What has bewildered bureaucrats next is the fact that,  unlike  LDP ministers, he is independent, individualistic, and active.  The LDP ministers studied along a course provided by officials  and answered at the Diet as instructed by them. Minister Kanzaki  is different from past ministers in that he is a new minister of  the Hosokawa coalition cabinet and that he is exhibiting his own  colors like Prime Minister Hosokawa.    The places which MPT ministers usually chose to see in their  observation visits were local post offices in Osaka, etc. Except  islands in Okinawa, they never visited any remoter places.  However, Minister Kanzaki expressed the desire to visit both the  largest and smallest post offices in his local observation trip.  This indeed startled officials. He thus inspected the "Tokyo  Central Office," the largest post office located in Ariake,  Tokyo. Perhaps, this is a common place that a minister would  like to visit and observe. It has modern zip-code reading  machines, and one can learn how things flow rationally in the  mail processing work. Therefore, past MPT ministers unfailingly  visited this place. This time, too, Minister Kanzaki observed  the office at the guidance of Ms. Tomoko Samura, director of the  Postal Division of the Tokyo Regional Bureau of Postal Services,  who is now climbing the ladder of success ahead of others among  career women within the MPT. Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked  quite pleased.    However, what annoyed bureaucrats was his visit to the  smallest post office. It is said that after making extensive  inquiries, they finally decided to visit the Tomiyama Post  Office in Tomiyama-mura, Aichi Prefecture, noting that the post  office could be reached without taking very much time. This  village has a total population of 210 in 83 households, and this  means that the Tomiyama Post Office is in a village with the  second-smallest population in the nation. As if squatting flat  on the ground, the houses are clustered together in the folds of  mountains standing along the Sakuma Dam (Sakuma-cho in Shizuoka  Prefecture), an artificial lake. The visit was reportedly  realized by the desire of the minister who said that "large post  offices are important, but I would also like to see with my own  eyes how usefully very small post offices are working for the  livelihood of the people."    In the early morning of 8 September, the minister and his  party left the Yudani Hot Spring in Aichi Prefecture where they  stayed overnight. They drove north and stopped to observe the  Sakuma Dam. Then they drove the winding lakeside road for about  two hours. Driving the bumpy road and watching timber-carrying  trucks running past them on the opposite direction, they finally  arrived at the village. MPT Minister Kanzaki is the first  minister to visit the area since the village was built in the  ninth year of Meiji [1876]. It is said that even LDP ministers  elected from the local Higashimikawa District have never set  foot in the village.    The Tomiyama Post Office is located in front of the village  office and has three members, including the office chief. The  minister observed the activities of the post office and was  briefed on the conditions of the area under its jurisdiction. As  for mail collection and delivery, this post office is reportedly  so situated that the mail-collecting job is quicker if the  collector comes from the post office in Iida City, Nagano  Prefecture, rather than from a nearby post office in the same  Aichi Prefecture. Among those who accompanied the minister was  Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services Director Hideki  Teranishi. Since not even its own regional bureau director has  ever visited this post office before, Minister Kanzaki's  actions, full of vitality, were all the more encouraging and, at  times, bewildering to MPT bureaucrats, whose stamina was no  match for that of the minister.    The minister and his party also observed a domed playground  at the Tomiyama Primary and Middle School. This is a playground  equipped with a dome system which spreads overhead in case of  rain. It was built with funds from the MPT postal life insurance  program. Unfortunately, it rained so hard that the dome's  spreading and closing operation was not demonstrated, but  Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked deeply moved upon learning  that postal life insurance funds were being used for developing  such a mountain village.    For the village, this was indeed the first visit by an  incumbent minister, and so village chief Yukio Kawakami  attempted to take this occasion to lodge an appeal. However, the  regional bureau prevented him from doing that on the instruction  from the ministry. Yet Minister Kanzaki eagerly listened to him.  The village chief said: "Ours is a small village, and so we need  the post office all the more. Not to speak of a city bank, we do  not even have a regional bank. The post office is the only  banking institution in this village. We want the post office to  remain with us forever." Reporting on the present village  conditions, he added: "Please apply rays of hope equally to the  countryside as well. Being a village nestling in the folds of  mountains, radio signals do not reach smoothly, and therefore  we cannot use pocket pagers or portable phones. The television,  too, does not throw clear pictures." If the visitor were an LDP  minister, he would have not lent his ear to the remarks of the  people in accordance with a scenario prepared by officials. At  the appearance of a non-LDP minister who actively intends to  hear the voice of the ministry's service customers, the  bureaucrats seem to feel that their job has become harder.    After finishing about two hours of his inspection, the  minister expressed the following view: "As a nation, we have to  value such a village in the underpopulated area. I would like to  treasure such a contact in the future as well." In response,  village chief Kawakami reportedly revealed with joy that "the  mere fact that the minister has visited us is enough to make us  happy."  <H5>  Astounded at Unexpected Eagerness To Learn </H5>   The minister is so eager to learn things that the places he  visits are quite beyond expectations, and therefore it seems  that MPT bureaucrats are busy chasing him in hot haste and  confusion. For example, in mid-September the minister even  inspected the "library" on the eighth floor of the ministry  building. The library of an office is its brains. A library does  not show the list of readers to the public. This is because  one's creed and ideology can be guessed by learning what books  one reads. Likewise, a government agency's course to take and  intellectual level can be guessed by what books its library has.  Minister Kanzaki, who inspected the library, is indeed no  ordinary person. We cannot but say that he is a man whose  intellectual level is high.    He also took MPT bureaucrats aback by choosing the MPT's  Communications Research Laboratory in Kodaira City, Tokyo, as  the first place to visit among subsidiary organs. An MPT  minister usually visits such facilities as NHK, NTT [Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation], and KDD [Kokusai Denshin  Denwa Co.] as his course of study. A leading member of the  Communications Research Laboratory joyously said that visiting  the laboratory first of all showed him to be not an ordinary  minister.    This laboratory is the eighth-largest among government  research organizations, but as the saying goes about piquant  though small, it has now become an indispensable organ. It  contributes to foreseeing huge earthquakes by measuring warps of  the Japanese Archipelago through the length of time in which  power sources arrive from a volume of radio waves. It also  tackles a program to develop a system for preventing crashes  between cars by having weak power sources released from the car  front. It is thus carrying out varied researches.    Deserving particular attention among them is the "atomic  clock" under the jurisdiction of the Frequency Standard Section  of the laboratory's Standard Measurement Division. It is  believed that everyone learned in social science courses at  primary and middle schools that Japanese standard time defines  as its noon the moment the sun crosses the meridian line of the  Akashi Astronomical Observatory located at longitude 135 degrees  east. We call this the astronomical time.    This astronomical time was good enough for our use in a mere  agricultural/industrial society. The length of time when the  earth revolves on its axis once was decided to be 24 hours. As  it is, the center of gravity is not the center of the earth,  thereby causing a one-second lag every several years. However,  we have now stepped into an "information-oriented society" in  which computers are mutually connected by communication  circuits, and so the astronomical time with such large lags is  no longer usable as the standard time.    In the first place, the computer can make several million  calculations per second, and astronomical time can no longer  cope with this tremendous speed. Such being the case, it is said  that the length of time in which the cesium-133 atom vibrates  9.192631770 billion times has been defined as a second. It is  this MPT laboratory that is taking custody of the "atomic clock"  which used the cesium-133 atom. NHK's timecasts, etc. are said  to originate in this laboratory and the time signals are sent  from NTT's shortwave transmitting station in Sanwa-machi,  Ibaragi Prefecture.    Now is an information-oriented society in which computer  networks constitute the infrastructure, and this is the very  reason that the atomic time becomes standard and the MPT's  Communications Research Laboratory controls it. Astronomical  observatories come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of  Education. Time in the agricultural/industrial society was  controlled by the Ministry of Education; however, it comes under  the MPT's control in the information-oriented society. MPT  Minister Kanzaki is indeed no ordinary man because he chose the  Communications Research Laboratory, which is so important to the  ministry, for his first observation visit. However, not many  MPT bureaucrats understand the significance of the  Communications Research Laboratory.  <H5>  They "Stuck Fast" to LDP, and Are Now Paying for It </H5>   The fourth reason for the bewilderment of the MPT  bureaucrats  regarding Minister Kanzaki was that they could not clearly  understand his personality at the beginning. High-ranking  bureaucrats, many of whom are graduates of former imperial  universities, cannot but view those who passed the national bar  examination with respect. Many of them, graduates in law, once  dreamed of taking the examination, but chose the path of career  bureaucrats because they lacked in both mettle and ability to  take the examination.    Therefore, they cannot hold up their heads before Minister  Kanzaki, a prosecutor turned politician, in that he passed the  national bar examination while they could not realize the dream  of passing it. They are thus "serving him with a feeling of  awe" (a division chief in the Communication Policy Bureau). It  is said to be clearly observable among MPT bureaucrats at the  beginning that they politely shunned him, suspecting that he  would be a stern man in view of his past service as a public  prosecutor considered a symbol of "relentlessness."    What is more, like a public prosecutor, he has a sharp look  in his eyes and speaks in a resolute tone; therefore, his image  rather strongly generates the feeling that he is a "fearful  minister." However, this impression completely changed during an  overnight stay in a hotel in the Yudani Hot Spring before his  visit to the Tomiyama Post Office. He held a social gathering  with accompanying reporters from private broadcasting stations,  and is said to have let loose and offered great service as a  merrymaker.    The occasion was also participated in by Mr. Teranishi,  director of the Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services, and  others. It was the bureaucrats who should have made the  gathering hilarious, but it reportedly was Minister Kanzaki who  delighted the attendants by exhibiting his very entertaining  talent. He appears to have really played merrily as indicated by  the following remarks by a leading official: "We did not expect  a prosecutor to make the place that merry." Since then, he has  been reputed within the MPT to be an understanding person and a  man of refined tastes.    However, when he has something to say, the minister minces  no  words and assumes a resolute attitude. For example, at Diet  committee meetings in the past, bureaucrats in respective  ministries and agencies concerned answered questions in place of  their ministers in the capacity of government members of the  committees. However, the Hosokawa cabinet adopted a system which  halted the practice of government committee members answering in  place of their ministers and made the ministers or newly  established deputy ministers (parliamentary vice ministers)  answer all questions. Reacting to this step, Minister Kanzaki  started posing questions and expressed his doubt about the  system at a ministerial discussion after the 31 August cabinet  meeting. He asked, "Was the abolition of the government  committee member system decided at the meeting of the leaders of  the government and coalition ruling parties on 30 August?" As  this questioning indicates, he says frankly what he has to say  and discloses his course of action clearly. On this score, his  reputation is said to be rising within the ministry.    However, the fourth [as published] factor contributing to  the  bewilderment of bureaucrats is the fact that they cannot clearly  understand Komeito policies. In this regard, it is bureaucrats  who are wrong. It is because they only stuck fast to the LDP  government and did not study the other parties' policies. MPT  bureaucrats used to say that "the party's thought is...," but  when they mentioned the "party" it meant the LDP, not any other  party. They have thus far ignored the other parties, and they  cannot but pay for it.    Komeito has put forward its proposal to the MPT with regard  to the budget for this fiscal year, and the proposal clearly  reveals Komeito's policy directions. First, in Paragraph (A) on  "the Expanded Improvement of the Information/Communications  Foundations," the party asks the ministry to: "subsidize the  local governments' CATV [cable television] establishment  programs in order to remove multiple radio disturbances"; "plan  to expedite the improvement of relay stations in order to  eliminate fringe areas where radio reception is poor"; "strive  to put to practical use broadcasting and communication systems  in the underground zone so that people there can hear broadcasts  and use portable phones without reception problems"; "work to  strengthen the radio surveillance system and step up control on  illegal radio waves"; "study and develop new frequency resources  and their utilization technique"; "promote the practical use of  the vehicle information communication system (VICS)"; "study and  develop ozonosphere protection through the use of radio waves";  "enlarge expenditures for developing the tropical rainfall  measuring mission (TRMM)"; "develop a pioneer research on highly  advanced home medical diagnosis and treatment system, etc."; and  "develop the communication and broadcasting technology satellite  (COMETS) and the next-generation COMETS."    Next, in Paragraph (B) on "the Improvement of  Telecommunications Projects," the party asks the ministry to:  "review the NTT's local-call rate system," "take measures to  prevent tapping of car and cordless phones," "step up measures  to support the production of various broadcasting media and  software," "expand sign-language broadcasting programs as well  as the character/voice multiplex broadcasting programs,"  "increase broadcasting program libraries," and "improve and  consolidate international broadcasting."    Then, turning to the sector of operational activities, in  Paragraph (C) on "Postal Services" the party calls on the  ministry to: "promote the installation of delivery mailboxes";  "study and develop a complete automation system in mail  processing"; "furnish information to local residents through the  expansion of the post office satellite communication network";  "promote diversified use of postal conveniences in a  highly-advanced manner at each post office in large cities";  "build complex facilities including welfare installations"; and  "develop low-pollution automobiles like methanol-fueled cars."    Moreover, in Paragraph (D) on "the Improvement of Postal  Savings Corresponding to Financial Deregulation" which became an  issue when Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, former minister, was serving,  the party asks the ministry to: "improve and consolidate a  system for lending postal savings to individuals"; "raise  tax-exemption ceilings for interest income from postal savings  for aged people, etc."; "expand the framework for independent  working funds in postal savings"; "work to increase operational  funds for local bonds and provide loans to local governments";  "establish new annuity-type savings"; "abolish the measure to  impose taxes on the interest from the part of contributions in  international volunteer savings"; and "install automatic  remittance machines for exclusive use at windows."    Last, with regard to postal life insurance, the party calls  for "development of new commodities," "improvement of the tax  system," etc. Minister Kanzaki is expected to make decisions in  line with these policies.  <H5>  Nagata-cho Report Card for Minister Kanzaki </H5>   Just one month after the Hosokawa coalition cabinet started,  ASAHI SHIMBUN in its 4 September [1993] evening issue rated  respective ministers under the title, "Report Cards for  Children's Class in Nagata-cho School." The article, carried by  the newspaper as its special weekend feature, was quite  interesting. As to the question, "Does he speak clearly in easy  language," Minister Kanzaki was rated "average." He was asked to  "make further efforts" on the following three questions: "Does  he carry through what he has decided?" "Does he move at  another's beck?" "Is he willing to tackle new things?" He was  rated "very good" regarding the last question, "Does he act big  or do things without much ado?" We might say he received an  "average" mark as a whole.    In the overall estimation, the marker appraised him rather  severely, saying: "He is a lawyer, and so it is understandable  that he is prudent. Yet it is hard to rate him because all of  his utterances show his failure to leave the framework of  bureaucrats' ideas. His efforts for learning is good, but we  hope that he will be able to speak in his own language as soon  as possible." Conversely, this means that he enjoys the trust of  bureaucrats. As stated in the beginning, he has no confrontation  with bureaucrats, and so it appears that his mistakes do not  show. However, as a former bureaucrat, he must be aware of  bureaucrats' tricks. A voice has been rising among mass media  calling on him to see through their tricks.    For example, concerning the issue of easing regulations,  Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations] and others are  requesting that "measures be taken for CATV businessmen so that  they can operate business by leasing circuits from  telecommunications enterprises." A responsible division  director made the following answer in this regard: "There are no  CATV businessmen who want that kind of thing. So there is no  need to ease regulation." There can be no need because it is the  very division director who has carried out the administrative  guidance, saying that "they must not lease circuits."    There is a strong voice saying that, as an ex-public  prosecutor, the minister should have an eye with which to see  through those deceptive answers by bureaucrats. When he develops  such an eye, the low rating he received from ASAHI SHIMBUN will  be obliterated. There is a strong voice of the people who pin  hopes on MPT Minister Kanzaki, a nice fellow.</p>

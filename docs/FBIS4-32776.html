			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said that the hemispheric summit convened by  Washington is a maneuver to discredit, take away authority from,  and overshadow the results of the Ibero-American forums.    Robaina, who yesterday departed for the foreign ministers  meeting of the nonaligned nations in Cairo, Egypt, indicated  that the manner in which the Miami summit has been orchestrated  speaks for itself on what its true goals are.    He noted: "That meeting seeks to overshadow what  Ibero-America has been doing."    He criticized the fact that the United States -- the nation  that has convened the hemispheric forum -- did not consult with  the nations of the area when it came time to establish the  summit's topics of discussion, the date, and the site where it  is to be held.    Robaina also considered it negative to "want to talk about  Cuba when we were specifically excluded, and because of the fact  the summit is being held in Miami," where the most aggressive  and right-wing sectors of the Cuban immigrants reside.    When questioned about whether Cuba would attend the meeting  if it were included among the participants, he said "we have no  fear of attending any forum we are invited to, even in Miami."    He explained that Cuba is not seeking an invitation and even  if it were on the list of participants of that summit, it would  question the manner in which the summit was convened, and the  date and the site chosen for the summit.    With regard to the IV Ibero-American Summit to be held from  14-15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, he said that this  summit's objectives could turn into a true forum for debate and  economic integration.    In terms of the nonaligned nations' meeting, he said that  Cuba was interested in strengthening this movement "to gain a  voice and authority that will allow us to debate on the  international level."    When questioned about the goal of his visit to the State of  Qatar, he said that it was due to an invitation by his colleague  who had visited Cuba some months ago. Robaina mentioned his  intention to inaugurate a diplomatic mission in that country.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Profession finds few surprises and much to digest - Tax Practitioners TAX PRACTITIONERS were yesterday busily digesting the fine print of one of the lengthiest finance bills in recent years, while stressing it contained few surprises. If the chancellor's Budget speech in March provided the hors d'ouevres, the finance bill represented a substantial main course filling in the details. 'It is a very impenetrable document, very technical and surprisingly thick,' said Mr Chris Adams, a tax partner with accountants Arthur Andersen. 'They certainly haven't skimped on the words. This will provide a lot of work for the profession.' Mr Roger White, head of tax at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'For practitioners, this is a bit like being given a new comic as a child. We can study, enjoy and grow to like it over the next few days.' The bill runs to more than 300 pages, with 211 clauses and 19 detailed schedules. Part of its significance lies in the fact that it follows the Budget speech so closely. Most important, it showed little sign of backing down from the chancellor's more controversial proposals, such as the removal of zero-rating on domestic fuel, and changes to petroleum revenue tax and advance corporation tax (ACT). 'This very closely follows the Budget speech,' said Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield from Touche Ross. 'Everything is in there that we expected. There is nothing new.' He pointed out that omissions - as already anticipated - included legislation on inheritance tax relief for traders at the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Much of the wording reflected the intentions laid down in the Budget speech or the press releases that accompanied it. The clauses on ACT mirrored draft versions already circulated. Among the lengthier items covered are changes to excise duties and Value Added Tax; details of the duty on the new national lottery; the treatment of overseas life insurance companies; and provisions for underwriters on the Lloyd's insurance market. There is also a substantial section on the taxation of exchange gains and losses. Mr Richard Law, a tax partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said his firm was disappointed that the bill contained this section. This meant there had been no time to include comments on the draft proposals issued earlier this year. There are also many attempts throughout the bill to introduce anti-avoidance clauses designed to prevent taxpayers from taking advantage of loopholes. Practitioners said considerable time must have been taken by the Inland Revenue to close a number of existing loopholes and prevent the creation of new ones. Other changes included confirmation of changes in the classification of residency for tax purposes; tightening taxation for foreign-controlled corporations; and final details of the pay and file system for corporations to be introduced from this September. Mr Andrew Evans, an employee benefits partner at Price Waterhouse, highlighted as important a new definition of 'accessories' to be applied to company cars, and amendments to discretionary trusts affecting funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes. Mr Adams said there were clauses in the legislation which would lead to test cases in the courts, such as clarifying when interest is payable in relation to debts between associated companies. 'The wording is not as clear and straightforward as you might expect,' he said. Mr White added: 'The bill is a whole collection of bits and pieces.' 'It's a terrible mish-mash, which jumps from one provision to another. If one thing stands out, it is advance corporation tax.' But he stressed the bill would be very interesting for specialists and generate considerable work: 'You won't find tax practitioners jumping out of windows.' The firm will be analysing the bill and encouraging its professionals to sell on their advice to clients so they can be guided 'down the cheapest route.' 'We will have a pretty good workload,' he said. 'And there is another Budget at the end of the year.'</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: The Midas touch The rising gold price has not been good for equities. In theory, that should not be the case since both are a hedge against inflation. But the equity market has also to contend with the fear that rising prices would push interest rates up again. High multiples which have been justified on the basis that low inflationary growth produces high quality earnings would look less acceptable if inflation returned. Such fears, though, would make sense only if the higher gold price really was a signal of a return to the inflationary psychology of the 1970s. By yesterday, a recovering London market rightly appears to have decided otherwise. If the FT-SE's reluctance to stick below 2,800 is encouraging, the market still seems stuck in a narrow range. There is no immediate prospect of a further cut in base rates. Institutional liquidity is tight, the Zeneca and BT issues loom, and the government cannot yet feel confident about its ability to fund the PSBR at current gilt yields. That could cause problems for the equity market. There is probably enough evidence of recovery to justify a forward multiple around 14. But the limited prospects for dividend growth would leave a market yield of less than 4 per cent looking niggardly if gilt prices fell sharply. The market is below this year's starting level and the economic background has improved but, until the funding position looks more comfortable, there is nothing to drive it higher. It is not surprising, then, that dealers are so susceptible to stories - about the gold price, for example, or multi-billion pound bids for biscuit companies.</p>

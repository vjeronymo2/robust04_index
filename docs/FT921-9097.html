			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu and NEC give warning on profits FUJITSU and NEC, two of Japan's leading computer companies, yesterday warned that profits in the year to end-March would fall sharply as a result of weakness in the markets for computers and computer components, including semi-conductor chips. Fujitsu said yesterday that parent company pre-tax profits were expected to plunge by 60 per cent to Y50bn (Dollars 394.9m), while consolidated pre-tax profits could be down by as much as 80 per cent to Y30bn. NEC's parent company pre-tax earnings are likely to be off by 30 per cent to Y100m, while consolidated results could be down by 45 per cent to Y170bn, the company said. The cuts in profits are a reminder that Japanese companies are not immune to the worldwide slump in the computer industry. IBM, the world's biggest computer company, is expected to report the first loss in the company's history in 1991. Both companies had earlier warned that profits would be down in the current fiscal year, but have had to revise estimates further in the light of unexpectedly weak markets. The two companies have been hit hard by the plunge in prices of 4 Megabit dynamic random access memory chips, the latest generation of high-capacity computer memory chips. The experience has underscored the huge risks that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have assumed in their race to stay at the cutting edge of technology in memory devices. Both companies have already moved to cut capital spending, although they said yesterday they were still considering plans for the next fiscal year. Fujitsu said that ICL, the British computer company which it acquired about a year ago, would not be affected by any spending cuts.</p>

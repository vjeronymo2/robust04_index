			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: First fund authorised by SFC launched in HK CREDIT Lyonnais Rouse, the futures arm of the French bank, has launched the first fund in Hong Kong authorised by the colony's Securities and Futures Commission. A second fund, from ED &amp; F Mann, the futures fund specialist, has also been authorised. The strong appetite for speculative investments in Hong Kong has fostered hopes that futures funds may find an enthusiastic investor base. The official authorisation means the funds can be marketed directly to Hong Kong residents. The SFC last month published detailed guidelines, containing both disclosure and structural regulatory requirements, for futures funds seeking authorisation. 'In Hong Kong, there does appear to be a demand for investment products that might involve a high degree of risk,' commented Mr Robert Nottle, chairman of the SFC. 'The SFC is of the view that it is preferable for such demand to be channelled into authorised funds that carry fund risk disclosure and other investor protection requirements than to be channelled into areas where there is no regulation.' The fund, CLR Select Futures Fund, has also been authorised in Luxembourg and Germany, and is being examined by the Australian authorities. Credit Lyonnais Rouse already manages Dollars 24m in existing futures funds. ED &amp; F Mann's MAP II fund is managed using quantitative techniques; its predecessor, MAP I, raised Dollars 18m. Mann has a total of Dollars 1.1bn under management in futures funds.</p>

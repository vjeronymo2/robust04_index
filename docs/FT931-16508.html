			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Belgians acquire Ravenhead THE RAVENHEAD Company, the glass tableware company based in St Helens, Lancashire, has been acquired for an undisclosed cash sum by Durobor UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Belgium-based Durobor Group. Mr Jon Peacock of Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance, which acted for Ravenhead, said that a small proportion of the consideration was deferred. In 1990, Ravenhead and its Canadian parent were sold to management and US financial investors in a Pounds 27m buy-in. The Canadian trading company is now in receivership, and Ravenhead Holdings, after selling its trading company to Durobor, will be a shell. Mr Peacock said he was not at liberty to reveal Ravenhead's profits for the year to June 1992, though he did say that turnover was Pounds 18m. The results were being signed yesterday, and would be filed shortly, he added. When asked whether Ravenhead was being rescued, he said: 'Ravenhead will benefit from the acquisition.' Ravenhead, which employs 390 people, is market leader in the supply of glass tableware (mostly glasses and ashtrays) to the licensed victualling trade, where it has an estimated 50 per cent share. Mr Peacock said there was synergy in the deal, in that Durobor, which exports 80 per cent of its production worldwide, is strong in stemware, whereas Ravenhead is strong on tumblers.</p>

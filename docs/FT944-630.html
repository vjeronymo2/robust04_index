			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): De La Rue/Portals - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Portals' shareholders may be disappointed that its board failed to fight: a contested take-over would probably have raised the final price paid by De La Rue. But in an industry where customers are governments, and discretion is a byword, the damage wreaked on both businesses during a hostile bid could have been significant. Shareholders are being offered a fair price for a fair business. The rationale for combining De La Rue's printing expertise and Portals' paper technology is impeccable. Governments are increasingly concerned about counterfeit bank-notes. De La Rue will be able to marry the two groups' anti-fraud technologies, offering worried customers a comprehensive service. And Portals' paper distribution network will help De La Rue market its high denomination, high-margin bank-notes to governments which are unwilling to invest in expensive technology for low-volume print runs. Finally, De La Rue will be able to market verifying machines based on paper technology to clearers and central banks. Fears that De La Rue is deepening its exposure to paper money, when a cash-less society is on the horizon, are groundless. Use of cash is set to expand rapidly in the developing world, while a cash-less first world will remain a pipe dream in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, concerns remain. De La Rue needs to allay fears that competing bank-note manufacturers will be unwilling to buy paper from its new subsidiary. Given few opportunities for cost cutting, the group will have to demonstrate the synergies of putting the companies together are real. The acquisition is sensible if not sensational.</p>

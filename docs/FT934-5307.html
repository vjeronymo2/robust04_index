			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (8): Tapping into undeveloped reserves - Iain Simpson examines the government's plans to exploit its oil and gas fields As its joint oil venture with the former Soviet Union lurches from one crisis to another, Vietnam is looking at ways of making more money out of its oil and gas reserves. The government's priority is to recover the gas now being flared off by VietSovPetro, the joint venture between Hanoi and Moscow. Plans to exploit gas from undeveloped fields are also being assessed and exploration contracts will soon be let on other areas. The Australian company, BHP Petroleum, has struck oil in the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field it is drilling off the south-east coast of Vietnam. BHP officials say their floating production system means the find can be exploited soon - certainly by the middle of 1994. BHP estimates recoverable reserves in the field at 7-800m barrels of oil. The company also says 2-3,000bn cubic feet of gas exists in Dai Hung. The gas from Dai Hung will not be piped out until well into next year but the state oil company, PetroVietnam, is pursuing ways of recovering gas from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, the only Vietnamese field from which oil is now being pumped. Bach Ho was discovered by Mobil in January, 1975, but three months later the company was forced to abandon its drilling rigs and flee the country in the face of the advancing North Vietnamese troops. Two years later, Vietnam established its own state oil company, PetroVietnam. In 1981, the state company set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union, VietSovPetro and three years later the first oil was pumped out of Mobil's field. Since then, VietSovPetro has been draining the reserves at Bach Ho and flaring off the associated gas. It is producing 130,000 barrels a day. Critics in the oil industry say the Soviet technology is out of date and the oil reservoir is not being properly conserved by VietSovPetro. Indeed, PetroVietnam has just let two contracts - one for reservoir management and one for rig maintenance - to foreign companies. These tasks are normally carried out by the company drilling the wells. A proposal to recover gas from the Bach Ho field has also been put out to tender and British Gas, one of the companies bidding for the scheme, believes there is a large untapped market for gas in Vietnam. The project is split into two phases: under the 'fast track' phase one, an underwater pipeline will bring the gas onshore near the south-eastern port city of Vung Tau. Five foreign engineering companies have bid for this Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m contract and the tenders are to be examined by the middle of next month. Phase two involves an expansion of the pipeline capacity from phase one and the construction of an LPG plant. Industry sources say three foreign consortia have bid for this second phase of the project, worth Dollars 400m. At least one of these bids has been in since June and the bidders are pushing the government to make an early decision, saying that otherwise the reserves will continue to diminish as they are flared. Hanoi is also keen to discover and exploit other potential reservoirs of gas offshore and is seeking bids from companies to exploit gas reserves in offshore blocks which are now being drilled for oil. The gas pumped ashore by the phase one pipeline, which Hanoi hopes will be completed by the end of next year, will be used mainly to generate electricity at a power station near Vung Tau. Industry sources say the turbines, now powered by imported fuel oil, can easily be adapted to use natural gas. There is currently almost no domestic market for gas in Vietnam, except for a small onshore field in the north, used for electricity generation and piped to a ceramics factory. British Gas, which leads one of the consortia bidding for phase two, believes the higher volume of gas brought onshore can be used to develop a domestic market. A study carried out by the company 18 months ago concluded that in the short term, the Vietnamese market could absorb 2bn cubic metres a year. Phase two could bring between 1bn and 1.5bn cubic metres onshore annually and British Gas says it wants to promote the use of natural gas among industries in the south which now rely on electricity. Power is in short supply in the south, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City. However, the government is spending Dollars 500m on a north-south power line to carry excess electricity from north to south and may not welcome attempts by foreign companies to promote alternative sources of power. After a gap of 18 years, a team from Mobil is back in Vietnam, led by regional vice-president Bob Aberbach. The company has bid for a production-sharing contract on the Blue Dragon field, which will soon be awarded by the state oil and gas corporation. At the time of writing, the US trade embargo against Vietnam prevents American companies from doing most kinds of business in the country but, under the recently relaxed rules of the embargo, American oil companies can go a long way towards exploring potential fields. 'We can sign production-sharing contracts, carry out exploration drilling and appraisal drilling, which is the first stage in any production-sharing programme,' Mr Aberbach said.</p>

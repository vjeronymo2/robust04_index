			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Support for CrossRail Sir, I refer to articles by Charles Batchelor and Kevin Brown ('CrossRail plan doomed despite MPs' support', July 1; 'Expiry of London's Pounds 110m ticket to nowhere', July 2), in which reference is made to a 13-point letter sent by Dr John Marek MP to his Labour Party colleagues. In the letter, Dr Marek says if 'the promoters rethink the proposals and have a go at integrating CrossRail with the rest of the transport network, the project should be given the go-ahead'. The CrossRail promoters welcome this support, because this is precisely the position. CrossRail is already planned to connect to 26 lines through 46 interchanges. In addition, the promoters have stated they will give binding undertakings to the committee to promote an additional provision that will provide for the construction of links to Heathrow Express and the proposed Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Finally, it is significant that nowhere within Dr Marek's 13 points or the full letter does he say that CrossRail should not go ahead.

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDELLIN CARTEL DENIES PLOT TO KILL BUSH DURING ANDEAN SUMMIT  </P> <P> Drug lords stepped up their public relations blitz, announcing that they have  no plans to kill President Bush during a February drug summit and promising to  release a Colombian diplomat abducted Friday in the capital.  </P> <P> Warring drug cartels last month staged a number of kidnapings to extort ransom  but recently have been releasing captives to persuade the government to  negotiate a cease-fire.  </P> <P> Furthering the public campaign for negotiations, the Medellin cartel late  Monday issued a communique, purportedly signed by fugitive kingpin Pablo  Escobar, saying the cocaine traffickers have no plans to assassinate Bush when  he meets Feb. 15 with Andean leaders in the Colombian port city of Cartagena.  </P> <P> Escobar, wanted for extradition to face drug charges in the United States, also  denied a report that the traffickers are smuggling shoulder-fired SAM-7  missiles into Colombia to attack Air Force One as Bush lands.  </P> <P> CBS-TV News reported last week that the Secret Service was investigating a  drug-ring plot to kill the President during his anti-narcotics summit with the  leaders of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.  </P> <P> In its communique, the Medellin cartel promised to release Roberto Garcia Pena,  a Colombian official kidnaped last week in Bogota. When freed, Garcia Pena will  be carrying a message from the cartel, the announcement said.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the cocaine czars offered to surrender if the government agreed  not to extradite them to the United States. The offer signaled a tactical turn  away from the bombing onslaught begun last year that killed almost 200 people.  </P></p>

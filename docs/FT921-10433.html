			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sasib increases turnover by 24% SASIB, the Italian specialised engineering group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised turnover by almost 24 per cent to L766bn (Dollars 639m) last year thanks to continuing acquisitions. Adjusted for the takeover of General Railway Signal and LUZI, two railway equipment groups bought but only partly consolidated in 1991, sales rose by 5.3 per cent. Including the acquisitions, Sasib's order book jumped by 73 per cent to L735bn at the end of last year against L425.5bn at end-1990. To fund its continued expansion and bolster its balance sheet, the company is raising at least L78.5bn in new capital. Sasib will issue 15.7m new savings shares, to be priced at no less than L5,000 each, as part of a convertible bond issue. The money will help to improve Sasib's balance sheet after last year's acquisitions, which contributed to a L54.4bn fall in net liquidity to L68bn at the end of 1991.</p>

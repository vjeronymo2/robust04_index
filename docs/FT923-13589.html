			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: South African theatre after apartheid It has taken the visit of an American director to stir the stagnant waters of South African theatre. Two decades of cultural isolation, combined with the widely-felt need to testify against apartheid, have created a local drama scene in South Africa of much energy but little variety. Now directors, writers and actors face new possibilities. But inevitably many find it difficult to shift their focus, to find new ways of saying and showing. Professor Richard Schechner of New York University is the first international director of repute to work in South Africa for a long time. He is a guest director at the current Standard Bank National Festival of the Arts in Grahamstown, the elegant university town which was once at the heart of 19th century settler-Xhosa wars. Schechner, who was jointly sponsored by the bank and the US government, has brought August Wilson's play, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He cast and rehearsed it in Johannesburg, using mainly unknowns, before opening it at the festival this week. The play is set in a Chicago blues recording studio in the Twenties and is a cameo of racial attitudes then and now. Unlike most of the 120-odd plays at the festival, it is not set behind a proscenium arch; instead, Schechner uses the entire auditorium as a stage. Thus the focus falls on the stage, rather than circumstances alluded to; on direction rather than performance; and on unspoken intimacies and nuances of relationship rather than statements. This obliqueness is foreign to the often strident realism and rhetoric of local theatre as it has succumbed to the twin pressures of reduced public funding of the arts and anti-apartheid orthodoxies. The production represents one fruitful direction for the future. Others are emerging as artists face what Nadine Gordimer, echoing the psychologist Erich Fromm, calls the 'fear of freedom'. For the first time, a state-sponsored arts council, the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal, has staged a work by the Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian poet and dramatist, Wole Soyinka. His Death and the King's Horseman, staged with statuesque simplicity, depicts the conflict between British colonial values and tribal custom. The tribal scenes are written with often operatic flamboyance, the colonial with easy, sardonic wit. The production boasts several fine performances, notably one of weary cynicism by one of the country's most impressive actresses, Nomhle Nkonyeni, who started her career with Athol Fugard's Serpent Players in Port Elizabeth in the Sixties. A variant of the focus on the local is the blending of Fugardian psychological realism with the exuberant expressionism of song-and-dance of black improvised theatre. The blend is still uneasy, with marked gear-changes from action within the stage, which the audience observes, to action intended to arouse the audience. Breaks in narrative flow for a toyi-toyi performance (toyi-toyi is the march dance used by black militants) to underline a politically correct sentiment demand a degree of flexibility of the audience. This artistic eclecticism is seen, for example, in Life imn Hostels by the Zakheni Cultural Group, which also demands trilingualism, being performed in an insouciant mixture of English, Afrikaans and Zulu, like many workshopped plays. The play takes place in a hostel for migrant mine-workers: intense, poignant revelations of degradation break suddenly into rousing tribal songs and dances; horrifying disclosures are swiftly followed by mordant comedy. Such violent disjunctions are smoothered in Ekhaya-Museum Over Soweto by painter/writer Matsemela Manaka. His musical is about a returning exile's dream of establishing Soweto's first museum. A band is on stage; the master of ceremonies is drunk and libellous; uplifting speeches are made at the audience, and calabashes of beer passed round. The ritual of the opening ceremony is intentionally blurred with the rituals of performance. Multi-culturalism is more smoothly achieved in The Nuga Moya Cinderella by Natal's Theatre for Afrika. Their musical burlesque is set in a rural post office, complete with a gallery of South African types: the officious postmaster, the right-wing clerk, the resentful, militant son of the dead tea-lady. To raise money for his education, the post office staff stage a version of Cinderella for the village, setting their version in a Zulu kingdom. The white right-wing clerk plays the king; the handsome prince is played as a Soweto rock singer who is not too interested in rural grandeurs; the ugly sisters are played by a white and a black clerk. Ostensibly a light comedy, it consciously creates an image of hope and co-operation, identifying what is and what might be in the country at large. Facing new freedoms has also encouraged South African playwrights to deal with topics previously considered insignificant: preserving wildlife; sexual inequality; sexuality itself. A bizarre feature of this new freedom is some nostalgia for the immediate past - of about three years ago. An Afrikaans duo has disinterred early Boer and Afrikaans songs, which they perform with all the flair of cabaret and disco. When they do the national anthem, Die Stem and come to the verse which talks of dying for the country, black audience members are stalking out, to the performers' apparent surprise. White audience members took the same line when the country's best-known satirist described sex with identical twins in what is his first mature, well-made play, Die Vleiroos (The Marsh-Rose). Pieter-Dirk Uys's play is his first to plumb beneath political surfaces. Like a surprising number of new South African works, it features a motif of a father-figure, dead but still influential, whom strong, living and often crazy women fight against. It's an apt metaphor for the emergent South African theatre.</p>

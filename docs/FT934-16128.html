			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Italian bankers on fraud charges THREE prominent bankers have been arrested on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy relating to the 1991 collapse of Federconsorzi, the powerful Italian agricultural services group. Federconsorzi was forced into liquidation in May 1991 with outstanding debts of L4,200bn (Pounds 1.74bn). These are the first arrests connected with the affair, which caused widespread friction with foreign creditors over full repayment of debts contracted by the agricultural services group. Those arrested yesterday were Mr Paolo Bambara, the Federconsorzi chief executive, and Mr Rosario Corso, a senior member of the management of the leading state-controlled bank, Credito Italiano. It was revealed yesterday that a week ago police arrested Mr Paolo Lorenti, the financial director of Federconsorzi. The charges allege that these men abused their positions when Federconsorzi was on the brink of collapse, ensuring that certain bank loans were reimbursed in full prior to the formal liquidation process. The arrests highlight the increasing involvement of the banking system in investigations into corruption. Earlier this week police arrested Mr Franco Matera, a senior manager at the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricultura, for allegedly helping to facilitate a L2.5bn bribe for a contract for nine helicopters supplied to the Italian security forces by Augusta, the state-controlled helicopter manufacturer. Meanwhile, Milan magistrates have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Enrico Braggiotti, former chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana, allegedly in connection with Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) paid to him by the late Mr Raul Gardini while head of Ferruzzi-Montedison. Greek supreme court prosecutors yesterday dropped their investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Italy's Calcestruzzi, court officials said, Reuter reports from Athens. Calcestruzzi, which is controlled by the Feruzzi group, bought the major share in Heracles, Europe's biggest cement exporter, in 1992 for Dollars 225m (Pounds 149m) in a joint venture with the state-run National Bank of Greece. According to prosectors, No evidence had been found to justify charges against employees of the state-run company, or any others involved in the sale. Feruzzi's financial executive, Mr Giuseppe Berlini, had alleged that Greek politicians received bribes to expedite the sale of the cement company.</p>

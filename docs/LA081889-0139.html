			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Keye/Donna Wins Bridgestone Account: Los Angeles ad agency  Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, which recently resigned the Suzuki automotive business,  has picked up the estimated $10-million Bridgestone Tire account. Ads for the  Japanese-owned tire maker, which were formerly created by the firm Lintas:  Campbell Ewald, will now be created by Keye/Donna's year-old New York office;  this single piece of business more than doubles the annual billings at that  location.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE ON SANTE FE  </P> <P> One more letter about Jerry Hulse's article on Santa Fe ("The Lure of Santa  Fe," June 3). You had to have grown up there to appreciate all the beauty and  personality of the area. I don't return often enough, but I will always  remember Santa Fe, and always with love and pride.  </P> <P> BEVERLY HARRIS WEST  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

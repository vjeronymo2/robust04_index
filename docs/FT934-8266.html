			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties find support SELECTED property shares advanced as James Capel, the London institutional broker, reiterated its bullish stance on the sector. The broker, which first turned positive a year ago, said it continued to recommend an overweight position because of what it believes to be the continuing improvement in the market fundamentals. In particular, the broker notes that 'when rental growth begins, property will cease to be rated purely in terms of the cost of money, but more in terms of the income growth potential'. Capel is recommending Land Securities, which advanced 7 to 715p yesterday. While the broker is forecasting a net asset value of 647p this year, it said this could grow to 900p to 950p within three years. Elsewhere in the sector, Slough Estates climbed 8 to 254p and British Land 3 to 401p.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Clinton buys in time to boost Christmas sales Clinton Cards added 86 shops to its chain of 277 greeting card and gift stores in a Pounds 3.5m purchase announced yesterday alongside its interim results. The group, which is controlled by the Lewin family, claims that the acquisition from its principal card supplier, Hallmark, the UK arm of the US group, lifts its share of the UK greetings card market from 7.5 per cent to 9 per cent. The acquisition will lead to the closure of more than 12 stores where Hallmark shops compete with Clinton Cards in England and Wales. 'It basically takes a competitor out of the high street,' said Mr Clinton Lewin, managing director. Pre-tax losses deepened from Pounds 956,000 to Pounds 2.19m while turnover edged up from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 32.7m in the six months to July 30. An interim deficit is normal because the chain makes a large proportion of its profits in the Christmas period. The group blamed weak consumer confidence for a 4 per cent drop in like-for-like sales and a 'disappointing' operating loss of Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 770,000). In June the shares fell 31p to 105p after the company warned that profits were unlikely to exceed last year's Pounds 3m. Hallmark's 86 shops incurred a loss of Pounds 345,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 21.1m. The purchase, which includes Pounds 2.7m of stock, will be completed before Christmas trading begins. A cash consideration will be paid over four and a quarter years without interest, with annual repayments linked to Clinton's purchase of Hallmark goods. Gearing stood at about 60 per cent at the period end. Losses per share emerged at 8.4p (3.66p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.6p. COMMENT Clinton Cards' acquisition of the Hallmark shops seems to make sense for the card retailer. The stores should need little work to fixtures and fittings, and will be trading for Clinton over the busy Christmas period. Moreover, Clinton's repayments are attractively linked to its demand for Hallmark goods over the next four years. The interim results are worse than last year, but are not as gloomy as expected after this summer's profits warning. The group is thought to have improved cost control and should be in a good position to benefit when consumer confidence returns. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m for the year, which gives a prospective multiple of 13.7 on yesterday's close of 103p, up 2p. For those confident of an upturn in consumer spending, the shares have scope for further recovery.</p>

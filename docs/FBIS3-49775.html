			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec said today that it would be in the Czech  Republic's interest that its neighbors belong in the same  military grouping. Speaking with CTK after the dinner he hosted  for his counterparts from the Visegrad Group, which comprises  besides the Czech Republic also Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia,  he said that "no one wants his border to be the border of  confrontation."    Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that Poland  would not object to one Visegrad country entering NATO earlier  than the others. "But if Poland were the first, this would not  be in harmony with its security interests," he stressed.    Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said he thought that  all Visegrad Group countries had good reasons to closely  cooperate and that they enjoyed similar conditions within the  Partnership for Peace project.    At a press conference following the dinner, Zieleniec said  that in addition to technical-military measures, which are  already being prepared by the Czech Defense Ministry, the  political dimension of the Partnership for Peace should also be  dealt with. He said that closer political cooperation must be  established with the NATO countries. "This is the road that  leads towards building a firm defense union in Europe," he  stressed.    Zieleniec and his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky said  they gave priority to political consultations.    Moravcik said that Slovakia favored a balanced course of  action that would combine both the political and military  aspects of the project.    Polish Minister Andrzej Olechowski said he expected first  missions of the U.S. Army and NATO to come to the Visegrad  countries.    Poland's partial dissatisfaction with the Partnership for  Peace is due to the lack of specific prospects for admission  into NATO, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said  following a dinner of the Visegrad foreign ministers this  evening. "We have many promises, political declarations, but we  lack specific prospects," he said.    The artificial border between the two parts of Europe that  was created in 1945 will continue to divide Europe as long as  those countries nearing the West politically, economically, and  by their moral values are pushed aside, said Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky.    Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec termed the  Partnership  for Peace an important step towards integrating the Visegrad  countries with NATO and towards building a new security  architecture in Europe. "If more partners are to agree, none of  them will get 100 percent of what they want," he said. He  stressed, however, that the project in its current form, as  opposed to the original version, had extraordinarily significant  political dimensions.    Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said that it is  important that the Partnership for Peace be followed quickly by  further steps.</p>

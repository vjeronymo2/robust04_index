			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Siege mentality takes a grip on the Protestants - Loyalist view Hoarding of goods had begun on the Shankill Road yesterday. Shops said that candles, gas lighters and basic foods were in demand all day as many Protestants made provision for a breakdown in law and order. 'The siege mentality is taking hold down here,' one shopkeeper said. 'I'm calling it the peace dividend.' Fear was evident yesterday in the Shankill Road and other working-class unionist strongholds - fear that the IRA ceasefire followed concessions made by the British government and fear that the IRA will not hand over its guns, enabling the violence to continue. The talk along the Shankill yesterday was of a civil war in Ulster being 'the obvious outcome' if the British government has traded in the unionist veto for the IRA ceasefire. 'People have reacted very badly,' said Mr Bob Stoker, an Ulster Unionist party activist who lives near Sandy Row, another Protestant area. 'They have not taken it calmly at all. There has been a great run on food stores and people have sold out of gas cookers, candles and paraffin lamps,' he said. 'People are prepared to wait and see for a short while but while they do so they are getting prepared,' Mr Stoker said. 'Ordinary people down here will not be put in a situation where they can be starved into defeat.' Tension in Protestant areas of inner-city Belfast was heightened following a raid by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on two houses last night. According to the Rev Eric Smyth, a councillor for the hardline Democratic Unionist party, the police smashed down the door of one house in spite of it being empty. 'Tempers are very high at the moment,' he said. 'The feeling is very bad.' Mr Smyth said concerns developed after part of yesterday's Sinn Fein celebration procession involving more than 50 cars, taunted and threw sticks at children playing in a Protestant area near to the Catholic Falls Road. Suspicion is also rife. The Rev Brian Moore, minister at the West Kirk Presbyterian church on the Shankill Road, talked of disaster if concessions had been made by the British government. 'If that does emerge then that's another ball game altogether,' he said. 'That would be a very serious situation which we would find very difficult to control.' 'We have longed for peace. But I suppose there is a suspicion in the community that there may be a hidden agenda with the government and the IRA, that a deal has been done.' Mr Moore said there was 'disillusionment with our political representatives,' but 'hopes loyalist paramilitaries will assist the peace process'. Mr David Ervine, a leading member of the Progressive Unionist party, which is thought to have insight into the UVF, the loyalist para-military organisation, thinks the ceasefire will aid the peace process - but only when it is clear no deal has been done. 'If the government can assuage the fears of unionists I would expect an immediate response,' he said. He believes this would involve a ceasefire announcement by the main loyalist terrorist groups. 'If assurances are given the loyalist weapons will be laid down, and laid down quickly,' Mr Ervine said. Other unionists were willing to look on the bright side. Mr Michael McGimpsey, an Ulster Unionist party councillor in Belfast, believed assurances from the British government that no deals had been done. Mr McGimpsey believed that the 'cul de sac' argument may be the real reason the IRA called a ceasefire. 'They may finally have realised that their tactics were not getting them anywhere,' he said. But he also warned: 'If people believe the IRA have stopped because they have got something then we are in for a very difficult time.'</p>

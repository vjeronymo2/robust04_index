			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DOUBTS TOLD ON SUPER REGULATOR OF SECURITIES, FUTURES MARKETS  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board does not think creating a super regulator is the  answer to disputes between the agencies that oversee the securities and futures  markets, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate panel today.  </P> <P> "We believe some changes to the existing regulatory system are necessary to  avoid the prospect that jurisdictional disputes among regulators will impede  innovation in our financial markets, but consolidation of jurisdiction is not  necessary to achieve this objective," Greenspan said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Greenspan also said the division of authority between the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not  increased the sharp price drops that have spooked small investors out of the  stock market.  </P> <P> "The board does not believe that the existing division of regulatory authority  has increased volatility in the securities markets," the head of the nation's  central bank told the securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing  and Urban Affairs Committee.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramoncito P. De La Cruz] </F>   [Text] A total of 353 critical public infrastructure and  social services projects, with an aggregate cost of P67.771  billion [Philippine pesos], has been approved by the Ramos  Cabinet the other day to form part of the Core Public Investment  Program (CPIP) next year, the National Economic and Development  Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday.    Out of the total, only P23.008 billion will be shouldered by  the national government as most of the projects will be funded  either by international financial institutions or through  internal cash generation resources of government-owned and  controlled corporations [GOCCs].    In real budgetary terms, government will shell out P21.212  billion in local counterpart funds and subsidies to government  corporations and the GOCCs will give P1.796 billion through  their incomes.    Based on the aide-memoire submitted to the President, the  CPIP projects will be "spared from any budget cuts even if  government's fiscal position worsens during the year," with the  end view of "restoring government's effectiveness in  implementing critical projects."    Based on the approved list of core investments,  agro-industrial development projects accounted for 55 projects  amounting to P1.861 billion; human development sector, 64  projects costing P4.906 billion; infrastructure support sector,  222 projects worth P60.842 billion; development administration,  five projects worth P12.896 million; and disaster mitigation  projects, six projects worth P149.156 million.    Among the selected projects, 188 are included under Category  A, which is composed of ongoing and new foreign-assisted  projects such as capital activities in basic education, water  supply, health, nutrition, family planning, and, housing; 128  fall under Category B, which is composed of energy-related  projects; and, 37 projects fall under Category C, which are  locally funded.    Based on the CPIP concept, the agencies concerned are tasked  to immediately prepare their work and financial plans for the  projects, which will be the basis for the budget releases to be  made by the Department of Budget and Management [DBM].    "One unwritten rule which was adopted by the DBM is the 30  percent-30 percent-20 percent-20 percent quarterly budget  release pattern for the CPIP projects," a NEDA official said.  "Effectively, the projects will receive 60 percent of their  share in the first half of the year."    A performance contract will be drawn up between the agencies  and President Ramos for closer monitoring of these projects.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Office of Management and Budget plans to forecast today that Congress is on  target to satisfy the $110-billion Gramm-Rudman law deficit target for the  coming fiscal year, congressional sources said. The officials, who asked to not  be identified, said that by the government's updated calculations, the deficit  for the 1990 fiscal year -- which begins Oct. 1 -- would be about $99.5  billion. Even if $5.7 billion in income from planned sales of federal assets is  not included -- and it cannot be counted under Gramm-Rudman procedures -- the  deficit would be $105.2 billion, still well within the law's limit. Because of  disagreements between the Administration and Congress, few people expect the  assets to be sold. If the government projects that the $110-billion shortfall  target will be surpassed, Gramm-Rudman automatically triggers spending cuts.  </P></p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Collapse puts chartists back in limelight - London The equity chartists are back in the limelight as the community of stock market analysts struggles to find its footing again after last week's collapse swept away many of the signposts. The fall of the Footsie to 3,150 was significant; the threat of 3,015 was very worrying. Are we heading for 2,910, and how seriously should we take the chartists' warnings that the next serious support levels are around 2,850 or 2,550? The downside argument, marshalled by Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research - who has long seen the market at 2,800 - is that the failure of last week's bund auction pinpoints the probability that yields have further to rise, in the UK as well as in continental Europe. He says that rising interest rates are sinking investors' perceptions of equity valuation - 'therefore, the market is not getting any cheaper'. On the other hand, at Footsie 2,850, the equity yield would be around 150 basis points above expected inflation, and the yield ratio at levels last seen before the economic recovery began. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, for one, finds this 'an unlikely scenario'. A more likely outcome, he believes, is a rising yield relative as economic growth continues, and a more stable valuation of UK equities. None of this gave the market any protection as the stock index future contract on the Footsie plunged below 3,000. This happened several times last week - three times in one session, in fact - before the line was finally abandoned in a hurry on Friday afternoon. Given the importance of the future contract as a mechanism for portfolio rebalancing, the headlong retreat from the Footsie 3,000 mark is distinctly worrying. The sudden upset in equities underlines the wisdom of fund managers chasing the utility stocks over the past fortnight. Water stocks have outperformed by about 5.5 per cent. BZW believes the yield attraction will continue to score with investors as long as the overall equity background remains so difficult, although possible regulatory questions will resurface when the market concerns are resolved. Consumer stocks continue to lose supporters, as price competition and sluggish personal spending undermine optimism. The market reception for Marks and Spencer's trading statement was cool. The engineering vehicle sector was identified early as an area primed to benefit from economic recovery, but has underperformed by around 4 per cent recently. Smith New Court comments that the European car market, after a promising opening to the reporting season, is now showing little sign of overall recovery. Lucas Industries, with a large exposure to the continental European car industry, may prove to be late in the recovery cycle, thinks Smith, although its grip on around one third of both Europe's foundation brake and diesel car systems markets augur well for 1995 and 1996.</p>

Since 5 April when Ricupero was installed,  there have been two crises -- and they have not been resolved  yet -- between the members of the first team of advisers and  secretaries, on whom the new minister counts for waging the war  against inflation.    No solution has been found to the public confrontation  between Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho and  Federal Revenue Secretary Osires Lopes Filho. The latter wants  the approval of a project to restructure the Revenue  Secretariat, which Clovis Carvalho has opposed. Lopes has  threatened to resign if the minister does not support at least  some of the proposed measures. Carvalho is not calm either. The  only member of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's team who was unknown  to Ricupero, Carvalho will remain in his post but will lose  coordination power to diplomat Sergio Amaral, the cabinet chief  and adviser to the minister.    Another problem for Ricupero is special adviser Edmar  Bacha's  unwillingness to remain in the government. The information on  Bacha's resignation reached the minister's cabinet in the middle  of the difficulties caused by the congressional debate on the  provisional measure for implementation of the economic plan.  Bacha's resignation might have been caused by his willingness to  resume academic commitments in Rio de Janeiro, where he is a  UFRJ [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro] professor.    Difficulties -- The conflict between Osires and Carvalho  also  seems far from being settled. Ricupero has known Lopes since the  beginning of the 1980's as his fellow professor at Brasilia  University. As for Carvalho, the minister only has some good  references of him, which he received from some common friends.  It is believed that if the minister does not approve at least  the creation of three coordinating boards for improving the tax  control system -- as is provided for in the new Internal Revenue  Department regulations -- Osires Lopes will actually resign.    Some government members consider that the minister's style  in  dealing with this type of problem consists of encouraging  internal problems in the hope that they will reach a natural,  spontaneous solution. For Ricupero's direct advisers, however,  things are not quite like that. They explain that he is a deeply  thoughtful man who, rather than taking a hasty step, prefers to  delay a decision. In order to avoid losing Bacha, they said,  Ricupero might name him to the new Central Bank executive board,  which will take care of circulation of the real, independently  of the fact that the minister will guarantee immunity against  political pressure to spend more than what is permitted by the  government's fiscal situation.    The economic team now is mostly concerned about the  possibility of a new fiscal crisis after approval of the Social  Emergency Fund and on the eve of the new currency's circulation.  During the first quarter, the Treasury registered a deficit of  $250 million, despite the fact that the Revenue Department's  monthly income has surpassed last year's average value by $1  billion. The increase in interest rates since December, which  aimed at fighting price speculation, forced the Treasury to  disburse $1.1 billion, compared with $540 million spent in the  same period in 1993.    Relations -- With such high interest rates, the economic  team  fears a reaction by President Itamar Franco, who might again  talk about the economy at any time. Without the shield of  Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who kept Franco's explosive  personality under control, Central Bank technicians are  preparing for just about any presidential offensive. The finance  minister, despite his "good chemistry with Franco," as an  adviser put it, addresses the president with the reverence due a  superior, which is the typical attitude of a career diplomat.</p>

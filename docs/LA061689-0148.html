			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: WOMEN AS SUITORS: REVERSE ROLE IS AN IDEA AFTER ONE'S OWN HEART,  RESPONDENTS SAY  </P> <P> Last week, Single Life offered an assortment of opinions on Dutch-treat dating.  The second part of this equal-rights issue is: Should women feel at liberty to  ask men out?  </P> <P> This time around, the answers were much more uniform -- "yes," "sure,"  "certainly," and "why not?"  </P> <P> Tammy Carter Guiso most assuredly approves of females taking the initiative in  requesting a date. And she didn't stop there; Guiso even proposed marriage to  her object of pursuit.  </P> <P> Her assertiveness worked. On June 3, she and Brad Guiso were married.  </P> <P> "I encourage women to act on those impulses. Who knows what the result will  be?" Guiso wrote in a letter to Single Life.  </P> <P> "I always used to ask guys out; I think it's fine," Guiso said in an interview.  "Guys have told me they feel flattered when women ask them out."  </P> <P> In her husband's case, Guiso, 23, telephoned Brad one night and invited him  over to help her study. That was the beginning.  </P> <P> Then about a year later, she popped the question. "We'd sort of talked about  getting married, but nothing had been said formally. I just decided it was  time," recalled the Irvine resident, who is the assistant director of marketing  for the American Cancer Society.  </P> <P> Her fiance-to-be reacted with shock -- "and he doesn't get shocked easily," she  said.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?' " he said. "But I thought  it was great. I graciously accepted."  </P> <P> Untimid Tammy rolled right ahead in her disregard for tradition. "We went over  to my parents' house and Tammy asked my folks if she could marry me," said  Brad, 28, an accountant with a real estate company.  </P> <P> "I liked it when women asked me out," he added. "It was a relief knowing I get  to decide this time whether I want to go out rather than being on the other  side where you're wondering: 'Is this person going to say yes or no?' Women  should do it more often, so that they understand the position from the flip  side."  </P> <P> "I think it's nice when women do the asking," said Kirk Morgan, 29, a sales  manager in Laguna Beach. "People are too busy to wait for the old-fashioned  boy-ask-girl thing; they have to take the opportunity when they can.  </P> <P> "I know I'm too busy -- I go on business trips for two weeks at a time, and  when I get back I feel like I've lost touch with everyone. So I like it when a  woman calls me."  </P> <P> If the woman strikes up the date, Morgan tentatively figured, she should fund  it: "I'm such a traditionalist when it comes to paying. But I suppose that with  the luxury of asking goes the burden of debt" -- and, also, the burden of a  possible "thanks, but no thanks."  </P> <P> "I'd decline if it wasn't the right person," Morgan said. "Women turn down men  all the time. It's a two-way street."  </P> <P> "I have zero problem with women asking me out," said the unequivocal Joseph  Poirier, 60, a real estate broker in Garden Grove. "It happens to me once or  twice a month. If I'm not interested, I usually deflect the rejection by saying  that I'm in an established relationship."  </P> <P> Michelle Molinari, 20, wrote that she has asked out two men in her short life.  One date proved disastrous, the other a huge success.  </P> <P> "My girlfriends thought it was utterly shameless for me to ask a guy to my  senior prom," Molinari said in her letter. "I may have ended up footing the  bill while my friends got a freebie, but you get back what you put in.  </P> <P> "Although the failure rate seems as high as 50%, I wouldn't hesitate to ask a  man out again."  </P> <P> The other 50% of that statistic, Molinari said in an interview, occurred when  she was 16.  </P> <P> "I called a boy in my French class and asked him to a concert," remembered the  Anaheim resident, who works as a nanny. "It was very hard, mustering the  courage. I had written down a whole script of what I was going to say. I told  him I didn't have a car, but that if he was willing to drive I'd pay for the  tickets."  </P> <P> Mr. French Class, Molinari said, turned out to be a "real pistol." "He treated  me like a guy because I'm the one who asked him out. He said things like, 'You  don't expect me to open the car door for you, do you?' "  </P> <P> That lousy experience did not deter Molinari from trying again two years later.  </P> <P> Molinari's prom date was the last boy her Mormon parents and friends would have  picked for her. "He had a Mohawk (haircut); Mormon girls don't date guys who  look like that," she said, laughing. "My parents probably thought it was  another one of Michelle's pranks. I mean, your prom picture is something you  show to your grandchildren."  </P> <P> But Molinari detected a heart of gold below that unorthodox hairdo. And by  evening's end, so did her friends. "They couldn't believe the attention he paid  to me; he'd put his arm around me and pull out my chair for me. All my friends  had these jock dates who were totally into themselves."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2ND HINDU EFFORT TO STORM MOSQUE FAILS;  </P> <P> INDIA: AT LEAST 31 MORE DIE IN VIOLENCE SPARKED BY DISPUTE. CRISIS IN  BELEAGUERED GOVERNMENT COALITION DEEPENS.  </P> <P> Thousands of Hindu fundamentalists failed in a new attempt today to storm an  ancient shrine claimed by Muslims, and at least 31 more people died in violence  sparked by the dispute.  </P> <P> A government minister resigned to protest Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap  Singh's attempts to block construction of a Hindu temple on the disputed site,  deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition.  </P> <P> Armed paramilitary troops blocked about 5,000 Hindus from attempting to  re-enter the mosque in Ayodhya, which has been the center of a decades-old  dispute between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority.  </P> <P> Hindu fundamentalists broke through police cordons Tuesday and chipped away  bricks and bits of plaster from the one-story mosque, which they want to  replace with a temple.  </P> <P> At least five Hindus were killed and 20 injured when police opened fire to  throw back the rioters. One of the injured died of his wounds today.  </P> <P> Press Trust of India said at least 30 other people were killed in street  battles between Hindus and Muslims in four widely separated cities.  </P> <P> At least 170 people have been killed in the last eight days, and Singh's  11-month-old government has been pushed to the verge of collapse. The Hindu  fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support from the governing  coalition last month to protest government policy on the temple project.  </P> <P> The desertion left Singh without a majority in Parliament, but he has said he  will win a vote of confidence scheduled for Nov. 7.  </P> <P> Singh's attempts to ride out the religious and political crisis received  another setback today when the deputy minister for sports, Bhakta Charan Das,  resigned to protest the police action at Ayodhya.  </P> <P> Das, a Hindu, accused Singh in his resignation letter of "lack of  foresightedness" in tackling the crisis.  </P> <P> The dispute also triggered violence in neighboring Bangladesh, an Islamic  nation, where Muslim mobs attacked temples and Hindu shops and homes after  hearing of the situation in Ayodhya. Authorities clamped curfews on the capital  Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong to curb rioting.  </P> <P> In Ayodhya, volunteers of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council said they  would make another attempt to storm the mosque Thursday.  </P></p>

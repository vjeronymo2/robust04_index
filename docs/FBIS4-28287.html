			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, chairman  of the Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions  of Literature and Art of Korea, in a statement on June 7  expressed the hope that the federation and organisations of  literature and art of South Korea would have a contact in  Pyongyang or Seoul or Panmunjom at an early date on the occasion  of August 15.    Noting that the convocation of a national conference is a  timely and reasonable measure to remove the danger of a war  created in Korea and open up a new phase of reunification in the  90s with concerted efforts of the nation, he said:    "However desperately the South Korean authorities may block  the convocation of a national conference, they cannot break the  will of the 70 million fellow countrymen to hold the conference.    "When delegates of organisations of literature and art in  the  North and the South sit at one place, a common action guideline  of the national conference will be shaped and things favorable  to peace of the country and its peaceful reunification will be  done.    "I express the hope that the men and organisations of  literature and art of South Korea that value justice and  conscience will actively respond to our patriotic proposal."</p>

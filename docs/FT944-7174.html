			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Strong demand lifts Hydro-Quebec net Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities, posted nine-month net profits of CDollars 405m (USDollars 295m), up 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, with stronger domestic demand and a rate increase from May, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Revenue from power sales was CDollars 5.4bn, up 4.7 per cent. Expenses rose 2.9 per cent mainly because of high depreciation, amortisation and taxes. Interest expense rose 8.6 per cent due to the lower Canadian dollar and heavy equipment commissionings. Capital spending will be CDollars 3.4bn for all 1994, against an earlier estimate of CDollars 3.9bn. In the first nine months new borrowing totalled CDollars 2.9bn, completing the 1994 financing programme.</p>

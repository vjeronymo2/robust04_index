			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Ex-king sails in to test Greek waters DEPOSED King Constantine of the Hellenes says he is just having a holiday in Greece, for the first time since the monarchy was abolished in a referendum in 1974, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. But his cruise aboard a Greek shipowner's yacht, together with his wife, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, and five children, is stirring controversy by resembling a royal progress more than a family excursion. The left-wing opposition expressed outrage that the government allowed the former king to come home. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist leader, demanded his immediate expulsion. One newspaper editorial wondered why his two eldest sons, both in their 20s, were not arrested on arrival and taken off to start military service, still compulsory in Greece. A judge in Thessaloniki last week ordered an investigation to determine whether the ex-king had committed any treasonable acts while on Greek soil, such as inciting citizens to riot. Even the government panicked when the ex-royal family disembarked in northern Greece and set off to visit soldiers manning a border post on the frontier with Macedonia. Their jeep had to turn back after finding the road blocked by embarrassed local police officers. The minority of Greeks who admit to being monarchists have no trouble keeping up with the ex-king's activities. His trip is being exhaustively covered by a private Greek TV channel, owned by another shipowner.</p>

In mid-December  1993, public security personnel in the cities of Guiyang, Zunyi,  and Liupanshui of Guizhou province "staged work strikes" or  "slowed down work." Over 200 public security policemen of  Guiyang's public security bureau asked for leave collectively,  and Zunyi's public security bureau had to stop work for one week  due to a manpower shortage, while personnel of the Liupanshui's  public security bureau went to present a petition to the  provincial public security department, protesting against "fund  shortages" and the "exclusion of bonuses." The fact that public  security policemen take a passive attitude toward work has  called for a series of countermeasures. Guizhou could not but  send troops in the place of policemen for patrol purposes. The  Ministry of Public Security sent an investigation group to  Guizhou on 24 December.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Declining milk production lifts powder and cheese prices DECLINING WORLD milk production has pushed up prices of milk powder and cheese over the past two years, but butter prices remain depressed by falling consumption and the high level of stocks, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In its annual report on world dairy markets, published today, Gatt says world milk production fell 2.1 per cent in 1991 and is expected to fall another 1-2 per cent in 1992. This reflects efforts by the European Community and other western European countries to contain milk deliveries and the 'virtual collapse' of the commercial market in Russia and eastern and central Europe. The result has been a firming of milk powder prices from mid-1991 and a rapid reduction in stocks of skimmed milk powder this year. World cheese trade remains buoyant, fuelled by a steady increase in demand. World market prices rose by an annual 13-16 per cent in 1991 and 1992, Gatt estimates. However, world butter production shrank by 4.2 per cent in 1991 and is expected to drop by a further 2.5 per cent in 1992. Despite this, prices remain depressed at, or only slightly above, agreed minimum prices in 1991 and 1992. Consumption continues to slow, partly because of the trend to lower-fat diets in the West, and stocks remain relatively high. Gatt points out that commercial sales of butter in international markets have been very limited in the past couple of years, mainly because the former Soviet Union, the world's biggest butter importer, can no longer afford to buy at market prices. Russia also took less than 60 per cent of authorised sales of cheap butter in 1991 and in 1992 bought only a small quantity of butter, almost all of it under a US credit guarantee programme. Commenting on dairy policies, Gatt says there is now 'an almost universal trend towards increased liberalisation and less governmental interference', which has seen a reduction of subsidies and price supports to curb costly surpluses. In many industrialised countries the numbers of dairy farms and cows are declining, though this is being partially offset by rising production in the third world. India is now the third largest producer, after the EC and the US, and China could well become the world's second largest developing country producer by the beginning of the next century.

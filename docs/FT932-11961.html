			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / People: O&amp;Y's Spiers moves to RBS The stream of finance directors being appointed to banks from outside took a twist yesterday with the announcement by Royal Bank of Scotland that it has found a new finance chief from a most unlikely source. Despite the trouble Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development has caused banks over the past couple of years, Royal Bank has recruited its finance director. Robert Speirs of Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf is moving to Royal Bank from July on the retirement of the bank's current finance director Kenneth Thompson. Speirs (right)acknowledged the irony yesterday, but insisted that he had learned some 'salutary lessons' from the property sector. Both Speirs and Thompson believe the job of a bank finance director has become more complex. They have to have a deep understanding of balance sheets and treasury operations these days, according to Thompson, who joined RBS in 1988 from Glaxo. 'I am not exactly sure what bank finance directors used to do,' he says. In recent years banks seeking finance directors have increasingly looked outside for candidates with knowledge of capital markets and an understanding of risk management. Richard Goeltz, who was appointed chief financial officer of National Westminster last year, came from Seagram. Speirs, who is 56, has Scottish connections from his time at Britoil, where he was finance director before the company was taken over by British Petroleum. He originally trained as a tax specialist with the Inland Revenue before switching into finance and moved to O&amp;Y Canary Wharf in 1988. 'I think a bank finance director used to be the person who kept the books. Now they are moving more towards the corporate way of doing things,' says Speirs.</p>

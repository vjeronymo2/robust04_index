			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, April 3 (AFP) -- Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] Sunday [3 April] accused  Albania of trying to manipulate the independence-minded ethnic  Albanian minority in this former Yugoslav republic.    The ethnic Albanians are seeking a degree of autonomy  bordering on independence for a third of Macedonia's territory,  mainly in areas where they form a majority of the population,  such as on the frontier with Albania itself.    The Macedonian Government says the Albanians comprise 20  percent of the population of 2.3 million people. The ethnic  Albanians put it at 50 percent.    The main Albanian political party in Macedonia, the  Democratic Prosperity Party, which is part of the coalition  government in power in Skopje, split into two factions in  February.    That rupture "was caused by direct interference from  Tirana,"  Macedonian Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski said in an  interview with AFP.    A party congress at which the split occurred was attended by  lawmakers and diplomats from Albania proper.    The traditional leadership of the party was accused by  Albania of damaging the cause of the Albanian minority in  Macedonia. The leader of the new faction, 28-year-old Menduh  Taqi, has received a hero's welcome in Albania.    But while he had tough words for Albania, Frckovski  suggested  that 30 ethnic Albanians due to go on trial for allegedly  running guns to Albanian militia here would not have the book  thrown at them.    Although the defendants could be sentenced to between two  and  10 years, the minister said, "Harsh sentences should not be  expected."</p>

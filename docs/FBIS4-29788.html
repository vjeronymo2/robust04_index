			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Tuesday he plans to visit the United States this  weekend for bilateral trade "framework" talks with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor.    Kakizawa said he revealed his plan for the U.S. visit to  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in a meeting after the regular  cabinet session and Hata approved it.    But his U.S. visit depends on what happens in the Diet,  Kakizawa told reporters.    Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an  agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade  framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)  industrialized nations in July.    Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to meet  in  Naples.    Kakizawa is tentatively scheduled to leave for the U.S. on  Friday [24 June] evening and return to Tokyo on Monday.    The two sides are considering a West Coast city such as Los  Angeles or San Francisco as the venue of the Kakizawa-Kantor  meeting, government sources said.    Kantor has strongly requested a meeting with Kakizawa, the  sources said.    Japan and the U.S. have also considered a meeting between  Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but  gave up on that as it was too difficult to arrange, they said.</p>

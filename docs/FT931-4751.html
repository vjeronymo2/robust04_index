			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / S Africa plan focuses on equality: Philip Gawith and Patti Waldmeir report on a radical economic programme THE South African government yesterday launched its most radical economic restructuring programme since it took power in 1948. The programme, which reflects a new emphasis on equality, would touch almost every aspect of economic life. It aims to increase the amount of investment in relation to gross domestic product to improve productivity and to re-establish the stable financial environment without which investors cannot prosper. It is a classic supply-side restructuring programme - but with a human face, designed to make it palatable to opposition political forces whose approval must be gained if it is to succeed. Initial union reaction was positive, with a leading union economist describing the plan as a useful starting point rather than rejecting it out of hand. The changes required to effect it are enormous. They include: Reducing government current expenditure to 20.1 per cent of GDP in 1997 from 26.8 per cent in 1992; Lowering the company tax rate to 40 per cent from 48 per cent, and the individual's marginal rate to 40 per cent from 43 per cent, by 1997; Reducing tariff barriers on imports to 18 per cent (possibly 14 per cent) in 1997 from 27 per cent at present; Keeping real wage increases to 0.75 per cent per annum; Taking a tougher line on anti-competitive behaviour, price-fixing and collusion; Balancing the budget by 1997. (Last year's deficit represented 9 per cent of GDP); Phasing out exchange control; Success will depend on wage restraint from the unions and an inflow of foreign capital equivalent to 2.8 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s, tailing off later (largely from international finance institutions). It will also depend on a strong government's ability to push through unpalatable reforms - at a time when Pretoria is about to hand over to a power-sharing government which could prove weak and fractious. The programme is published against a background of widespread acceptance of the pressing need for fundamental economic restructuring. 'South Africa cannot afford another decade of poor economic growth, since this will only lead to greater unemployment, poverty, violence and social instability,' comments Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance and the driving force behind the document, in the foreword. At the heart of the programme is the simple assumption that levels of investment, and productivity of that investment, must be raised if South Africa is to meet its daunting development challenge. Fiscal and monetary discipline the improved functioning of product and labour markets and liberalised trade and financial markets are among the programme's goals. The focus is on providing long-term solutions to structural problems, rather than short term palliatives. The approach will be gradual as the government believes the economy, and the society are too sick to survive a 'big bang' approach. Government officials acknowledge they have long paid lip service to economic reform. And while some progress has been made - for example in monetary policy and agriculture - it took the deepening economic crisis and the appointment last May of Mr Keys, to produce a comprehensive programme. While the programme is focused on the supply side, it makes clear that growth is not seen as being more important than equality. The document notes 'the new political understanding of the nature of the South African economy . . . accepts that the process of economic growth must be seen as but a central feature of the broader process of economic development of the country and its people.' In the past they have always insisted that growth alone was enough to cope with poverty. 'What is envisaged is a process of structural adjustment in the developed market economy and a reconstruction of its less-developed socio-economic framework, in particular the equitable access of all South Africans to all opportunities in the economy.' During the difficult political transition to democracy, the government would provide a package of measures including labour intensive public work schemes, unemployment insurance and special training programmes. Mr Keys has been careful to stress that the restructuring proposals are not prescriptive, but are meant to provide a platform for debate. But his officials make clear that reform will begin with next week's budget. 'It may have more teeth than people would like to see' says Mr Jacobs. The document highlights constraints on growth: in the short term, a large fiscal deficit could crowd out a private investment revival, and balance of payments problems will constrain growth if large net capital outflows cannot be stemmed. The longer term constraint is the legacy of apartheid - defects in the socio-economic system, such as large distances between industrial centres and labour force accommodation, and lack of education and skills which would 'prevent the full participation in the growth process by the country's large developing community.'</p>

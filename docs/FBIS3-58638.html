Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], said in Bonn on 17 January  that the determination with which the SPD has concentrated on  the great economic and social issues is decisive for the party's  "successful course." This includes an economic policy forum on  the modernization of Germany's economic base, at which the SPD  will discuss its government program with entrepreneurs later  this month.    Prior to the Federal Government's 17 January meeting on  additional spending cuts of DM7.5 billion, Scharping doubted  that the planned new borrowing could be limited to DM70 billion.  Scharping said Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel's  (Christian Social Union -- CSU) budget "borders on a  falsification of the balance sheet."    There were differences of opinion on the budget policy  within  the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. According to party chairman  Klaus Kinkel, the government will not survive 1994 without a  supplementary budget. This was rejected by Federal Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) as "adventurous speculation." At  the ministers' meeting, Kinkel rejected additional spending cuts  in the defense and educational sectors. He said the Bundeswehr  was not the nation's reserve cash box. Following talks with  scientific organizations, Kinkel stressed the importance of  biotechnology for Germany as an investment center. The  Christian Democratic Union presented its economic program on 17  January. It is supposed to show ways out of the economic crisis  over the medium term and was approved by the party's leading  bodies at a closed meeting in Windhagen near Bonn last weekend  [15-16 January].</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Newmont shares prompt new gold rush - The Denver-based group's glittering attraction for investors Mr Gordon Parker, long-time chairman of Denver-based gold producer Newmont Mining, is remarkably composed for a man who has just received a large and largely faceless group of new bosses. 'I've been institutionalised,' he jokes, referring to the portfolio and money managers who have bought nearly 30 per cent of Newmont's shares in the last six months. Many of these investors rushed in following Mr George Soros' widely publicised purchase of a 14 per cent stake in Newmont on April 24. A spokesman for Mr Soros, who has some Dollars 7bn under global management, says the investment is passive and Mr Soros will not seek a seat on the board. Since the Soros trade gold prices have hit their highest level since 1991 and Newmont stock is at the top of its 52-week range. Newmont's business is, literally, pure gold. Through its 90.1 per cent ownership of Newmont Gold it is the largest gold producer in North America. And the glitter of Newmont Gold's 19.5m ounces of gold reserves, most of them in the rich Carlin Trend area of Nevada, has proved irresistible to a generation of billionaire financiers. Mr Parker, a South African mining executive who joined Newmont in 1981, has repelled Mr T. Boone Pickens, the US corporate raider who wanted to grab Newmont's gold mines in exchange for junk bonds in 1987. That forced Mr Parker into the arms of Consolidated Gold Fields to recover some of the Dollars 1.9bn debt incurred in the Pickens battle, and he later ended up with Lord Hanson as boss when Gold Fields was taken over by the Hanson conglomerate in 1989. Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French industrialist, who is perhaps the world's most prominent gold bull, became Newmont's main shareholder in 1990. Sir James came on board when Lord Hanson swapped Gold Field's 49 per cent stake in Newmont for about Dollars 1.6bn in US Pacific north-west forestry operations owned by Sir James and his partner Lord Rothschild. His purchase coincided with a long-term sag in gold prices. Even the biggest gold bugs grew tired of waiting for inflation and global calamity to bolster prices. Enormous central bank gold sales, 600 tonnes net last year, stifled potential for a rally driven by the growing gap between gold demand and new production. As gold prices headed for seven-year lows, Sir James and Lord Rothschild - through General Oriental Investments and RIT Capital Partners, their respective investment vehicles - began to wriggle out of their Newmont shares. Newmont is a very efficiently run gold company, but investors buy gold company shares for exposure to the gold market, and the metal's performance has been dismal for the past decade. The long-term slide in gold prices has been much more bothersome to Newmont than the continual change of big shareholders. As prices fall, all of the definitions of a gold mining company have to be re-examined. Reserves must be revalued and revenues slip, even if, as is the case with Newmont, production is rising. Newmont's income from continuing operations dropped to Dollars 90.6m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, in 1992, from Dollars 168.5m, or Dollars 2.49 a share, in 1990. The fall was largely due to the sagging gold price. Mr Parker, despite his reputation as a conservative executive, is wildly speculative when it comes to pricing, and rarely hedges his production. Exposed to the market, Newmont Gold's average sales price dropped from Dollars 403 per ounce in 1990 to Dollars 379 in 1992. Newmont Gold's production costs, at Dollars 210 per ounce, are among the lowest in the world, but margins have been squeezed. The company produced 1.59m ounces of gold in 1992, and plans 1.7m ounces of output this year. Newmont's 40 per cent income drop hampered Sir James' plans to reduce his holdings, which comprised an uncomfortably large portion of his portfolio. General Oriental Investments and the RIT group managed to sell 1.8m Newmont shares to an Australian investor in October who immediately sold them on through Salomon Brothers to about 50 institutional investors. The deal received little notice, and gold prices continued their slide. The machinations of the gold market are as opaque and malleable as the metal itself, and in a remarkable turnround, spot prices for an ounce of gold in New York rebounded from a January low of Dollars 328 to Dollars 347.50 on the April day that Mr Soros bought 10m Newmont shares from the Goldsmith group for Dollars 39.50 each. Sir James, for his part, fanned the rally by telling the Press he had used the Newmont proceeds to buy call options on gold. His options position demonstrated he wanted to remain invested in gold, and its execution sent the traders who granted the options into the market to buy gold to back the trades. The deal worked neatly for Newmont, and for Sir James, who still held some 30 per cent of the company and sits on its board. Three days after the widely-publicised Soros deal, Newmont unloaded its 14 per cent interest in an Australian gold producer, Newcrest, netting about Dollars 67m. As the present gold fever which he helped to start worked its way through world markets, Sir James sold another 10 per cent stake, or 6.5m Newmont shares, to a consortium of investment banks that quickly remarketed the block in a public offering at Dollars 45.50 per share. In another public relations coup, the May 11 offering coincided with the release of the widely-followed annual survey of the gold market by Gold Fields Minerals Services, which is partly owned by Newmont. The data showed gold demand far outstripping production last year and pointed to China as an important gold buyer. The excitement over gold may also help Newmont raise Dollars 115m to finance a 15-year gold-leaching venture in Uzbekistan. It expects the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to put up Dollars 90m of the project finance, but is also courting other investors to help finance the deal. Beyond the vagaries of the gold market, Newmont is well positioned for growth. It plans to spend Dollars 68m this year to find and develop gold reserves, more than half of this outside the US. Its core operation, Newmont Gold, is mining lower-grade ore as it goes deeper into the Carlin Trend. The company is buying a Dollars 230m roaster to process some of this ore and is developing other extraction technologies. Newmont Mining, meanwhile, is exploring properties in Nevada, near its existing operations, and in Oregon and Idaho. In August, production will begin at the company's 40 per cent joint venture in Peru, a low-cost, high-yield leaching operation. Together, Newmont's share of proven reserves in Oregon, Peru and Uzbekistan total 4.3m ounces. Two ventures in Indonesia and one in Thailand are also under development, with Newmont geologists prospecting in other areas in Asia, including Vietnam and China. See Lex, Page 24</p>

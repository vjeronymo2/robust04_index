			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Helen Grange, Chris Whitfield, and Norman </F> Chandler]    [Text] kwaZulu could face an intensified security crackdown  if last-gasp talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in  the electoral impasse. There are widespread fears that violence  in kwaZulu/Natal might soar if the special working group -- set  up to provide the summit sequel with fresh initiative -- fails.    Yesterday there was deep pessimism in both Government and  ANC  circles over prospects for a breakthrough. "Even if we manage  to reach agreement in the working group -- which is possible --  it appears that it will be blocked by the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] leadership," said a senior Government source. They  pointed out that encouraging progress in talks between the king  and Mandela on Friday [8 April] had been reversed after he  consulted the full IFP delegation.    With the failure of the four-way Skukuza summit, it is  understood that security action will be considerably intensified  if tensions in the province continue to lead to bloodshed.  KwaZulu politicians acknowledge that the next four days will be  crucial to the territory and the Zulu monarchy. They fear that  if their demands are not met, the low-key civil war now raging  in the region could escalate out of control.    The situation in the territory was generally quiet  yesterday.  South African troops had not been mobilised by nightfall at  their temporary base at the Eshowe showgrounds. It is  understood that mobilisation could begin by Thursday, depending  on the success of the task force discussions. Yesterday Ulundi  was abnormally quiet, according to local residents. The local  hotel had only three guests, and normal Saturday trade at the  bar and restaurant was non- existent.    With hopes of an ANC-IFP constitutional resolution all but  shattered by Friday's inconclusive summit, attention is also  focusing on getting as many kwaZulu/Natal voters as possible to  the polls.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer, speaking in  Cradock yesterday, said it was estimated about 60 percent of  Natal's inhabitants would be able to participate freely in the  election. But IFP supporters, especially north of the Tugela,  were actively intimidating people not to take part in the  election, he said. Meyer warned that if the election was  postponed, the future of the country would be determined by  radical elements of the Left and Right, and that a Bosnian-style  situation would develop. None of the arguments that were now  being brought up by the IFP were new and there were no solutions  for them, he added.    The IFP warned at its central committee meeting on Saturday  that kwaZulu citizens would resist the state of emergency, and  demanded its immediate lifting. In resolutions addressing the  reasons for rejecting the ANC's "offer" at Friday's summit, the  IFP central committee said it had displayed a "great deal of  ignorance" and some aspects were "even colonial in character".  The committee said the offer was a political promise with no  legal effect on the Interim Constitution, and amounted to an  offer to the king "as a person" and not as the head of the Zulu  nation. It gave him ceremonial functions but provided no space  for the autonomy and self- determination of the Zulu nation.    Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi told THE STAR: "We are very  depressed. In my whole lifetime I have never seen such anger by  our people." He added that the state of emergency was not a  recipe for peace.</p>

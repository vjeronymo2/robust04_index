			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian cocoa output revised up MALAYSIA'S COCOA Board has raised its 1992 cocoa output estimate to 200,000 tonnes from 184,000, but some traders said the actual figure could be much higher, reports Reuter from Tawau. Traders in the east Malaysian state of Sabah estimated 1992 cocoa supply, including carry-over stocks, could reach 235,000 tonnes, compared with 230,000 in 1991 and 247,000 in 1990. 'Good rains in the later part of the year and big year-end crop made up the production figures,' said a senior trader. Other traders in the Tawau, Sabah's main cocoa-producing region, said some estates saw a 30 to 40 per cent rise in the present main October-December season. Malaysia's cocoa area is estimated to have fallen to 388,700 hectares (960,000 acres) from 400,300 ha in 1991 and a peak of 420,300 ha in 1990 as growers, hit by depressed prices, have turned to other crops.</p>

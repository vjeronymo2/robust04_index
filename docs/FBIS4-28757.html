			<p>BFN     [Text] The country's balance of payments (BoP) position  dipped by 4.64 percent to a $616 million surplus during the  first quarter compared with the year ago level of $646 million,  according to the latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures  released yesterday.    Foreign investments inflow primarily accounted for the  surplus, posting a 203.18 percent increase to $1.619 billion  from the year ago level of $534 million.    Of the total, $502 million was traced to the remittance in  March of Arab American Oil Co. (Aramco) to the national  government as payment for a 40 percent stake at Petron Corp.  The Aramco proceeds accounted for 46 percent of the P1.085  billion improvement in the foreign investments inflow.    The rate of outflows continued to outpace inflows during the  quarter, climbing 285.25 percent to $1.071 billion from the year  ago level of $278 million.    The Bangko Sentral data showed that unrecorded outflows,  lodged under the "errors and omissions account," went down by  10.28 percent to $192 million from the year ago level of $214  million.    A source said the drop in the withdrawals of nonresidents  may  be due to the substantial influx of investments in government  securities and bonds, which is usually associated with the hike  in domestic interest rates.    Inflow of medium and long-term loans declined by 23 percent  to $914 million from the year ago level of $1.187 billion. This  may reflect the cautious stance taken by multilateral and  bilateral institutions as the country negotiated for a  three-year program with the International Monetary Fund. The  IMF Executive Board is scheduled to take up the Philippine  request for a $650 million facility before the end of the month.    Net short-term capital, including foreign borrowings with  maturities of less than one year, registered a whopping 114.29  percent increase as $45 million were repaid during the period.    The balance sheet was exacerbated by the trade deficit,  which  widened by 29.82 percent in the first quarter compared to the  year ago level. Merchandise trade deficit totalled $1.663  billion as import payments outpaced export receipts, posting a  21.91 percent uptick to $4.579 billion. Export receipts, on the  other hand, amounted to $2.916 billion, registered a 17.82  percent hike from the year ago level of $2.475 billion.    The source pointed out the growth in import receipts could  have been fuelled by speculations that the peso exchange value  would continue to strengthen against the dollar.    Although remittances from overseas workers increased to  $2.209 billion during the period, this failed to offset the  24.69 percent growth in nonmerchandise trade payments totalling  $1.389 billion.    The country's current account position showed a $676 million  deficit. Receipts from invisibles, which include freight and  merchandise insurance, travel and investment income, grew by  8.38 percent to $194 million from the previous year's $179  million.    Corresponding payments stood at $27 million, a surge of  1,250  percent from the year ago level of $2 million.    Other BoP accounts registered the following advances:    -- monetization of gold, $38 million or a 137.5 percent hike  from the previous year's $16 million; and,    -- revaluation adjustments, $1 million, or a 97.14 percent  decline from the year ago level of $35 million.</p>

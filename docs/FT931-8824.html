			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Former minister backs pay body MR PETER Bottomley, a former Tory employment minister, last night came out against the abolition of Wages Councils and challenged the government to explain why it did not 'make plain' before the last election that such a move was in the offing, David Owen writes. His remarks came as the Trade Union Reform &amp; Employment Rights Bill, abolishing the councils that set minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid workers, moved through its report stage in the Commons. Mr Bottomley also opposed a government move to phase out the public subsidy for trade union ballots. To Labour protests, Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, described the continued subsidy as 'inappropriate'.</p>

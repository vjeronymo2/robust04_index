			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Brussels Is Taking the Cane"] </F>   [Text] "What is in a name?" Juliet asked her Romeo, and  immediately advised him to give up his in order to end the  conflict between the two families. Greece has demanded the same  thing from its small neighbor Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] for over two years -- and with  increasing brutality. The name of the country alone is a  program, Athens laments, because this means that Skopje is  claiming the part of Macedonia that was allocated to the Greeks  after the 1912-1913 Balkans war. The Constitution and flag are  also brimming with revisionism.    The European Union [EU] yesterday waved the cane at the  refractory Greeks. In response to the trade blockade that  Athens imposed on Skopje on 16 February, the EU Commission  dragged Greece before the European judge. The EU wants the  European Court to issue a provisional injunction against Athens:  The blockade is to be lifted immediately. A formal complaint  will follow.    In European terms, the EU has acted at breathtaking speed,  with the blockade having been imposed less than two months ago.  This gives one the feeling that a lot of irritation has  accumulated in Brussels against welfare-recipient Greece. In  fact, Greece has been making life difficult for the EU for quite  some time now. It has systematically tried to counteract  Brussels' policy directed against Serbia; again and again Greece  is talked about for sanction-busting. The permanent conflict  with NATO ally Turkey goes back to the times before the European  Community was founded. The other 11 members are not very  pleased with the Greeks for reasons specific to the EU. Be it  in the Chancellor's Office in Bonn or in the corridors of  Brussels: The Greeks are accused of "blackmail" behavior.  Athens systematically delays EU decisions to derive financial  profit from Brussels.    Of course, Macedonia, once a republic at the edge of  Yugoslavia, is not entirely innocent. Like everywhere else,  there are nationalist phrase mongers there that Greece can use  as proof of Macedonia's territorial claims. But Skopje has  passed two amendments to its Constitution that reject desires  for territorial claims or interference. In addition, Macedonia  has offered Greece an agreement on the inviolability of its  borders -- which was brusquely rejected by Athens.    Meanwhile, Macedonia is sliding into economic ruin. Trade  with Serbia has been disrupted because of the sanctions, and the  Greek blockade has also cut off the southern border. The GNP  declined by 15 percent last year. Can the EU punitive action  against Greece produce any results? If Athens does not yield to  the provisional injunction, a new proceeding will have to be  initiated in Luxembourg to legitimize punitive action.  According to the Maastricht Treaty, the Court of Justice has  the right to impose financial sanctions on EU members, but the  provisional injunction will take weeks. Yet, perhaps Athens  will realize earlier that it is isolated within the EU.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Text] CHARASIAB, Afghanistan, April 3 (AFP) -- In opening  remarks during his first meeting with United Nations special  peace envoy Mahmud Al-Mestiri Sunday, Afghan Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar claimed he was not fighting for power.    "This war is not for power, it is for principles," said  Hekmatyar without elaborating.    Mestiri and his staff of seven UN personnel, including  Sotirios Mousouris, Coordinator for Afghan Humanitarian  Assistance, drove to Hekmatyar's Charasiab headquarters 25  kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Kabul to sound out the prime  minister's views.    The UN convoy, which included local and foreign journalists,  was blocked temporarily in Charasiab bazaar by banner-waving  civilians calling for peace and the resignation of Hekmatyar's  rival, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani.    "Rabbani's resignation is a must," read the English language  banners and placards, which could be taken as a clear statement  of Hekmatyar's first political objective.    The armed forces of Rabbani and Hekmatyar have been battling  each other most recently since January 1, when Hekmatyar joined  the ex-communist militias of warlord General Abdol Rashid Dostam  in a failed coup attempt to topple Rabbani.    "We ask for a government elected by the people and not by  means of tanks and artillery," Hekmatyar told Mestiri, who  doubtless observed the truck-mounted 122mm (5 inch) multi-barrel  rocket launchers and D-30 howitzers as he drove to Charasiab.    In south and west Kabul the sound of shelling could be heard  before noon Sunday, but in general the special ceasefire  declared for the duration of Mestiri's visit to Kabul was  respected.    Mestiri is expected to meet on Monday with Rabbani's  strongman, former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, and return  to Pakistan Tuesday by a special UN flight from Mas'ud's Bagram  airbase 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital.    Civilians in Kabul have suffered the brunt of the factional  fighting there, and are hopeful of positive results from  Mestiri's visit, but it would be unrealistic to expect the UN  envoy to conjure up a peace formula acceptable to all sides  without further sessions of lengthy negotiations.</p>

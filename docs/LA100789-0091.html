			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE SOVIET DEFENSE CHIEF MAY BE CIVILIAN, YAZOV SAYS  </P> <P> Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, assessing the pace of changes in the  Soviet military on the final day of a visit to the United States, speculated  Friday that Moscow may break with a centuries-old tradition and pick a civilian  as its next defense chief.  </P> <P> "I don't believe a minister of defense must have the proficiency and the  stamina to drop from a plane with a parachute," said the beribboned Yazov, a  general in the Soviet Army. "A minister of defense is more of a political  analyst and a politician."  </P> <P> The Soviet officer's comments drew a smile from his host, U.S. Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney, a former congressman from Wyoming.  </P> <P> Yazov said the newly elected Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme  Soviet, the sitting legislature, may consider changing the policy that dictates  that the defense minister must be a military man, a tradition he said dates  "from the years of the old Russia, the Russia of Kiev."  </P> <P> The first Soviet defense minister to visit the United States, Yazov wound up  his six-day tour by inviting Cheney to the Soviet Union, an offer Cheney  accepted. Defense officials said that visit is likely to take place next year.  </P> <P> Yazov's comments revealed a Soviet military struggling under President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or restructuring, which he stressed "was  not contrived to bring about the renewal of the military" in the first place.  </P> <P> "Perestroika was intended to bring about a renewal of the relations in the  Soviet society as a whole," said Yazov. "Naturally, to a certain extent the  renewal processes have touched upon the ways of the military and our armed  forces."  </P> <P> The 65-year-old general said that in one recent instance, a military cadet  challenged a general officer in an election to the Congress of Peoples'  Deputies -- and won. In another, he recounted, lieutenant colonels voted  against a proposal of the minister of defense in the Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> "So these are the rights being enjoyed by all the citizens of our society. So  to a certain extent, the perestroika processes have already been practiced in  the armed forces of the U.S.S.R.," Yazov said.  </P> <P> Yazov was the first candidate for his position to face the scrutiny -- and  scathing criticism -- of Soviet legislators before he was narrowly approved  last July.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Troops Praised  </P> <P> Yazov praised the U.S. troops he met and watched in a series of maneuvers at  bases across the country. "The power they showed struck us immensely," he said  of the Army's elite 82nd Airborne paratroopers, who conducted a jump for Yazov  at Ft. Bragg, N.C., Friday morning.  </P> <P> In a wide-ranging session with reporters, Yazov launched a peace offensive of  his own.  </P> <P> "Let me ask you a question," Yazov challenged one questioner through an  interpreter. "Are you serious about believing that the Soviet Union is  preparing to go to war with the United States?  </P> <P> "It is the atmosphere of trust that should be put in the foreground," he added.  </P> <P> But Yazov turned prickly when he was asked to assess the American B-2 stealth  bomber, an aircraft designed to breach Soviet airspace unobserved and deliver  nuclear weapons on sensitive Soviet targets.  </P> <P> "We do not consider it to be a challenge on the part of the United States in  regard to the Soviet Union. You keep perfecting your military hardware, we also  keep perfecting our military weapons systems," Yazov said.  </P> <P> "We don't have to modify the Soviet air defense system" in response to the  plane, which is now being tested by the Air Force, Yazov said. "The Soviet air  defenses have the capability today to bring down any air threat," he added.  </P> <P> Yazov replaced Sergei L. Sokolov last July after an embarrassing incident in  which a 19-year-old West German pilot flew into Soviet airspace unchallenged  and landed in Red Square.  </P></p>

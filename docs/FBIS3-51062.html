			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pedro Rioseco] </F>   [Text] Managua, 4 Jan (PL) -- Former President Daniel  Ortega today urged the Nicaraguan people to increase their  solidarity with Cuba this year and to actively contribute to  eliminating the illegal blockade imposed by the United States  against that island for more than 30 years.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried  out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers,  stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing  poverty in that Central American country.    Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with  more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the  effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios  government for the past three years, our people generously  showed their solidarity, Ortega said.    He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and  towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba,  professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and  relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in  the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and  people of that heroic Caribbean nation.    In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba  but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also  participated.    As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its  militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees  in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on  Cuba at all international forums.    Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan  Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official  support for transferring the collected food and has always  insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations  with Havana, despite pressures.    During the past three years, he stressed, there have been  campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and  withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those  campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the  government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent  our country from participating in the isolation of the island.    In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out  actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban  issue included in presidential summit agendas.    Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace  agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin  America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which  is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two  UN General Assemblies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Dramatic Hours of Kolozsvar -- </F> Archeological Excavations To Start Today"]    [Text] There is a pogrom mood in Kolozsvar [Cluj]. Mayor  Gheorghe Funar has announced that the archeological excavations  around the statue of King Matthias in the center of town will  begin today. He also promised to take legal steps against  demonstrators, after the Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian] mobilized the population for  a protest meeting at 1300.    We are aware of the fact that the planned archeological  excavations in the center of town do not serve scientific  purposes. It is a political provocation aimed at dismantling the  statue of King Matthias, reads the appeal of the Kolozsvar  county organization of the RMDSZ to the population of the town.    According to the RMDSZ, the planned action against the  town's  main square and the famous statue is the last straw in violation  of the national dignity of the ethnic Hungarians in Romania.  The RMDSZ called upon the entire population of Kolozsvar to  participate in a protest rally organized on the main square at  1300 on 22 June in order to defend the statue and the St Michael  Cathedral.    The mood in Kolozsvar has become extremely tense in the wake  of the planned excavations, the removal of Josef Bem's memorial  plaque, and the latest nationalist anticultural and  anti-Hungarian provocations. In view of this fact, the  operative council of the RMDSZ has been convened in Kolozsvar  for this afternoon.    Given the fact that the municipal council failed to gather  the necessary votes to allocate 30 million lei to finance the  excavations, Gheorghe Funar proposed to postpone the debate.  However, they announced that they would begin the excavations,  even without the approval of the municipal council because the  Historical Museum of Transsylvania allocated 10 million lei for  this purpose.    Museum Director Gheorghe Lazarovici pointed out that the  excavations are meant to "prove the continuity of the Romanian  people" because the archeological excavations that began at the  beginning of the last century were discontinued in 1943, and the  scientific evaluation of the results took place in Budapest. If  we cannot prove our thousands-of-years presence here with  written documents, then we will dig in the main square of  Kolozsvar for as long as 20 years to find the proof from the  earth, Lazarovici said.    In the municipality meeting on 20 June, Funar pointed out  that he would erase everything that refers to this town's  Hungarian character and, at the next municipal council meeting,  he would propose to change the name of the town to Napoca.  Nicolae Ruja, an adviser of the Romanian National Unity Party,  expressed the opinion that the statue in question should be  located in the Hunedoara Castle rather than on the main square  of Kolozsvar.    At a news conference on 21 June, Funar declared that the  excavations would commence on 22 June. He said that it is  impossible for this plan to generate any tension. If, however,  those who are displeased decide to, nevertheless, demonstrate on  the main square, he would use the legal stipulations regarding  unannounced demonstrations and the offenders would be arrested.  According to Funar, the Roman Catholic Church should not hinder  the excavations because the National Council for the Protection  of Monuments has already approved them.    In the Hungarian-language daily SZABADSAG published in  Kolozsvar, Roman Catholic Dean Arpad Czirjak drew the attention  of the Hungarians in Transsylvania to the fact that the Romanian  nationalists are preparing for a final showdown against King  Matthias' successors.    Both Hungarians and rationally thinking Romanians argued a  lot for giving up the aforementioned plans in recent weeks.  However, it seems that arguments no longer help. There is a  pogrom mood in Kolozsvar.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elisa Wasch] </F>   [Excerpt] [Announcer] In Vienna talks about Bosnia have  started today again, for the second time in three weeks. The  meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will deal mainly with  territorial issues. Elisa Wasch reports on the negotiations.    [Wasch] Both sides today stressed that they finally want to  put an end to the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past  months, the Muslim government units in central Bosnia managed to  conquer six towns; about 70,000 Croats are surrounded there. As  a result, over the past days threats have come from Zagreb.  Both President Tudjman and Defense Minister Susak spoke of a  potential Croatian military intervention in Bosnia if the  Muslims do not cease their offensive. Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate Granic, who participated in today's talks, denies that  there are any plans for a Croatian intervention.    [Begin Granic recording, in English with superimposed German  translation] We do not have any plan to make a military  intervention. We will talk about how we can put an end to the  fighting, about a cease-fire, and about future relations between  Croats and Muslims. [end recording]    In addition, Granic said that Croatia continues to be  willing  to negotiate access to the Adriatic Sea, which is demanded by  the Muslims. However, Zagreb no longer wants to talk about the  Adriatic port of Neum, which the Muslims want to have.    [Being Granic recording] Croatia is ready to discuss access  to the sea but not Neum. [end recording]    The Vienna talks are still going on and will be continued  tomorrow. [passage omitted]</p>

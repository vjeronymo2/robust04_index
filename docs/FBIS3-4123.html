The supply  of farm produce is directly related to stable prices and an  improvement in the people's livelihood, and an increase in the  peasants' income, is directly related to market development. It  is the crux of rural work at present and in the future and an  important and pressing task for the vast numbers of peasants and  rural cadres to increase the peasants' income.    The successes attained in China's agriculture since reform  are obvious to all. However, the problems exposed in  development are also worrisome. Of all the problems, the most  serious ones are the declining efficiency in agriculture and the  slow growth in the peasants' income. The peasants' income  increased rapidly at an annual rate of 13.9 percent from 1978 to  1984. The enthusiasm of the peasants for farming ran  unprecedentedly high and the output of farm produce increased by  a wide margin during that period. Take grain output for  example: The figure rose from 300 billion kg in 1978 to 400  billion kg in 1984, an increase of 100 billion kg in six years.  Before rural reform, it took 20 years to get an additional 100  billion kg of grain. After 1985, however, the peasants' income  did not increase despite the increase in output, or the output  increased remarkably but their income increased slightly. In  the eight years from 1985 to 1993, the peasants' incomes  increased by an annual rate of only 2 percent. Income fell  behind production growth. As a result, the annual growth target  of 5.4 percent required for attaining the comparatively well-off  goal was out of reach.    The main reason for the problem is the irrational price  relationship between farm and manufactured goods and the low  economic efficiency of agriculture. On the one hand, the price  of farm produce, driven by overall price hikes, rose. But the  extent was still lower than the increase in the price of means  of production. In other words, the price of products was lower  than the price of materials and cost, resulting in high input  but low efficiency. On the other hand, the increase in the  price of farm produce was far lower than that in manufactured  goods which used farm produce as materials. As agricultural  production could not share the average social profits,  agriculture, which is a basic industry, was thrown into an  unfavorable position. As a consequence, income from  agriculture, which constituted 70 to 80 percent of the source of  peasants' average per capita income, rose at a slow pace, and  even dropped in some regions.    The problems caused by the drop in peasants' income were  serious: First, the market for rural consumer goods remained  weak, growth dropped, and consumer goods bought by rural  inhabitants, who accounted for over 80 percent of the country's  total population, accounted for 40 percent of total retail  sales. Second, the input in agriculture decreased. In some  economically developed regions, the tendency of neglecting  agriculture was more obvious, the amount of cultivated land and  sown area of grain decreased while large amount of agricultural  funds flowed nonagricultural fields. Third, because of the  irrational prices, the peasants are not enthusiastic to sell  farm produce to the state. Some are waiting for better prices.  As a result, the amount of major farm produce including grain,  cotton, and edible oil possessed by the state decreased, which  affected its capacity for macroeconomic regulation and control.  Fourth, the low income of the peasants added difficulties to  the development of rural social welfare undertakings. As the  income of most of the peasants is not high and the growth in  their income has decreased instead of increasing, it will be  impossible to transform the outlook of the rural areas.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphatically pointed out on numerous  occasions: "Without rural stability, there will be no stability  in the overall political situation. If the peasants have not  extricated themselves from poverty, it means that our country  has not extricated itself from poverty." "Without the  enthusiasm of the peasants, it will be difficult for the state  to develop." Hence, we should look at the peasants' incomes  from the high plane of social stability, political stability,  and coordinated development of the national economy as a whole.  In light of the requirements of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Central Rural Work  Conference, and the National Agricultural Work Conference, it is  necessary to stabilize the party's basic policies in the rural  areas, further deepen rural reform, appropriately settle the  outstanding problems arising from rural economic development,  and try by every means to increase the peasants' income.    To increase the peasants' income, it is necessary to first  focus attention on developing production. While ensuring the  sown area of grain, cotton, and edible oil, we should vigorously  readjust agricultural production and product mix, develop  quality, high-yield, and efficient agriculture. Of the growth  in peasants' income last year, over 30 percent derived from  township enterprises. This is an important source for increasing  the peasants' income, which should be firmly grasped. Second,  it is necessary to gradually readjust the purchase price of farm  produce and reduce the price scissors between industrial and  farm products. To stabilize consumption by the inhabitants, it  is necessary to establish a risk fund and adopt other measures  to curb price hikes and prevent a price spiral. Third, to  increase input in agriculture, the state should readjust the  investment in capital construction, budgetary funds, and credit,  increase the proportion of investment in agriculture, and  support agricultural development. Fourth, the circulation for  farm produce should be unclogged and the rural market should be  invigorated. The peasants should be organized to enter the  market, develop production-supply-marketing and trade-  industry-agriculture integrated organizations, and reduce the  loss in profits from the intermediate links. Fifth, to increase  the peasants' incomes, further efforts should be made to  alleviate the peasants' burden. In places where the peasants'  burden is lightened and the unreasonable charges are removed,  these practices should not be allowed to reoccur under any  excuse. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the  "help-the-poor scheme" and do well the work of helping the poor.    The question of agriculture, rural areas, and peasants has  always been a fundamental one in China's revolution and  construction. It is an economic, as well as a political task,  to try by every means to increase the peasants' incomes. From  the strategic high plane of rural and social stability and  promoting the rural economy and sustained, rapid, and healthy  growth of the national economy, we should seriously do the work  well so that the peasants' incomes will increase along with  economic growth and the 900 million peasants will be able to  attain the comparatively well-off goal at an early date.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Strong demand boosts Thai phone group Surging demand for cellular phones in Thailand has enabled United Communications' (Ucom) to report robust half-year net profits of Bt864m (Dollars 34.5m). Second-quarter profits were Bt448m. The results have been consolidated for the first time so no comparable figures are available for 1993. 'The growth in the cellular phone business has made Ucom one of Thailand's fastest growing companies,' said Mr Dan Fineman of Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities. Approximately 55 per cent of Ucom's profits come from cellular phones. Jardine Fleming believes cellular phone sales will climb by 60 per cent this year to 741,000 and that Ucom's full-year net profit will be Bt1.8bn.</p>

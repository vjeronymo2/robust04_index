			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 26 KYODO -- The European Union  (EU) wants to join the United States and explore "a common  approach" to get Japan to lower its trade surplus by opening its  markets wider to foreign products, the top EU trade official  said Tuesday [26 April].    Leon Brittan, European commissioner for trade policy, told  reporters that he discussed Japanese trade issues in a meeting  with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Tuesday. "We  share a common view that Japan has a trade surplus which is too  large and that part of the problem of that surplus is caused by  difficulties in access to the Japanese market," Brittan said  after his meeting with Kantor.    The EU, which also runs a sizable trade deficit with Japan,  has expressed concern that U.S. pressure on Japan to open up its  markets through bilateral negotiations would come at the expense  of European interests.    Brittan reiterated that concern during his current trip to  Washington, arguing that Japan and the U.S. should take a  "tripartite approach" in their trade talks by letting the  Europeans in on their negotiation process.    The United States and Japan have been negotiating for nearly  one year on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus, but the  talks have run into stalemate over U.S. demands to set  "numerical indicators" to measure the openness of Japanese  markets.    Brittan, speaking at the National Press Club in Washington,  said the EU is opposed [to] the concept of setting numerical  targets for specific industry sectors because that would  increase government interference in the markets.    Instead, Brittan said the Japanese Government should  undertake specific fiscal policy commitments, describing such  macroeconomic targets as "useful" in bringing down Japan's trade  surplus. "With a slightly different method we might be able to  reach an agreement that would satisfy all our concerns," Brittan  said.    Brittan also raised the Japan trade issue in an address to  the European Institute in Washington on Monday, saying that the  EU and the U.S. should cooperate to remove "flagrant rules and  regulations" in Japan that block trading opportunities for  foreign businesses.    The so-called "framework" trade talks between Japan and the  United States have been suspended since they broke down at the  summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and former  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington on  February 11.    Japanese and U.S. officials say they have no idea when the  trade talks will be resumed, and the uncertainty has been  compounded by the political turmoil in Japan, with newly elected  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata having difficulty forming a new  government.</p>

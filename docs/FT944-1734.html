			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Florence terminal Florence inaugurated its new Amerigo Vespucci air terminal, named after the Florentine explorer, on Saturday, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. The opening raised the competitive stakes with Pisa's airport which, though 90km away, is the traditional arrival point for Florence's tourists because of its long runway. Florence airport is already served by small jets operated from the UK, France and Germany by carriers including Meridiana, UK Air and Lufthansa. It claims to be the third largest airport in Italy, judged by number of destinations served by scheduled airlines.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (6): Mutual encouragement - Employment in Stevenage is moving to the services sector STEVENAGE, the first of the new towns, has seen its employment base undergo a significant change since the beginning of the 1980s, writes Anne Steadman. Traditionally a manufacturing town, the emphasis has shifted in recent years towards the services sector. But, although the proportion of manufacturing to services jobs has moved from 55/45 per cent to 35/65 per cent during the period, the total number of jobs, at around 35,000, has remained fairly constant. In common with other Hertfordshire towns, Stevenage has had to bear its share of the burden of the decline in the defence industry. Two divisions of British Aerospace, Space Systems and Dynamics, are located within its Gunnels Wood industrial area, but the town has also had considerable success in attracting inward investment in the past few years. One recent success is the new Pounds 40m head office of Provident Mutual, which will be officially opened on May 26. The complex of three interlinked buildings provides a total of 200,000 sq ft of offices, of which all except 30,000 sq ft will be occupied by Provident Mutual's 850 staff. The company began moving personnel out of its original base in Moorgate, in the City of London, in the mid-1950s, first to Hitchin. Pressure on space led to expansion into Stevenage, where eventually more offices were taken. The decision to stay in the Stevenage area was based on several considerations. Transport links, says Ian Cartwright, Provident Mutual's administration services manager, are excellent, particularly the high-speed 125 rail service into Kings Cross In addition, the company has forged firm links with local schools, which offer good recruitment potential. There is also a good range of housing - both in Stevenage itself, where prices are as cheap as anywhere in Hertfordshire, and in the surrounding villages - a factor which influences recruitment from outside the area. Added to this, Provident Mutual had developed a good relationship with the council. An even bigger boost for Stevenage has been Glaxo's decision to locate its European research campus in Stevenage, on a 75-acre site in Gunnels Wood. There is also a site of 25-acres for further expansion, should it be needed. Glaxo was looking for a large site with good access to road, rail and air communications, says Richard Sykes, chairman and chief executive of Glaxo Group Research. Stevenage also had the UK's first purpose-designed pedestrianised town centre. An indoor shopping mall, Norwich Union's, Westgate Centre, has been added, bringing town-centre retail space up to 1m sq ft. Most of the major high street multiples are represented, but the original part of the town centre has begun to look rather tired. As part of its on-going plans to promote and sell Stevenage, the council plans improvements to the town centre and to the walkways which form the access route from the station. Recladding of the leisure centre, along with improvement to the footbridges, is also a priority. The council is committed to putting up some of the cash for the improvements, but is also looking for input from the private sector. Response from retailers and landowners with vested interests has been positive so far, says Elizabeth Wilson, Stevenage's head of development and planning. The council is also considering some form of town centre management, again in partnership with the private sector.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Soap Ends Story Line: NBC has acknowledged "unfortunate and misleading  stereotypical portrayals" and abruptly ended a "Santa Barbara" story line that  featured two warring Arab rulers, both of whom were holding Americans hostage.  The acknowledgement came in response to a letter from the American-Arab  Anti-Discrimination Committee, which demanded an end to that plot line and  asked to meet with NBC producers. Amal Benedict, a spokeswoman for the Arab  group, said that since the Persian Gulf crisis, "there is definitely more focus  on Arabs in network drama, and they're being portrayed as villains. . . . The  stereotyping that has gone on is just not factual." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

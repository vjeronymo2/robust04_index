If partial demolition/disposition is required:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A demolition/disposition application must have been approved before the MROP activities application may be approved; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The application must have been submitted along with evidence of approval by the unit of general local government in which the project is located. This approval may be obtained from the Chief Executive Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Conversion of units (by combining small units to make larger units or vice versa) must either be approved before an MROP activities application involving conversion may be approved, or an application for said conversion must have been submitted, and the cost of any conversion must be considered in the MROP activities application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Funding provided for MROP activities at a project may not be used for total demolition/disposition of that project, but may be used for partial demolition/disposition if required to meet long-term viability; however, 75 percent of the units in the project or portion of the project which comprises the MROP application must be reconstructed.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Most Americans  support the U.S. Administration to resume talks with the  Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK), a NEWSWEEK  magazine poll said today.    The poll showed that nearly 68 percent of 499 Americans  interviewed by telephone believed the United States should  resume talks with the DPRK.    Twenty-five percent were against resuming talks before  inspections on the DPRK's nuclear facilities, and seven percent  said they didn't know, the poll said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday [19 Jun] that the  U.S. would be willing to resume high-level talks with the DPRK  if the DPRK is ready to freeze its nuclear program while talks  go on.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> So now the Pentagon is telling us that the B-2 'Stealth Bomber' may cost as  much as $1.9 billion each if production is slowed down (Part A, April 4). The  private military contractors and their cohorts in the Pentagon have grown lazy,  fat and happy from 10 years of taxpayer-subsidized welfare for the rich.  </P> <P> It is a fact that under the Reagan-Bush presidencies the military budget has  more than doubled while monies for social, welfare, education and public  infrastructure programs have been slashed. The result: a grossly inefficient  military-industrial complex, a huge federal deficit, an uneducated, complacent  public, crumbling roads and an upsurge in government sleaze and corporate  crime.  </P> <P> It is long overdue that these contractors and their government co-conspirators  were held accountable for their crimes against the people. The last thing we  need is another wasteful, inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.  </P> <P> MICHAEL GREENE  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Margarita  </P></p>

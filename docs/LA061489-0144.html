Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EX-USC STAR CHIP BANKS ARRESTED  </P> <P> Former USC and All-Pro linebacker Chip Banks has been arrested and charged with  possession of crack cocaine and marijuana.  </P> <P> Banks, 28, of Atlanta, was arrested Tuesday at a housing project known for drug  transactions, police Sgt. P. L. Mitchell said. Banks dropped a brown bag  containing one dose of crack and a bag of marijuana on the ground when police  approached, officers said. He is serving a five-year probation for a March  conviction of cocaine and marijuana possession, stemming from an October  arrest.  </P> <P> Banks, a top college player at USC, was the third player selected in the 1982  NFL draft. He played five years with the Cleveland Browns and was traded to the  San Diego Chargers in 1987. He refused to sign a contract with the Chargers  last season and sat out the year. He did not play because of a drug problem,  Banks' agent, Harold Daniels, said after the March conviction.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CURTIN IN, ALDA OUT AS NBC PLOTS FALL STRATEGY  </P> <P> Alan Alda won't be on NBC next fall in a regular series as planned. But Jane  Curtin, who wasn't expected to return to series television, will. So will a  new, big-budget, prime-time version of "Dark Shadows," the Gothic serial.  </P> <P> These were some of the announcements made Thursday by Brandon Tartikoff,  president of NBC Entertainment, in a press conference in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Tartikoff also announced that NBC will counter-program baseball's league  playoffs and World Series next fall with four to six hours of made-for-TV movie  versions of Jackie Collins and Danielle Steel books, to which the network  recently obtained rights.  </P> <P> NBC lost the rights last year to major league baseball in a bidding war with  CBS. Tartikoff said this is NBC's answer. "We're not taking it lying down. . .  . No one's ever seriously counter-programmed the World Series, but we are."  </P> <P> When asked if he would watch movies based on Collins' books, "Lucky" and  "Chances," or watch the World Series, Tartikoff said, "I have a VCR."  </P> <P> Tartikoff also announced that "Fall From Grace," a made-for-TV movie based  about Jim and Tammy Bakker's television ministry, is going into production. And  two miniseries -- one about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the other based on  the "The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All" best-seller -- will be  filmed for next season on NBC.  </P> <P> Tartikoff explained the loss of a regular series starring Alan Alda next fall  as being the result of a decision by Alda not to return to weekly television.  The plan for the series was Alda starring as a middle-aged man facing mid-life  crisis.  </P> <P> Alda had completed one script, which Tartikoff said NBC will own and might  produce with another star in the lead.  </P> <P> "What's happened for Alan, though," Tartikoff said, "is that his directing  career is in high gear. Disney has a major motion picture they want him to get  involved in. And nobody knows the demands of weekly series television better  than Alan."  </P> <P> He announced no details of the comedy planned for Curtin but said that "Dark  Shadows" -- which is still a cult series after a daytime run years ago -- will  premiere as a two-hour movie featuring some members of the original cast next  fall. Dan ("War and Remembrance") Curtis, creator of the original series, will  be executive producer.  </P> <P> In other developments at NBC, "The Ann Jillian Show" has been pulled from the  schedule and is going in for a major overhaul with new producers. "My Two Dads"  will return Sunday evenings starting Jan. 21.  </P></p>

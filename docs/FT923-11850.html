			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / SmithKline Beecham lifts profits 10% BUOYANT pharmaceutical sales helped SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs and consumer products group, report pre-tax profits up 10 per cent from Pounds 230m to Pounds 254m for the second quarter. Sales increased 9 per cent from Pounds 1.155bn to Pounds 1.261bn. However, both sales and profits benefited from favourable exchange rates: at comparable rates, sales and profits would have been 4 per cent and 5 per cent higher. Earnings per share and per equity unit, following a share split in the UK this month, were up 12 per cent to 6.2p and 11.7 cents. Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, said: 'We are particularly pleased with the performance of pharmaceuticals. Our strong marketing capacity has allowed us to expand existing products and successfully launch new ones.' He pointed to the success of Relafen, a new arthritis treatment which was launched in the US in February. The drug had worldwide sales of Pounds 40m for the first half of the year. Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, increased 24 per cent during the first quarter at constant exchange rates. Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug, fell 2 per cent. Mr Bauman said the company still lacked marketing depth in Japan, the world's second largest market. The group would look to expand its sales force and set up more co-marketing agreements with indigenous companies. Sales from pharmaceuticals increased 13 per cent from Pounds 607m to Pounds 686m. The division's trading profits rose 7 per cent from Pounds 163m to Pounds 176m, while margins declined from 26.8 per cent to 25.6 per cent. The company said this was caused by increased spending on marketing to support the introduction of new products. Sales of consumer brands rose 7 per cent from Pounds 331m to Pounds 355m. Trading profits increased 14 per cent from Pounds 49m to Pounds 56m. Margins improved through better sales and sales of non-core operations. Mr Bauman said the group had been disposing of products which were not health-related or were not growing sufficiently fast. Operating profits at the animal health division fell 25 per cent from Pounds 14m to Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 76m (Pounds 77m). Clinical laboratories' trading profits increased 15 per cent from Pounds 19m to Pounds 21m on turnover of Pounds 144m (Pounds 140m). The company proposed a second interim dividend of 2.075p (1.875p) per ordinary share and 5.279 cents (4.216 cents) per equity unit. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Sun slips in third term despite record sales SUN Microsystems, the leading computer workstation manufacturer, reported a bigger than expected decline in third-quarter earnings, in spite of record revenues. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 51.7m, or 47 cents a share, compared with Dollars 61.4m, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.1bn, up 20 per cent from Dollars 952m. Sun attributed the decline to higher shipments of less profitable upgrade products, including add-on memory and data storage devices. The company said that European markets had been weak. 'Profitability was below the year-ago level due to gross margin declines that were partially offset by tightly controlled growth in operating expenses,' said Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer. 'Our commitment to control headcount and spending enabled us to increase revenue per employee above Dollars 300,000 for the first time.' For the first nine months of fiscal 1993, Sun recorded revenues of Dollars 3.1bn, up 17 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Net income for the nine-month period was Dollars 80.6m, or 77 cents a share, compared with Dollars 135.6m, or Dollars 1.34, last year.</p>

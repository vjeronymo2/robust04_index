			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL;  </P> <P> RETAILERS SEE CHANCES TO WRING PROFITS OUT OF EARTH DAY HOOPLA  </P> <P> As national manufacturers scramble to portray their products as environmentally  safe, county retailers and clothing producers are cashing in on Earth Day as  well.  </P> <P> While a little late for Sunday's Earth Day, the MainPlace/Santa Ana mall plans  a raft of activities next month under the tongue-twisting banner, "Earth Day Is  Every Day in May."  </P> <P> For starters, the mall plans to open a recycling center in its west parking lot  for glass bottles, aluminum cans and newspapers. Its backers have set a lofty  goal of trying to break the Guinness world record for the most recyclable  material collected in a 30-day period.  </P> <P> The mall also plans to show environment-related displays from groups ranging  from the Audubon Society to the Orange County Transit District next month.  </P> <P> A rain forest exhibit will be on display for two weeks in the Robinson's Court.  Jungle guides will lead package-toting shoppers on a walk through a living rain  forest, complete with native plants, animals and sounds -- but presumably free  of malaria-bearing mosquitoes.  </P> <P> If that doesn't quench a thirst for modern jungle living, the mall is also  giving away a Hawaiian vacation for two that includes a trip to the rain forest  on Kauai. To further bolster its planet-conscious effort, the mall is featuring  save-the-ocean issues in the May edition of its magazine. It's printed on  recycled paper, of course.  </P></p>

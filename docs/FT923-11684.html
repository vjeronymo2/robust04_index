			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Nuclear weapons to be turned into fuel TWO US companies plan to convert uranium from dismantled Russian warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. The companies are Allied-Signal, a high technology group, and Nuclear Fuel Services, a privately owned supplier of reactor fuel to the US navy. Under a preliminary deal with the Russian atomic energy ministry (Minatom) and the Russian Academy of Sciences, Minatom would provide highly enriched uranium from retired Russian weapons, and other sources, for conversion into the low-enriched fuel used in commercial reactors. British, French, Japanese and other US groups are understood to have held similar discussions with the Russians. The joint venture expects to sell the fuel to the world's nuclear energy industry in conjunction with the US government. The US Department of Energy supplies 60-70 per cent of the west's commercial nuclear fuel. The venture plans to build a conversion plant in Russia, but to ensure an early start, it would ship highly enriched fuel to the US from next year and convert it at a plant in Tennessee owned by Nuclear Fuel Services.</p>

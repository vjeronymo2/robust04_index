			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Airbus criticises lack of political support - Loss of Saudi jet order dismays consortium The four partners in Airbus - Deutsche Aerospace and Aero-spatiale each with 37.9 per cent, British Aerospace with 20 per cent and Casa of Spain at 4.2 per cent - expressed dismay and criticism yesterday over the Dollars 6bn Saudi contract for aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the parent company of Deutsche Airbus, blamed the lack of political support in Germany and Europe for the failure of Airbus to win any part of the contract for 50 airliners. 'The order was awarded on political grounds, and not on the basis of economics,' Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, the Dasa director responsible for civil aircraft production, said. He said that while President Bill Clinton had intervened forcefully on behalf of US industry, political support in Germany, in particular, and Europe in general had been comparatively weak. He warned that the failure to win any share of the contract - unless the decision was altered - would result in further job cuts at Deutsche Airbus. 'Since Airbus aircraft have not been considered for this major contract up till today, the pace of Airbus production will have to be adapted in the near future,' he said. Airbus said it did not know if the US contract represented the whole Saudi order or if there was more to come. He had no doubt that if the contract from Saudia, the Saudi airline, had been decided on price and quality alone, the Airbus would have proved clearly superior to its US competitors. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium of aircraft makers, said it intended to scrutinise the terms of the deal to see whether it contravened the Gatt agreement. 'We'll be looking very carefully at the terms that the US has offered,' said Airbus. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, has for the past year been negotiating with Saudia over the sale of its A340 long-range aircraft and its smaller A320s. It has still not been officially notified about the US contract. Construcciones Aeronauticas (Casa), the state-owned Spanish aerospace company, said: 'It is bad news for Airbus and therefore it is bad news for Casa.' The Airbus consortium accounts for some 20 per cent of Casa's turnover, and together with the EFA fighter project in which Casa is also a partner, the European airliner constitutes the domestic industry's main access to technology and international partnerships.

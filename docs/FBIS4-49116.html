			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes it can be  removed from the special 301 "watch list" targeted by the United  States for possible trade sanctions for failure to protect  intellectual property rights (IPR), Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Tuesday [3 May].    Sheu made the statement after learning that the US Trade  Representative (USTR) has decided to move Taiwan from the  special 301 "priority watch list" to the less threatening "watch  list" this year.    Sheu said Taiwan has made significant progress in IPR  protection during the past year, including the passage of  amendments to copyright, trademark and patent laws stipulating  harsher penalties for offenders.    Taiwan has also launched massive crackdowns on commercial  piracy, Sheu said. "We'll continue law enforcement efforts to  prevent IPR violations and hope the US can move us from the  special 301 `watch list' as soon as possible," he added.    Sheu reported that police cracked 2,111 cases involving  copyright violations last year, in which 131,261 pirated music  cassette tapes, 18,307 videotapes and 19,219 volumes of pirated  books were confiscated.    The number of cases cracked was up 51.5 percent from 1992  and  the quantities of seized pirated books, videotapes and music  tapes were all historic highs, Sheu said.    Government authorities received 25,112 applications for  copyrights in 1993, of which 96.7 percent were filed by local  residents and the remaining were filed by foreign nationals.    Official tallies show that 86 percent of copyright  applications by local people were approved, while 78 percent of  those filed by foreigners were approved.    The USTR placed Taiwan on the special 301 "priority watch  list" in April 1993 and decided to keep Taiwan on that list last  August. Under the special 301 provisions of the trade act of  1974, the US Government must complete its annual review of its  trading partners' IPR protection practices by April 30, and  submit a report on the review to Congress.</p>

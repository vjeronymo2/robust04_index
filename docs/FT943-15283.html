			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung's son set to take power Mr Kim Jong-il appeared ready to take control of North Korea yesterday after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, as Radio Pyongyang urged the country's citizens to support the son as leader. North Korean television aired scenes of thousands of weeping citizens bowing before the numerous statues of Mr Kim Il-sung erected around the country as part of the personality cult that was at the centre of his 46 years of rule. The death of Mr Kim has led to the suspension of negotiations between the US and North Korea, which has also postponed a summit with the South Korean leadership designed to ease tension on the Korean peninsula. Western leaders were quick to send conciliatory signals to North Korea. In Naples for the Group of Seven summit, US President Bill Clinton said he had conveyed to Pyongyang his 'deep appreciation' of the role the late leader had played in resuming a dialogue between the US and North Korea. He emphasised his desire to avoid the 'isolation and misunderstanding' of the past between the two countries. The US and its allies also made clear, however, that they would continue to press North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons programme. South Korean officials predicted that Mr Kim Jong-il would succeed his father in the powerful position of general secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party, which controls the government and military. But he may allow an elderly official to assume the figurehead position of president. Mr Kim, 52, believed to represent a younger generation of technocrats, needs to forge a political alliance with the conservative leaders of his father's generation to ensure his control. He lacks the revolutionary credentials of his father, and while already commander-in-chief of the North Korean armed forces, he is believed to have failed to achieve complete control of the military. The KWP and the North Korean parliament are expected to hold emergency sessions in Pyongyang as early as today to elect a general secretary and president. Preparations continued for the funeral next Sunday of the late president, whose death was announced at noon on Saturday, 34 hours after he succumbed apparently to heart failure. North Korea halted military exercises and stopped propaganda broadcasts attacking South Korea after Mr Kim's death. But the South placed its armed forces on emergency alert on Saturday in response to concerns that a hardline military elite might try to oust Mr Kim from power. Mr Kim died as North Korea began high-level discussions with the US in Geneva on the nuclear dispute and two weeks before he was scheduled to meet South Korean president Kim Young-sam in an unprecedented summit meeting. North Korea said that Mr Kim died of heart failure brought on by stress connected with the dispute in recent weeks over the international inspections of the North's nuclear facilities. The presence of several officials, believed to be reformers, on the committee for Mr Kim's funeral indicates that a new generation of pragmatists may rise to the fore.

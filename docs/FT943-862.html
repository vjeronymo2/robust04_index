			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: How Group interim losses reduced How Group, the engineering concern, cut pre-tax losses by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.12m in the first half of 1994, against Pounds 1.45m last time which included Pounds 488,000 related to discontinued activities. Turnover was Pounds 58.4m (Pounds 70.5m), which Mr Peter How, chairman, said was because of the normal time-lag of converting construction orders into work-in-progress. A marked increase was evident in work being undertaken and turnover for the year was expected to be similar to 1993. Mr How said that 'generally, there is a renewed feeling of optimism, which I do not believe to be misplaced. . . . Competition, though still fierce, is becoming a little more realistic as the volume of enquiries rises.' Losses per share came to 2.69p (2.64p), but the interim dividend is again 0.375p.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. BEAT: BEST OF '88 WON'T SHATTER ANY TRENDS  </P> <P> If your great-aunt's bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded  its way through songs about life in the gutter, it'd probably stand a good  chance of getting a record deal.  </P> <P> At least that's the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on  the part of record companies in the wake of Guns N' Roses' multi-platinum  breakthrough. And with Geffen having snapped up such promising bands as Little  Caesar and Junkyard, there's no reason to think that frenzy won't continue well  into 1989.  </P> <P> Not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this  year:  </P> <P> The best thing you could say about the rest of the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was  that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for  trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around  town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a  "scene."  </P> <P> On the other hand, the worst thing about the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that  nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an  irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn't get the  attention they deserved.  </P> <P> After all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when  one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from L.A. in 1988 -- Melissa Etheridge  -- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build  her career through playing beach community taverns?  </P> <P> And who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media  attention would be Ailee Willis "discoverees," the Del Rubio Triplets, three  middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of "Walk Like an  Egyptian" and Willis' "Neutron Dance," and make most of their concert  appearances at nursing and retirement homes?  </P> <P> There are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in '88: Nu Folk  (the name's gotta go) and the latest edition of L.A. psychedelia.  </P> <P> Such clubs as Bogart's, Club Lingerie and the Music Machine suddenly swung open  their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the Breakaway and the  Gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (The revived Ash  Grove couldn't make it, though.)  </P> <P> Nu names to watch: meaning-seeker Mark Davis and witty social observer Milo  Binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands Different World and the  Beef Sisters could develop into contenders as well.  </P> <P> Among the murky mind-expansion brigade, Jane's Addiction is certainly the most  prominent, while fellow late-night denizen Caterwaul also seems a good  candidate for big things, based on the preview EP I.R.S. has just issued. An  album from the Betsy Martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. The stable  of psyche-rock purveyors at Nate Starkman &amp; Son records also seems quite  promising, with Shiva Burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some  major label attention these days.  </P> <P> The best live club act this year was Mary's Danish, which combines the droll  wit and delivery of singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager with a wild, loose  funk-rock sound. American Martyrs and the Bel-Fires have also both developed  strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl.  </P> <P> The Wild Cards, who released a debut LP "Cool Not Cold," also could (finally)  be the band to follow fellow Latinos Los Lobos to national attention. And the  country world offers potential matinee idol Jim Lauderdale (a debut album  coming soon from Epic), country-rock songstresses Lucinda Williams (a new album  that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and Kimm Rogers.  </P></p>

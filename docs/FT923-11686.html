			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Canada's summer not all fun: Some crucial political decisions must be taken soon AUGUST, when Canadians usually try to confine their thoughts to baseball, boating and barbecues, is shaping up this year as a crucial period in national politics. Several issues in the endless wrangle over Quebec's future place in Canada will be brought into sharper focus over the next few weeks. Mr Robert Bourassa, the Francophone province's premier, must decide soon whether to proceed with a national-unity referendum scheduled for late October and, if so, what question he will pose. Mr Bourassa, however, cannot make this decision without greater clarity about the willingness of the nine English-speaking provinces to compromise on a package of constitutional proposals which they presented to Quebec earlier this month. Some key parts of the package have already stirred up a hornet's nest there. The political activity is most intense in Ottawa, where Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark are working feverishly to bridge the gap between English Canada's offer and Quebec's demands. As it stands, the offer would bring far-reaching changes to the way Canada is governed. The Senate, the upper chamber of parliament, would be changed from an appointed body to an elected one, with an equal number of representatives from each province (plus a handful from the Northwest Territories and Yukon) and with limited powers of veto. The federal government would be considerably weakened by the transfer of various powers to provincial jurisdiction, notably those on job training, culture and immigration. Aboriginal people would gain a right to self-government, the extent of which would probably be left to the courts to define. Quebec, which has boycotted the national-unity talks since the collapse of the Meech Lake accord two years ago, is unhappy about several aspects of what is now being dubbed the Pearson accord (after the building in Ottawa where it was crafted). The province contends that some parts, notably the constitutional recognition of the Francophone province as a 'distinct society' and the powers over immigration, are weaker than the equivalent sections of the Meech Lake agreement. Quebec sees itself not simply as one of 10 provinces, but as the home of one of Canada's two founding peoples. It thus has severe misgivings about a Senate where probably no more than eight out of 84 members would have French as their mother tongue. Although this would be offset by greater representation for Quebec in an enlarged House of Commons, Quebecois fear that the upper house of parliament would effectively cease to be bilingual. Mr Mulroney and Mr Clark are trying to find sufficient common ground between Mr Bourassa and his English-speaking counterparts to justify a meeting of all provincial premiers. Among the compromise proposals being toyed with is one which would guarantee some Senate seats for French-speaking minorities outside Quebec. Ideally, the meeting - which could take place as early as next week - would be an occasion for everyone to put their signatures to a new constitution. Mr Bourassa could then return in triumph to Quebec City and call a referendum, confident that he had gained enough to spike the guns of the Quebec separatists. But such a happy outcome is by no means a certainty. Among the other scenarios that could unfold are an unravelling of the package agreed by the nine provinces, an effort by the federal government to impose its own set of compromise proposals, and a delay in the Quebec referendum. Even if an agreement is reached soon, one wild card is the possibility of opposition to the new deal outside Quebec. The Meech Lake accord was signed by all the premiers in 1987, only to fall apart as ratification by provincial legislatures became bogged down in growing public doubts. This time round the provinces will not only need to ratify a deal, but some have also committed themselves to public hearings and referendums. Serious reservations are already being expressed about the offer to Quebec, with critics labelling it as an unworkable agreement born of desperation rather than a recipe for effective government. Trade unions fear that the transfer of job training to the provinces could imperil the national unemployment insurance scheme. Even Mr Michael Wilson, industry and trade minister, who is one of the most senior members of the Mulroney cabinet, publicly voiced his displeasure over what he considers the wishy-washy mechanism to bring down pervasive inter-provincial trade barriers. The question is whether Canadians are now so fed up with the interminable constitutional merry-go-round that they will accept virtually any agreement signed by the prime minister and all 10 premiers. Or can they still be persuaded that no agreement is better than a bad one? There is little doubt, however, that the longer the debate goes on, the greater the threat to Canada's long-term political stability. If an agreement cannot be reached and ratified soon, attitudes in all parts of the country are likely to harden as recriminations begin. Canada's latest identity crisis would not only be prolonged, but deepened.</p>

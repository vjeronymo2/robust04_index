			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Japanese brokers cut earnings forecasts LEADING Japanese securities houses have sharply cut their earnings forecasts for the year, with three of the Big Four houses reporting net losses for the first time since the mid-1960s and 10 of the top 14 brokers expected to report pre-tax losses. The revisions showed that the weakness of the Tokyo market and the spate of scandals over the past year have inflicted greater-than-expected damage on the Japanese brokers. Nomura Securities revised its pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March down from Y75bn (Pounds 330m) to Y45bn, well below the Y233.5bn earned in the previous year. Yamaichi Securities said pre-tax loss would be Y34bn and net loss would be Y52bn. Nikko Securities, another leading house, cut its forecast pre-tax profit from Y45bn to Y2.5bn, down from Y72.9bn last year, while the net loss is expected to be Y26bn. Daiwa Securities last week forecast a net loss of Y43bn, and said pre-tax profits would be only Y13bn, against Y119bn a year earlier and Y313bn two years ago. Each of the companies said the poor results reflected the decline in commission income caused by the market's slumping turnover and the mounting appraisal losses on the companies' own stock holdings. The longer-term effects of the stock market's weakness were particularly evident among the 10 second-tier brokers, nine of which expect pre-tax losses ranging from Y3.9bn to Y47.5bn. The only exception is Kokusai Securities, which is strong in bond dealing, and forecast a small pre-tax profit of Y130m. Several brokers reported large losses related to disputes with clients over tobashi, in which brokers transferred loss-making securities from one client account to another to take advantage of different book-closing dates and avoid the reporting of losses. Yamatane Securities revealed yesterday that it had agreed to pay compensation totalling Y19.4bn to two clients and that its chairman and president would resign to take responsibility for the tobashi disputes. Daiwa has already announced a Y72bn loss for similar reasons, and Cosmo Securities reported a Y36bn settlement with a restaurant chain. Trading volumes in Tokyo have been particularly low in recent months, contributing to the expected 37 per cent fall in Nomura's commission revenue over the year. Nikko said its commissions would fall 36 per cent and Yamaichi forecast a 40 per cent decline. Firms have already cut capital spending, reduced staff intakes and are reviewing the future of unprofitable branches.</p>

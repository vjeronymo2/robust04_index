			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: FT-Actuaries World Indices On June 23, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee announced that Thailand and Brazil would be included in the World Indices from October 1 1994, subject to satisfactory resolution of several outstanding technical issues. The committee has decided that Thailand and Brazil will be added from November 1 1994, to the World Index and all relevant regional indices. The addition of both new markets was postponed until November 1 in response to comments from index users, some of whom have expressed concern about the substantial lead-time required before first-time investors can participate in the Brazilian market. Simultaneous with the introduction of Brazil, FT-AWI Mexico will move on to a same-day calculation basis from its current one-day lag, and a new Americas regional index, consisting of the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil will be added to the daily table. When new countries are added to the World Index, it is necessary to set initial index levels. These will be US dollar index values derived from the value for the World Index on October 31 1994. There will be a slight modification from the usual practice for the Brazil index level in local currency. Normally an index in local currency is calculated as a function of the index level in US dollars, the current exchange rate, and the exchange rate from December 31, 1986. In the case of Brazil, years of hyperinflation would result in an impractically large number for the local currency index. To adjust for this, the exchange rate from December 31 1986 will be multiplied by a factor which will scale the index to a level comparable to that of the Brazil US dollar index. Following comments from users of the World Indices, the committee has also decided that to reflect as accurately as practicable conditions for foreigners trading in Thailand, the following guidelines will be used to price Thai shares, including the prices used to start the index. 1. Foreign board prices will be used where the aggregate of foreign holdings are greater, equal to or less than three percentage points below the permitted foreign limit (see 4 below). 2. Domestic board prices will be used in all other cases. 3. The World Index Policy Committee will, for the purposes of determining the type of price to be used, review the latest aggregate levels of foreign holdings and the individual foreign limits at its quarterly meetings. Any changes in the type of price used for individual lines of Thai stocks will be announced after each quarterly meeting and implemented at the start of the next quarter. There will be no changes in types of prices used during a quarter. However, the practice of making pre-announced adjustments to companies' investibility weightings during a quarter will continue to be applied to all countries. Thai companies' investibility weightings will, where appropriate, take into account any changes in the permitted foreign limits for individual lines. 4. Every day before the Thai index is calculated, all constituent lines priced from the foreign board will be reviewed. If the foreign board price for any line is unchanged from the previous day but there has been a price movement in the domestic board price, a calculated foreign board price will be determined as follows: Calculated foreign board price = today's domestic board price x (yesterday's foreign board price used in the calculation of the Thai index/yesterday's domestic board price). Where the foreign and domestic board prices are unchanged, the latest price used in the calculations of the index will be carried forward. The constituents of Thailand and Brazil are as follows. The investibility weightings are correct at the time of publication but may be subject to amendment prior to the launch of the index.

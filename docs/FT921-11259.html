			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capel wakes up its ideas - The Fund Managers / Profile of a flourishing 'newcomer' THERE USED to be a rumour in the City of London that the in-house unit trust departments run by stockbrokers for their private clients were a good place for an afternoon nap. Protected by client loyalty and the firm's reputation, the managers were under less pressure to perform than their independent rivals. Times have changed, and in-house groups have also come under the competitive spotlight. One group which realised this some years ago, and made an effort to compete, was James Capel unit trust management, which appears to be flourishing as a newly-independent management group. James Capel, the stockbroker, set up its first unit trusts for private clients in 1975. Early in 1988, though, the unit trust operation was still a comparative minnow, with only Pounds 43m under management. An American index and four additional trusts were launched in an effort to bring in new clients. By 1989, assets under management had risen to Pounds 269m; the present figure is around Pounds 450m. Capel also has established itself as one of the leading fund managers of index-linked unit trusts. Capel's parent, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, decided last year to merge the fund management operations with the European and British asset management division of one of its other subsidiaries, Wardley unit trust management. An independent company, James Capel Asset Management, was set up. Perhaps the subsequent move to Docklands, in London's East End, away from the rest of James Capel, was an invigorating change for the 15 fund managers. However, one of Capel's best performers, Gold and General (along with Julian Baring, its idiosyncratic manager), was lost to Mercury Asset Management in December. Performance has certainly improved over the past couple of years. Seven of the ten funds with a three year record have an above average performance in their sectors. Capel's managers call their approach 'low value or low p/e investing.' The idea is to buy shares on a low price/earning ratio - the number obtained by dividing the share price by earnings per share. The lower the p/e, the cheaper, in theory, the share. Capel will not buy any share with a p/e higher than the market's, and it sells any stock if its p/e reaches that of the market. It is not a unique approach, and it works better in some markets than others. Investment manager Richard Bisson says it usually is suited better to under-developed stock markets in south-east Asia and much of Europe. Indeed, the performance of the European Growth trust bears this out (although being relatively under-invested in Germany helped, too). Capel limits how much of the fund can be invested in each country; in Germany it is 13 to 37 per cent, and in Norway 0 to 6 per cent. This means the fund never takes huge bets on one country and is always well diversified. So, it is unlikely to be at the very top or very bottom of its sector. Low-value investing also has paid off for Japan Growth, Hong Kong and Far Eastern Growth trusts. The more specialist Singapore and Malaysia fund, inherited from Wardley, has been hit by the weakness of those two markets. Bisson attributes the underperformance of the American growth fund to what has happened since the 1987 crash. 'Investors are less willing to take risks and are buying steady growers like Procter and Gamble,' he says. But he believes the tide has begun to turn in favour of value stocks. Capel's largest fund, Income, is the fourth best performing of all unit trusts over 10 years, with a 600 per cent return and is also eighth in its sector (out of 106) over three years. In recent years, however, it has been the index funds which have helped Capel to make a name for itself, with around Pounds 150m invested of its total assets under management. Last October, Capel launched its fifth index fund, called Trixie, to track James Capel (the broker's) Trixie index. This consists of the 382 smallest companies on the FTA All-Share index, excluding illiquid stocks and investment trusts. The fund is, however, holding just 250 stocks. As with its other index funds, Capel has partially recreated the index, matching each sector in the fund as closely as possible to the index and choosing a selection of stocks from big, medium and small companies. The index funds are run from Edinburgh by a team of ten at James Capel Quantative Research under an Iranian mathematician, Dr Namdar Mossaheb. Why should investors want to buy index-linked funds? Well, few fund managers out-perform the various indices consistently. Indexation makes it possible to match the performance of those indices, offering investors the available investment opportunities in a particular market with little risk. Index-linked funds also cost less; annual management charges on the Trixie index fund are 1 per cent a year and on the UK Index fund 0.5 per cent, compared with 1.5 per cent on Capel's conventional funds. Some say this is too high. Capel replies that there is a skill in designing an index fund and that it is quite costly to adjust it often for changes in cash flow, the underlying index, rights issues, takeovers and mergers. So far, Capel's index funds have tracked their underlying indices well. This raises the question of whether traditional 'active' fund managers are strictly necessary. Capel clearly is committed to both kinds of funds. This year promises to be one of its better ones, with the low p/e approach vindicated in a number of markets. It deserves to be taken seriously, even though some funds are still relatively small. No afternoon naps are going on here.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAMES CAPEL UNIT TRUSTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Size     Launched     3 year         Sector                    (Poundsm)              performance    performance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- American Growth       12.0       1978        +26.9          +38.9 American Index        12.6       1988        +42.8          +38.9 Capital               16.8       1975        +15.6          +10.9 Europ Growth          15.6       1988        +30.2          +21.0 Europ Index           10.0       1989          n/a            n/a Far East Grth         15.1       1988        +15.2           -0.1 Global Bond            4.7       1991          n/a            n/a Hong Kong              4.3       1985        +32.1          +44.9 Income               107.9       1975        +24.8           +9.2 Intl Growth           12.5       1988        +18.5          +12.6 Japan Growth          17.4       1982         -7.4          -11.4 Japan Index           40.6       1989          n/a            n/a Japan Sm Cos           5.6       1989          n/a            n/a Sing &amp; Mal            23.5       xxxx        +41.6          +44.9 Tiger Index           15.0       1989          n/a            n/a Trixie Index           n/a       1991          n/a            n/a UK Index              42.9       1990          n/a            n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat.

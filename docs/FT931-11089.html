			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Book Review: He has seen the future, and it works differently POST-CAPITALIST SOCIETY By Peter F. Drucker In UK, Butterworth Heinemann Pounds 16.95. In US, HarperCollins Dollars 25 In the two dozen books which the encyclopaedic Peter Drucker has written since his first, The End of Economic Man, in 1939, he has dealt in various combinations with philosophy, politics, economics, ancient and modern history, sociology, science, technology and  - most notably - the management of all types of organisations, from businesses to non-profit bodies and even governments. Very occasionally, this still-fresh 83-year-old has turned his hand to integrating all these themes into one volume, in a manner rivalled by few writers over the past 50 years  - and that includes the once-fashionable John Kenneth Galbraith. Yet Drucker's reputation among most 'educated persons' (the object of the slightly teasing conclusion of this volume) rests just on his seminal writings about business management. These range from classics such as Concept of the Corporation in 1946, through The Practice of Management in 1954, right up to Innovation and Entrepreneurship in 1985, plus the book a year he has produced since then. With Post-Capitalist Society, Drucker has reverted to weaving all the threads together into a universal tapestry. For readers uninitiated in his power and range, the book should put an end to his narrow reputation. It reveals him better than ever as an acute observer of the underlying trends in each subject area, and his erudition and perspective help him knit them together persuasively. The 'post-capitalism' of his title may create unfortunate echoes of the recent flood of often half-baked writings about 'post-modernism' in almost every walk of society and the arts. But it has method in it. We have entered a 'post-capitalist' era, says Drucker, in the sense that the 'capitalist' society of the mid-1800s to mid-1900s was dominated by two forces: capital and labour. Now, and increasingly over the next two decades, we will move rapidly into a 'knowledge' society, in which the most vital factor of production will no longer be natural resources, capital or labour  - all of which can be obtained with relative ease today  - but knowledge. By the year 2000, he predicts, there will be no developed country where workers making and moving goods account for more than one-sixth of the labour force. Instead, the two key classes of society, with a greyer line between them than there has been between capital and labour, will be knowledge workers and service workers. Drucker argues that the main economic and social challenges will be, respectively, the productivity of the former and the dignity of the latter, whose numbers will be slightly greater. Lest his 'post-capitalism' should confuse the reader, Drucker makes it clear that it is in no way anti-capitalist in the sense that some post-modernists, though not all, are anti-modernist. It is centred upon the free market, as the only proven economic mechanism, although some of its institutions will have to change their roles. Commercial banks, for instance, will make their money increasingly by receiving fees for information, rather than by earning a return on money. Among the other characteristics of post-capitalist society, says Drucker, will be the confusing economic, political, social and managerial effects of constantly see-sawing tension between tribalism, nation states, regionalism and 'transnationalism'. For all his illuminating discussion of this phenomenon, Drucker is at his most thought-provoking on the economics and productivity of knowledge, and on organisational issues such as why specialisation is almost always more effective than diversification, whether in a business or a hospital. In an especially intriguing chapter, he points out the difficulty of quantifying knowledge, and therefore calculating a return on it. Hence, as he says, the lack of an adequate economic theory of knowledge despite the emergence of knowledge at the centre of the wealth-producing process. At a more down-to-earth level, Drucker dwells at length on the need in a knowledge-intensive society to take education out of the traditional classroom and, by the use of technology, to make it available  - and attractive  - to people throughout their lives. Universal 'literacy' will consist not just of reading, writing and arithmetic, but also of fully-fledged numeracy, an understanding of science, technology and foreign languages, plus what Drucker calls 'learning how to be effective as a member of an organisation'. Above all, it will require better 'process knowledge'  - including 'learning how to learn'  - as distinct from traditional subject knowledge. In order to lay the foundations of this society, Drucker argues that schools and colleges will have to become open to all ages, as well as more competitive and accountable for their performance. If all this seems too rich and indigestible a concoction to swallow, potential readers should be reassured that Drucker's sparse prose is laced with allusions not just to Socratic versus Protagorasian debate (about the nature of knowledge), but also to 13th-century Sienese art, to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to Margaret Thatcher, and even to the Girl Scouts movement. Drucker is nothing if not eclectic. After all the torrential, over-cooked outpourings of American futurologists such as John Naisbitt and Alvin Toffler over the past decade, this slim volume makes a meatier yet more elegant and refreshing change of menu.</p>

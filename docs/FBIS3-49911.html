Czech Presidential office head Lubos Dobrovsky told  journalists that Kovac described the partnership initiative as a  "great opportunity for central European countries' integration  into Euro-American civilization and the sphere of European  values, which are protected and guaranteed by NATO as a  militarily-formed security structure."    Havel's talks with Kovac were one of a series of talks with  heads of state of other Visegrad Group countries (Poland and  Hungary) held at Prague castle today.    After the talks with Havel, Kovac left for talks with U.S.  President Bill Clinton. After their negotiations there will be  a working dinner given by Clinton for his Visegrad partners at  the U.S. Ambassador's residence.</p>

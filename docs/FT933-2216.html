			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / HK completes Pounds 3.9m probe into Allied THE HONG KONG government issued on Saturday the results of a 13-month investigation into alleged corporate fraud by the Allied group, a probe which has cost HKDollars 46m (Pounds 3.9m) and sparked the largest commercial crime raid in the colony's history. The report details how Allied chairman Mr Lee Ming-tee created a network of listed, but supposedly independent companies. It alleges that he used these to consolidate control of a sprawling corporate empire, to by-pass listing regulations, and to manipulate share prices of group companies. The investigation has been described locally as 'the Carrian of the 1990s', referring to the infamous HKDollars 100m court battle over the collapse of the Carrian property group in 1983. But while the scale of the Allied investigation has been immense, the allegations are less damaging. The inspector's report lists five recommendations, of which only two were made public. These concern the creation of safeguards within the group to prevent misconduct by individual directors, and such measures have already been implemented. It is understood that the three unpublished recommendations are: That indications of criminal activity should be further investigated. This was addressed in Wednesday's raid on Allied offices by 300 police officers. The Stock Exchange and Securities and Futures Commission is advised to examine further any alleged breaches in listing regulations. It is suggested that the companies involved in the report should examine the findings and consider any further action. The report finds evidence of market manipulation, non-disclosure of substantial shareholdings and inter-group deals disguised as arms-length transactions. It remains to be seen, however, whether it has there is sufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings. Allied described the investigation as a 'witch hunt'. According to Allied's managing director Mr Brian O'Connor, the colony's financial secretary, Mr Hamish MacLeod, had promised the group an advance copy of the report and a meeting prior to its release. Neither of these promises had been fulfilled, Mr O'Connor said.</p>

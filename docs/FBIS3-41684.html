This was reported to a Trud correspondent by the  chairman of the Department of Especially Dangerous Infections at  the City Committee on Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight,  Lyudmila Alekseyeva.    The patient is in the city's second infectious hospital. He  is Yevgeniy Zhigunov, 48, without fixed place of abode.    Before being brought to the hospital, Zhigunov, in his own  words, ``had not been feeling well'' for about a week. He was  working as a guard of a truck in which he also slept. He drank  water from ponds and puddles where, evidently, he contracted the  infection.    ``This is not an epidemic'' added L. Alekseyeva.  ``Individual  cases like this occur annually but do not lead to any noticeable  consequences.''</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: The Veep does it his way - US vice-president Dan Quayle In the summer of 1991, the Washington Post dispatched its two star reporters on a mission to discover the truth about US Vice-President Dan Quayle. Over the next six months, David Broder and Bob Woodward conducted more than 200 interviews; they enjoyed unprecedented access to the vice-president, at home and abroad. The resulting seven-part series created a mild sensation in Washington, since it corrected the caricature of the 1988 election campaign, suggesting it was time to take Mr Quayle seriously in 1992, an election year. Today, the vice-president arrives in London, the last stop in a seven-day European tour. He has delivered an address on defence issues to the Wehr-kunde conference in Bavaria, expressed US solidarity during talks with the leaders of the Baltic republics, and lunched with the US Olympic Team. The political rehabilitation of Dan Quayle is well under way. On the eve of his trip, Mr Quayle invited the Financial Times to take a closer look, to see whether the Post's magnum opus really was the last word. The scene was the West Wing of the White House, and Vice-President Quayle was celebrating his 45th birthday, surrounded by photographs of his family, two aides, and the Stars and Stripes. He was wearing a broad smile. Mr Quayle accepted graciously his birthday present - the authorised history of the Financial Times by David Kynaston - and immediately began to talk about recent bed-time reading material: The Americans by Daniel Boorstin and Seize the Moment, former President Richard Nixon's latest foreign policy tome. 'Fascinating,' said the vice-president, 'balance of power and all that.' It seemed churlish to interrupt, but remarks by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan about the possible decline of the American work ethic had made front-page news from coast to coast. What was his response? 'No, No,' said Mr Quayle. All very unfortunate. Maybe something had been lost in the translation. Japan was a very important ally. Yes, but what about the Japanese prime minister's specific charge that many of America's economic problems came about because too many American college graduates went to Wall Street in the 1980s, rather than producing something of value? 'That's not true,' Mr Quayle shot back. 'If you look at our manufacturing numbers - as far as our total gross national product, manufacturing is up. I'm not going to get into a discussion of statistics, but I can tell you one statistic that I know very well, and that is that manufacturing for us is up. So we're still producing goods as well as services.' The vice-president is correct in one respect: figures show that manufacturing increased its share of gross domestic product in the second half of the 1980's. But there has been a steady erosion in the manufacturing workforce. In the 1980s, according to Professor Robert Reich of Harvard University, one of the country's leading economists, more than 2m jobs disappeared, 1m in the three years since the Bush/Quayle administration took office. Mr Quayle is, of course, a child of the 1980s. As a 33-year-old Congressman, he rode the Reagan tide in 1980, crushing Senator Birch Bayh, the liberal incumbent Democrat in Indiana. Over the next eight years, Mr Quayle carved out a solid, but not particularly inspiring record in the US Senate, developing some expertise in defence and national security issues. Today, he has matured, his staff say. One aide noted that he spends between 60 and 90 minutes a day with President Bush when both men are in town. Indeed, officials stress that the Veep attends all the high-level intelligence briefings and receives all the top-secret information rightfully due to someone who is a proverbial heart-beat away from the presidency. It is fashionable to engage in political revisionism about Quayle, so what were the vice-president's views about the 1980s - once seen as the decade when America regained its confidence, but now viewed as the decade of greed, the era of easy money and the stretch limousine? The vice-president paused. Maybe things on Wall Street might have gotten a little out of hand; but 'even some of the richest people in this country had to go to trial, and some went to prison. I think it will certainly serve as a reminder that nobody is above the law'. Mr Quayle is more exercised about executive pay in the US, especially when it is unrelated to performance. Without naming names, Mr Quayle said: 'Where you have those exorbitant salaries, totally unrelated to performance of the company, it's ridiculous. I will go on record to say that for some, executive compensation is way out of line.' We turned to his European tour which includes stops in Finland, Lithuania, the ski slopes of France - the vice-president likes to ski almost as much as he likes a round of golf - Bavaria and London. Today he is due to meet Mrs Margaret Thatcher, followed by talks tomorrow with Prime Minister John Major, her successor, and Mr Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labour party. Would it make a dime's worth of difference if Labour or Conservative formed the next government? Naturally, this was a matter for the British people to decide, the vice-president replied. 'But let me just tell you that John Major, in our viewpoint, has been one outstanding prime minister . . . There is a very special relationship between the president, George Bush, and the prime minister.' And Labour? Well, Mr Bob Hawke, the recently ousted prime minister of Australia, said the British Labour party had changed, an impression confirmed during a couple of meetings with Mr Kinnock and other Labour leaders. But of all the Labour MPs, Mr John Gilbert had a firm grip on military matters. 'A very thoughtful individual,' Mr Quayle commented. The vice-president seemed keen to stress the continuing need for an independent British nuclear deterrent. 'It has worked, and if Great Britain wants to relinquish its nuclear power capability who do you to abdicate this to? Pakistan?' The conversation shifted to Mr Boris Yeltsin who had just left the US after his inaugural appearance at the UN and Camp David. Mr Quayle was not present at either meeting, but he has met the Russian president on several occasions (his staff suggest that both men share a common experience: each had a bad press early on in Washington). The vice-president has top-rate staff, both on domestic and foreign policy. Mr Quayle was consistently sceptical about President Gorbachev and his reform intentions, even as far back as 1987. What was his impression of Mr Yeltsin? 'I trust his instincts. Before Gorbachev was willing to let the Baltics go, he said they were going to go. He was proud that he was the first democratically elected president of Russia, almost in history. I found him very direct, very forthcoming.' But did he trust him? 'Trust is something you hope for . . . something you earn.' It was a rare moment of reflection. Mr Quayle often seems inclined to rush to judgment (although other members of the administration credit him for sound political instincts when it comes to negotiating with Republicans on Capitol Hill). Yet every so often he also comes across as being caught in a time-warp. Asked if the US would support Germany and Japan becoming permanent members of the UN Security Council, the vice-president stalled, suggesting that countries such as Nigeria or Brazil would clamour for similar treatment. Pressed that the US could easily lead the charge toward revising the entry rules, Mr Quayle responded by minimising US influence: 'Look how losing side on the UN resolutions that have come up. I wouldn't say that the UN is pro-American by any stretch of the imagination. This is an odd judgment coming one year after the US secured UN support for waging war against Kuwait and when the Bush administration is calling for an expanded role for the UN. It is a view which is at least five years out of date. The vice-president seems much more confident than four years ago when he suffered a thousand indignities at the hands of the television and press. Whatever the public doubts, he remains determined to continue his political rehabilitation, and that includes mastering the intricacies of a second presidential campaign. 'I am doing it my way . . . And I am going to rely on myself . . . I don't need a lot of outside advice.' The vice-president speaks with the conviction, if not yet the authority, of someone who has his sights on higher office.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1947 Born Indianapolis.

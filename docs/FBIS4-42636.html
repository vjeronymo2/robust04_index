			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jochen Thies: "Clinton, You Go First"] </F>   [Text] West European governments were reluctant to clarify  their relationship with the new Italian Government under Silvio  Berlusconi. They let the United States make the first move.  Thus, as a prelude to his European trip, Bill Clinton has had  the opportunity to say a few words on the Rome government's  democratic ability, and on his cooperation with it. Clinton's  uninhibited way of dealing with Berlusconi, Fini, and other  members of the tripartite coalition must have been noticed in  France, Greece, and the EU [European Union] staff in Brussels,  where, remarkably enough, opposition had been expressed  vis-a-vis the political changes in Italy that led to a  completely new Italian party landscape.    Clinton, notably younger than the leaders of Europe, and  with  a much fresher style, must possess a special interest in the new  "Italian relationships" just like his predecessors after World  War II. At that time, Washington feared a communist takeover in  Italy, and sent a warlike lady as ambassador to the banks of the  Tiber River; Clare Boothe Luce.    From the U.S. stabilization policy pursued in Italy since  the  end of the war, one may conclude that even today this policy is  taking place behind closed doors. After all, from the U.S.  angle, Italy possesses strategic importance. Despite all its  problems and uncertainties, Italy continues to be one of the  largest EU members. It is a direct neighbor of the war-torn  Balkans, and, last but not least, quite close to the  Mediterranean basin and the troubled Maghreb countries. Apart  for that, Italian Americans play a major role in the media  society of the United States, something that encourages feelings  of friendship toward the motherland.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Hong Kong rates to rise Banks in Hong Kong yesterday said they would raise lending and deposit interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on Monday in response to the move this week by the US Federal reserve to tighten monetary policy. Hong Kong's dollar has been fixed against its US counterpart since 1983 and the authorities had little option but to move official and bank rates higher to preserve the link. On Tuesday the US Fed increased its Fed funds rate by 0.75 points to 5.5 per cent. The colony's new bank rate will be 8.5 per cent  -the highest level since late 1991. The Hongkong Bank said it will raise residential mortgage costs to between 10.25 per cent and 10.75 per cent. The prospect of higher borrowing costs unsettled the local stock market where share prices were marked down sharply, in spite of the widespread expectation of an imminent rate hike. The Hang Seng index ended 90.84 lower at 9,427.44 on turnover of HKDollars 2.43bn.</p>

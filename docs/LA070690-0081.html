			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> SECURITIES TAX REPORT PUSHES DOW DOWN 32  </P> <P> Blue-chip stocks posted their biggest loss in two weeks Thursday on selling  fueled by a report that White House aides were considering a tax on the sale of  securities.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up 69.30 during the past five sessions  before Independence Day on Wednesday, dropped 32.42 to 2,879.21.  </P> <P> In the broad market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5-to-2 in  nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 397 up, 1,058  down and 495 unchanged. Big Board volume slipped to 128.32 million shares from  Tuesday's 130.05 million.  </P> <P> "That tax trial balloon was the culprit," said Jon Groveman, president of  Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co.  </P> <P> A Wall Street Journal report said the White House is contemplating a proposal  to levy a tax of up to 0.5% on the sale of stocks, bonds and futures contracts.  </P> <P> "I think that (tax report) really hurt; that, coupled with the fact you had  sell programs from the opening bell and nothing to offset them," said George  Pirrone, vice president at Dreyfus Corp.  </P> <P> Program selling contributed to the drop in stocks, but the light volume  exaggerated the effect of the selling. Traders were also squaring their books  before today's employment report for June.  </P> <P> Philip Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes that at  least part of the selloff may have been related to nervousness over the jobs  report. While a good report could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower  interest rates, there is no certainty that the central bank will act on it.  </P> <P> Analysts also said traders were reluctant to chase after the market's recent  rally, given widespread doubts about prospects for corporate earnings in a  sluggish economic environment. Earnings reports for the second quarter of the  year are due in large numbers during the next three weeks.  </P> <P> The Dow's drop was led by GM, down 1 1/8 to 47 1/4; Merck, down 1 3/8 to 86  1/8, and United Technologies, down 1 to 56 7/8. Auto stocks generally were weak  despite news of strength in recent auto sales.  </P> <P> Other big losers included AMR, down 2 1/4 to 60 3/4; Wells Fargo, down 2 to 74  7/8, and Wrigley, off 2 1/2 to 54 1/4.  </P> <P> Among S&amp;Ls, HomeFed plunged 2 points early on, then recovered to finish  down 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, after Merrill Lynch upgraded its short-term rating on the  stock to "hold" from "below average."  </P> <P> Winners included Genentech, up 1/2 to 29, and Eli Lilly, up 1 1/2 to 86 1/4. A  group of researchers in Milwaukee said a study suggested that some  characteristics of physical aging in men could be reversed with a growth  hormone made by the two companies.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Neutrogena rose 1 3/8 to 23 1/8. Analysts attributed the gain to  short-covering by traders who had bet that the stock was headed lower.  </P> <P> Microcom tumbled 2 5/8 to 6 1/8. Late Tuesday, the computer networking company  revised downward the earnings it reported for its last fiscal year and  increased its estimate of the loss that it expects for the quarter ended June  30.  </P> <P> Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo in slow trading as lack of incentives  dampened a modest morning rally to end four straight sessions of gains. The  Nikkei 225-share index lost 94.25 to close at 32,351.67.  </P> <P> In London, stock prices dropped sharply as investors became worried about the  outlook for corporate profits. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 24.1 to  close at 2,331.4. In Frankfurt, share prices weakened after early gains to end  broadly lower. The 30-share DAX index lost 10.95 to end at 1,914.18.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Fall on Rate Worries  </P> <P> Bond prices generally fell, weakened by fear among traders that signs of  economic strength are making lower interest rates increasingly unlikely.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell about 3/16 point or about $1.87 per $1,000  in face amount. Its yield increased to 8.40% from 8.38% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bond market strategists said the weakness was generated partly by what they  called an unexpectedly high figure on 10-day auto sales from Detroit. The Big  Three said vehicle sales for late June rose 11.9% over the same level a year  earlier. The market had generally expected a rise of less than 7%.  </P> <P> In the view of bond traders, higher auto sales suggest that consumers aren't  afraid to finance expensive purchases, which means they are more confident  about the economy. That, in turn, could raise inflationary pressure. So more  traders figured that the Federal Reserve won't ease interest rates any time  soon.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.313% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Ends Higher on Technical Factors  </P> <P> The dollar closed moderately higher on world currency markets in light and  uneventful trading.  </P> <P> U.S. financial markets were closed Wednesday in observance of Independence Day.  </P> <P> Traders in the United States and Europe attributed the dollar's rise to  technical factors. Lou Calvello, a trader with Prudential-Bache Securities  Inc., said several dealers were buying dollars to square up their positions  ahead of Friday's release of unemployment data for June.  </P> <P> The market has been anticipating the Labor Department's report for several  days. "Hopefully it will spark some activity," said Jim Chorek, an analyst with  MMS International in Chicago.  </P> <P> Trading was particularly thin, with many U.S. investors absent from the market  as they extended their Fourth of July holiday, dealers said.  </P> <P> Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 151.00 Japanese yen from Wednesday's  150.30 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 150.50 yen. But in New  York, the dollar closed higher at 150.57 yen.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.7795, cheaper for buyers than Wednesday's  $1.7845. In New York, it cost $1.7815 to buy one pound.  </P> <P> Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current  delivery traded at $361.40 an ounce, off 70 cents from late Tuesday. Republic  National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $360.50, off 50 cents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rain Forecast Hurts Corn and Soybeans  </P> <P> Prices of corn and soybean futures wilted on the Chicago Board of Trade after  the National Weather Service issued a rainy forecast for the Midwest.  </P> <P> Wheat and oat futures also fell but not as steeply as corn and beans, which are  grown mainly in the Midwest and would benefit from additional moisture.  </P> <P> On other commodities markets, most oil futures fell; precious metals were  lower.  </P> <P> Corn futures settled 4.50 to 10 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in  July at $2.86 a bushel; soybeans were 7 to 23 cents lower, with July at $6.285  a bushel; wheat was 1.50 to 5.25 cents lower, with July at $3.1825 a bushel.  </P> <P> Most contracts for delivery of new-crop corn plunged the permitted daily limit  of 10 cents a bushel, largely in reaction to a six- to 10-day outlook issued  Wednesday by the weather service. The forecast was for normal temperatures and  above-normal rainfall over most of the Corn Belt during the latter half of next  week.  </P> <P> The losses wiped out gains that had mounted during the past week in reaction to  predictions, mostly by private meteorologists, that a pattern of unusually  warm, dry air was setting up in the Corn Belt.  </P></p>

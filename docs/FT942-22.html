			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (8): Smart suits appreciate low depreciation - Arthur Way explains why four-wheel drives are keeping their grip In a manner that reflects their progression along a muddy track, four-wheel-drive vehicles (4x4s) have shown no signs of faltering during recent years in the UK marketplace. At 58,561 units in 1993, demand for 4x4s - also known rather quaintly as off-road cars - was double the level of just two years earlier, and eight times as high as 10 years ago. These numbers refer to the entire off-road car sector, which can be divided into three main groups. At one end of the spectrum are such vehicles as the Daihatsu Fourtrak and Suzuki Vitara. These often come in soft-top variants, favoured by younger owners for their affordability and the element of 'fun' they provide. As such, they do not fall into the executive category. Next come the mid-range models, typified by Ford's Maverick and its cousin the Nissan Terrano, both of which are manufactured in Spain. These are closer to executive-car territory and, in some cases, are chosen by senior management for their mainstream transport. Finally, there are the 'heavyweight' 4x4s, including Chrysler Jeep's Cherokee, Isuzu's Trooper, Land Rover's Discovery and Range Rover, Mitsubishi's Shogun and Vauxhall's recently introduced Monterey. These models are moving to centre stage in the executive car market, with the result that sales have increased substantially and more manufacturers have entered the sector. At first glance it is somewhat puzzling why this should be so. After all, executives are associated with smart suits, briefcases and travel between one company car park and another, rather than country garb, bales of straw and the need to cross rough terrain. The apparent absurdity is compounded by the terms of business-user insurance policies, many of which forbid off-road use. There are, however, two compelling reasons why 4x4s have become so favoured as executive transport. First, fleet managers, finance directors and proprietors of small businesses are looking with increasing favour towards 4x4s, because of their high residual values. Mitsubishi, for example, states that the Shogun loses only about 15 per cent of its value in the first two years. In contrast, a typical executive car may lose half of its original purchase price during the same period. Second, latest versions of 4x4s incorporate many of the characteristics and features of large luxury cars - such as ABS braking, airbags, air conditioning, automatic transmission and leather seats. They drive and feel like a car, and have comparable performance, while many users appreciate the commanding position high above the traffic and the feeling of safety which this brings. Moreover, there are a variety of additional attributes, ranging from high load-carrying capacity and the ability to travel with assurance during inclement weather. According to the leading suppliers of heavyweight 4x4s, typical buyers are business and professional people in their late 30s or early 40s, who have an active lifestyle. Although the vehicles rarely - if ever - leave a made-up surface, quite a number are fitted with a tow-hook, which suggests that some owners use them to pull equipment such as boats, gliders and horseboxes. Evidence from the marketplace indicates that a fairly wide range of cars is being traded in for 4x4s. Buyers of Land Rover's Discovery, for example, tend to have had large estate cars, whereas Range Rover buyers are trading in marques such as BMW, Jaguar and Lexus. Land Rover is the market leader by a wide margin, thanks to its legendary Range Rover and highly successful Discovery. The latter was launched towards the end of 1989, since when more than 125,000 have been produced, of which around 65 per cent have been exported to 50 markets, making the model Britain's main contribution to the global 4x4 leisure market. The Discovery is distributed in Japan through two channels - Rover Japan and Honda's Verno network, where it is sold as the Honda Crossroad. In an important move, the model was launched in American during April 1994. Land Rover sells around 5,000 Range Rovers a year in this market, and expects to see the Discovery achieve double that number. Prospects have been enhanced following the introduction of the 1995 model version (in March 1994). This has a new interior and manual gearbox, together with a reworked engine which provides greater refinement. Mitsubishi has established a loyal following with its Shogun model, which is the world's best seller in the 4x4 off-road car sector. Since its launch in 1983, the company has produced more than 1m units, and annual sales currently amount to around 180,000. In the UK, though, the figure is below 4,000 - representing 25 per cent of Mitsubishi's import quota - and is unlikely to rise significantly in the short term, due to continued restrictions on Japanese imports. In the absence of this constraint, sales would undoubtedly be noticeably higher. Mitsubishi reports growing interest on the part of executive buyers for the Shogun, particularly during the past year. Chrysler Jeep's experience, since its debut in the UK at the beginning of 1993, provides a good indication of the 4x4 market's buoyancy. A first-year sales target of 2,000 turned into actual sales of 4,000 units, of which 3,500 were Cherokee models bought principally by business people. The target for 1994 is 5,000 sales, including 4,500 Cherokees. Chrysler Jeep reports that the majority of trade-ins are quality saloon and estate cars with few 4x4s. At the moment, only petrol-engined versions are available, but a turbo-diesel is scheduled to arrive later in the year. Vauxhall is another recent entrant, following the introduction of the Monterey in May 1994. The company is targeting the model (which is made by Isuzu in Japan) at executive-car buyers who are on the verge of trying something different. The sales target for 1994 is 2,000 units, of which 70 per cent are expected to be the long wheelbase 5-door version. The future of the executive 4WD sector looks good, as more people in the position to afford heavyweight 4x4s recognise their characteristics. Recent changes to company-car taxation - whereby scale charges are assessed on purchase price, rather than engine size - may help the sector's development, since many of the models feature large engines in the 3-4 litre range and were unduly penalised under the previous system. In addition, as tax scale charges are notched up to reflect more closely the monetary benefit of having a company car, executives are more likely to choose the model they really desire, rather than some identikit executive saloon. Under these circumstances, maybe the greatest threat will come from the growing ranks of multi-purpose vehicles - another alternative sector.</p>

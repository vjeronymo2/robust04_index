			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Misys turns in strong recovery to Pounds 9.12m MISYS, the computer services group, reported a strong recovery in the year to May 31, with pre-tax profits rising 62 per cent from Pounds 5.63m to Pounds 9.12m. The increase was mainly the result of reduced costs, improved margins and tight control of working capital, said Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman. There was also an absence of exceptional charges - last time Pounds 1.05m was deducted from the pre-tax line for redundancies, full listing costs and losses on the sale of Modular Technology. Operating profits rose 28 per cent to Pounds 8.87m (Pounds 6.93m). Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 68m (Pounds 67.5m), though the cost of sales declined by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 28.6m. Overheads fell by Pounds 229,000 to Pounds 30.6m. Mr Lomax said that the margins were better because the software content of the group's sales was increasing and the hardware reducing. Software is priced on the size of applications, or the number of stations, giving it higher margins. However, product sales were down by 7 per cent, though this was compensated for by the 18 per cent increase in service revenues, which now account for 39 per cent of total sales. In the year to May 1990 the figure was 25 per cent. Mr Lomax said the demand for working capital was 'modest', that the group carried very little stock and that debtor days were 36 - 'good within the industry', he said. The company has cash balances of almost Pounds 10m (Pounds 6.9m), after spending Pounds 3m on acquisition costs. Always known as an acquisitive company, Misys bought Innsite, the provider of software for the hotel industry, and a maintenance company during the year. At the end of the period, it bought the balances of Countrywide Holdings (UK) and Countrywide Management Group that it did not own - 'a large infill acquisition', said Mr Lomax, to boost Misys Financial Systems with insurance trading products. Earnings per share rose to 17.8p (11.5p) per share and the final dividend is lifted 9 per cent to 3.83p to make 6.1p (5.67p) for the year. The shares closed up 13p to 304p. COMMENT Computer software companies fall into two camps. There are those, like Misys, which make products and then market them. They have the benefit of short order books. They were hit hard earlier in the recession and are now bouncing back. Then there are the Hoskyns and Logicas of this world which make bespoke systems to order. Things aren't so pretty there. Misys also locked many of its customers into good service contracts in the good times; these are now helping it in the bad. That, and the financial services side contribute the bulk of profits, which makes the Countrywide purchases, with their recurring revenues, seem sound. Assuming, perhaps generously, pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m for the current year, earnings will be 25.2p per share giving a prospective multiple of 12.1, a marginal premium to the market average. A buy, but not without risk.</p>

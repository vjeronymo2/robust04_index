			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Armenian President Levon </F> Ter-Petrosyan by Annika Savill in London on 10 February]    [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concedes that neither  side in the six-year war over Nagorno-Karabakh -- the bloodiest  conflict in the former Soviet Union -- is prepared to compromise  at all to achieve a settlement. But, the Armenian leader added  yesterday on a visit to London, the only scenario which could  lead to an all-out war between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be  if the people of the enclave faced the threat of genocide.    Mr Ter-Petrosyan was told by John Major during his official  visit that Britain wanted to help end the war, in which more  than 15,000 people have died and more than a million have become  refugees. The enclave of 100,000 Christian Armenians inside  mainly Muslim Azerbaijan initially wanted to join neighbouring  Armenia, but it is now fighting for independence.    "The ideal would be a solution to satisfy the population of  Nagorno-Karabakh," Mr Ter-Petrosyan said. "Under this ideal  lies the principle of self-determination."    "In terms of reality, the only real solution could be one  based on compromise," he added. "If we are basing things on  today's psychology, neither the Armenians nor the Azeris are  prepared to give anything away. That is today's psychology and  both parties are not ready."    He said "any talk of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh only  makes it more difficult". The Conference on Security and  Co-operation in Europe, he noted, had accepted "this  methodology" in its mediation efforts. "The CSCE does not refer  at all to the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," he said, only to the  "first aim of a ceasefire and a withdrawal of occupying forces".    The President has enjoyed a statesman's treatment during his  four-day visit. He has been received in audience by the Queen,  held more than two hours of talks with the Prime Minister and  laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.    Mr Ter-Petrosyan was content with assurances from the  Foreign  Office that it had no knowledge of a reported scheme by British  businessmen to try to send mercenaries to Azerbaijan via  northern Cyprus. "We are satisfied with the answer, so  satisfied I did not raise it in my meeting with John Major," he  said.    A mixture of erudition and rugged charisma, Mr Ter-Petrosyan  chainsmokes red Rothmans for breakfast. Born in Aleppo, Syria,  49 years ago, he has a PhD in Armenian-Assyrian literature of  the 4th and 5th centuries. He understands but does not speak  English, except to say "May I smoke?" A founding member of the  Armenian Karabakh Committe in 1988 -- which saw the start of the  war -- he has been president since Armenia's independence in  1991.</p>

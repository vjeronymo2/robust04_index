			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JACKIE MASON ORDERED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT  </P> <P> Comedian Jackie Mason has been ordered to pay his former Florida girlfriend  $2,000 per month in child support, marking the end of a bitter three-year  paternity lawsuit.  </P> <P> A Florida court of appeals late Tuesday upheld the monthly paternity award  retroactive to the Dec. 15, 1985, birth of Ginger Reiter's daughter, Sheeba.  </P> <P> The court found that Mason, a comedian who starred in last year's television  series "Chicken Soup," could better pay for the child's support than Reiter,  37, who operates a singing telegram service.  </P></p>

This was reported by Palestinian  sources in Tunis. They said Sa'ib 'Urayqat traveled from  Jerusalem to Tunis to deliver the message. The PLO terms are as  follow:    -- Israel will disarm the settlers and permit international  presence in the territories.    -- Israel will stop expropriating Arab lands in the  territories and building new settlements.    -- Israel will restructure several settlements situated  close  to Palestinian population centers, such as Netzarim in the Gaza  Strip, Qiryat Arba', and two settlements in the Jericho area.  'Arafat suggests that the Netzarim residents should be  relocated to another settlement in southern Strip, and that  Palestinians should be allowed to purchase some of the evacuated  lands.</p>

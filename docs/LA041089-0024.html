			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley dismissed all private security companies  at the nation's two international airports after last week's seizure of an Air  Jamaica plane in Miami in a drug-smuggling case. Manley said that "a  combination of monumental corruption and negligence" allowed nearly two tons of  marijuana to be shipped on the state-owned airliner. An Air Jamaica cargo  supervisor and an unidentified suspect in Miami were arrested in connection  with the drug shipment. He also said Air Jamaica has dismissed all employees  involved in loading the plane.  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Observer: Yachting legend Nigel Burgess, drowned yesterday in the Vendee Globe solo round-the-world race, was a giant in the world of yacht brokerage. Although his private - and ultimately fatal - passion was racing single-handed sailboats, his business was the sale and management of vast motor-yachts worth millions. His company, Nigel Burgess Yachtbrokers, had sold the ship best-known as Trump Princess twice. The first time was for Adnan Kashoggi. When the Middle East's most visible Mr Fixit ran short of funds Burgess found a willing buyer in Donald Trump despite the property tycoon's avowed aversion to the sea. When Trump in turn found himself financially foundering, Burgess steered through a second sale to a Saudi buyer. Even more lucrative than the commission on the sales was that management of the vessel and its crew of 50-plus was handled by Nigel Burgess Yachtbrokers. His immense discretion about his business did not stop stories of his dealings from entertaining the industry. For instance, at the time Kashoggi's yacht was sold it bore the name of one of his daughters, Nabila - retention of which, under the Arab code, would have been an insult once the boat was out of the family. Trump eventually agreed to change the name to Trump Princess . . .for Dollars 1m off the Dollars 30m purchase price.</p>

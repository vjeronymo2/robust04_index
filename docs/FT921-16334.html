			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: To buy or not to buy FT-SE Index: 2,504.1 (+11.3) The equity market will be barely recognisable to fund managers returning to their desks on Monday after a prolonged Christmas holiday. Since they left, the market's gloom has evaporated and the Footsie has risen by some 150 points. The natural inclination, especially since the New Year seems to demand a rally, may be to indulge in a spot of panic buying. All the more so, since the year-end rise in equities has prevented the establishment of a precedent for gilts offering a higher overall annual return. Even at current levels, equities still look under-valued compared with gilts. Yet prices have been supported over the past couple of days of thin trading by short-covering in the futures market, which had largely abated by yesterday afternoon, and by the strength of Wall Street, which could still prove to be short-lived. Closer to home the risk remains that a sterling crisis could force the authorities to raise interest rates. Only slightly further down the road lie election jitters and the probability that some large industrial companies will cut their dividends when announcing results for 1991. The dilemma for the professional investor is whether to plunge in and ride out these storms in the anticipation of economic recovery during the second half of the year. The dangers of missing out on a New Year rally could be considerable, but so are the risks of buying in too early. Much depends on whether the market manages to sustain its present level as trading volume revives over the next few days. It will be a while yet before its direction becomes clear.</p>

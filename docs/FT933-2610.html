			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic news checks rally by US stocks Wall Street US STOCK markets failed to build on Wednesday's late rally yesterday, share prices ending flat to lower after subdued trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.80 off at 3,630.85. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 2.17 to 459.43, but the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.25 to 739.80. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 229.7m shares. Although share prices rebounded strongly on Wednesday afternoon as buyers moved into the market in the wake of heavy losses, there was no follow-through from that late rally yesterday, and prices softened from the opening. Sentiment was not helped by the day's economic news. Industrial production rose only 0.2 per cent in August, weekly jobless claims increased by 2,000, and the July trade deficit narrowed slightly as both export and import sales weakened. The data painted a picture of an economy still struggling to achieve anything more than very modest rates of growth. Stocks were not helped by the bond market, which posted fresh declines after an upbeat opening. Analysts said that investors continue to believe that the correction in both stock and bond markets is far from complete. Among individual sectors, the golds group was one of the few bright spots, thanks to a rebound in bullion prices. Newmont Mining rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 , Newmont Gold put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 1/4 and Battle Mountain Gold added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 8. Placer Dome, meanwhile, advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 1/8 in volume of 2m shares after the company estimated that 4.8m ounces of gold may lie within its 70 per cent-owned Venezuelan property. Drug shares were weaker as a group, with Schering-Plough slipping Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 , Merck Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Pfizer Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 and Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 . Shares in Wang Laboratories, the computer group currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, dropped Dollars  3/16 to Dollars  3/8 in heavy trading on reports that under its soon-to-be-announced financial restructuring the company's stock will be cancelled and replaced with warrants that give the shares a value near to zero. Showboat jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 after brokerage house Oppenheimer initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and forecast strong earnings for the next two years. SPX climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 on news that its Sealed Power Replacement unit is being acquired by Federal-Mogul for Dollars 150m in cash and bank debt. Canada TORONTO was higher in hectic trade as a rally by gold shares boosted the market. The TSE 300 index finished 20.2 ahead at 3,988.1 and advances led declines by 393 to 313 after volume of 86.6m shares valued at CDollars 604.2m. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices gained ground, led by the golds group, which added 4.2 per cent as the bullion price in New York climbed USDollars 5 to USDollars 352.75 an ounce.</p>

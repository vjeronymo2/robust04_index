			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Praise for Angola's democratic debut ANGOLIANS received praise from the west yesterday as they awaited the results of almost incident-free presidential and parliamentary elections, the country's democratic debut after three decades of civil war. Although partial preliminary results released by the National Electoral Commission gave the ruling MPLA and its President Jose Eduardo dos Santos an early lead, these were based on between 2 and 5 per cent of the vote in barely half of the country. Full results are not expected for another day or two. If the trend is confirmed, however, the key question will be whether the Unita former rebels of Mr Jonas Savimbi will accept the outcome. The European Community urged yesterday that all sides 'should now work together to rebuild Angola in a spirit of tolerance and reconciliation.' A statement from the British presidency committed the community and member states 'to give what help they can to the reconstruction of the country.' The people of Angola should 'take up their primary responsibility for ensuring stability in order to hold on to the democratic values so dearly won,' it went on. During polling on Tuesday and Wednesday, Unita leaders expressed cautious satisfaction with the way it was being conducted. But they had warned that they would regard the result as invalid unless all supporters of the movement who were registered to vote had the opportunity to do so. In one of the few outbreaks of violence, Unita supporters shot dead a guard to Mr Armindo Espirito Santo Viera, deputy interior minister. They also occupied houses near Mr Savimbi's residence, saying his life was in danger. Logistical problems meant ballot boxes and electoral material arrived late in some areas, but the national turnout was estimated yesterday at more than 80 per cent. Late returns and power cuts delayed counting. In the capital Luanda, an MPLA stronghold, with 5.3 per cent of the votes counted Mr Dos Santos had 73.7 per cent in the presidential race against 19.1 per cent for Mr Savimbi. In Benguela to the south, where Unita was strongest, based on 1.7 per cent of the vote counted Mr Savimbi was also trailing, with 42.1 per cent against 53.5 per cent for Mr Dos Santos.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Bank makes Japan's VRN debut FUJI Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 350m issue of subordinated perpetual variable-rate notes - the first Japanese bank to raise capital using a controversial variable-rate structure. The notes count as upper tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy guidelines. The move is expected to mark the start of a wave of subordinated perpetual debt issues by Japanese banks which are struggling to meet capital guidelines. The deal was arranged by Merrill Lynch, the only bank currently active in the VRN market. Variable-rate notes are priced to pay an initial margin over the London interbank offered rate and are re-marketed at auction every three months. If there are insufficient buyers, the margin widens to a fall-back rate. The VRN market collapsed in 1990, due to declining confidence in bank credit quality. Investors - including a number of UK companies whose treasuries had bought paper as money-market investments - were left holding paper at fall-back rates which no longer seemed attractive. Until yesterday's deal, only two VRNs had been launched so far this year. Most outstanding deals are still at their fall-back rates, although Merrill Lynch says the paper is liquid and actively traded. Dealers were sceptical about demand for the Fuji paper, which pays an initial margin of 0.85 point over Libor, with a fall-back rate during the first five years of 1 point. One trader suggested the deal would be viewed as a step-up floating-rate note, rather than a variable-rate note. Merrill declined to disclose the nature of placement (except that it was with genuine end-investors, excluding banks), but reported firm demand and predicted further such deals. Fuji Bank also launched a Dollars 150m issue of perpetual subordinated floating rate notes arranged by Fuji International. Placement of the paper, which also represents upper tier 2 capital, is believed to be with related companies, a pattern which has been followed by many Japanese bank capital issues.</p>

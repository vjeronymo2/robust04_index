			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Moslem  authorities in Gorazde have killed, tortured and in different  ways maltreated several hundreds of Bosnian Serbs, thus abusing  this U.N.-designated "safe area". About 12,000 Serbs lived in  this town before the outbreak of the civil war. Moslems did not  even spare the dead, because they demolished the Serb graveyard.  Moreover, they pulled down St. George's church built in the  13th century. The truth about Moslem crimes against Serbs  started coming out only after the Bosnian Serb army had reached  the outskirts of the town, having first crushed in a  counter-attack the Moslem offensive, mounted right from Gorazde,  the Belgrade dailies VECERNJE NOVOSTI and EKSPRES POLITIKA write  on Monday.    After the failure of the Moslem offensive waged in very  sight  of U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) members, the Moslem  authorities committed horrible atrocities against Serbs, and  then showed the massacred bodies of the dead to foreign  reporters claiming that they were victims of "Serb shells and  snipers." There is "a special job" in some parts of Gorazde  called "pushing the massacred bodies of dead Serbs" into the  river Drina, the Belgrade dailies write.    In the section of the town under control of notorious Moslem  fundamentalist Ferid Buljubasic, there is still some 400 Serbs.  In that section of the town, from which Moslems open mortar and  sniper fire violating a truce, there are prisoner camps for  Serbs. In the camp in the Vinarici settlement and  "printing-works" and "cement works" in Vitkovici near Gorazde,  hundreds of Serbs (men and women) have been tortured and killed,  the dailies write.    Moslems killed seven Serb soldiers captured in early August  1992, having tortured them first in the most brutal way. They  were kept in the Trnovrh prisoner camp overhanging the town.  One of the captured Serb soldiers, Rade Kacar, cut the agony of  being tortured and humiliated by hanging himself while the  bodies of the other six soldiers were thrown into the river  Drina which runs through Gorazde. In the Serb village of  Crkvice near Gorazde Moslems killed the entire population and  completely burned down the village.    Western media zealously reported about the U.S. relief  operation "Provide Promise", but was silent about NATO aircraft  supplying 15,000 Moslems troops in Gorazde with up-to-date  weapons over the past months, although Gorazde is a  U.N.-designated "safe area" and as such should have been  demilitarized as far back as last spring, the Belgrade dailies  say.    The Bosnian Serb army has come into possession of the  information that NATO aircraft have been dropping weapons and  ammunition to Moslems in Gorazde every night in recent months,  the dailies say.</p>

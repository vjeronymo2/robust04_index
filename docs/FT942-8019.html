			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: How to cut that car tax burden - Finance If you are paying more tax than last year because of your company car, there are ways of reducing the burden. Under the new car tax system introduced in April, employees pay tax on 35 per cent of the manufacturer's list price of the car when new, plus the price of any accessories and value added tax. (Drivers with personalised number plates can now heave a sigh of relief - the Inland Revenue recently confirmed that these do not qualify as accessories.) Buying a second-hand car will not help reduce the tax bill because you will still be taxed on its full retail price. However, if your company car is four or more years old at the end of the tax year, the list price will be reduced by one third. The age of the car is measured from the date it was first registered, so those registered before April 6, 1991 will qualify for the reduction in 1994-95. The tax burden can also be brought down for those who are able to increase their business mileage. Drivers covering 2,500 - 17,999 business miles will have a reduction of one-third on their assessment, while those covering more than 18,000 will receive a discount of two-thirds. So, if the car's list price (including VAT, accessories etc) is Pounds 18,000, you would be taxed on 35 per cent of this, that is, on Pounds 6,300. If you drive more than 18,000 miles, the tax charge would be on Pounds 2,100 and if the car is also more than four years old, the taxable amount would fall to Pounds 1,400. Another savings tactic is to drive a van. Maurice Parry Wingfield, tax partner at Touche Ross chartered accountant says: 'While driving a van will not be to everyone's taste, there are many kinds of 'van' to consider, including four-wheel drive pick-ups, which are often used by people as leisure vehicles.' If none of these ideas work, probably because your car is a perks car with business usage of under 2,500 miles, you may be considering opting for a salary increase instead of the car. The problem is of course that you will be taxed at your marginal rate on the increased salary. However, if you also need a car for your private use, the most tax efficient method might be to take a smaller salary increase, combined with an interest free loan from your employer to buy a car yourself. This is how it might work. If you were buying the car from your employer, you would have to buy it at 'market value' to avoid further tax. The loan benefit will not be taxed so long as you only borrow up to Pounds 5,000 and you do not have any other outstanding loans from your employer. Andrew Frape, tax partner at chartered accountant Wheawill &amp; Sudworth, reminds those running a private car that charging your employer business mileage is attractive. Under the Inland Revenue's Fixed Profit Car Scheme, the employer pays tax-free mileage allowances to employees for business miles they cover with their own car. As long as the amount paid does not exceed the set rates, under the scheme you will not be taxed on the cash received.</p>

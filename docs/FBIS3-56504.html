			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan security agencies will be reshuffled to  better respond to their new goals, having emerged since Armenia  acquired independence. These goals radically differ from those  pursued in the totalitarian period, according to a decree by  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, released here today.    The decree liquidates the so-called "operational services"  of  Armenia's State Office for National Security which were formerly  engaged in ideological control over the population. Their staff  will be paid salaries during next three months, after which  period they will either be fired or fill other positions in the  state office departments, according to results of professional  fitness tests. All security personnel are subject to these  tests, the decree says.    New guidelines for the State Office for National Security  will be developed, along with a new structure of the agency.    Under the decree, the main border-guard administration,  agencies in charge of guarding strategically important  enterprises, financial and medical departments of the state  security office, as well as its technical maintenance services  will keep functioning until the complete restructuring will take  place. Possibly, they will form the foundation for Armenia's  future security service.    David Shakhnazaryan, 39, who since March 1993 was an  ambassador at large under the Armenian president, has been  appointed an acting head of the State Office for National  Security. He is to replace Eduard Simonyants, who headed the  office since February 1993 and now will fill another post.</p>

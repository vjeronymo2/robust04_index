Stanic Should Remain Party Secretary"] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana/Zgornje Pirnice -- At a closed session on  Saturday [18 June], the caucus of the Slovene Christian  Democrats [SKD] discussed the situation in the party for several  hours and, with a special conclusion, opted in favor of the  party's consolidation and the majority principle in  decision-making, SKD press spokesman Valentin Hajdinjak told the  STA news agency after the meeting.    The party will assert the majority rule at all levels of  decision-making. In this way it will pursue a uniform political  policy that shall be determined through the will of majority,  the participants of the caucus -- which consists of party's  executive committee, its ministers and its deputies -- decided.  In cases where the party will not have a stance, the majority  opinion within the club of deputies shall prevail. They also  proposed to draw up the rules of procedure or regulations for  the better work of the club of deputies and the party and, thus,  fight the belief that the party is divided.    The participants of the caucus expressed disagreement with  the resignation of the party's secretary general, Edvard Stanic,  and urged him to withdraw his resignation. Stanic has taken  time for consideration and will announce his decision at the  session of the party council today.</p>

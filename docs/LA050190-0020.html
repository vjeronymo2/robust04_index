			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL URGES RUN-DOWN HOUSING BE RENOVATED  </P> <P> A City Council committee Monday recommended approval of a program designed to  help Los Angeles property owners renovate rather than demolish buildings that  have been taken over by drug dealers and gang members.  </P> <P> Under the program -- described as a marriage between an earlier plan proposed  by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Mayor Tom Bradley's "Operation Knockdown" --  the city would buy vacant, deteriorated buildings and turn the properties over  to nonprofit corporations. The corporations would repair the buildings and rent  or sell them to moderate- and low-income tenants.  </P> <P> Also under the program, homeowners who have been given an order to "repair or  demolish" would get more information on available city loans and other options  that could help them hang on to their property.  </P> <P> The plan must still be approved by the full City Council, which is expected to  review the matter within two weeks.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the program is to try to address unnecessary demolition and at  the same time reduce the blight of neighborhoods," said Michael Bodaken, the  mayor's housing coordinator.  </P> <P> Bodaken heads a task force formed by the mayor to review Operation Knockdown, a  program started in 1989 in which abandoned homes that had become havens for  drug dealers and gang members were demolished.  </P> <P> Operation Knockdown came under attack earlier this year after a Times article  revealed that more than 200 deteriorating, low-income homes had been demolished  in the city last year. Many of the buildings that were destroyed were not  occupied by drug dealers but were salvageable housing located in poor areas  with a shortages of housing, critics charged.  </P> <P> After the article, Yaroslavsky called for a moratorium on demolitions and later  proposed "Operation Rebuild" as an alternative.  </P> <P> "It's much cheaper to rehabilitate a house than to tear it down and start all  over," said Katharine Macdonald, spokeswoman for Yaroslavsky. "The goal is to  not deplete the available stock of affordable housing in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Under the proposed program, which was approved Monday by the Community  Redevelopment and Housing Committee, officials of the nonprofit corporations  will work with homeowners facing "repair or demolish" orders.  </P> <P> Most of the demolition last year was carried out by homeowners following city  orders, who simply did not know what else to do, Bodaken said.  </P> <P> "The city did not do a good job of informing them of their options," he said.  </P> <P> Bodaken said that through the program, which includes some elements of both  Operation Knockdown and Yaroslavsky's Operation Rebuild, "we bring together the  notion that you have to have enforcement and compassion."  </P> <P> The enforcement end of the program will be conducted in part by volunteers from  the County Bar Assn.  </P> <P> Those who are unwilling to work with the city will be targeted and located by  the volunteers.  </P> <P> "They will bring the people in to court, where will they will once again be  informed of the (assistance available). If that fails, we will ask for an  injunction asking them to repair," Bodaken said.  </P> <P> He said the city would first target people who live outside the area where the  property is located.  </P> <P> The six-month pilot program approved by the housing committee is expected to  cost $2.5 million, but the amount could be increased depending on the success  of the program, said a spokesman for Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who heads the  committee.  </P> <P> Funding would come through the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P></p>

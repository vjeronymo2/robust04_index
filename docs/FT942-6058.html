			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bank of Nova Scotia ahead Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-biggest bank, had second-quarter net profits of CDollars 187m (USDollars 135m) or 76 cents a share, excluding special charges, up from CDollars 172m or 71 cents a year earlier. Return on average assets was 0.66 per cent against 0.72 per cent, and on equity 13.5 per cent against 14.2 per cent. The bank took special after-tax charges of CDollars 305m relating to the purchase of Montreal Trust and the write-down of goodwill for another acquisition. First-half earnings were CDollars 384m, up 14 per cent, but after the charges were CDollars 79m, or 15 cents, against CDollars 337m, or CDollars 1.41, a year earlier. Total assets at April 30 were CDollars 127bn, up 27.5 per cent, largely due to the Montreal Trust acquisition and the impact of the lower Canadian dollar. Net interest income was little changed, but non-interest income rose 29 per cent, due to strong brokerage and investment banking revenues. Non-interest expenses rose 41.5 per cent with the addition of Montreal Trust's costs. The total loan-loss provision for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 567m. Non-performing loans were down to CDollars 2.08bn on April 30.</p>

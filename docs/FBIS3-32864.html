"We have made no contact with the terrorist leaders who are  free," Fujimori said, denying Lima newspaper reports stating the  government and Shining Path are holding meetings aimed at  initiating a dialogue.    During a news conference, the Peruvian president added: "We  have established contact via our intelligence services to  capture their leaders but not to establish communication, let  alone establish talks."    "The policy of my government is to capture the terrorists or  confront and annihilate them," said the Peruvian head of state.    Fujimori warned: "I will not allow terrorists to continue  perpetrating so many murders, and that is why we have adopted  adequate measures, some of them harsh but effective."    According to official figures, the Maoist organization has  caused the death of 25,000 Peruvians.

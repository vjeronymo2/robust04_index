			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Fujitsu and Samsung sign chip agreement FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday said it had signed a semiconductor cross-licence agreement with Samsung, a leading South Korean electronics company. It is the first broad cross-licensing agreement for semi-conductors between Japan and Korea to be publicly confirmed, and symbolises growing Japanese acceptance that the South Korean industry has come of age. The companies would not comment on details of the agreement. But a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese economic daily, said Samsung would pay Fujitsu about Y4bn (Pounds 17.4m) to compensate Fujitsu for use of its advanced technology. The newspaper said the agreement would run for five years and would cover technologies patented in Japan, the US and in Europe. The agreement is another step towards normalising business relations between the Japanese and South Korean semiconductor industries. Other such agreements between Japanese and South Korean companies are likely. The Japanese industry has been concerned about the impact of emerging South Korean producers on the market, and is an ironic mirror image of US industry concern over the expansion of the Japanese industry. Samsung's sales of 4 megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, in particular, have proved a headache for the Japanese industry since they have been priced below similar Japanese devices. The worldwide semiconductor industry has been depressed, and manufacturers are losing money on the 4M DRAM chips. The Fujitsu-Samsung agreement provides a legal framework for the companies to use each other's technologies and for payment of royalties.</p>

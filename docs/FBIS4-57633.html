			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 19  May.    Average fuel prices were increased 18.11 percent on 14 May.

(Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in  Portuguese 12 May 94 Economy and Business Section p B1)    Although the level of Brazilian exports went down during the  first three months of the year, it recovered in April and  totalled $3.6 billion. Compared to the same month last year,  this is a 20.8 percent increase. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO  in Portuguese 12 May 94 Section 2 p 3)    Brazilian exports to Argentina from January to March  totalled  $891.4 million, which represents 70.5 percent of the Brazilian  exports to Common Market of the South countries. Brazilian  exports to Paraguay decreased from 20.3 percent in 1993 to 17.2  percent this year and totalled $217.9 million. Similarly,  exports to Uruguay decreased from 15 percent to 12.3 percent  during the same period and totalled $154.8 million. (Sao Paulo  FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 12 May 94 Section 2 p 2)    Federal tax revenue in Sao Paulo in April totalled $2.32  billion. It was 32 percent higher than the amount collected  during the same month last year, and 11 percent higher than  March's $2.09 billion. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese  12 May 94 p 5)    The Brazilian stock market lost nearly $2.3 billion in March  and April as a result of the political and economic instability  in the country, as well as the increase in U.S. interest rates.  Stock market expert Eduardo Moraes said the losses also can be  attributed to the withdrawal of foreign investors from the stock  market because they were responsible for about 30 percent of the  financial operations in the field. Moraes added that stock  market investors were frustrated by the end of the  constitutional reform, the apparent failure of former Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential campaign, and  the privatization program's slow implementation. (Madrid EFE in  Spanish 1805 GMT 13 May 94)    Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal reported that as a result  of the government having to pay two salaries to public employees  in the same month, the budget had a 1.6 trillion real cruzeiros  deficit in April. The overall Treasury revenue in April totalled  5.058 trillion real cruzeiros and expenditures totalled 6.692  trillion. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 14 May  94 Business and Economy Section p B6)    According to Petrobras, Brazilian Petroleum Corporation,  national oil and liquid gas production in April totalled an  average 697,237 barrels per day, i.e., 17,604 more barrels per  day than in March. Petrobras said natural gas production  totalled 20.1 million cubic meters. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO  PAULO in Portuguese 17 May 94 Section 2 p 2)    The federal government granted 100 to 325 percent salary  bonuses to Planalto Palace military employees. Civilian  household chief Henrique Hargreaves said the increase seeks to  level the bonuses paid to the military with those for the other  public employees. Claudio Santana, director of the Federal  Public Employees Union-Federal District, believes it is one more  discriminatory act by the government.

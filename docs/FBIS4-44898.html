			<p>CSO     [Text] Can atoms and molecules be manipulated by human  hands to create revolutionary materials that have never existed  before? If so, the technology will spur dramatic progress of  science and technology to an immeasurable extent. In order to  develop such technology, MITI's project "Atom Technology" was  initiated on a full scale. For 10 years, starting in FY92, MITI  is expected to invest approximately &yen;25 billion into this  ambitious project, which is being pursued by a group of  brilliant minds from industry, academia, and government.    It may not be merely a dream to have some of the atom  technology implemented by the early 21st century.    Recently, we have seen rapid progress of technologies for  observing and controlling microregions that have shifted from  submicron to angstrom level. Already, research papers have been  published by IBM Corp., NTT Corp., and Hitachi, Ltd., to present  their achievements, e.g., letters were drawn by moving one atom  or molecule at a time with a scanning tunnel microscope.    This technology is called mechanical probe (technology of  pulling an atom or a molecule out and putting it back in). The  principle of this technology is as follows. The tip of an  ultra-fine needle (probe) is brought in contact with a  material's surface, and pulse currents are passed through the  needle to weaken the chemical bonds of the material through  optical excitation. Furthermore, heat is added to cleave atomic  bonds, and one atom is grabbed on the needle's tip. The atom is  moved by the needle wherever desired, and a reverse-polarity  electromagnetic pulse is applied to the needle to place the atom  in a specific hole.    Another recently developed technology permits one to pull  out  one atom from a material, by irradiating an electron beam, and  then attach the atom in a targeted site. However, these  technologies are no more than research tools, and further  technological revolution is necessary for exceeding the limits  of existing technologies to industrialize material synthesis  technology.    The aforementioned project of MITI aims at the development  of  next-generation common key technologies that are expected to  spur fantastic growth of various industries, including the  chemical, biotechnological, and electronic industries.  Therefore, the project plans to try to fuse various  technologies, such as the mechanical probe and laser  technologies, and to seek brand new technologies based on ideas  completely different from traditional ones.  <H5>  Fusion of All Possible Technologies </H5>   The MITI project consists of four major branches: (1)  solid-surface atom, molecule observation and manipulation  technology; (2) spatial atom aggregation observation and  manipulation technology; (3) organic molecule structure  observation and manipulation technology; and (4) atom, molecule  process theoretical technology.    The development objectives of the solid-surface atom,  molecule observation and manipulation technology are to  identify, observe and measure one atom or molecule on the  surface of a material under various conditions -- such as  ultra-high vacuum and high and low temperatures -- and to be  able to manipulate the atom or molecule. At the present level,  it is extremely difficult to observe atoms and molecules of  materials other than electrically conductive materials, whereas  the new project aims at technologies that can be used for any  type of material.    In addition, under the same section of the project,  technologies are to be developed to measure (in real time),  analyze, and control dynamic processes such as chemical  reaction, etching and surface growth on the surface of a solid.    Under the spatial atom aggregation observation and  manipulation technology, development targets are technologies to  observe live and control the formation, aggregation, discretion,  and reaction of atom aggregates in a three-dimensional space.  Also targeted are technologies to form self-organizing aggregate  structures made of targeted atomic aggregates by controlling  their movements and reactions and electron transfers among them  through the manipulation of a spatial electromagnetic field.  <H5>  Theory Clarification and Prediction, First of All </H5>   Under the organic molecule structure observation and  manipulation technology, technologies are to be developed to  identify organic molecules, such as biological molecules, and to  manipulate the chemical bond and electronic state at a specific  segment within the molecule.    Furthermore, these technologies will be used to acquire  basic  information for increasing the speed and the precision of  decoding the base sequence of DNA.    In order to develop these ultimate technologies, it is also  necessary to develop basic supporting technologies, such as  simulation technologies, for theoretically clarifying and  predicting the behavior and reaction phenomena of atoms and  molecules at a surface or an interface. Thus, the plan is also  to develop a new "theoretical experimental apparatus" by  combining computers and information processing software.    This project has been under way at the National Institute  for  Advanced Interdisciplinary Research (NAIR), which was newly  established by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology  in January 1993 at Tsukuba Research Center. The project R&amp;D  is  being carried out by researchers from national research  institutes, private corporations, and universities, all of whom  work under one roof in a concentrated, cooperative manner; yet  the participation of these researchers is quite flexible. A  supercomputer is soon to be installed at NAIR, and other  facilities and devices are being installed as scheduled.    In February 1993, a technical research association called  Angstrom Technology Research Organization was set up by 30  corporations, including those participating in the MITI project.  Those corporations include E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,  Inc.;  Texas Instruments Inc.; and Motorola Corp., in addition to  Japan's major electric makers -- Mitsubishi Material Co., Ltd.;  Kobe Steel, Ltd.; Nippon Steel Corp.; Ebara Manufacturing Co.,  Ltd.; and Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd.</p>

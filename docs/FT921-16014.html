			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals in price tumble PRECIOUS METALS prices tumbled yesterday as a wave of selling by fund managers started in Japan and was carried over to Europe and then New York. Platinum touched the lowest level for nearly seven years in New York, driven down by worries about the US economy and the continuing poor prospects for car sales. About half of the platinum produced is used in automotive anti-pollution catalysts. In London platinum closed at Dollars 330.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 6.25 from Friday's close. Sentiment was not helped by news at the weekend that a strike at Impala's Bakokeng mine in South Africa had ended. Gold crashed through the psychologically-important Dollars 350 an ounce level to close in London at Dollars 348.50, down by Dollars 3.65 from Friday's close and the lowest price since September. Meanwhile, silver lost 6.5 cents an ounce to close in London at Dollars 3.92. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'The Japanese came back from holiday and sold gold and platinum. That started the fall.' He suggested that silver would recover rapidly and help gold prices back up again. But gold might first retreat to about Dollars 345 an ounce. He pointed out that yesterday's fall in precious metals prices was 'paper driven' (or took place because of selling in the futures, not the physical, market) and therefore should be more easily reversed. Physical demand for gold remained good in the Far East where the approach of the Chinese New Year, traditionally a time of buoyant demand for gold, had seen the premium for tael bars in Hong Kong widen yesterday to Dollars 2 an ounce from Dollars 1 last week.</p>

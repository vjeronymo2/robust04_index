			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (1): New phase for a new town Recession has come as Telford and the county at large are beginning a process of profound economic change. After the rapid expansion of the 1980s, growth is slowing and unemployment is almost back to 1979 levels THE economic sun has dimmed over the county of Shropshire and its most striking point of growth, Telford. Not that there is catastrophe in the air; rather, that expectations fostered in the second half of the Thatcher decade are blighted both by the present recession and the likelihood of slower growth after it. Retrospectively, the years from 1985 to 1989 look like a brilliant summer for Telford, albeit rather duller for the rest of the county. During that period, as the national economy strained to expand, Telford grew. The new town, first conceived as an overspill for the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation, found its feet independently: as it turned out, there was not as much to spill over from the conurbation as had been envisaged 25 years ago. Companies arrived, not only from around the UK, but from overseas. The effect, in county terms, was startling. Of the industrial and warehousing land taken up in Shropshire during the 1980s, 82 per cent was in Telford. Job creation in Telford, part of the Wrekin district, overshadowed what was taking place in the rest of the county. 'During the last 10 years', the county council says in a new economic strategy document, 'Shropshire has experienced a massive cycle in unemployment with rates returning in 1989 to almost the same rate as in 1979. The continued reduction in unemployment in the county since 1985 appears to have bottomed out and is now on a rising trend.' Of all the counties in England, Shropshire evokes most strongly the notion of the rural idyll. But the dreamy quality of its landscape and the erroneous idea that it is somehow geographically remote from urban strain hide the harsh fact that, in the county at large, average earnings for male workers are the lowest in the West Midlands region and the second lowest of any county in the UK. Reduction of European Community farm subsidies and the ripple effects throughout the local economy of diminishing farm incomes, although not unique to Shropshire, are hurting badly. Agricultural and industrial recession come together in Shropshire. Telford has been buoyant and the announcements of new investment plans by various companies continue to filter through. But just as changes in national and European Community farming policy hurt the rural county, so the fall in demand for manufactured products hurt industrial Telford. The closures of J. P. Woods at Craven Arms and Dairy Crest at Ellesmere were the rural economy equivalents of the redundancies at the Telford manufacturing plants of MCG Lancepack, Tatung (UK), IHW Engineering and Birtley Building Products. Unemployment in the Telford and Bridgnorth travel-to-work area, under the national average at 5.4 per cent in January 1990, had crept up to 7.2 per cent, the national average, by February 1991. Between January 1990 and January 1991 the number of unfilled job vacancies fell by more than one-third. There are, then, jarring notes in the song of success which the Telford Development Corporation, which runs the new town, has become accustomed (with some justification) to chant. It was able to ride the economic expansion of the late 1980s, attract new companies and provide the new jobs because, during the lean years of the early 1980s, it had created the serviced land and readied the facilities. In a real sense, the Development Corporation had prepared the ground. New jobs in Shropshire largely went to Telford. However, Mr Robert Truslove, chief executive of the Shropshire Chamber of Industry and Commerce, suggests that 'there is a danger in an area like Shropshire of the creation of new jobs masking the difficulties that companies are experiencing'. There is the familiar litany of cashflow problems and interest rate difficulties. But, for Shropshire in general and Telford in particular, there is the hazard of inexperience. 'To survive a recession', Mr Truslove says, 'there are two things which are useful. One is to have survived one before and the second is to have a track record. 'A lot of the companies here are young, they were set up in the last 10 years, so a high proportion have never gone through a recession and don't have a track record.' Most of the new companies were set up in the second half of the 1980s and high interest rates have hit them hard. 'They borrowed at low rates. When they came to their second phase development they couldn't afford to fund it', notes Mr Truslove. It is a sign of the times that new business activity has slackened. In 1990-91, the number of companies in Shropshire withdrawing from value-added tax registration was greater than those registering. It is also a measure of the times that, as Mr Christopher Mackrell, commercial director of the Telford Development Corporation, acknowledges, the proportionate rate of growth in the new town is not as fast as in the past: some projects are being deferred. 'The level of enquiries in pure number terms is down on what it was last year', he says. The recession catches both Telford and the county at large at the start of a process of profound economic change. Clearly, rural Shropshire can no longer rely on farming and its spin-off industries to maintain an acceptable quality of life. The development of Telford is entering a new phase. 'Unemployment, the need for industrial/commercial land (and) falling relative 'real' wages dictate the need for positive action and an adequate supply of industrial and commercial land throughout the county if the economy of the area is not to worsen during the next 10 years', declares the county council. Moves are being taken to buttress the rural economy with industry, to encourage the growth of tourism and to wean the farming community away from excessive reliance on bulk products to those with a higher added value. It is a slow and painstaking task. For its part, Telford will soon be in the throes of organisational change. prise Zone, with its tax concessions, ends in 1993. The Telford Development Corporation, its work done in providing a momentum of growth, is being wound up and responsibility for the disposal of public assets passes to the Commission for New Towns (CNT). The work of luring new companies passes to the Telford Development Agency, to be established by Shropshire County Council, Wrekin District Council and the CNT. More important than organisational change, however, is the growth of a services sector. Such a sector has always existed as a support for local industry, but it is beginning to strike out on a life of its own as organisations as diverse as the Inland Revenue's computer headquarters, the Land Registry, TSB's training facilities and the Windsor Life Insurance headquarters set up in the town. The concomitant is an increase in pure office, as opposed to general commercial property development - Pegasus Court, Central Park, the Telford Business park, for example. Industrial development will undoubtedly continue, if more slowly than in the recent past. Mr Mackrell observes that 20 per cent of the available land in the West Midlands is in Telford. But the growth of a services sector is an indication of urban maturity. And maturity, by definition, implies steady rather than headlong growth. IN THIS SURVEY Investment: a total of 115 foreign companies have invested in Telford, creating 9,210 jobs and occupying 411,930 sq m of floor space Page 2 Labour: the shape of the labour force is changing in a way which puts a premium on training Page 3 Agriculture: with markets increasingly clogged and the level of EC subsidies declining, Shropshire's farmers are feeling the strain Page 4</p>

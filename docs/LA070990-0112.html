			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMERICANS SPEND LESS ON MEDICAL CARE  </P> <P> Despite spiraling health care costs, Americans are using a smaller chunk of  their income for out-of-pocket medical expenses than they were 30 years ago, a  team of government economists reports.  </P> <P> The bite is about the same as in 1972-73, said the Health Care Financing  Administration researchers.  </P> <P> The reason, says Katharine R. Levit, is that private insurance is providing  more benefits -- in large part because states are requiring more coverage --  and employers have been unsuccessful in shifting the costs of better coverage  to workers.  </P> <P> That's bound to change, she predicts, as consumers are pressured to carry a  larger share of the burden.  </P> <P> In 1988, spending from all sources for health care in the United States was  nearly $540 billion -- more than 11% of the gross national product that year,  Levit and two colleagues reported in an article published in the summer issue  of Health Affairs, a quarterly journal on health policy.  </P> <P> The figures tallied by Levit, Mark Freeland and Dan Waldo are the latest  comprehensive figures available, they said.  </P> <P> Of the total, $312 billion came from private sources -- including $113 billion  paid by consumers out of pocket and $175 billion paid by private insurance.  Federal, state and local governments contributed $228 billion.  </P> <P> National health expenditures have risen more than 11% annually over the last  three decades, and 10.4% from 1987 to 1988.  </P> <P> The 1988 spending amounted to $2,124 for every man, woman and child in the  United States.  </P> <P> Americans used about 5% of their after-tax income in 1988 on health care  expenses -- including their share of insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs  to meet deductibles and pay for medical care not covered by insurance.  </P> <P> This proportion is the same as in 1972-73 and lower than the 6.1% of after-tax  income used for health care expenses in 1960-61, the researchers reported.  </P></p>

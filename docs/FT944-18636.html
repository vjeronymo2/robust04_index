			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Italian monument Some 12,000 Italians waited for hours in pouring rain yesterday for a rare chance to visit the Quirinal Palace, the hill-top residence of popes, kings and - these days - presidents. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's daughter, Marianna, led the tours. The 16th century palace atop one of Rome's seven hills was only rarely open to the public, but now tours will be given for three hours every Sunday morning. The Quirinal has served as home to three popes, four kings and, since 1947, nine presidents who are head of state.</p>

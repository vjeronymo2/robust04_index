			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso yesterday  signed Resolution No. 118 allowing enterprises to issue bills,  copies, and credit cards in URV's (real value units). The bills  released by credit card enterprises may be issued in URV's. The  Finance Ministry has warned that "there can be no price  difference between the transactions made with credit cards and  those made with checks or in cash."    Under the previous legislation, enterprises had to issue  bills in real cruzeiros. "The resolution cancels the compulsory  use of real cruzeiros in this type of document. Enterprises may  use the URV, but they are not compelled to do so," Finance  Ministry Economic Policy Secretariat member Roberto Padovani  said.    State companies will not be allowed to collect utility rates  through installments in URV's. Bills for electric power, water,  telephone, stamps, mail services, and fuel purchases will  continue to be issued in cruzeiros.    The copies, bills, and cards issued in URV's, even if valid  for a period shorter than one month, will be paid in real  cruzeiros by the URV value of the day on which the obligation  comes due. Issuance in URV's will allow enterprises to exclude  inflationary expectations from their transactions in  installments.    Since no inflation is expected to grow in URV's, the most  that enterprises can do is include a small interest rate in the  sales in installments. It is as if it were the price in cash  plus the interest.    Receipts issued by enterprises will continue to be in real  cruzeiros. Merchandise prices will continue to be expressed in  real cruzeiros. The only thing that changed is the possibility  of including on a bill or copy the total value of the  transaction in URV's. The receipts giving rise to a bill must  be issued in real cruzeiros.  <H5>  Impasse </H5>   The lack of clear rules for the use of the URV made  retailers  and industrialists adopt opposing positions, while stores were  half paralyzed. The day before yesterday the larger Sao Paulo  supermarkets agreed on a deflation formula to orient the  introduction of the URV. The proposal by retailers, which was  formulated by Carrefour during a meeting that was also attended  by representatives of the Pao de Acucar, Se, Eldorado, Peralta,  and Tulha networks, is the following: Take the credit price set  by suppliers in February, remove the 48 percent financial cost,  and pay in 28 days, corrected by the URV.    With this formula, the March price list will have prices  that  will be 6 percent lower than the average of the last four-month  period of 1993.    Industry representatives who yesterday talked with FOLHA --  and who asked not to be identified -- said that the proposal was  "indecent." They argued that no one lends money for the  industrial sector to finance its operational capital in URV's.  According to their figures, the February financial cost  remained below 48 percent.    Up until yesterday, the industrial and the retail sectors  had  ruled out the possibility of a supply shortage. Yet FOLHA  learned that some products can be in short supply if  negotiations are not resumed at their normal rate as of next  week.    The decentralized stores of the Pao de Acucar network, which  have reduced stocks, have already been authorized to restock  from the deposits of the Brazilian Distribution Company, which  supplies products to centralized management stores. Other  supermarkets are making their purchases from wholesalers.    Carlos Eduardo Toro, of the Colgate-Palmolive company,  believes that negotiations in URV will become feasible as soon  as the government clarifies the taxation procedure.    "We already have a table for negotiating in URV's, but  without clear rules on how taxes will be collected the table  cannot be enforced," Toro said.</p>

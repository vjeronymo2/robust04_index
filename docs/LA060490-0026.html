			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: CELEBRITY AND CELESTIAL STARGAZING MAKE 'TOTAL RECALL' BASH  MEMORABLE  </P> <P> The Scene: Mega-bash Thursday night for "Total Recall," a Tri-Star release that  promises to be boffo at the box office. After a packed screening at the  Hollywood Pacific (where, outside, fans chanted, "Ah-nald! Ah-nald!" when  "Total Recall" star Schwarzenegger arrived), Columbia hosted a party at  Griffith Observatory, where guests were treated to laser shows, dancing,  psychics, tarot card and palm readers and a great view of L.A. from the roof.  Guests could gaze at the grid and privately hope that, someday, all that would  be theirs.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Ronny Cox, one of the film's co-stars, summed it up when he excitedly  said to a friend, "I think the buzz on this is good." While some seemed alarmed  by the film's screechy noise level, spurting blood and high body count, most  seemed sure it would bring in audiences -- even if they have to pay the new  inflated ticket price of $7.50 at some theaters.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Schwarzenegger, with his wife, Maria Shriver, and his mother,  Aurelia; director Paul Verhoeven, co-stars Michael Ironside, Rachel Ticotin and  Sharon Stone; plus Mimi Rogers, Grace Jones, Paul Michael Glaser, Debbie Allen,  Jack and Elaine LaLanne, Mr. T, Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Pat Riley, Tony  Danza, Pierce Brosnan, Wayne Gretzky and wife Janet Jones, Michael Nouri, Ivan  Reitman, Sandra Bernhard, Robert Davi, Lou Ferrigno, Julian Sands, Esai  Morales, Timothy and Barbara Leary, and Sondra Locke.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: Standouts in the mostly business-suited crowd included Mr. T's neon  graffiti-printed shorts and jacket accessorized with his usual colossal  collection of gold chains; Grace Jones' slinky grape-colored dress and  painted-on eyebrows; Debbie Allen's hot-pink satin pouf jacket; Jack LaLanne's  red and black pin-striped suit; Wayne Gretzky's stubble, and Mimi Rogers'  tailored jacket over low-cut T-shirt.  </P> <P> Chow: Along Came Mary fed the hungry troops buffet-style, with mini-hamburgers,  onion rings, pizza, scallop skewers, baby racks of lamb, and sundaes, cookies  and brownies.  </P> <P> Quoted: Who is Schwarzenegger's toughest critic? His mother, of course. But not  to worry -- "She loved it," he said. "I always ask her what she thinks. She  thought the action was great, all the futuristic things."  </P> <P> Overheard: "I knew I needed earplugs for the Roxy, but I didn't think I'd need  to bring them to a movie," said one woman whose ears were still ringing an hour  after the movie had ended.  </P> <P> A Movie by Any Other Name . . .: One industry wag has already re-dubbed the  film, "Like, I Recall -- Totally!"  </P> <P> OK, but Is There Going to Be a Total Recall II?: Not directed by Verhoeven, it  seems. "I don't think I could do this again," he admitted. "I'd get kind of  bored, probably."  </P></p>

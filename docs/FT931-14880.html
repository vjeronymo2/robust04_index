			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: SBC in SFr122m bid for Hypobank SWISS BANK Corporation (SBC) is making an agreed share exchange bid for Hypothekar-und Handelsbank Winterthur (Hypobank), a quoted regional bank based in Winterthur, worth about SFr122m (Dollars 85.3m). The bid, the latest in a series of takeovers in the overcrowded Swiss banking sector, reflects the growing pressure on small banks dependent on depressed domestic commercial and property business. Last week, in the biggest acquisition to date, CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, launched an agreed share exchange worth SFr1.5bn for Swiss Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth-largest bank. SBC, the second-largest bank, said then it did not seek to expand its domestic retail presence massively and so had not made a bid for Volksbank. But it would consider opportunities in regions where it was weak. This, it said yesterday, was the case in north-east Switzerland, where Hypobank was active. Hypobank, in which Winterthur Insurance has a 77 per cent stake, has assets of SFr1.53bn and, at end-1991, reported net equity of SFr107m. Profits plunged in 1991 to SFr100,000 from SFr6m, and SBC said yesterday it made a small profit last year. Final terms of the offer to all shareholders are to be set by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, but SBC expects it to be at the rate of three of its bearer shares for each of the 125,000 Hypobank bearer shares. SBC bearer shares closed yesterday up SFr1 to SFr326.</p>

Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and  fisheries,  said that though the policy of the ministry's Food Agency is to  use only Japanese rice for school meals, schools will be  supplied with foreign rice if the principals agree to it.    He made the remark to the committee on agriculture, forestry  an fisheries of the House of Councillors.    The Food Agency has announced that only domestic rice should  be used for school meals, but some educators have proposed that  use of imported rice would be of educational as well as  nutritional value to school children by giving them a direct  experience related to the current rice controversy.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK HAS GRETZKY, KINGS ON THIN ICE;  </P> <P> NHL PLAYOFFS: THE GREAT ONE WON'T KNOW UNTIL JUST BEFORE GAME 3 TONIGHT AT  FORUM IF HE CAN FACE FLAMES.  </P> <P> Today is Game 3 of the playoffs for the Kings.  </P> <P> And Day 18 of the Wayne Gretzky Crisis.  </P> <P> The big question is, which will end first?  </P> <P> Once again, anticipation has turned into anxiety, recovery into reassessment.  </P> <P> The latest word on Gretzky's ailing back: No word.  </P> <P> The decision on his long-awaited return to the ice, expected Saturday, has been  delayed again until 5 p.m. today.  </P> <P> Gretzky will drive to the Forum for tonight's third game between the Kings and  Calgary Flames in their best-of- seven, first-round playoff series, which is  tied, 1-1.  </P> <P> After yet another consultation with team physician Steve Lombardo, it will be  decided whether Gretzky will:  </P> <P> a) Be a spectator.  </P> <P> b) Be a specialty performer, appearing only on the power-play unit.  </P> <P> c) Return all the way and take his full shift on the ice.  </P> <P> Don't bet on the last.  </P> <P> Certainly not off Gretzky's comments at the team's Culver City practice rink  Saturday after the greatest scorer in NHL history practiced with his teammates  for the first time since suffering a hyperextension of the back March 22.  </P> <P> Friday, Gretzky went on the ice for the first time since the injury, skating  for about 20 minutes while the Kings were in Calgary.  </P> <P> Saturday, Gretzky lasted about the same amount of time, skating cautiously,  shooting tentatively.  </P> <P> Tentative would also best describe his outlook afterward.  </P> <P> "I really don't know when I'll play," he said. "I've gotten up some days and  not felt bad. And some days, I've felt like I'm done for a couple of weeks.  </P> <P> "What I really need is time. We're doing the best we can and moving as fast as  we can, but we may not have the time. I hope the hours go by slowly and that I  heal quickly."  </P> <P> That hasn't happened.  </P> <P> It has been a deceptive injury from the start. Gretzky was hit from behind by  the New York Islanders' Alan Kerr. The blow shoved Gretzky into Ken  Baumgartner, creating a whiplash effect.  </P> <P> King Coach Tom Webster didn't see the hit from his spot on the bench. No one  except Gretzky realized the severity of it at first.  </P> <P> He thought he had a broken back. But, although he was hit in the first minute  of the game, Gretzky finished the period, hoping he could skate through it.  </P> <P> When he couldn't, he asked out after the period.  </P> <P> Gretzky began to experience back spasms. Days turned into weeks, the regular  season into the playoffs and still no Gretzky.  </P> <P> Optimism began to run high for a return today after he missed the first two  playoff games of his 11-year career. The spasms were gone and he was skating  again.  </P> <P> But other problems remain.  </P> <P> "I have no strength in my back," he explained, "no power to push off, to twist.  I have no flexibility.  </P> <P> "If I play and I am more of a hinderance, that would be no help."  </P> <P> There's another dire possibility as well.  </P> <P> "If I take one hit," he said, "I could be done for a couple of weeks. That  doesn't make a lot of sense."  </P> <P> What does make more sense, perhaps bringing Gretzky back too soon and risking  further injury, or trying to play the defending Stanley Cup champions without  him?  </P> <P> Decided underdogs after finishing fourth behind Calgary in the Smythe Division,  the Kings proved they are more than a one-man team by winning Game 1 in the  Olympic Saddledome.  </P> <P> "It would be great to get a player like him back," defenseman Larry Robinson  said, "but, at the same time, it can be detrimental if they're not 100%.  Calgary is too good to have somebody out there who can't go full out. But with  a talent like that, it's pretty tough to leave him on the side."  </P> <P> Although he has mentioned using Gretzky only on the power play in his first  game back, Webster wasn't talking that Saturday.  </P> <P> "No way is he going to play unless he can make a contribution," Webster said.  "If he dresses, we want to make sure he plays. And not in just one specific  role."  </P> <P> That's fine with Gretzky.  </P> <P> "If I come back to play," he said, "I want to play. It's in my blood. But, it's  up to him (Webster)."  </P> <P> It's obvious in Gretzky's face that the pain in his back is matched by pain in  his heart.  </P> <P> "This is the time to play," he said. "This is what it's about. I've lifted the  (Stanley) Cup four times and it's the greatest feeling in the world."  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Faceoff tonight is at 7:30. Game 4 will be at the Forum on Tuesday, as will  Game 6, if necessary, on Saturday. . . . While Wayne Gretzky's prognosis is  guarded, the outlook is clearer for defenseman Tom Laidlaw, also out with a  back injury. Laidlaw skated Saturday for the third straight day and hopes to  play in Game 4.  </P></p>

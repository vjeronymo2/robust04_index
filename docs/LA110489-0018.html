			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S HUNTING SEASON IN WESTWOOD AS FANS GO AFTER THE BRUINS  </P> <P> Once upon a time, UCLA had a good football team. They won three of four Rose  Bowls, and seven straight bowl games.  </P> <P> And with that success, Terry Donahue had the golden opportunity to recruit the  nation's top players for future Bruin greatness. Today, those recruits are  starting. I don't think Donahue knows what he's doing. He recruited five of the  nation's top running backs. Please tell me what you need with five running  backs? How about recruiting just one or two, and maybe some linemen to block  for them!  </P> <P> Call me crazy, but I thought only one player at a time could carry the  football.  </P> <P> GARY FENTON, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

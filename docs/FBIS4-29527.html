			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku said on Monday his government intends to materialize the  proposed South-North summit meeting at an early date through  speedy preliminary talks. "We will try to have working-level  preparatory talks in a way that won't be bound by agenda  topics," Yi said.    Testifying before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and  Unification Committee, Yi said that in the past, many proposed  high-level inter-Korean talks failed to take place due to  haggling over agenda topics. He said the South cannot disregard  the North's nuclear past, adding, "This stand of ours was  explained to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and our  understanding is that Mr. Carter duly conveyed it to the North  Koreans during his recent visit to Pyongyang."    Yi who is also National Unification minister observed that a  third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level meeting could take place  earlier than expected if the Carter-Kim Il-song agreement could  be made a governmental agreement between the two countries.    On the issue of supporting the North's construction of  light-water reactors, Yi said the South can agree to such  support only after North Korea made clear a plan to give up  their nuclear development. The construction of two  900,000kw-class light-water reactors North Korea wishes to have  would cost about 3.6 to 4 billion dollars, Yi said.</p>

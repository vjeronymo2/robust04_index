			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hatfield loses its heart THE SPEED and detail of the local reaction yesterday to the BAe announcement that it intended to close its Hatfield factory by the end of next year showed the decision was not unexpected. But it still came as a numbing blow to the local workforce. Specific plans for alleviating the difficulties of the 2,300 to be made redundant and for bringing new jobs to the area were announced by local authorities and the Hertfordshire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) virtually immediately. However, there was no attempt to hide the scale of the problems the local economy will now face. 'It's impossible to exaggerate the impact locally and the size of the disaster for Hatfield,' said Mr David Riddell, chief executive of Welwyn Hatfield Council. The workforce clocking on for the afternoon shift agreed. Mr Bob Cartwright, a machinist at the factory for 10 years, said the news had not been unexpected because of the steady reduction in the workforce in recent years, and the worldwide problems facing the aerospace industry. 'But it still comes as a very nasty shock. Nearly everyone you know around here works for BAe. Something like this touches every family,' He said. He expects a redundancy pay-off of around Pounds 7,000 and does not want to move away from the area. A problem he shares with many others is the fall in the value of his house - by at least Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 65,000 - which reduces his job mobility. According to the local TEC, which is putting up around Pounds 500,000 of the money targetted to alleviate the growing unemployment problems, 85 per cent of those redundant are men and over 1,000 are skilled technicians. About 40 per cent of the workforce lives in Welwyn and Hatfield, and a further 40 per cent in the rest of Hertfordshire. The problem is that Hatfield is already a jobless blackspot, with an average unemployment level of 9 per cent, and with 17.5 per cent out of work in some areas. British Aerospace suppliers in Hertfordshire are set to lose around Pounds 15m worth of orders a year. But the cumulative impact on the local economy is likely to be twice as high. It is Hatfield's pride as well as its pocket that is hurt, though. The town has an unrivalled place in British aviation history having built many famous aircraft, including the wartime Mosquito fighter-bomber, the de Havilland Comet airliner and, more recently, the Trident, the 125 executive jet and the 146 regional jetliner. There were 7,500 employed at the Hatfield factory until the mid-1980s but since then the rundown has been steady. In 1989, the weapons' operation was closed and, as the recession cut deeply into the world aviation market, the company was forced to reduce production costs to remain competitive. There was very little criticism locally of the company. Its closure decision was seen as the inevitable result of market forces and the fall in demand for commercial aircraft. 'No blame attaches to BAe. We understand the pressures they have had to face and the efforts they have made to keep the factory open,' said Mr Riddell.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Computer facilities HOSKYNS GROUP, a supplier of computer services, has reached an agreement with the Bank of England for the provision of facilities management of the Bank's central computer system. The contract will be worth around Pounds 6m over the next three years. The Bank of England has made a strategic decision to adopt a more decentralised approach to its future computing requirements. As a result of this decision, the Bank's mainframe equipment and associated skilled computing staff will not be required when these new systems come on stream progressively over the next three years. The Bank has decided to appoint Hoskyns to run its mainframe computer oper ations during the transitional period.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Construction is smoothly proceeding on a centrifugal  separation machine assembly facility being built by the Uranium  Enrichment Machinery Company (Head office, Tokyo, President  Shigemi Sugino) in Rokkasho-mura in Aomori Prefecture.    This company has a centrifugal separation machine parts  fabrication and assembly plant in Sendai City in Miyagi  Prefecture, however, operations at the uranium enrichment  facility by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. has begun, and future  expansion work is continuing in earnest. Because of this, and  also because of a desire to increase the centrifugal separator  transport efficiency, ensure product quality, and at the urging  of the prefecture where the facility is located, the company  decided to construct the final assembly processing plant at the  Rokkasho-mura factory, within the Ogawara development zone which  is adjacent to the enrichment plant, and transfer this function  from the Sendai facility.    As for the size of the facility, the area of the lot is  around 40,000 square meters and the area of the construction  site is approximately 4,000 square meters. The construction is  scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, and  construction completion ceremonies are slated for January 1994.  The commencement of assembly operations is planned to start  around the end of this fiscal year [the end of March 1994], and  they will perform assembly operations starting at a rate of 150  ton SWU/year of centrifugal separator for FY94. They plan, at  first, to employ 20-30 people at this facility.    The Uranium Enrichment Machinery Company was established  with  &yen;3 billion, &yen;1 billion each coming from Hitachi,  Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This company, which  was established in December 1984, is Japan's only uranium  enrichment centrifugal separation machinery manufacturer.  Currently, they employ around 300 people.</p>

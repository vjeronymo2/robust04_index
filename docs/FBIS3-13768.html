			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "AL-WAFD's View" column: "Who Dares to Object?"] </F>   [Text] We have so far not heard a single Arab capital or  leader criticizing the irresponsible remarks of U.S. President  Bill Clinton, remarks that Jerusalem is the eternal united  capital of Israel.    We have not heard the Jerusalem Committee, which is made up  of Arab kings and presidents, breaking its silence to submit an  oral or written protest telling that person sitting in the White  House that Jerusalem was Arab before he was born and that it  will be Arab eternally.    The Arab League, which speaks on behalf of the Arabs, has  not  called an emergency meeting to discuss this serious shift, which  threatens Arab rights to Jerusalem.    Not a single foreign ministry throughout the Arab world has  issued a statement, not even a one-page statement, saying that  the Arabs reject the provocative U.S. statements and demanding  an explanation, if not an apology.    Do these remarks mean that the United States has  unilaterally  decided to change the bases on which the Madrid peace process  was founded?    What kind of talks are these if everything is being  determined away from the negotiating table and without involving  the negotiators? Can America put on priestly robes and claim to  be honest and neutral after this?    With the new Balfour Declaration he just made, Clinton has  stooped to the level of blatant bias toward Israel at the  expense of Arab rights. We do not dismiss the possibility that  he might come out on us one ill-omened morning to announce the  movement of the American Embassy to Jerusalem.    O Arabs, wake up and stand up as one man so that we do not  lose Jerusalem forever.</p>

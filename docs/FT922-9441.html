			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Marlene Dietrich - Obituary The voice was a mellifluous foghorn. The languorous eyelids hung at half mast while the eyebrows were an elevated fantasy in mascara. And the well-lit cheekbones were rocks towards which infatuated men sailed knowingly to their destruction. Marlene Dietrich, who died yesterday in Paris, was the cinema's most exotic creation. Whether dressed for kitsch in her films with director Josef Von Sternberg or slumming it in low-budget Westerns and thrillers, she seemed a creature entirely composed of artifice. She was happy that we should see her that way. Dietrich claimed there was no connection between her public image and her well-guarded private life. Different versions of that life battled it out in the biographies. Was she born in Berlin on December 27 1901, as most books say? Yes - though she herself preferred later dates. Was The Blue Angel (1930) her first film, as she often insisted? No - it was merely her first film with Josef Von Sternberg. Before the icy master with the megaphone came on the scene, Dietrich had appeared in some 18 films in her native Germany. And as a little-known European actress she had even co-starred with another little-known European actress, Greta Garbo, in GW Pabst's 1925 Joyless Street. The Blue Angel made her world-famous: though the Dietrich she was to become later under Sternberg - haughty, mysterious, swathed in soft-focus - was a far cry from the piping cabaret vamp who sings 'Falling in love again' while doing strange things with her legs on a chair. Dietrich went to Hollywood in 1930, leaving her husband and daughter behind in Germany. An off-screen romance began between her and Sternberg, while on-screen they continued their partnership with six majestic films. The sublime and the ridiculous lie down happily together in movie romances like Morocco (1930), Dishonored (1931) and Shanghai Express (1932). And in the Sternberg-Dietrich masterpiece The Scarlet Empress (1934) Dietrich's beauty becomes merely one part, albeit the most plastic and haunting, of an astonishing fresco of scenic effects and design inspirations. The Sternberg-Dietrich films may be kitsch (her own favourite word of dismissal), but they have their own passion and conviction. Away from Sternberg, Dietrich never found the same creative spark, in either herself or her directors. She seems miscast or undercast in films like Destry Rides Again (1939), Manpower (1941), A Foreign Affair (1948) and Stage Fright (1950). And she seems worse than miscast - wheeled on as if to parody herself - in Hollywod's vain attempts to recreate the Sternbergian magic with other directors: Richard Boleslawsky's The Garden Of Allah (1936) or Mitchell Leisen's Golden Earrings (1947). In later years Dietrich's legend transferred itself effectively to the stage in her one-woman concerts. But in Hollywood after her heyday she came to be used as little more than a flavour-enhancer. Glorified cameo roles in films like Welles's Touch Of Evil (1958), Wilder's Witness For The Prosecution (1957) and Kramer's Judgment At Nuremberg (1961) showed that Dietrich, even if she could not exactly act, could smoulder interestingly. More: she could suggest better than anyone a whole non-Californian world of casbahs, cabarets and smoky enigma. Unlike Garbo, Dietrich retired reluctantly from the screen and even returned for an ill-judged guest role in Just A Gigolo (1978). Equally ill-judged, perhaps, was her cantankerous voice-only participation in Maximilan Schell's feature documentary Marlene (1985). Her bullying of interviewer-director Schell leaves a harsh aftertaste. But there is no denying the spell of that husky voice; nor, as we watch the vintage film clips, the power that those chiselled, shining, iconic features still have today.</p>

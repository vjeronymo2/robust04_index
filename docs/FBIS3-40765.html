			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Seyyed Hasan Ruhollah 'Alami, a member of </F> Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami's central committee, by Jihad Salman;  place and date not given]    [Text] Seyyed Hasan Ruhollah 'Alami, a member of the  central committee of Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity  Party] in Afghanistan, visited Lebanon recently as an envoy of  his party. AL-'AHD met with him shortly before he left to return  to Afghanistan and spoke with him about key issues in  Afghanistan.    [Salman] Can you apprise us of the political climate in  Afghanistan since the departure of communist rule?    ['Alami] Let me first salute the souls of the martyrs of  truth, the martyrs of Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the martyrs  of the Islamic world.    After the overthrow of Najibollah's rule and control over  Kabul, the mojahedin groups met in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is  considered the center of gravity of the mojahedin because of the  many Afghan political groups there.    Everyone agreed that Sebghatollah Mojaddedi [faction leader  of Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli--the National Liberation Front] would  be the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for one  month and that Borhanoddin Rabbani would assume the presidency  after him for four months, during which Mr. Rabbani was to  prepare the climate for general elections, so that the people  could voice their opinion regarding who was to be entrusted with  the political program that would determine Afghanistan's future.  However, Mr. Rabbani unfortunately did not implement the plan  under which he assumed the presidency for an interim period.  Instead, he formed a consultative council of influential people,  comprising his followers and members of this entourage. And he  did so without at least consulting with the mojahedin movements  or parties.    That complicated problems and deepened disagreements,  ultimately resulting in battles erupting between the Afghan  political parties. These parties became divided into two groups.  One group, loyal to Rabbani, comprises Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic  Society], Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] led by 'Abdol Rasul  Sayyaf, and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party]--Yunes Khales faction.  The latter two are Wahhabi groups.    The other group includes most of the Afghan opposition  parties, headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Hezb-e  Eslami--Hekmatyar faction under Golboddin Hekmatyar.    At this point, the Islamic republics in Iran and Pakistan  thankfully sent delegations to resolve the problem. They were  able to obtain the consent of all of the parties to hold  negotiations in Islamabad, Pakistan.    The Islamabad negotiations produced an agreement between all  of the political parties in Afghanistan. The agreement  stipulated that Rabbani remain president of the country and that  Hekmatyar be appointed prime minister.    The agreement was signed in Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi  Arabia,  each of whom signed official texts of the agreement.    Mr. Rabbani was obligated to set a date for elections after  preparing the atmosphere, and the people were supposed to elect  representatives in complete freedom to form a state based on  these elections.    However, the regime's consultative [council], under the  leadership of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, Jami'at-e Eslami's military  commander, and 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, the faction leader of  Ettehad-e Eslami, did not implement this agreement. They voided  it. The war erupted anew, preventing the government from  performing its functions in the central capital of Kabul.    [Salman] What are the domestic and regional political  circumstances that produced the Islamabad Agreement?    ['Alami] As I have said, Mr. Rabbani, who was appointed to  be  president for an interim period after Mojaddedi's presidency  tenure ended, was not committed to readying an appropriate  climate for elections. He formed an interim parliament  representing his interests and was able to ensure his  reappointment as president of the country for two years. This is  what most of the other mojahedin movements--such as Hezb-e  Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami  [National Islamic Movement], Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli, Harekat-e  Eslami, and others--objected to. They considered it illegal.  Battles erupted in Kabul. Then, delegations arrived from  Pakistan and Iran as reconciliation committees. Immediately  after the mediations succeeded, former Pakistani Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif called for negotiations in Islamabad. Those  negotiations led to the Islamabad agreement, which was signed by  all of the mojahedin movements in Afghanistan and by the sponsor  countries, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.    Despite the agreement's deficiencies and unfair treatment of  Hezb-e Wahdat-e Melli [National Unity Party] and many other  parties, we signed it to achieve a reconciliation in Afghanistan.    Regarding the regional factors, it is well known that the  efforts of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in  Pakistan, despite the difficulty of bringing all of the parties  together for talks, opened the door to the Islamabad agreement.    [Salman] It is said that the Islamabad agreement is a  minimalist agreement. What are Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami's  observations regarding the agreement?    ['Alami] In the matter of the Islamabad agreement, the  Pakistanis dealt with the Afghan political reality based on two  factions, one headed by Hekmatyar and the other by Rabbani.  Regarding this division, we noted that the problem concerns the  Afghan people and its representatives in the mojahedin  movements, not individuals. Also, what was agreed upon was not  honored. Furthermore, the stature and presence of other  movements and parties--such as Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and  Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami, which enjoy a strong political,  popular, and military position--were disregarded and not taken  into account. We agreed to sign, despite this lack of fairness,  out of our commitment to our people's interest and the country's  supreme interests.    Then, this agreement was an interim agreement. Its duration  is coming to an end without the climate having been prepared for  elections, as the agreement stipulates.    [Salman] Could you address the obstacles blocking the  Constitution Writing Committee that was to be formed under the  Islamabad agreement?    ['Alami] If elections had been held as agreed in Islamabad,  the people would have formed a committee to write a  constitution. However, this did not happen. In this regard, Mr.  Rabbani, as the person directly responsible for holding  elections, should be asked about the reason for the delay.    [Salman] You said that the agreement is an interim agreement  whose end has approached. What is the solution in your opinion?    ['Alami] Officials of the parties should meet to arrive at a  solution agreed to by everyone, determine the destiny of the  people and the country, and stop the bleeding. Hezb-e Wahdat-e  Eslami--through its secretary general, Sheykh 'Abdol 'Ali  Mazari--has recommended that both Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar  resign, and that general presidential and parliamentary  elections be held.    [Salman] If this recommendation is not implemented, can the  present government, as a government of national unity, be a  forum for dialogue that can produce something new for the future?    ['Alami] This is possible, because Mr. Hekmatyar and the  members of the government meet periodically at Darolaman Palace  (the center of the government), from which President Rabbani is  absent for reasons unknown.    [Salman] Do Mr. Rabbani's authorities empower him to  intervene to block a political measure undertaken by the  government regarding a conciliation?    ['Alami] The Jalalabad agreements give authorities to Mr.  Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar. However, due to a lack of cooperation  on the part of the president of the republic, there was no  opportunity to exercise these authorities.    [Salman] In other words, the authorities given to Mr.  Hekmatyar remain inactive.    ['Alami] This is because the Jalalabad agreements were not  implemented. They laid the foundation for a practical program to  implement the Islamabad agreement.    Naturally, Mr. Hekmatyar has not exercised the authorities  granted him in the agreements, because the agreements were not  implemented, because Mr. Rabbani is blocking them.    It is only natural that political alliances in Kabul with or  against Mr. Hekmatyar will affect the exercise of his  authorities.    [Salman] Does that mean that political alliances play a role  in impeding implementation of the agreements?    ['Alami] Somewhat.    [Salman] Do the new ethnic alliances play a negative or  positive role in this respect?    ['Alami] They have a positive effect in pressing for  implementation of the agreement. The ethnic alliance facing Mr.  Rabbani comprises more than 70 percent of the Afghan people. Mr.  Rabbani cannot rely on this element, which was supportive of  change in the past. Perhaps his evasion of implementing the  agreements and of holding elections is related to the weakness  of his alliances.    [Salman] Does that mean that ethnic balances have resulted  in  the separation of northern Afghanistan?    ['Alami] I find that farfetched, because Mr. Rabbani rejects  this matter.    [Salman] In view of all of these givens, in your opinion,  what is the most appropriate solution for Afghanistan's  political problem?    ['Alami] The only solution is for all the parties to sit  down  at the negotiating table.    [Salman] It is said that Jami'at-e Eslami, under Rabbani's  leadership, fears an alliance between Hezb-e Eslami and Hezb-e  Wahdat-e Eslami, and it feels that it would be excluded from the  game. What guarantees would you and your allies offer if all of  the parties sit down at the negotiating table?    ['Alami] All guarantees are possible. Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami  and Hezb-e Eslami are ready to discuss anything, provided that  foreign powers bent on destroying the Islamic jihad in  Afghanistan and on discrediting the victory it achieved after  the termination of communist rule do not interfere.    [Salman] Is Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami preparing an initiative  or  some mediation in this regard?    ['Alami] There are initiatives. Jami'at-e Eslami is well  aware of this. A number of meetings were held between Hezb-e  Wahdat-e Eslami and Jami'at-e Eslami. Then, a central delegation  headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami Secretary General Sheykh 'Abdol  'Ali Mazari met with Rabbani and Sayyaf.    [Salman] What about Jami'at-e Eslami and Hezb-e Eslami?    ['Alami] The relationship between Hezb-e Eslami and  Jami'at-e  Eslami requires greater trust and better intentions on the part  of both parties. I think that the failure to implement the  Jalalabad agreements provides an opportunity for the two to sit  at the dialogue table. Otherwise, problems are possible.    [Salman] In conclusion, we thank you. Do you have a final  remark?    ['Alami] I thank AL-'AHD. I wish, through it, to give a  salute of respect to the mojahedin of the Islamic resistance in  Lebanon and the intifadah in Palestine, because they are proving  and confirming God's sublime utterance, "And [they are] never  afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault" [Koran 5:57], by  standing on the front line in the confrontation with American  and Zionist arrogance and fulfilling their divine mission with  the utmost pride and honor. We entreat God to grant them victory  and show them the right way to the victory of his religion.</p>

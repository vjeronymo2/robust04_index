			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (4): Consolidating operations - Insurers aim to exploit two new areas, pensions and health insurance CLINCHING a deal is almost always important to any self-respecting company chairman, but Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) was particularly relieved to conclude his company's recent agreement with Suez, the French holding company. Mr Peyrelevade had for more than four years been trying to persuade Suez to cede its controlling interest in Colonia, the second largest German insurer, to UAP. This autumn he became even more anxious to reach an agreement before UAP's forthcoming privatisation in the face of fierce speculation about his own possible move to become chairman of Credit Lyonnais. The main obstacle to UAP's ambitions was Gerard Worms, his opposite number at Suez who had worked for Mr Peyrelevade in the mid-1980s when the latter was chairman of Suez. Whenever UAP and Suez had come close to agreeing a deal in their four years of talks, Mr Worms had hung out for more cash. But Suez has in the past year come under intense financial pressure and Mr Peyrelevade seized his chance. UAP now owns a controlling stake in Colonia and as a result has leapt up the insurance industry league table to become the second largest insurer in Europe after Germany's powerful Allianz group. Mr Peyrelevade has made no secret of the fact that UAP's next objective will be to oust Allianz from the top slot. The triumph of the Colonia deal marked a turning point, not only for UAP, but for the rest of the FFr672bn French insurance industry. France's insurers had a tough time in the early 1990s. The Big Four insurance companies - UAP, Axa, Assurances Generales de Paris (AGF) and Groupe GAN - all suffered falls in profits last year because of the parallel problems of the depressed insurance market and the effect of the recession on their property portfolios. Yet the industry is now edging towards recovery. The worst affected area of the insurance market, the damage sector, is showing signs of improvement. The life business is in a position to benefit from the expansion of two new product areas - private pensions and health policies. Meanwhile the three state-controlled insurers - UAP, AGF and GAN - are all preparing for sale to the private sector as part of the Balladur government's privatisation programme. The condition of the French insurance industry differs widely from sector to sector. Demand for life insurance has continued to grow throughout the recession as the nervous French have put their spare cash into long term savings schemes. At the same time the expansion of the mutuels, the specialist financial services companies that grew rapidly in the 1980s, has been checked. 'The life insurance market is still buoyant,' said Michel Albert, chairman of AGF. 'But the banks have taken most of the growth, rather than the traditional insurers, and profitability is depressed because of the level of competition and reductions in interest rates.' These pressures seem likely to intensify for the foreseeable future, but the insurers do hope to exploit two new growth areas - private pensions, following the forthcoming reform of the state pension system, and private health insurance, as the government progressively reduces its contribution to the cost of medical care. Meanwhile the damage insurance market, which was hammered by the recession, is now improving. The insurers have sustained heavy losses in this sector, partly because of escalating commercial claims and partly because of a steep increase in car thefts. Until recently these difficulties were aggravated by the insurers' reluctance to risk losing business by raising premiums. However premiums have since risen thereby lessening the pressure on profitability. 'Most companies, including GAN, have been raising premiums,' said Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN. 'The industry as a whole still isn't technically profitable in damage insurance, but most companies should break even next year.' However, the insurers face a long wait before they can hope to augment the profits from their insurance interests with the proceeds of property disposals as they did in the late 1980s. Many companies last year had to make hefty provisions on their losses in the property market (generally sustained by banking subsidiaries). The property market has since stabilised, and signs of recovery are beginning to appear in the residential sector, but there is still little scope for lucrative property deals. As a result the big French insurers see the mid-1990s as a period of consolidation. The emphasis of their domestic operations is to improve productivity by cutting costs. Some companies, notably AGF, have invested heavily in staff training and information technology to streamline their distribution networks. Others, such as Axa, have experimented with new techniques, such as direct marketing, which could eventually create a cheaper distribution system. The French insurers are also consolidating their international operations. Mr Peyrelevade has said that the Colonia deal will be UAP's last big acquisition for some time, although the group is continuing talks to try to expand its UK business. Similarly AGF, having succeeded in acquiring a 33.5 per cent stake in Germany's AMB, envisages a more cautious approach to expansion. Mr Albert said it was time for the group to 'consolidate our international operations by improving their profitability'. He also said he hoped that privatisation would provide an opportunity to cement AGF's new network by enabling its new partners to buy its shares as noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors. Moreover Mr Albert is convinced that the network of strategic stakes and cross-shareholdings amassed by AGF and UAP will be the blueprint for European insurers in the 1990s. 'The AGF of the future will look like a federation, rather than an empire,' he said. 'There are synergies to be found in information technology, reinsurance and risk control. But the European insurance markets are too different to create huge, centralised groups.'  --------------------------------------------------------- NET PROFITS OF BIG FOUR INSURERS IN (FFR BILLION)  ---------------------------------------------------------               1990      1991      1992  --------------------------------------------------------- UAP            4.2       3.8       1.1 AXA            3.3       2.4       1.5 AGF            2.7       2.7       1.5 GAN            2.4       2.3       0.4  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: company accounts  ---------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------- TURNOVER OF ALL FRENCH INSURERS  ------------------------------------------- Year       FFr billion  ------------------------------------------- 1987               348 1988               412 1989               494 1990               534 1991               596 1992               672  ------------------------------------------- Source: FFSA  -------------------------------------------</p>

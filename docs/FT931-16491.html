			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk Marketing Board to slash head office staff by 60 per cent THE MILK Marketing Board is cutting its 560-strong head office staff by 60 per cent as it prepares for the end of its 60-year-old statutory monopoly. Some time next year, the board, which serves 30,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales, will turn itself into a voluntary co-operative to be known as Milk Marque. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the MMB, told the Oxford farming conference that Milk Marque would be starting out with zero market share. The decision to cut jobs had been taken reluctantly, he said, but 'we mean business'. For dairy farmers the demise of the MMB would overshadow all other farming upheavals including reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy and the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the reform was inevitable because of changes in both the political climate and in the milk market, Mr Dare suggested. He pointed out that doorstep milk sales were falling 8 per cent a year, while supermarket sales were rising by 20 per cent. 'The trend is very clear,' he said. Milk Marque would embrace the free market wholeheartedly - any farmer would be able to supply any buyer and any buyer could source milk from any farm. Total annual turnover would be about Pounds 2.5bn a year, which might appear huge he said, but compared with Pounds 19bn for Nestle and was roughly equivalent to Unigate's. Such a turnover was needed when four dairy companies were buying two-thirds of the milk in England and Wales, Mr Dare added. It would give Milk Marque the necessary muscle to compete in 'the premier league' of the EC, with its 350m customers. The pressure brought by the UK's largest retailers on farmers and growers has been very much for the good, Mr George Paul, chief executive of Harrisons and Crosfield, told the conference. 'The quality of food, particularly fresh vegetables and fruit, available in supermarkets has improved out of all recognition over the last decade,' he said. Mr Paul contended that producing to the fullest quality standards 'would be sufficient to ensure the livelihood of most producers, providing that they are wise in their choice of customer or intermediary'.</p>

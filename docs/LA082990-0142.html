			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CUBA ADOPTS STERN FUEL-ENERGY CONTROLS  </P> <P> Cuba, citing a nearly 2-million-ton shortfall in Soviet oil shipments and a  surge in world oil prices due to the Persian Gulf crisis, today announced  drastic nationwide fuel restrictions and energy-saving measures.  </P> <P> In a package of cuts published by the official newspaper Granma, the Communist  government halted the start-up of a new oil refinery built with Soviet aid and  said it will stop production at one of the country's three operating nickel  plants.  </P> <P> The measures were the harshest so far introduced to offset growing disruption  to the island's economic lifeline from the Soviet Union, its main political  ally and trading partner.  </P> <P> Granma said the country is moving toward a "special period in time of peace" --  the government's term to describe a siege economy situation.  </P> <P> "We have to be prepared for this," the newspaper said.  </P> <P> It even called on Cuban farmers to increase the use of draft animals instead of  vehicles to pull carts and plows.  </P> <P> Daily distribution of diesel fuel and gasoline to state companies was be  restricted immediately. Gasoline distributed to the state sector through  coupons will be cut 50% for the rest of the year, the statement said.  </P> <P> Gasoline supplies to private vehicles will be reduced 30% beginning in October.  </P> <P> Granma said industries, farms and the public must reduce electricity  consumption as much as possible.  </P> <P> It called on each Cuban family to cut back its monthly electricity consumption  by 10%. If this target is not achieved, the authorities will be forced to  introduce one day each week in which electricity would be shut off at peak  hours.  </P> <P> Otherwise, families who exceeded set limits could have their electricity cut  off for as long as 30 days.  </P> <P> Granma said even more energy-saving measures may be necessary if oil shipments  from the Soviet Union continue to fall behind because of economic problems  there.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Bumpy flight from conflict to concord: Acrimony could give way to co-operation in the international aerospace industry The European Airbus consortium could not have chosen a worse moment to bring to market a new airliner. The launch in Hamburg today of the A321 - a larger 186-seat derivative of the A320 twin-engine airliner - comes in the middle of the worst recession to hit civil aviation in the past 40 years. Aircraft manufacturers around the world have been scrambling to cut production and employment to adapt to the siege-like conditions facing the industry. Airlines, which have made a cumulative loss of more more than Dollars 10bn during the past three years, have continued to defer or cancel an unprecedented number of new aircraft orders booked during the buying spree of the late 1980s. The crisis, different from previous cyclical downturns because it has coincided with a deep slump in the defence side of the aerospace business, has also revived trade tensions between the US and Europe over the controversial issue of government subsidies for Airbus. President Bill Clinton warned last week that he was determined to do 'whatever it takes' to maintain US leadership in the commercial aircraft business. The US reached an agreement with the European Commission last year on commercial aircraft subsidies after five years of heated negotiations. But accusations are again flying across the Atlantic that Airbus is selling aircraft to financially troubled US airlines at unfair prices to increase its market penetration at the expense of its two US rivals, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. President Clinton told an audience of US aerospace executives and Boeing workers in Seattle: 'I've seen these agreements made for years: I've seen people promise us they'd do this, that and the other thing, and nothing ever happens.' Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice-president for planning and international development, followed this by telling a congressional aviation committee last week that it was 'critical that the Europeans understand that neither the US government nor its aircraft industry will stand on the sidelines and allow these practices to rob us of our market'. However, at this stage at least, Mr Clinton's broadside against Airbus appears to have been largely dictated by domestic US concerns at a time when thousands of jobs are at risk in the aerospace industry. Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are in the throes of sweeping restructuring. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets with about 60 per cent of the world market, is reducing its overall production by 35 per cent and has announced 28,000 job cuts over the next 18 months. McDonnell Douglas, now trailing behind Airbus as the world's number three commercial aircraft maker, plans to reduce its workforce by 10 per cent this year after cutting it by 20 per cent last year. By the end of this year, the group's overall employment will have dropped from 121,000 in 1990 to about 78,000. Mr Clinton told Boeing workers that 'a lot of these lay-offs would not have been announced had it not been for the Dollars 26bn that the US sat by and let Europe plough into Airbus over the last seven years'. Airbus has also been forced to revise production plans. But, unlike its two American competitors which are reducing output, Airbus has so far claimed its output will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, said last month that the consortium's production was expected to grow from about 150 aircraft this year to about 170 in 1995, compared with an original target of 225 in 1995. This has led to US fears that Airbus will seek to intensify its drive to win greater market share by offering sweetheart financing packages and pricing terms that breach last year's US-EC pact on civil aircraft sales. 'We expect that these types of creative mechanisms will proliferate,' said Boeing's Mr Clarkson. Airbus and its four partner companies - Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace, and Casa of Spain - have consistently argued that US manufacturers have benefited at least as much from direct and indirect support from their government. They also claim that US manufacturers, like Airbus, have long supplied financing to airline customers to win large orders. But for all the transatlantic sabre-rattling of the past few weeks, neither the manufacturers nor their respective governments appear anxious to precipitate a trade war over civil aircraft sales. 'No one is about to launch a major new aircraft programme in this market and we are therefore not worried about development subsidies,' Mr Clarkson explained. 'What we want is for the agreement reached last year to be implemented so that we can finally get some visibility on the true financial situation of Airbus,' he added. To this end, the US administration has now asked for consultations with the EC to review and implement last year's agreement. President Clinton has also decided to establish a national commission to investigate the conditions and problems of the financially strapped US airline industry. The proposal for a commission has been welcomed by the US manufacturers, which believe their most pressing problem is airline finances rather than Airbus subsidies. 'Let's face it, the Europeans are simply not going to give up on Airbus, but the government could help airlines around the world with financing support to buy our products,' said Mr John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas. He was speaking last month at the roll-out of his company's new twin-engine jet, the MD90, a new derivative of McDonnell Douglas's long-established DC9 and MD80 family of narrowbody jets which competes with the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737. Of the big three manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas is regarded as the most vulnerable. Many analysts believe the company could follow Lockheed and decide to pull out of the commercial aircraft business to concentrate exclusively on its defence operations. But Mr McDonnell and his senior executives insist that the company is not about to abandon its civil aircraft activities, which are based at Long Beach, California. McDonnell's strategy has been to drive down costs aggressively and reduce production. The chairman said the company had refused to go after 'bad business' simply to land orders and buy market share. But he acknowledged that his company suffers a severe disadvantage because it does not have as broad a product line as either Boeing or Airbus. 'Right now, this is not such a big handicap because no airlines are buying aircraft: but it will be important for us not to have this disadvantage when the cycle picks up again in two or three years' time,' he explained. For McDonnell Douglas the solution lies in a global partnership which would create a new commercial aircraft company, controlled by the US group but with a series of international equity partners prepared to invest in the development of new products. Although Mr McDonnell failed to clinch a partnership last year with Taiwan Aerospace, which was proposing to invest Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent stake in the Douglas civil aircraft business, he said the company was now engaged in 'mature discussions' with a number of potential partners, including several in the Asia-Pacific region. He explained: 'We've got two years to establish this new entity with multiple owners which would help broaden our product line.' But the implication is that unless McDonnell Douglas can find international partners, its longer-term future as a manufacturer of commercial jets will be in doubt. This quest for partners, which would enable the Long Beach company to establish a similar risk-sharing system operated by Boeing with the three Japanese manufacturers (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries) and by the four European manufacturers through the Airbus consortium, also explains why the US manufacturers are reluctant to engage in a trade war against Airbus. Boeing, too, is currently seeking to expand its international links. Significantly, it agreed at the end of January to study with the four Airbus partners the joint development of a super jumbo jet capable of seating 600-800 passengers. 'No single manufacturer could envisage developing such an aircraft on his own,' Mr Clarkson said. From Seattle to Long Beach to Toulouse, therefore, new realignments are starting to emerge which could lead to a profound transformation in the structure of the commercial aircraft industry over the next decade. 'Like the birth of an airplane, the birth of new enterprises has been an important part of the process of renewal within our industry for many years,' Mr McDonnell said. 'Don't be surprised if the next roll-out you attend at McDonnell Douglas is the roll-out of a new Douglas Aircraft Company that is a global venture with owners from around the world.'</p>

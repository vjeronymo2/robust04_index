			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: CHADWICK'S 'HOUSE': IS THIS BLASPHEMY?  </P> <P> A lot of rock music has been termed blasphemous, though rarely by the people  who created it.  </P> <P> But that's the term used by Guy Chadwick, singer-songwriter of the English  quartet House of Love, to describe his use of religious imagery in several  songs on the band's new album, "House of Love." The group will be at the Roxy  on June 15 and 16.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to be blasphemous," the sunken-cheeked Chadwick, 30, said  recently over a beer in the bar of a West Hollywood hotel. "But I'm sort of  challenging my own beliefs. I don't know how I feel about religion or God. The  power of religion has always interested me, and to an extent I'm flirting with  it in a dangerous way. I do sometimes think, 'God, should I write that? Will He  let me get away with that?' "  </P> <P> The truth is, Chadwick's references to Jesus and God are most often ambiguous  and ambivalent, and at worst questioning. His attitude, he says, was shaped by  his upbringing, in which, after spending his first two years in Germany where  his father was stationed with the British Army, he was exposed to a colorful  world of wonders first in Singapore and then Malaya. But at age 13 he found  himself stuck in a relatively drab boarding school in the English Midlands.  </P> <P> "It was dreary, and in some ways affected me," he said. "I remember being  disappointed in my adolescence -- a particularly bad hand dealt me, moving from  somewhere like (Asia) to such a boring place."  </P> <P> Then in the late '80s, the flowering punk scene turned his head. "It literally  made me pick up a guitar and learn to play," he said. "It was really that  corny."  </P> <P> After several years of struggling to get a foothold in music, Chadwick signed  an ill-fated solo deal with RCA in England in 1983. Then four years ago he  formed House of Love, which released an independent album in 1988, drawing  critical praise for its brisk, thoughtful guitar-pop. The new album, with a  sound that harks back both to punk and '60s pop in a manner somewhat akin to  that of the Church or the Stone Roses, has won even greater accolades in the  British rock press.  </P> <P> Some rock fans may consider Chadwick's biggest blasphemy to be a song on the  new album titled "Beatles and Stones," in which he sings, "The Beatles and the  Stones / Made it good to be alone," countering the communal-spirit party line  associated with those groups' music.  </P> <P> "If anything, that song's reverent," Chadwick maintained. "I vaguely remember  seeing Jimi Hendrix on 'Top of the Pops,' " he said. "And I barely remember the  Beatles."  </P> <P> And he readily acknowledges ambitions that are far from Beatlesque. Instead, he  admires the accomplishments of the Only Ones, a late-'70s English band greatly  loved by those who remember it, but remembered by few.  </P> <P> "At least they made some records, left something behind," Chadwick said. "It  wasn't all in vain. They left something and got something as well." STEVE  HOCHMAN  </P></p>

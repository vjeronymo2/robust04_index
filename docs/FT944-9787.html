			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hardy seeks Pounds 9m for syndicate The trickle of extra corporate capital into Lloyd's of London continues today with the announcement of a new company that plans to raise up to Pounds 9m to invest in the 1995 underwriting year. Hardy Underwriting plans to invest exclusively in Lloyd's syndicate 382, managed by Hardy (Underwriting Agencies), which specialises in helicopters among other business. The company intends to raise the cash via an offer of 4.5m units of one ordinary share at 100p and Pounds 1 of 10 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock at par. Other companies expected to announce plans to raise funds in time for 1995 include the Brockbank managing agency, which runs some of the largest Lloyd's syndicates. Brockbank is aiming to raise up to Pounds 50m, sufficient to underwrite about Pounds 95m of business on Brockbank syndicates. Meanwhile Wellington Underwriting, which is seeking a stock market listing, is due to complete arrangements this week for placing 30m shares at 100p. Its efforts have been hindered by the failure of Lloyd's council last week to approve new arrangements allowing corporate companies to invest in each other. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, estimates that corporate investment next year will be only about Pounds 250m more than the total Pounds 900m committed in 1994, the first year in which corporate capital was allowed.</p>

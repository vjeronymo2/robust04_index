			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong  affairs, Lu Ping, yesterday blasted what he described as a  unilateral move by the Hong Kong Government to seek extra funds  for airport projects without waiting for a Sino-British  financial accord.    He also warned that the re-opening of airport negotiations  could be affected by the refusal of the Secretary for Economic  Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, to attend a meeting of the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on the Airport Corporation  Bill.    Speaking in Beijing yesterday, Mr Lu, the Director of the  Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  voiced his opposition to granting extra funds to the new airport  plan.    Mr Lu said China could not agree to the funding request, put  to the Legislative Council on Monday [10 January].    He denounced the Government for refusing to make a  commitment  on financing the airport projects.    "To follow the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) the  Government's level of debt has to be limited to $5 billion," he  said.    "There is a surplus of over $100 billion, it can inject a  certain amount to the new airport construction."    Mr Lu also questioned the Government's claim that it could  leave $78 billion in reserves to the Special Administrative  Region (SAR) government while virtually refusing to make a  commitment.    In response, a government spokesman said: "We haven't seen  the precise report of Mr Lu's comment but we are puzzled to hear  suggestions that we are taking a unilateral action and that they  were not informed."    He said papers on the funding options had been given to the  Chinese side of the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee last  week.    "What we have done is in line with the MOU. We are trying to  maintain the momentum of the airport and to complete the  projects to the maximum extent possible by mid-1997," he said.  The spokesman said if the Chinese side had new proposals which  helped reach an agreement, the Government would be happy to hear  them.    In a paper circulated to Legco members on Monday, the  Government proposed two options for taking the airport projects  forward. One envisaged a request for a one-off grant of $377  million for the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to allow it  to finish works currently underway. The other suggested that on  top of the airport body's running cost for the next financial  year, funds totalling $1.3 billion should be made available to  pay for three urgent construction projects.    Mr Lu said: "(The Government) hasn't discussed with us its  decision to seek temporary funding from Legco. To this  unilateral move we can never give our consent."    Under the Sino-British airport accord, which was signed in  September 1991, China endorsed the airport proposal provided  that Britain agreed to leave $25 billion in reserves for the  post 1997 government, as well as to keep the level of government  debt below $5 billion.    On the disposal of land along the airport railway, Mr Lu  rejected the British suggestion that the 58 hectares should be  granted in one go.    "If the land supply increases suddenly by about 60 hectares,  how can one say that this will have no impact on the overall  land supply [in the market]?" Mr Lu said there was no way that  China would give its consent even though the British Hong Kong  authorities had agreed to make concessions on the financial  arrangements.    Referring to the Airport Corporation Bill, Mr Lu said the  Chinese authorities could not share the Government's view that  there would be adequate scrutiny of the future airport  management body.    Despite the fact that the bill outlined that the Government  was empowered to act on public interest, Mr Lu said: "When you  realise that there are public interests concerned, you probably  have to pay compensation (to the other signatories of  agreements).    "Therefore, we asked the Government to come and explain to  the PWC, given it said it would have adequate power to control  the corporation. The PWC members are advisers to us."    Mr Lu said the PWC had decided to invite Mr Siu to explain  the bill, seizing the opportunity of his scheduled visit to  Beijing to sign an agreement with the civil aviation authority.    "If things carry on like this, it remains doubtful as to  when  the airport negotiation will resume," he said.    In Hong Kong, 14 Hong Kong affairs advisers yesterday told  local XINHUA (New China News Agency) officials that China and  Britain should try to strike a deal on the airport projects as  soon as possible.</p>

This award may be made to the individual either directly by the Department or by a grantee that receives Federal funds for the purpose of providing, for example, fellowships, traineeships, or other awards to individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690; 21 U.S.C. 862) provides that a sentencing court may deny eligibility for certain Federal benefits to an individual convicted of drug trafficking or possession. Thus, an individual who applies for a grant, fellowship, or other monetary benefit under a program covered by this notice should understand that, if convicted of drug trafficking or possession, he or she is subject to denial of eligibility for that benefit if the sentencing court imposes such a sanction. This denial applies whether the Federal benefit is provided to the individual directly by the Department or is provided through a grant, fellowship, traineeship, or other award made available with Federal funds by a grantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any persons determined to be ineligible for Federal benefits under the provisions of section 5301 are listed in the General Services Administration's ``Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The programs listed in the chart make discretionary awards subject to the eligibility requirements of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647; 28 U.S.C. 3201). The Act provides that if there is a judgment lien against a debtor's property for a debt to the United States, the debtor is not eligible to receive a Federal grant or loan, except direct payments to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary, until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

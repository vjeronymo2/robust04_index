			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Economics Notebook: Pension funds can rock the financial markets THEIR role in society is invaluable. We depend on them for our security in old age. But pension funds have also emerged as one of the great potential destabilising forces in the world's financial markets. Last week in Washington, finance ministers and senior officials from the world's leading industrial countries took time out from their everyday pre-occupations to ponder some of the lessons of last autumn's crisis on the world's currency markets. Their conclusions - summed up in a communique by the Group of Ten industrial countries - amounted to little. But that should cause no surprise. Two studies - one by staff of the International Monetary Fund* and another by senior G10 officials chaired by Mr Lamberto Dini of the Bank of Italy - served to highlight the powerlessness of governments and central banks in the face of massive currency movements. A quick statistical overview of the foreign exchange market shows what problems governments face. Daily foreign exchange transactions have grown rapidly over the past decade, fuelled by the liberalisation of capital markets, technological advance in computers and telecommunications and the rapid expansion of the amount of funds managed by institutional investors. As a result, daily net turnover of the nine biggest foreign exchange markets totalled Dollars 910bn (Pounds 590bn) last year, a sum much higher than the total non-gold reserves of all the industrial countries. According to the IMF, these totalled Dollars 555.6bn in April 1992. The total reserves of the industrial countries are also dwarfed by the volume of financial assets held by foreign investors. Total cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991 while the IMF estimates that the total cross-border ownership of tradeable securities has increased to Dollars 2,500bn. Institutional investors, of which pension funds are the most important, have played a prominent role in this process of portfolio diversification. In Europe, institutions invest about 20 per cent of their assets abroad while foreign investments of US and Japanese institutions generally range between 5 and 7 per cent. These relatively modest sounding percentages can translate into potentially large financial flows. US pension funds, for example, had invested just 4.6 per cent of their assets abroad in 1991. But these were worth Dollars 125bn. Similarly, the 6.6 per cent of assets invested outside the US by American mutual funds was worth Dollars 90bn. Moreover, the IMF and Dini reports both predict that the trend to international portfolio diversification will keep growing. The IMF quotes research by InterSec Research Corporation, a company that tracks pension fund investments worldwide. This estimates that the share of foreign currency denominated assets in the portfolios of the world's 300 largest pension funds will increase from about 7 per cent at present to about 12 per cent by the middle of this decade. If true, global pension fund assets will rise to around Dollars 7,200bn by 1996, of which Dollars 880bn will be cross-border investments. US pension funds are projected to double the share of foreign securities in total assets to 10 per cent by the mid-1990s. Such portfolio diversification can be a tremendous force for good in the world. By putting resources where they are needed, the investment of savings from mature industrialised countries in higher-yielding opportunities abroad should bring benefits to both the investing and the host countries. But the sheer scale of the present and prospective investment flows is also a big headache for governments, particularly as institutions which used to invest for the long term are taking advantage of improved liquidity in financial markets and falling costs of financial transactions to switch in and out of currencies and their derivative securities. Rapid action is not just the preserve of the hedge funds, such as those run by Mr George Soros which shot to prominence in the attack on sterling last September. These privately subscribed funds, which are mostly based in unregulated offshore centres, are notable for their ability to take highly speculative, leveraged positions in currencies. The Dini report notes that some pension funds have also started to treat foreign exchange as an asset class in itself, separate from any debt or equity security. According to the IMF, 'relationship buy-and-hold finance is giving way to transactions-driven finance, leading to the observation that it is no longer clear what a 'long term investment' means'. All this is bad news for governments. When private markets change their mind about a currency, a defending central bank can be faced with a run of Dollars 100bn to Dollars 200bn in a week and run out of reserves. But it is a sign of the dilemma faced by monetary authorities that the Dini report was unable to come up with any clear recommendations for dealing with these problems. It talks in a 'motherhood and apple pie' sort of way about the need for close consultations among governments, sound policies at home and co-operation among countries to ensure that interest rates changes or intervention to protect currencies are as effective as possible. But at one point it acknowledges that 'a country can experience downward pressure on its currency despite the fact that its macroeconomic policy and performance have been sound'. A case in point was France last year which eventually fought off speculation against the French franc and and forced losses estimated at Dollars 1bn on speculators in the process. But although the French franc is doing well in the honeymoon period after the centre-right government's sweeping election victory, few foreign exchange operators are yet willing to give it a competely clean bill of health. *International Capital Markets: Exchange Rate management and International Capital Flows.

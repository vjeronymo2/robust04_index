			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY, CITIES SEEING PAYOFF IN EFFORT TO DRAW FILMMAKERS  </P> <P> A joint effort among state, county and city officials to keep Hollywood  filmmakers from leaving California to make movies is showing modest but  tangible results for Orange County.  </P> <P> Film-making is increasing in some Orange County cities and could double this  year in unincorporated areas, according to figures released recently by the  Orange County film liaison office.  </P> <P> At the same time, the relatively small numbers aren't likely to cause Hollywood  Chamber of Commerce officials to start crying "Exodus."  </P> <P> As of June 15, the office had issued 16 permits this year to motion picture  companies filming in unincorporated county areas, just one fewer than in all of  1989, according to county film liaison Lolly Powell. With heightened activity  anticipated during summer months, at least twice as much filming is projected  during 1990 over last year, Powell said.  </P> <P> "It would be my hope that it would triple, but it's been a surprise so far that  we've increased that much," she said.  </P> <P> Some cities -- including Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Fullerton and Laguna Beach  -- also report that movie companies are becoming more familiar sights. In  Newport Beach, the Orange County city most popular with filmmakers, 22 permits  have been issued to commercial film production companies so far this year, an  18% jump over the first half of 1989, said licensing supervisor Glen Everroad.  Most filming in Newport takes place after August, he said.  </P> <P> In Laguna, where 100 crew members and extras descended last week to shoot an  NBC television miniseries, filmmakers have become regular guests, said Cindy  King, Laguna's director of recreation and film liaison.  </P> <P> King said the increase can be explained by Laguna's quaintness and cooperation,  adding that the city has simplified the permit-granting process to encourage  filmmakers. Similar goals were on the table last month during the California  Film Commission's first meeting with both city and county liaisons.  Participants are hoping the connection will result in a closer working  relationship between the groups.  </P> <P> The commission was created in 1985 to tether filmmakers who were being wooed  away from California by other states. In 1988, with productions lost to other  states still costing California $3 billion, a county liaison office was  established to help tackle the problem. Last fall, film industry insiders and  some local officials were still bemoaning what they called the "bureaucratic  nightmare" of making movies in Orange County, a problem the county and state  film offices have since been striving to solve.  </P> <P> "There's still work to do," said Michael Walbrecht, commission associate  director, who added that as of last week, only a couple of Orange County cities  have adopted the commission's "model process" for film permits. By adopting  that process, cities would have a uniform procedure in place of the myriad  different policies, ostensibly making it easier for film companies to move from  city to city for shooting.  </P> <P> However, Walbrecht added, in part because more Los Angeles neighborhoods are  becoming "burned out" with constant film activity, production companies are  increasingly setting their sights on surrounding counties. Cities that catch a  filmmaker's fancy can reap hefty financial rewards, he said.  </P> <P> While filming "Defending Your Life" with Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks in  Orange County recently, Warner Bros. spent $200,000 and hired 1,000 extras in  10 days, Walbrecht said. Statewide, the industry spends about $5.25 billion a  year and employs 118,000 people directly and 115,000 indirectly, he said.  </P> <P> "This is a very clean industry that usually comes into your community, spends a  substantial amount of money and then it goes away," he said.  </P> <P> But not always. Just ask Newport Beach officials.  </P> <P> Three years ago, in one of the more ill-fated episodes in county film-making, a  production company rigged a 46-foot yacht to explode in the Upper Newport Bay  ecological reserve without getting a city permit, Everroad said. When silt  clogged the water lines on the fire-suppression boats, the fire, scheduled to  burn for 30 seconds, raged in the Back Bay for 40 minutes, he said.  </P> <P> "This thing was a bomb floating out in the middle of the harbor." Debris  dirtied the bay, cinders settled on yachts and ashes drifted into koi ponds and  pools.  </P> <P> "It was a mess," Everroad said of the misadventure that took four months to  clean up. "We had a bunch of upset people."  </P> <P> Popular coastal sites include the Newport Beach piers, the Balboa Fun Zone and  Crystal Cove, where portions of the movie "Beaches" were filmed. Laguna Beach  was chosen as the backdrop for "Jackie Collins' Lucky," a six-hour television  miniseries, because it most closely resembled the south of France, location  manager Karen White said.  </P> <P> "It's foreign-looking in a way," White said. "We were looking for something  colorful, something that had some character and something that had a more  limited beach than, say, Hermosa, which goes on like the Sahara."  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, with its stately, historic County Courthouse, generic stadium and  recently refurbished historical homes, film-making "has increased  tremendously," said liaison Maria Schlinger.  </P> <P> But not everyone in Orange County is seeing the fallout.  </P> <P> In Orange, the site of a 100-year-old traffic circle and picturesque shops that  have provided the backdrop for films in years past, there has been no increase  in filming this year, a city spokeswoman said. And in Huntington Beach, where  marine safety captain Bill Richardson said scant permit fees should be  appealing, there has been little change.  </P> <P> One barrier for filmmakers who might be tempted to venture into counties  surrounding Los Angeles has been an industry regulation that prescribes extra  pay when Los Angeles-based film companies travel more than 30 miles from a  studio.  </P> <P> In addition, even when production companies are lured outside the radius and  into Orange County, residents don't always share the enthusiasm of local  officials.  </P> <P> With more than 15 trucks, trailers, busses and vans blocking the ocean view at  Laguna's Heisler Park on Friday, Al and Peg Difley stopped their morning walk  to watch cameramen wave off cars attempting to park along Cliff Drive. The  Difleys, who live a block from the the location site where crew members sipped  coffee and ate doughnuts, said such scenes are no longer a novelty.  </P> <P> "You see they've taken the whole street," Al Difley said. "Once in a while it's  all right, but not too often."  </P></p>

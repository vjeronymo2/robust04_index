			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Heseltine settles for 'new partnership' plan The government's preferred option for the future of the Post Office is partial privatisation, which it calls 'a new partnership' between the public, the state, and the industry's employees and sub-postmasters. Dubbed the 'BP option' - after the semi-private status of the oil company prior to its full privatisation in 1987 - the policy would involve: The government retaining 49 per cent of Royal Mail and of Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcel-delivery subsidiary. The government would pledge to retain that stake 'indefinitely', and any further reduction would require explicit parliamentary approval. In law the Royal Mail would count as a private-sector company, and ministers would pledge not to use their stake to intervene in commercial decisions. The sale on preferential terms of about 10 per cent of the shares to the Post Office's 180,000 employees and 20,000 sub-postmasters. The sale of the remainder of the company - about 40 per cent of the total shares - in a public flotation. The creation of Post Office Counters division as a separate entity, which would continue to be state-owned. Post Office Counters covers 20,000 post offices, 19,000 of them sub-post offices owned and managed by individuals or companies on a franchise basis. Although profitable as a whole, state control would be a guarantee against wholesale closures of subsidised rural sub-post offices. The establishment of an independent regulator - the director-general for postal services - with responsibility for ensuring that that the Post Office continues to provide a national, affordable and efficient service. Like Oftel and the other utility regulators, the regulator would be appointed by, but legally independent of, the government. The opening of the postal market to greater competition. Royal Mail might be able to strike more commercial deals with the private sector for bulk deliveries and pre-sorted mail, and its existing monopoly over the delivery of all letters costing Pounds 1 or less might be reduced. Mr Heseltine and the Post Office see this package as a principled compromise between the two other options set out in the green paper. The first option would retain the Post Office as a nationalised industry, but give it greater freedom from Treasury controls. The most onerous of these controls concern capital spending, profits, and performance targets. The Post Office claims that its capital spending is far below that needed to compete long-term in new postal technologies such as electronic messaging. And the sum it has to pay the Treasury out of profits - Pounds 181m last year - is almost twice as much as it would pay as a reasonable dividend. Mr Heseltine pours cold water on this option, pointing to 'serious difficulties' in removing 'all controls' from the Post Office if it remains more than 50 per cent state-owned. Although common in continental Europe, no industry in Britain has succeeded in establishing a fully commercial status within the public sector. The green paper's other, more radical, option is to sell 100 per cent of Royal Mail. This would be to treat Royal Mail in the same way as the other utilities - including British Telecommunications, which was once part of the Post Office  -which were sold in their entirety. The other proposals outlined above would still apply. Given the government's strong commitment to privatisation, it is not surprising that Mr Heseltine claims that the 100 per cent option 'has much to recommend it'. The case against this option is wholly political. As the green paper puts it: 'Many people would prefer a closer link between the government and the Royal Mail, (reflecting) the important role which Royal Mail plays in our national life.' In that case, why not keep 51 per cent of the shares in state hands? The argument for the 51 per cent sell-off is based on accepted international definitions of private-sector companies, which require a majority of their equity to be in non-state hands. All three options are likely to require legislation, particularly if the government decides to open the postal market to greater competition, which it is committed to doing. The green paper refuses to specify precise reforms to promote competition, but raises the possibility of three: a narrowing of the Royal Mail's existing letter monopoly; an increase in discounts available to companies which pre-sort their mail; and 'niche licences' for companies proposing to deliver specific services within the monopoly. The crucial limitation is that 'additional competition must not be allowed to put at risk Royal Mail's ability to maintain a universal service at a uniform and affordable tariff'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SELL-OFF CHOICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Government's preferred option  -State to retain 49 per cent of Royal Mail  -About 10 per cent sold to post office employees and sub post-masters  -The rest sold in a public flotation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Option 2  -Total privatisation: a 100 per cent flotation either in one or several   tranches  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Option 3  -Continued state control: the status quo, but with greater commercial   freedom  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Under options (1) and (2) Parcelforce would be privatised with the Royal Mail, but the Counters division would remain nationalised  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

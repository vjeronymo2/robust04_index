			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / MoD is criticised over ship refits THE MINISTRY of Defence's handling of naval vessel refitting was criticised by MPs yesterday as the service's privately managed dockyards awaited a crucial government decision on their future, David White writes. The Commons public accounts committee complained of slow progress in changing procedures at the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards since management was transferred to private consortia in 1987. The cabinet will decide shortly which yard should service the new Trident submarines. The decision - not expected until next week at the earliest - will mean concentrating all work on refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered submarines on one site. The committee's report coincided with intensive last-minute lobbying by the dockyard managers and local politicians in the bitter battle over which yard should service the UK's new Trident submarines. Committee of Public Accounts, 39th Report, Ministry of Defence. HMSO. Pounds 12.15.</p>

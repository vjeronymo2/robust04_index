			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Saudi banks report sharp rise in profits over nine-month term THREE of Saudi Arabia's 11 joint-venture banks have reported sharply increased profits for the nine months to September 30 compared with the same period in 1992. Saudi British Bank, 40 per cent owned by British Bank of the Middle East, part of London-based HSBC Holdings, reported nine-month net profits exceeding the full-year profits of any previous year - SR298.8m (Dollars 79.7m), an increase of 50.2 per cent from the SR198.9m in the same period of 1992. Total assets, at SR21,954m, have increased some 30 per cent in the past two years. Saudi French Bank, 31 per cent owned by Paris-based Banque Indosuez, saw net profits rise 60 per cent to SR269.3m from SR168.3m. Net profits at Arab National Bank, 40 per cent owned by Amman's Arab Bank, increased nearly 30 per cent to SR368.9m, compared with SR287.7m in the same nine-month period last year. Mr Andrew Dixon, managing director of Saudi British Bank, said that sales in the kingdom's private sector were 'buoyant'. 'There is an increasing drive from the non-oil private sector into industry. Import substitution is a reality, and the economy is probably growing at an annual rate of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent,' Mr Dixon said. However, while private sector non-oil contribution to gross domestic product was growing, the economy as a whole was very much 'oil-driven', so much depended on the future trend of oil prices, he said. Mr Dixon added: 'I feel reasonably comfortable that we should be able to maintain our present performance in the last quarter of this year, though for next year no one can be sure because of changing interest rate scenarios overseas which are moving from one type of market to another.' His comments underline the fact that a large proportion of banks' earnings are coming from net interest income, gains on bond portfolios, and higher fee earnings.</p>

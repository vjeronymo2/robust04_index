			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBRARY VOLUNTEERS, STAFF HARD AT WORK ON 'HUGE JIGSAW PUZZLE'  </P> <P> In a cluttered downtown workroom, Hector Quimby stared eagerly at more than  10,000 dirty books.  </P> <P> His mission was to clean up the literature -- but his weapon was a damp sponge,  not a censor's pen.  </P> <P> Quimby, 21, is one of 250 city library employees who, along with more than 400  volunteers, are busy preparing the temporary home of the Central Library for  its scheduled opening in mid-spring.  </P> <P> On eight floors of the elegant former Design Center at 433 S. Spring St., 1.8  million volumes will be housed, mainly in open stacks, until the landmark  Central Library that was ravaged by two arson fires in 1986 reopens in about  three years.  </P> <P> The current move, long delayed as authorities dickered over sites and lease  terms, is massive. While the new locale may be temporary, library officials  said, it will nonetheless function as the largest public library in the Western  United States.  </P> <P> "This is no Mickey Mouse operation; I don't like to even call it temporary,"  library spokesman Robert G. Reagan emphasized. "It is the Central Library in  its temporary location."  </P> <P> With thousands of books that were packed in haste after the devastating fires  arriving daily from three warehouses and two giant refrigeration facilities,  Reagan compares the effort to making "a huge jigsaw puzzle come together."  </P> <P> Adding to the logistical challenge is the fact that librarians still do not  know exactly which books they will have available to house on their portable,  metal shelves. The two fires destroyed 400,000 volumes and damaged another  700,000, so librarians are completing their inventory only as the books arrive  in hundreds of moving cartons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coordinates Move  </P> <P> "We're saying the shelving should go here, here and here," sighed principal  librarian Leslie Nordby, who is coordinating the move. "But it's based upon  nothing. We still don't have a good idea of what was in the freezers."  </P> <P> The library rented the industrial freezers, which usually house frozen foods,  to prevent mold and mildew from growing in books that suffered water damage.  Last fall, the books were transfered to a Saugus drying chamber for what  officials labeled the largest book-drying project ever. That, in turn, has led  to the colossal cleaning operation.  </P> <P> Trucked to Spring Street on 5-foot-square pallets, the books are moved by  elevator to a ninth-floor processing center in a former furniture design  showroom.  </P> <P> For seven days a week since late November, work crews in this nerve center have  cleaned and catalogued each volume, many of which are curled or sooty from  water and smoke.  </P> <P> "Some of them that come in are really black, with a lot of ash deposits all  over," said library clerk Quimby, whose blue shirt grew progressively dirtier  as he scrubbed the cover of a volume entitled "Silver Bay Conference on Human  Relations in Industry 1951-1954." "But this is something you'll tell your  grandchildren that you were a part of."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beehive of Activity  </P> <P> The block-long processing center, in which stacks of half-opened moving cartons  stood piled in no discernable order, is a constant beehive of activity.  </P> <P> In one corner, 10 employees and volunteers, several sporting radio headphones  and surgical masks, sponged spines and covers one afternoon this week.  </P> <P> At the other end of the brightly lit room, a group of volunteers matched the  clean books to index cards in the library's imposing shelf list. In cases where  cards could not be located, they made out new handwritten cards in order to  complete a full inventory.  </P> <P> Such work is seen as drudgery by most library employees. But the volunteers  worked with a sense of mission that made the hours pass quickly.  </P> <P> "It's boring, but so are a lot of things in life," asserted Ellie Shanahan, a  free-lance fashion stylist who is between jobs. "I believe in books, so I think  it's important that the library get back in order as soon as possible. And this  gives me something to do instead of sitting at home waiting for the phone to  ring."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catching Up on History  </P> <P> The work also gave volunteers a chance to sneak quick peeks inside the eclectic  tomes, which the other day ranged from a sewage disposal guide to an atlas of  India.  </P> <P> "You catch up on your history -- I just went through the Korean War with the  USS Manchester," said Jean Wallace, a retired telephone operator from  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, hundreds of books and magazines fail to make it past the  processing center.  </P> <P> Those deemed not salvagable by the cleaning crew are placed on wooden book  carts for a detailed perusal by principal librarians. If a second, cleaner copy  is already in the library's collection, or, in the case of periodicals, the  material is available on microfilm, damaged volumes are thrown into the  garbage.  </P> <P> "It is not a cavalier process," emphasized Pat Kiefer, the processing center's  co-manager, as she picked up a dilapidated copy of "What Color Is My  Parachute." The book's cover, once orange, was now black. "I know that we have  several other copies in better shape," Kiefer explained, before tossing the  book back in the discard bin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use Shopping Carts  </P> <P> Books that survive the processing procedure are re-loaded into cartons and  moved, by department and serial number, to the proper floor for shelving.  There, workers employ shopping carts donated by Vons markets for the final  filing.  </P> <P> "It's somewhat disheartening not doing your professional work," said Jack  Vargas, an arts and music department employee as he pored through copies of  American Painting Contractor magazine. "But what keeps us going is the goal of  reopening the library."  </P> <P> Currently, the only portion of the temporary library open to the public is a  nine-month-old, 3,000-volume Book Stop on the ground floor, which stocks best  sellers, travel and children's books.  </P> <P> Roughly one-fourth of the shelving for the full-service temporary library has  been completed, including the entire history, arts and music collections --  housed in an ornate, marble-columned hall on the second floor of the  60-year-old building.  </P> <P> This weekend, a shelving party is scheduled for the children's literature  section on the ground floor of the temporary library. As always, the library is  seeking additional volunteers to assist in the task. (Those interested may call  612-3261.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Depend on Volunteers  </P> <P> "There is a direct correlation between the number of volunteers and the timing  of the (still undetermined) opening date," Reagan said.  </P> <P> With a new building -- rented for $8.3-million for 54 months -- and $10-million  in new books from the Save the Books fund-raising effort, library officials  said, they are eager to get off to a fresh start on Spring Street.  </P> <P> But they concede that the legacy of the 1986 fires will live on in the campfire  smell and warped shape of many of the books on the new shelves.  </P> <P> "When people use the library, they'll notice some of the books look a little  strange," Reagan said. "But they must remember, the books have a history."  </P></p>

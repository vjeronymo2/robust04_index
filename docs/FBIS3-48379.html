Therefore, without giving priority to the ideological  reeducation of the popular masses, it is impossible to  successfully solve manifold difficult and complicated problems  in the building of socialism and defend the gains of the  revolution from the anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists.    NODONG SINMUN today stresses this in an article headlined  "Definite Priority to Conquest of Ideological Fortress, Decisive  Guarantee for Accomplishment of Socialist Cause."    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying:    "If we are to build socialism, we must conquer two  fortresses, ideological-political and material.    "Of the two, it is particularly important to conquer the  ideological-political fortress."    The author of the article says:    To conquer the ideological fortress means to educate all  members of society in revolutionary ideas and assimilating them  to the working class and the intelligentsia in order to train  them into versatile communists.    In order to build socialist society, two fortresses,  ideological and material, must be conquered and the conquest of  the ideological fortress must be given definite priority.  Because it is a primary and decisive condition for the building  of socialism. Socialism wins when the popular masses are  educated in socialist ideology and united on that basis and it  collapses when they are sick ideologically. The superiority of  socialism to capitalism is that of ideology and the might of  socialism lies in that of ideology.    The experience in building socialism in Korea clearly shows  that only when definite priority is given to the conquest of the  ideological fortress can socialism be built successfully. Our  party haspbeen able to successfully build socialism because it  has rallied the masses around the party and the leader, always  giving definite priority to the ideological revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il propounded the  chuche-oriented theory that the ideology of man decides  everything and has constantly rendered greater depth to the work  of capturing the ideological fortress in keeping with the  development of the revolution and construction to a higher  stage. Our people firmly defend the bulwark of socialism,  foiling the challenges and acts of aggression of the  imperialists at every step.    Especially, the historical lesson of the deplorable  realities  of former socialist countries is that the cause of socialism can  be accomplished only when the conquest of the ideological  fortress is given priority. The main cause of the frustration  of socialism in those countries is the neglect of the work for  the conquest of the ideological fortress. Socialism won at the  cost of blood was frustrated in those countries because  socialism lost the powerful motive force for its development and  failed to get a solid socio- political foundation.    Historical facts show that when a country, even if it is a  big power with strong military forces and vast economic  potentials, fails to strengthen its driving force and enhance  its role by giving definite priority to the ideological  revolution in the building of socialism, it cannot withstand the  anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries  and prevent the frustration of socialism.</p>

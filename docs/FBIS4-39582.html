			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Volkov article under "Government Debts" rubric: "It </F> Seems That the Atom Is Ceasing To Be Peaceful"]    [Text] Representatives of the nuclear power industry  workers' trade union are preparing to participate today in the  "Rosenergoatom" concern's traditional monthly conference of  nuclear electric power station [AES] directors -- they intend to  ask the leadership bluntly: Either use any means to attempt to  rescue the sector, or stop kidding people and shut down the  reactors.    The point is that the majority of rank and file turbine and  reactor operators, engineers, and even cleaners at the nine  Russian AES's have already forgotten what regular wage  statements look like, and do not intend "to put up with this  appalling situation any longer." The ordinary nuclear power  industry workers have no one left on whom they can depend: The  many months of maneuvering by the "Rosenergoatom" president, his  deputies, and the AES directors in Russia's vast corridors of  power, the entreaties to the government, and the undisguised  threats to abandon all work on improving the reactors' safety  systems -- all this did not change the situation in the sector  as a whole. The indebtedness of the main consumer of the  electric power generated by the AES's, the "YeES Rossii" Russian  joint-stock company, has doubled since the beginning of the year  and stood at 650 billion rubles [R] 1 June. It's a long time  since nuclear power workers gave a thought to profit: They  would just like to survive and pay off their own debts (for  fuel, new equipment, construction, and repairs -- amounting to  R574 billion). So as to at least stay afloat, the AES directors  have been forced to economize on everything, but even this is  not saving them. Only a handful of fuel assemblies and spare  parts for planned repairs remain, and at several power stations  it is time to enlist psychotherapists en masse to calm down the  seething work force.    Just recently the union of nuclear power engineering and  nuclear power industry workers had completely peaceful  inclinations: There was the good-natured picket at the White  House, the calm talks with the government and at the Duma, the  not too insistent requests to the new deputies to be, to put it  mildly, more attentive to the AES's -- the reactors, they said,  don't burn wood. (The only exception was the Bilibino AES in  Chukotka, where several power station workers staged a protest  hunger strike and threatened, in contravention of the law on  resolving labor conflicts, to go on strike.)    However, after the latest high-level document -- on this  occasion a report on the proceedings of a conference on  normalizing the situation in the sector hosted by First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets -- proved not to be worth the paper it  was printed on, the trade union decided to reject any form of  subordination. Now for the most important question: Will the  directors succeed in maintaining strict discipline at the power  stations in the coming months? (And it is so surprising how, in  a constantly nerve-racking situation, the AES's have managed to  get through six months without any serious emergencies?)    The union recently sent a letter to the State Duma  containing  a proposal to immediately appropriate R574 billion to cover AES  debts or to reach a decision to close all the stations down,  paying for all expenditure on the reactors' shutdown, cooling,  and unloading, as well as on maintaining them in a safe  condition for the next five years. (The nuclear power workers  calculate that this will run up a bill of more than a trillion  rubles). The nuclear power workers would, of course, like to  avoid the latter option, as well, incidentally, as "vigorous  actions" in the event their demands are ignored yet again. By  law, nuclear power workers cannot strike at all, but Vladimir  Koshkin, deputy chairman of the trade union's central committee,  stated yesterday in a telephone interview for your NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA correspondent that AES workers are  "prepared for any form of protest." So on this occasion it is  possible that the situation will end not only in group hunger  strikes -- and then the government will not get away with  handing out crumbs.</p>

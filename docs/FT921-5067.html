			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fails to sustain record-breaking form Wall Street US SHARE prices fell across the board on late computerised selling yesterday as stock markets failed to sustain Tuesday's record-breaking form, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.69 to 3,268.56. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.52 at 409.33, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 3.96 to 630.29. Turnover on the NYSE was 208m shares. Declines outpaced rises by 1056 to 602, seen as evidence of the market's underlying weak tone. Traders expressed disappointment that the Dow failed to break through the 3,300 barrier, blaming the downbeat mood among investors on the rise in bond yields, which reached almost 8 per cent by midday. A later recovery in bond markets and a fall in yields failed to help equities, though, and late program selling left prices decisively lower at the close. The Dow was hit by declines in two leading stocks. IBM fell Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 after ratings agency Moody's downgraded Dollars 18bn of the company's long-term debt from Triple-A to Double-A2, citing changing customer requirements and intense competitive pressures. Merck fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 151 1/4 despite attempts by the company to dismiss rumours concerning possible adverse research findings about its two cholesterol-lowering drugs. Merck said studies of the drugs continued to affirm that they worked and were safe. But the statements appeared to have little effect on market sentiment, and at one stage trading was halted because of an order imbalance on the sell side. K Mart initially rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 52 7/8 before easing back to end down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 51 1/4 after the giant retailer announced fourth quarter to January 29 earnings of Dollars 479m, up from Dollars 402m at the same stage a year earlier. Dial Corporation firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after the conglomerate spun-off its GFC commercial finance and mortgage insurance subsidiary in a de-merger. After the manoeuvre, shares in GFC and the on-going Dial consumer products company traded on a when-issued basis. Blockbuster Video fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 1/4 on the news that a franchisee was suing the video retailer, claiming it had been deceived by Blockbuster when the latter bought another video rental chain last year and began competing head-on with the franchisee. Blockbuster said the lawsuit was without merit. On the over-the-counter market, Puget Sound Bancorp rose Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 35 after the Washington state banking group said that it had received several proposals regarding the sale of the company. Canada TORONTO stock prices crept higher on strength in transportation and financial shares. Based on preliminary data, the composite index gained 10.85 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 3,587.64, and advancing issues edged declines 300 to 278. Volume was 25.5m shares worth CDollars 279.3m against the previous 19.5m shares valued at CDollars 213.9m.</p>

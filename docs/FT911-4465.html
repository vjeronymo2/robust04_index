			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Misleading smoke signals Sir, This must be about the 10th letter I have written to London-based national newspapers on the subject of cooling towers, industrial pollution and picture editors. Your photograph illustrating John Hunt's article ('Industry on the warpath to fight greenhouse battle', April 17) about industry's attitudes to the greenhouse effect commits the usual solecism: the efflux from cooling towers looks like Black Country smoke and reinforces that stereotype, but is in fact nothing more than water vapour as anyone living north of the Watford Gap could have told you. Next time, use real and contemporary smoke. But it won't be as spectacular, I'm afraid. Guy Liardet, Chemical Industries Association, Kings Buildings, Smith Square, SW1</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: US insurer to quit Japan CONTINENTAL Insurance, the Japanese arm of US casualty insurer Continental Corporation, yesterday announced it would withdraw from the Japanese market in September. The move is part of Continental's restructuring of its overseas network after facing losses from hurricane damage and the costs of reinstating catastrophe reinsurance. It may trigger similar decisions among US casualty insurers facing huge claims for damages caused by hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. Japan's tightly-regulated insurance market has also been a barrier for foreign insurers, which find it difficult to crack traditional relationships between Japanese business and their insurance companies. Continental has about 30,000 contract holders in Japan, and its premium income totalled Y1.2bn (Dollars 10m) during the year to March last year, ranking eighth among 33 foreign insurance companies in Japan. The Tokyo arm of Assicurazioni Generali, a leading Italian casualty insurance company which started its Japanese operations in 1991, will take over Continental's operations and contracts. Continental's 50 employees are also expected to be transferred to Assicurazioni.</p>

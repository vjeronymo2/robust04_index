			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Germans fear weak dollar will hit recovery: Industry looks to Bundesbank forcut Germany's industrial leadership has been showing signs this week of increasing restiveness about the strength of the economic recovery and the effects of exchange rate distortions on business prospects. Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman of the Allianz insurance group, warned in Munich that continuing dollar weakness could 'draw a line through our calculations' for 1994. Every one pfennig drop in the value of the US currency below the official fixing of DM1.7263 on December 31 last year implied a drop in the company's sales of DM100m (Dollars 63.6m), he claimed. An interim profits report from BMW, the quality carmaker, also warned of 'considerable risks' for economic developments in the renewed strength of the German currency. 'A continued rise in the external value of the D-Mark could bring the expected economic recovery back into question,' it said. Meanwhile, Gesamtmetall, the engineering industry employers' association, warned there would be no 'sweeping improvement' in the sector's earnings this year after aggregate losses of DM7bn in 1993. Even though new data has shown orders for machinery and plant continuing to rise - they were up a real 10 per cent in the first half of the year - Gesamtmetall said the need for rationalisation was still as strong as last year. The association's gloom stemmed from a survey in May by the respected Ifo economics institute of more than 1,000 engineering and electrical companies, in which only 38 per cent said they expected better results this year. Since two-thirds of these more optimistic forecasts came from companies which made losses in 1993, the association suggested that most of them expected no more than reduced deficits this year. Although the association's warning that 'a lot remains to be done, above all on the wages front' smacked of politicking in advance of the 1995 wages round, due to start in the autumn, it echoed worries voiced by individual companies. According to Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical engineering group, price competition and currency factors had depressed prices of some products by up to 10 per cent. Simultaneous warnings from two of Germany's leading companies also suggested real concern that the Bundesbank's tight hold on interest rates - one reason for the D-Mark's strength - could damage prospects for many industrial sectors. Although most economists expect at least one more cut in the internationally-sensitive 4.5 per cent discount rate before the end of the year, this week's statements suggest pressure is mounting for a move as soon after the summer break as possible.</p>

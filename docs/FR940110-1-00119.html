			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written examination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The written examination tests prospective drivers on the rules and requirements established by the FMCSRs. However, the examination is an instructional tool only and a person's qualification is not affected by his or her performance on the examination. Carriers are not obligated to take applicants' scores into consideration when making hiring decisions, so the Federal requirement is of only marginal usefulness. Carriers may continue to give the test, but the FHWA will no longer require them to do so. Moreover, drivers who are subject to the Commercial Driver's License (CDL) requirements must pass a knowledge test to obtain a CDL, so for CDL holders the written exam is both redundant and ineffectual. Therefore, the written examination (contained in appendix C) and all related qualification and recordkeeping requirements would be removed. The sections to be removed or amended by this proposal include &sect;&sect;391.11(b)(11); 391.35; 391.37; 391.51(c)(5); 391.51(d)(3); 391.61; 391.67(a); 391.67(c); 391.69(b); 391.71(a) and appendix C to subchapter B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> List of violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The objective of the record of violations is to notify the employing motor carrier of all of a driver's moving violations of motor vehicle traffic laws. This information is to be used by the carrier to ensure that its drivers have not been disqualified to drive a CMV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDL regulations require CMV drivers to notify their current employers within 30 days of any conviction for a non-parking violation in any kind of vehicle (not only a CMV). If the conviction occurred in a jurisdiction other than the one that issued the CDL, the driver must also report it to the issuing jurisdiction within 30 days (49 CFR 383.31). Therefore, the provisions in &sect;391.27 for motor carriers to require their drivers to prepare and furnish a list of all traffic violations during the preceding 12 months at least once every year, and to maintain the record of violations in driver qualification files for three years, are unnecessary and redundant. Furthermore, it is a common practice for motor carriers or their insurance providers to obtain from the State licensing agency the motor vehicle records on each of their drivers once or more per year, although this is not required. The FHWA is therefore proposing to delete &sect;391.27 and all related qualification and recordkeeping requirements. The sections to be removed or amended by this proposal include &sect;&sect;391.11(b)(8); 391.27; 391.51(b)(4); 391.51(h)(3); 391.63(a)(4); 391.67(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Miscellaneous.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA is also proposing minor technical corrections to &sect;391.51(b)(2) and &sect;391.51(g). These corrections will bring the regulation into conformance with organizational changes of the regional offices of the Federal Highway Administration, and will correctly identify the new title of the Regional Director of Motor Carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Drivers operating in Hawaii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The limited exemption in &sect;391.69(a) for drivers operating in the State of Hawaii is obsolete. Section 391.69(a) states that ``drivers who will reach the age of 21 no later than April 1, 1976, may continue to drive within the State of Hawaii.'' Since this date has passed, the provision should be removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Part 392_Driving of Motor Vehicles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has identified regulations within part 392, Driving of Motor Vehicles, that are redundant of State and local laws. The regulations in part 392 are designed to reduce Commercial Motor Vehicle accidents by requiring that every motor vehicle be operated in accordance with State and local laws and ordinances, or FHWA regulations, whichever imposes the higher standard of care. The driving regulations and rules of the road in part 392 resemble traffic laws and ordinances. Basic rules of the road for trucks and buses are more appropriately monitored and enforced by State and local authorities under their own laws than by Federal regulators. In order to reduce duplication of enforcement requirements, many of the rules contained in part 392 should be removed. The FHWA is proposing to remove the sections discussed below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Section 392.9a Corrective lenses to be worn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The FHWA is proposing to remove this section because it is duplicated by State driver licensing laws. State laws routinely require drivers who need glasses or contact lenses to wear them while driving. In addition, the requirement that wearers of contact lenses carry an extra set of them while driving does nothing to improve safety since a spare lens could not be inserted before bringing the vehicle to a stop. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Section 392.12 Drawbridges; stopping of buses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 392.18 slow moving vehicles; hazard warning signal flashers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 392.21 Stopped vehicles not to interfere with other traffic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The FHWA is proposing to remove these sections because they are unenforceable by FHWA field staff and are more appropriately addressed by State and local ordinances. In most, if not all, cases, State and local laws provide that drivers are required to observe traffic signs. State and local enforcement officers are responsible for maintaining proper traffic flow and handling slow moving and stepped vehicles. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Section 392.30 Lighted lamps; moving vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 392.31 Lighted lamps; stopped or parked vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 392.32 Upper and lower head-lamp beams. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

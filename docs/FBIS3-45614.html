			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese legislator  Qiao Shi today conferred with German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel on bilateral ties and international issues of common  interest.    Qiao stressed that China and Germany, both important  countries, should make contributions to the world.    He said China's reform is deepening. While acting strictly  in accordance with its national conditions, China should also  learn from experiences of various countries.    Qiao expressed his hope that Kinkel will make greater  contributions to boosting bilateral ties.    He also appreciated Germany's consistent stand on "one  China"  policy.    Kinkel said the political relations between the two  countries  have been good, especially after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  visit to China.    China has always supported Germany's unification while the  latter is also in favor of the stand on "one China", he said.    The German foreign minister noted that China is a country  with vast territories and populous population, which is also a  permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations.  "It will play great roles in political field," he said.    Kinkel said as an industrialized country, Germany is  interested in China with the highest economic growth rate in the  globe.    He reaffirmed Germany's support for the restoration of  China's status as a contracting party to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Qiao Shi thanked for Germany's support.    Qiao also met and had a friendly conversation with Hermann  Otto Solms, chairman of the Parliamentary group of the Free  Democratic Party here this afternoon.    Solms said all parties of the German Federal Assembly are  pleased with Qiao's visit to Germany, hoping that the ties  between the two governments, peoples and parliaments will be  continuously strengthened.</p>

This spokesman said the embassy was not considering  emergency  measures "either for the community or for enterprises" as a  result of the group's threat of "extremely ferocious and strong"  operations against foreign tourists and investors issued  Wednesday [2 February] after seven of the Islamic militants were  killed in a police raid on an apartment in Cairo. "Caution and  good sense mean not going into areas and quarters which are  notoriously dangerous, avoiding provocative conduct and  clothing, and taking account that Ramadan, the Muslim month of  fasting, is about to begin," said the embassy spokesman to the  Italian news agency ANSA.    Also explained was that checks run on visitors to the  diplomatic representation installed long ago, following earlier  threats of this nature, were being kept in place.    The president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Cairo,  Cesare d'Ippolito, said he had witnessed no panic among Italian  businessmen, who had all been informed of the statement sent out  by the Islamic group.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> SURVEYS WILL ASK RESIDENTS' CONCERNS  </P> <P> In an effort to shape the future of Buena Park, 30,000 surveys are being  distributed this week asking residents what they think of the city.  </P> <P> The questionnaires are part of Vision 2010, a citywide planning project  recently approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> "What we are trying to do is get a survey into the hands of every resident, one  per household," said Andy Rich, chairman of the special task force overseeing  the project. "We are looking for perceptions."  </P> <P> As many as 10 resident committees may be formed to study issues found to be  most critical, Rich said.  </P> <P> The questionnaires kick off a yearlong campaign to get residents and business  owners involved in the city's planning process. Since June, a committee of 10  people selected by the council have worked to launch the project. The  questionnaires are due by Aug. 24, but officials estimate that recommendations  to the City Council won't be completed until next June.  </P> <P> The survey, which is being distributed in two local newspapers, asks residents  open-ended questions such as what is good about the city, what needs improving  and what Buena Park should be like in 20 years.  </P> <P> A questionnaire in Spanish will also be circulated, Rich added.  </P> <P> Committee member Phil Walsh said 94 surveys have been returned so far and that  the major concerns cited were traffic, gangs and graffiti.

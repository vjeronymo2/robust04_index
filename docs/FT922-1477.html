			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (8): Mice run a metaphor of the office - GUIs GUIs - with their pull-down menus, icons and overlapping windows, represented a big advance in making personal computers easier to use. Files, folders and dustbins - a metaphor for the office - have proved extremely popular among computer users, as the tremendous success of the Microsoft version has shown. Microsoft says its Windows 3.0 has sold more than 10m copies since its release in May 1990. The latest version, 3.1 has already attracted over 1m orders since its release in April 1992. Windows has introduced IBM PC users to a method of working familiar to Apple users for years. Microsoft is now reported to be developing a new generation of Windows, NT, which will be a completely new operating system, replacing MS-DOS and able to be run on machine platforms other than those based on Intel microprocessors. The X-Windows GUI system for open systems is having a similar degree of success in that market. GUIs have their origins in a series of experiments conducted by Xerox in the early 1970s to try to find an intuitive way for people and computers to communicate. The result was the pointing device or 'mouse', now a standard piece of office clutter, and the concept of the 'electronic desktop', which uses pictorial images to allow the user to find his way around the computer's capabilities. Conventional wisdom has it that a GUI makes a computer more usable by presenting a common form of communication or interface to its user for all applications. Once he has learnt to use a GUI, he knows the basic capability and operation of all GUI-based applications. Operations such as filing and data deletion or insertion are always handled the same way. The user need only learn the specifics of the system - and the standard on-line help makes that much easier. Before GUIs, a user had to make do with the 'command line prompt' to run applications. Instead of selecting a spreadsheet from a pretty screen using a mouse, he would have learn sets of commands. The system offered no assistance in this process. Once the application started, the user would need to know what commands to issue for it. This command was different for almost every application. GUIs, by contrast, use the same technique in all applications. Windows' success has established Microsoft as the controlling force in the PC world, with more clout even than IBM. Microsoft is also an application product supplier, and Excel and Word for Windows are well on the way to dominating the market-place. Suppliers of rival products such as Lotus, Wordstar and Wordperfect, forced to produce versions of their products which operate under Windows, have been put on the defensive. The similar appearance and operation of these products to Microsoft's helps persuade buyers to go for the product from the supplier which clearly ought best to understand its own interface. The latest versions of Excel and Word are excellent, considerably better than their predecessors, and competitive with any rival product. Graphical Interfaces are not bought without a price. For the developer, this is the increased complexity of programming under Windows - the manuals for Microsoft 'C' version 7, which include a Windows Developers Tool kit, weigh around 50lbs. This means Windows applications are more expensive to develop than their command line predecessors. Windows applications also soak up machine power. Operations such as the re-calculation of a Spreadsheet can take up to 10 times as long on a Windows product than on its character-based sibling. As machines become ever more powerful, this power is absorbed by the GUI. How necessary is a GUI? If its main purpose is to make the machine more user-friendly, does it really offer benefits to one who is already well versed in its use? Proponents argue that productivity will still be higher using a GUI than without, and point to the Apple - which has always had a GUI to drive it. Opponents question whether that productivity is real or imagined. A study in the US last year claimed that users of Apple machines produced much better-looking documents than PC users, but that the information content was lower. In other words, they expended more of their creative energies on layout than on content. If this is true, we may see a general reduction in the inherent quality of PC-based work, as Windows takes over. Undoubtedly Windows has had a significant impact by making the PC more approachable for the untutored user. However, the experienced user has yet to be convinced. Where an application does not need graphics and exists entirely on its own, Windows may be an unnecessary overhead. Nevertheless, as more and more Windows applications appear, it is likely to become the dominant interface and gradually throttle the older character-based products.</p>

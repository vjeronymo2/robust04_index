			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / BT objects to Oftel's network charges plan A DISPUTE between British Telecom and Oftel, the industry regulator, over the charges to be paid by BT's competitors for use of its network could cast a shadow over the imminent sale of the government's remaining stake in the company. The argument, set off yesterday by Oftel's draft plans to guarantee competitors fair access to BT's network, is unlikely to be resolved before the BT3 sale next month. Although stock market analysts believe Oftel's plans have no significant implications for BT's profitability, potential investors will be warned of them in the prospectus. Oftel stops short of calling for BT to be broken up. But it wants to see the network and retailing sides of BT's business accounted for separately, with annual accounts for each published to Companies Act standard, and provisions to prevent BT from discriminating in its network charges between its own retail arm and other operators. Mr Don Cruickshank, the new director-general of Oftel, said: 'Our aim is to obtain the best possible deal for customers in terms of quality, choice and value for money. Key to promoting competition are the terms and conditions upon which operators can connect with BT's network.' Although prepared to publish and justify tariffs for new entrants, BT believes the proposed rules are too complex. It also objects to the reserve powers Mr Cruickshank proposes to take to impose a settlement in cases of disagreement. BT said: 'As a matter of principle we are against the further extension of Oftel's discretionary powers outlined in the document because they create uncertainty and unpredictability for BT and competitors alike.' BT also objects to the method to be used for determining charges for competitors in areas - such as London - where for historic or regulatory reasons BT's retail prices are out of line with its costs. Mr Cruickshank yesterday appeared unwilling to back down on the principles behind the proposals. 'BT protests too much,' he said, adding that the existing regulatory regime was 'slightly short of what is needed to promote efficient competition'. Neither side believes the dispute will reach an impasse and require a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. BT and other operators have five weeks to comment on the plans. The issue of inter-connection charges was originally a battle between BT and Mercury, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary which now has about 8 per cent of the UK telephone market. Since the government decided to end the UK's telecoms duopoly two years ago, however, numerous new entrants have been licensed, most of them requiring access to the BT network. BT has a near monopoly of local telephone connections. Mr Gordon Owen, chairman of Energis, the National Grid subsidiary which recently gained a licence to erect a national telecoms network on its electricity pylons, called for a published set of inter-connection tariffs, with a right of appeal to Oftel in cases of perceived discrimination.</p>

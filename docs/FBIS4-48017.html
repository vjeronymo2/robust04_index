			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff General Robert Mboma has urged  persons living along the border not to fear developments  unfolding in some neighboring states. He stated this today in  Bukoba, while meeting with commanders and servicemen from the  Tanzania People's Defense Force [TPDF] at (Ramusenye) and  Kaboya, following an expression of concern by the public.    General Mboma told the servicemen they must strengthen their  defenses to assuage the fears of those people living in areas  bordering certain neighboring countries, some of whom had  decided to move away from their home districts. He said that  people must be confident, since the TPDF had the task of  defending the Constitution, the country's borders, and its  citizens.    Regarding the Rusumo Bridge, he asked them to consolidate  their defenses and to ensure that the bridge was not destroyed,  as its destruction would be a disgrace to the TPDF.</p>

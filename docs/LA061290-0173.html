BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INFOTECH UNVEILS NEW SOFTWARE  </P> <P> Infotechnology Inc. today unveiled a new product for the investment community  that combines financial information, market data and video coverage of business  news on a single screen.  </P> <P> Infotech described the product, FNN:PRO, as an "industry first" that allows  users to watch the video coverage of business events on a window built into the  split screen of an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer.  </P> <P> FNN:PRO's software creates up to 16 windows on a color monitor, so that brokers  can watch the video feed and monitor simultaneously a number of quotations and  news services, such as UPI, Dow Jones and Reuters.  </P> <P> "It is the first service that allows users to watch a video business news  program and follow quotations at the same time," Infotech Chairman Earl Brian  said. "That is what will lead the broker to action."  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Private View: Breakfast with a one-man welfare state To be invited to breakfast and discover your host making tea and toast in his dinner jacket is mildly disconcerting, especially if he is nearly 79 years old. Could the famously unconventional Michael Young (less well known as Lord Young of Dartington) have just returned from an all-night, end-of-term, party? Unfortunately, no. He was just saving time ahead of an evening engagement at Glyndebourne opera. But since it is nearly the end of term and since it is also the 25th anniversary of the Open University, the creation of which Michael Young inspired (the OU now boasts more than 200,000 students and has been copied in 30 countries), it seemed a good time to find out what this remarkable entrepreneur was up to. Lord Young is too gentle for an entrepreneur, too modest for a visionary. Listening to the thin, quiet voice it was hard to picture the social revolutionary who, among other things, drafted the 1945 Labour Party manifesto founding Britain's welfare state, coined the word 'meritocracy' (to warn of its dangers) and created the Consumers' Association with its enormously successful magazine, Which?. He has a talent for originality rare in a conformist world. He sees what is happening rather than what ought to be happening, describes what is lacking, and sets about creating an organisation to supply it. It is a one-man welfare state. One of his latest wheezes - a prediction, really, for the next century  - is the 'open school'. It is his solution to the problems of truancy, disruption and academic failure and modelled on the Open University principle that every student is a volunteer, not a conscript. Children are growing up sooner, Lord Young observes, but the time they spend in schools gets longer. Therefore they should, if they wish, be able to leave at any point after primary level and do something socially useful under supervision - including learning from home - until they are ready to resume formal studies later in life. Utopian, or barmy? From any other mouth such an idea would be mocked to death. But similar schemes are emerging already. 'I suppose I am influenced by the fact that I was at a school where there was little or no compulsion,' Lord Young explained. He was referring to Dartington Hall School, the progressive establishment in Devon (recently closed after a series of scandals). 'We didn't have to attend classes unless we wanted to. And one was encouraged to learn through undertaking projects of various kinds. So when I was 13 or so I mainly worked on a poultry farm, in the woods. I also set up a motorcycle repair business and bought and sold motorcycles. Through the chickens I learnt elementary book-keeping and how not to make a terrible loss. 'I was certainly happy there. I think happiness is a good goad to learning. It put the idea in my mind how much more swiftly people learn if they really want to and how it can be spoilt for them if they have to. What may be awful at 10 may be very agreeable at 13, and so on. Children don't develop at the same rate.' You went to some classes at Dartington I suppose? 'I went to a few, mmm. I was mainly interested in painting.' He indicated a youthful landscape on the sitting room wall and told me he had a studio full of pictures. 'And I was interested in philosophy. If there were any compulsory classes they were in philosophy. Bertrand Russell's children were there too. He was quite a frequent visitor and sometimes joined in the classes.' What about the learning gaps? Lord Young's example was not persuasive: he recalled visiting Blenheim Palace as a youth with Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins and marvelling at their knowledge of the painters displayed there. Gaps or no, Michael Young was able to get a degree at the London School of Economics while simultaneously qualifying as a barrister. Unfit for military service because of asthma, he ran the think-tank Political and Economic Planning during the second world war, joining Labour Party headquarters as research director at the end. He became disillusioned with politics and the outcome of the nationalisation which he had himself fostered. So he turned to sociology, achieved a doctorate, and lectured for a while at Cambridge. He calls himself a 'libertarian socialist'. Open schools sounded fine, I said, but with the demands of today's economy could we wait for children to feel ready to learn? 'But you can't train someone, not effectively, who doesn't want to be trained,' he replied. 'It's not that I'm against schools, or education or anything. I just like them to be attractive. If one was to abolish compulsory education altogether most young children would certainly go. You just have to see what pleasure children of three get at nursery school. 'You would have to introduce this sort of thing gradually. People would be nervous, and rightly, about the minority of children who might escape the system altogether. Clearly there are a lot of children for whom the standard diet is satisfactory. They take to it beautifully. It would be awful if any changes were to upset that. 'In essence they are volunteering. So they've got to be catered for along with the rest. You can't just have everyone walking in the woods and coming back with nice charcoal sketches.' He laughed. What about 'workfare'? Lord Young's voice adopted a stentorian authority as he pretended to address a defaulter: 'Yes. You don't look after people with Alzheimer's disease. You haven't learned how to look after a trout fishery in north Wales. You have refused to go to Africa to help with the irrigation scheme in Rwanda. There's something wrong with you, John] You can't expect us to keep you if you don't do anything at all.' It was not only his schooling which was unconventional. Michael Young's father was an Australian violinist who turned music critic. His Irish mother separated from his father, after falling for a Russian Bolshevik with a flashing smile, and lived the bohemian life: love affairs, painting, partying and teaching at the Workers Educational Association. I asked her son what, in founding 30 or more organisations, he had been trying to do all these years. 'God knows. Maybe he doesn't. I've obviously tried to meet a need. I think I've got a rather keen sense of the market - usually not a commercial market  -or of a demand that can be met by some innovation. I've always been motivated by opposition.' He is also moved by what he calls 'the wonderful potential in all of us that isn't being realised'. 'And I think there has been a sort of communitarian or collectivist theme. I've always thought that co-operatives were, on principle, the best sort of organisation for economic and social purposes.' So the Consumers Association is an information co-operative whose members act as guinea-pigs for each other's purchases. The Advisory Centre for Education monitors schools, the College of Health medical treatment. His University of the Third Age, set up with the social historian Peter Laslett, has retired people teaching each other. On his 'brain trains' it is the commuters. He recognises, however, the failure of most workers' co-operatives. That had been a disappointment, he said. Are people fundamentally collaborative or selfish? 'Both. But I think what we've played up is the selfish side of it, and the collaborative side has been played down. The way we think about society and manage it - I think the whole thing is out of balance.' Many people must think of doing something when their toaster doesn't work, I said. But you go and start an organisation. What makes you different? 'What I learned from Dartington is the practical, or administrative sense. I don't think I'm a good administrator of something which is routine but I think I'm a good administrator of something which isn't yet born because I have a rather good head for detail.' And because you know how to work the system? 'I can often see where with small effort you can achieve a relatively large result.' He guards against failure by looking for people to find fault with his schemes. 'The most valuable people in any new enterprise are those who think it's no good.' You seem to enjoy creating these bodies as much as seeing the benefits, I said. 'Once something's going, if it is going, I'm happy to leave it. Unfortunately I find it difficult not to keep thinking of things to be done. They come streaming into my mind.' His latest project is to improve the rites of death. It may have less to do with his age than with the premature death exactly a year ago of his second wife, Sasha Moorsom. It is obvious he misses her a great deal. 'I would have liked to have died before her and to change places with her if one of us had to die,' he said, almost whispering. He spent hours in research at crematoria watching the hurried routine enforced by the expense of the machinery. 'Binding people to the pace of the machine can give a very inhuman result,' he said. 'It is even more terrible than I thought.' His National Funerals College, launched this month, aims to remedy that by putting clergy, funeral directors, counsellors and crematorium managers together. There is yet another project on the books, to do with the beginning of life. But that is still a a secret.</p>

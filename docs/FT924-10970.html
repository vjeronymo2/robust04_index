			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Bundesbank policies under fire: Top economic institutes urge rapid interest rate cut to reverse downturn GERMANY'S five leading economic research institutes yesterday questioned the very foundation of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy and urged a rapid relaxation in interest rates to reverse the current economic downturn. They also warned that the German government and federal states would fail to reduce the overall public sector deficit next year and called for severe restraint in unions' wage demands to keep them below the current rate of inflation. In one of their most critical economic reports of recent times, the institutes warned that growth next year was likely to slow to 0.5 per cent, from a 1.5 per cent forecast increase in gross domestic product in 1992. Even that gloomy forecast is based on the assumption that the Bundesbank will set a higher target for the growth of money supply, and that interest rates will decline - steadily in the long-term capital markets, and sharply in the short-term money markets. The key element in the institutes' autumn report is a critique of the central bank's reliance on the M3 measure of money supply, which includes short-term deposits as well as current accounts and cash in circulation. They say that, in fixing its money supply target, the bank has failed to make sufficient allowance for the increase in state-controlled prices in east Germany necessary to bring them up to west German levels. 'The importance of all those additional transactions arising from the increase in administered prices, such as rents and heating costs, was under-estimated,' they say. 'Monetary policy must make available additional money supply to correspond with growth in the nominal volume of transactions.' They also say that, because of additional distortions, including the abnormal attraction of short-term deposits (because short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates), the restricted M1 measure would be a better guide to monetary policy. The arguments were partially accepted yesterday by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's director responsible for economic research. He said the bank's own investigations had shown 'some distortions' in M3 in recent months. But he insisted the excess growth was only 'partly tolerable' and rejected using M1 rather than M3 as a guideline. Dr Heiner Flassbeck, of the DIW institute in Berlin, also warned against a protracted debate on tax rises. He said a rapid decision on tax reform was needed, to ensure a fairer distribution of the burden of German unification costs and provide an incentive for trade unions to restrain wage rises. Mr Kohl's initiative was also sharply criticised by the BDI, the German industry federation, which said: 'Announcing future tax increases without enacting the necessary cuts in public spending further endangers the frail German economy.' The institutes' report forecasts an increase in the overall public sector deficit from DM95.5bn (Pounds 39bn) this year to DM100bn in 1993. As for transfers to support the east German economy, it suggests they will reach DM163bn this year, and DM161bn in 1993, compared with DM132bn in 1991.

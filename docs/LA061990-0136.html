			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRADCO REPORTS LOSS OF $28 MILLION, SUES XEROX OVER A PATENT  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc., battered by the loss of its largest customer, reported a  $28.6-million loss for the fourth quarter ended March 31 and said that a group  of Japanese investors had agreed to buy a 27% stake in its pivotal Japanese  subsidiary.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based manufacturer of sorters for copying machines and printers also  disclosed that it has filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Xerox Corp.,  which with its two foreign affiliates had accounted for more than a third of  Gradco's business. Xerox now manufacturers its own sorters.  </P> <P> Gradco's poor fourth-quarter performance resulted in a $28.1-million loss on  revenues of $89.5 million for the fiscal year, compared to $5.6 million in net  earnings on revenues of $115.1 million in the previous year. The loss was due  largely to a one-time, $23-million fourth-quarter charge resulting from a major  restructuring announced earlier this year.  </P> <P> The reorganization, which followed a failed effort by Gradco chairman Keith  Stewart to take the company private in a leveraged buyout, resulted in the  shutdown of a Santa Ana manufacturing facility and the transfer of all  responsibility for copier products -- which account for 70% of the company's  business -- to Gradco Japan.  </P> <P> Gradco said the $26.5-million investment in Gradco Japan would come from a  group of Japanese institutional investors led by Japan Associated Finance Co.  Ltd., or JAFCO. Stewart, in a statement, called the deal "another step in the  process of taking Gradco Japan public on the Japanese over-the-counter market."  </P> <P> Stewart has in the past discussed the possibility of making such a public  offering in Japan, though he had previously described such a step as only one  of a number of financing measures under consideration.  </P> <P> The company said the JAFCO transaction would result in an $18-million gain for  the first quarter ended June 30, and that the cash would be used to retire debt  and for working capital.  </P> <P> Stewart and other officials could not be reached for comment after Monday's  announcement, which was made more than a month later than normal and after  stock exchanges had closed. The company's shares closed up 50 cents at $11.50  in over-the-counter trading Monday.  </P> <P> Although Gradco said when it announced the restructuring that it would hurt  earnings, the $23-million figure was far higher than anticipated and far above  the $10 million that chief financial officer Steve Nabor acknowledged as a  ballpark estimate in April.  </P> <P> Stewart confirmed in February that the company had lost a major contract with  Xerox, and Gradco said Monday that it had lost $21 million in sales as a result  of Xerox's efforts to make its own sorters.  </P> <P> Gradco said it was seeking damages and an injunction against Xerox Corp. in its  patent-infringement lawsuit, claiming that it had lost "in excess of $100  million" as a result of Xerox's actions. Although Stewart said in February that  Fuji Xerox, a major Japanese maker of copiers, was still a major customer,  Gradco said Monday that Fuji Xerox and Rank Xerox of the United Kingdom were  also infringing its patents.  </P> <P> Because of the loss of the Xerox business, revenues for the quarter were down  sharply. Stewart said that "the company will continue to feel the effect of the  loss of the Xerox business in the first half of the new fiscal year. However,  we expect a strong second half as we commence delivery of several new products  in both the copier and printer markets."  </P> <P> However, when Gradco in February reported an unexpected loss for the third  quarter, Stewart called it a "temporary decline" that "will not have a lasting  effect into next year."  </P> <P> Gradco, which went public in 1983, was once a favorite growth stock on Wall  Street but has experienced wild fluctuations in both its earnings performance  and stock price over the years. The stock traded as high as $18.50 last  September on the strength of the buyout possibility but later plunged below $9.  </P> <P> The Pritzker family of Chicago controls about 6% of Gradco's shares and has  periodically been rumored to be contemplating a buyout. Plenum Publishing Corp.  of New York took an 8% stake in the company last year. And Stewart has been  discussing buyout possibilities with Japanese investors since early last year.  </P> <P> Gradco has long relied on its patented moving-bin sorter for mid-sized copying  machines as its core product, and investors were attracted by the strength of  that technology and the broad potential in paper-handling equipment for  copiers, printers and fax machines.  </P> <P> But despite a string of acquisitions in the printer field, the moving-bin  sorter still accounts for a majority of Gradco's revenues. Analysts have said  the company could be vulnerable if copier manufacturers such as Xerox were able  to develop an effective sorter that did not infringe on Gradco's patents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRADCO'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter ended March 31, Gradco Systems Inc. reported a loss of  $28.7 million as its revenues plunged 36% to $18.5 million. The company  attributed the loss to a one-time $23 million restructuring charge.  </P> <P> Figures are in thousands except per share data.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.00IN:1.89IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $18,495  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $28,861  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $89,505  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $115,138  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (28,658)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,755  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (28,108)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,635  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Per share (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($3.79)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $.27  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($4.02)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $.88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Gradco Systems Inc.  </P></p>

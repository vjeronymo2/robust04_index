			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television Business Matters is devoted to one of the most important women in the Philippines - neither Imelda Marcos nor Cory Aquino, but Elena Lim, president of Manila's Solid Corporation. Her company produces cars, televisions, plastics, and black tiger prawns which are exported to Japan. David Lomax reports on how Elena Lim became a multimillionaire in a place marked by poverty, corruption and political instability. Can it really be 10 years since the death of pianist Andre Tchaikowsky? It can, and Radio 3 marks the anniversary with three programmes, beginning today (10.00) with recordings of him playing Chopin, Schumann, and his own 2nd string quartet. Television's interest in Barcelona continues; presumably it will persist until the Olympics. In Omnibus Special (10.20 BBC1) Robert Hughes visits everyone from designers to transexual prostitutes, and talks to Monserrat Caballe. Channel 4 begins a Spanish drama, Riders Of The Dawn (11.05) which looked strikingly beautiful in competition at last year's Banff Festival.</p>

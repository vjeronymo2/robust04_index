			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> SOUVENIR SALES;  </P> <P> A PERFECT GAME;  </P> <P> EX-CHAPMAN COLLEGE STUDENT SHOWED BASEBALL HOW TO MARKET SOUVENIRS  </P> <P> A decade ago, Rick White wrote a master's thesis on the business of baseball.  Today he is one of baseball's most successful businessmen.  </P> <P> For four years, the former Southern Californian has presided over soaring sales  of official baseball memorabilia -- everything from traditional caps, pennants  and baseball cards to more exotic orange Orioles beaks and Angels air  mattresses.  </P> <P> White is president of Major League Baseball Properties, which licenses  souvenirs and apparel bearing major league team insignia. The former Chapman  College student returned to Orange County on Friday for an annual convention of  350 memorabilia makers, culminating with today's All-Star game at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> According to sports business observers and competitors, White deserves much of  the credit for transforming the memorabilia business from a marginal operation  to a major source of revenue and improving Major League Baseball's financial  fortunes in the process.  </P> <P> "There's been phenomenal growth in the sale of baseball souvenirs, and Rick  White has been the main reason," said Brent Diamond, publisher and editor of  Team Licensing magazine, which monitors sale of paraphernalia sponsored by  professional sports teams. "He's the marketing force that's driven almost all  of their recent success."  </P> <P> Major League Baseball turned a profit for the first time in decades in 1986 and  has remained in the black ever since. From 1986 to 1988, league attendance  jumped 11.5%, and radio and television revenue increased 33.5%.  </P> <P> But the gains in attendance and broadcast revenues are dwarfed by growth in  sales of official baseball merchandise.  </P> <P> In 1986, retail sales of Major League licensed goods totaled $225 million. The  figure soared to $700 million in 1988 and is expected to top $1 billion this  year. Major League Baseball, including the 26 teams and the commissioner's  office, gets about 4% of that total and then divides it based on an undisclosed  formula.  </P> <P> This year's expanded sales put baseball ahead of the National Football League,  which has long dominated the memorabilia market, according to White.  </P> <P> Frank Vuono, senior director of licensing for the NFL, said it is unclear  whether Major League Baseball is now the leader. The NFL declines to disclose  its souvenir royalty revenue.  </P> <P> "That sort of thing is hard to measure, and we don't release any figures," said  Vuono. "But Rick has done a tremendous job in centralizing and developing their  business . . . and most retailers say we're about even."  </P> <P> White, 36, began his career with Major League Baseball after completing a  "regression analysis" of baseball salaries for his master's thesis at Purdue  University.  </P> <P> "We figured out that Hank Aaron should earn the most, and he did," said White,  who had been an all-star catcher at La Mirada High School and student body  president at Chapman College in Orange. "Sometimes you have to prove the  obvious."  </P> <P> After a short stint as a public relations officer for baseball's umbrella  organization and then as an assistant branch manager with Carnation Co., White  went back to work for Major League Baseball in 1979. He was assigned to Major  League Promotions, the forerunner of Major League Baseball Properties.  </P> <P> "Things were somewhat sloppily run then," said White. "Commissions varied  radically, and the league, the teams and everybody else marketed the goods.  (Then baseball commissioner) Bowie Kuhn didn't want to clog up the game with a  lot of commercialism."  </P> <P> When Peter Ueberroth took over as commissioner in 1984, however, things  changed. Under pressure from both players and owners, Ueberroth centralized  souvenir sales within Major League Baseball.  </P> <P> Paraphernalia sales had been paired with an unprofitable media operation, which  was spun off as Phoenix Communications in 1985. A former Time Inc. executive,  Charlie Bear, was hired as a consultant for the new souvenir sales group, and  an overall marketing plan was adopted.  </P> <P> "We found the money teams were making (on memorabilia), even after a World  Series, wouldn't even pay for a utility infielder," White said. "Peter allowed  us to make a change. He didn't tell us how to do anything but said we had to  create some sort of strategy."  </P> <P> Bear and White worked together to forge a marketing plan, which was designed to  follow the NFL strategy of centralized sales, publicity and trademark  enforcement.  </P> <P> "They got a late start and learned from the NFL's mistakes," said Diamond at  Team Licensing magazine. "They've seen by far the most growth, largely because  Rick put together a good marketing program."  </P> <P> Under the new plan, Major League Baseball assumed responsibility for stopping  counterfeit goods. When the program began back in 1986, shipments of unlicensed  foreign-made baseball products were turned back at the borders, and retailers  were assured that they would not be undersold by makers of inferior products  who cut separate deals with team owners.  </P> <P> Around the same time, Major League Baseball also dumped 25% of its former  licensees and began seeking more established producers.  </P> <P> In the last 2 1/2 years, the organization has spent more than $6 million to  police and prosecute counterfeiters.  </P> <P> "We want to establish ourselves as an upper-end producer," White said. "So we  are opening our own stores and are working with major department stores."  </P> <P> As part of that move, the league last year began sponsoring the Diamond  collection of authentic major league style apparel and the Cooperstown  collection of historically accurate uniforms.  </P> <P> Last year the league opened five Major League souvenir and apparel stores, in  San Diego, Oakland, New York, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. It plans to open two  more by the end of 1989 -- one in Brea and one in Boston. The stores sell  parkas, towels, sheets and even wallpaper, as well as more traditional items.  </P> <P> In the future, White said, Major League Baseball Properties will begin more  joint ventures with players and increased marketing of such collectibles as  baseball cards and old jerseys.  </P> <P> Asked if anything could dampen demand for Major League-sponsored goods, White  mentioned counterfeiting, over-saturation of the market, and, of course, a  players' strike.  </P> <P> "We don't play baseball, we don't make money," he said. "It's that simple."  </P></p>

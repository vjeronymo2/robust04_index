			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Germany seeks energy pact THE German government and opposition agreed yesterday to set up an all-party conference to negotiate a long-term energy policy, including a decision on the future of nuclear energy in power generation. The deadline for agreement has been set for the end of the year, before the country faces a whole series of local, state and national elections in 1994. However there remain widespread doubts in the nuclear industry over whether the political parties, ranging from the conservative Bavaria-based Christian Social Union to the anti-nuclear Greens, will be able to agree on any consensus. Apart from the future of nuclear energy, the conference will be asked to propose a solution for the direct disposal or reprocessing of nuclear waste, on which the political parties are deeply divided. That question is vital to the long-term future of Britain's Thorp nuclear waste reprocessing plant built by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at Sellafield, with which the German utilities have a 10-year reprocessing contract. The all-party talks, expanded to include representatives of the energy producers and consumers, trade unions and environmental groups, will also make recommendations on energy conservation, use of renewable energy, plans for the future use of fossil fuels, and for a common European energy policy. Pressure for such an 'energy consensus' has come from Germany's leading power utilities, including RWE, Veba and Bayernwerk, which have been demanding clarity from the government and opposition over the future of nuclear energy, which now provides about 34 per cent of Germany's electricity supply.</p>

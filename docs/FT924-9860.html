			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Management: Managers unite in attempt to raise profile - A look at this week's launch of the Institute of Management in Britain The new Institute of Management, launched this week, brings together the British Institute of Management and the Institute of Industrial Managers. With 75,000 members, it claims to be Europe's largest management institute. However, the IM is more than an amalgamation of two associations. Its aim is to raise the profile of management training, emphasising the development of management competences - not just the imparting of management theory - through qualifications approved by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. As Sir Derek Hornby, IM chairman, put it at the launch: 'We have a central aim - to develop good management practices. We achieve this by implementing management lead body standards through our education programmes and by including business and management courses within our integrated approach to professional management.' Peter Wilson, vice-chairman of IM and director of Luton College's management college at Putteridgebury, is an ardent advocate of the competence approach to management training. He is also anxious to see more done for managers who are unemployed or facing redundancy. His college enrols unemployed managers, or those facing redundancy, on courses at reduced fees to enhance their job prospects and help them re-orient themselves. The IM is marketing hard its 'competent manager' programmes. These are self-study packages leading to a certificate and diploma in management at NVQ levels 4 and 5, available on an in-house basis or through a public programme offered through IM or one of its licensed centres. At the heart of the programme is a 'modular training structure', focused on the application of an individual manager's working environment. With 103 branches, the institute runs tailored courses for companies and more than 70 short 'open' courses on all the main areas of management practice. It has an information centre based at its Corby office. The Institute of Management, 2 Savoy Court, Strand, London WC2R OEZ.</p>

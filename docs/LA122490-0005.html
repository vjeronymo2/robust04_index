			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S WATER PROBLEMS  </P> <P> While water prices may not accurately reflect the true value of this resourceto  certain agricultural centers in the state, this is not so in urbanized Southern  California. Metropolitan Water District has made major changes in water-pricing  policies in the lastdecade.  </P> <P> Incentive programs introduced in the 1980s to better manage existing supplies  through waterconservation, reuse, water banking and seasonal pricing are all  part of the reason why after four consecutive dry years this region is still  relatively unharmed by the drought.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, because the drought has now moved into a fifth year, MWD has  imposed a phased mandatory conservation program on its 27-member public  agencies. A crucial element of this program is a 200% surcharge for water  ordered beyond that allocated. Conversely, those agencies that successfully  reduce water use beyond the target amount will be rewarded with a 50% rebate.  </P> <P> CARL BORONKAY  </P> <P> General Manager, MWD  </P></p>

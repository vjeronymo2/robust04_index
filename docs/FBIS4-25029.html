			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou has  established a commodities reserve system and funds for covering  price-related risks in a bid to maintain the local market  stability, according to a city government official.    Since November 1993, Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong  Province, a rising economic giant in south China, has used the  reserve system for major commodities to regulate the market, he  said.    Now the system covers a variety of commodities, including  pork, food grain, cooking oil, sugar, frozen fish, eggs,  chemical fertilizers, pesticides and farming-related plastic  sheets.    The city government has spent about 100 million yuan keeping  these commodities in stock, the official said.    The city government has also raised nearly 120 million yuan  for the establishment of regulatory funds covering risks related  to grain prices, he added.    It has decided to spend 20 million yuan this year to  subsidize vegetable production, he revealed.    "The reserves of staple commodities have proved effective in  stabilizing the market and curbing excessive rises in prices,"  he said.    For example, last year state-owned grain stores in Guangzhou  succeeded in bringing grain prices down by selling grain in  large quantities.    In mid-February this year, the city government cut wholesale  pork prices twice and increased pork supplies, thus pushing pork  prices down.    Guangzhou's retail sales amounted to 11.3 billion yuan in  the  first four months of 1994, up nearly 26 percent over the same  period in 1993, the official said.    Its price index rose about 18 percent during that period,  lower than the nation's average, he added.</p>

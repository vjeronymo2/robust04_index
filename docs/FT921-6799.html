			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to become rubber exporter INDIA, THE fourth largest producer of natural rubber but traditionally an importer, is to become an exporter of the commodity this year. Faced with an unexpected surplus, the government has authorised growers and traders to export 14,000 tonnes by the end of March. In addition, the State Trading Corporation has been given permission to export RMA-5 grade rubber from its stocks. Exports in 1991-92 are expected to total about 20,000 tonnes. According to Mr K. Ahmedullah, executive director of Harrisons Malayalam, the country's largest rubber producer, India should find markets for its rubber in the West as well as in the East. Substantial devaluation of the Indian currency and liberal export incentives have made rubber exporting a practical proposition. The Indian government took a long time to arrive at the export decision as the rubber consuming industries, particularly the automotive tyre manufacturers, which have a strong lobby, were opposed to the idea. But as the rubber prices stubbornly remained below the 'floor' level even after the price support operation by STC, the only course left open to the government to shore up prices was to allow exports. Mr KJ Joseph, secretary of the Association of Planters of Kerala, says a sharp fall in the demand growth rate for rubber, specially from the tyre industry, which is facing severe recession, has coincided with a steep rise in production. The latest forecast is that rubber production in 1991-92 (April-March) will be 375,000 tonnes, compared with 329,615 tonnes last year, while consumption is expected to rise from 364,310 tonnes to about 375,000 tonnes. That would imply a perfect match between production and consumption. But, as Mr Joseph points out, the problem arose with the current season's opening stock of 86,000 tonnes and the importing of nearly 10,000 tonnes by private parties under the open general licence. Without exports, therefore, the next financial year, starting in April, would open with a stock equal to three months' requirement, which would inevitably keep rubber prices at distressingly low levels. The only way the stock can be brought down is through export. But, according to Mr EB Unni, spokesman for the United Planters' Association of South India, export alone is not going to be enough to bring supply and demand into balance. To sustain the interest of growers in rubber plantations, the minimum price must be above the cost of production, which has risen to Rs23.66 (48.8p) a kilogram while the minimum price of the RMA-4 benchmark grade remains at Rs21.44 a kilogram.</p>

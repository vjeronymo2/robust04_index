			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Surgery for Buchanan REPUBLICAN presidential contender Patrick Buchanan will undergo heart surgery today to replace an aortic valve, his campaign said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Doctors expected him to recover fully in about seven weeks. The surgery will be performed at the Washington Hospital Centre. Mr Buchanan, 53, a conservative television commentator and newspaper columnist, challenged President George Bush strongly in New Hampshire and other early primaries this year, in some cases winning more than 30 per cent of the vote. But his challenge has faded in later contests and Mr Bush easily beat him on Tuesday in the Californian Republican primary.</p>

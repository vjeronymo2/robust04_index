KEYHAN's correspondents sent to Baku report that the Iran  Red  Crescent Society will pay all the costs of building and starting  this hospital, and in addition an eight-person medical team has  been sent to the Imam Hoseyn Camp in this area to provide health  care and treatment services to the refugees.    In discussing their observations at the Azeri refugee camps,  the Iranian physicians announced: The spread of skin diseases  among the Azeri refugees is seriously threatening the lives of  thousands of innocent people.    Radio Baku reported that thousands of Azeri refugees have  been infected with skin diseases. Quoting an Iranian physician,  it said: The lack of field bath houses, hot water, washing and  cleaning materials and the failure to observe the principles of  hygiene are considered to be among the causes for the spread of  these diseases.    According to Radio Baku, despite the ceaseless efforts of  Iran's medical teams at the camps, due to the failure to receive  international aid, Azeri war victims are not in good health and  are suffering from diseases such as malnutrition, pneumonia, and  chlorosis.</p>

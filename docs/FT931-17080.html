			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed confidence as the year ends THE LONDON stock market moved confidently to the close of trading for 1992, as optimistic messages from British industry lifted the FT-SE Index on New Year's Eve to within a couple of points of the year's high. Share volume for the half-day session was modest but business picked up in the final hour of trading when equity prices moved ahead. The final reading showed the Footsie at 2,846.5 for a gain of 14 points on the overnight figure. The final Seaq total of 228.9m shares for the half-session compared favourably with normal trading experience. On Wednesday, retail equity business was worth only Pounds 797.4m. Over 1992, the FT-SE Index has gained around 14.2 per cent, with the final quarter bringing a dramatic response to the untimely departure of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism. Equities opened firmly behind the previous night's Wall Street strength, but the day's peak of 2,846.7 was soon lost in the absence of institutional interest. However, an important batch of drug approvals by the US regulatory authorities kindled interest in leading pharmaceutical issues and provided the final boost. There was little further progress among the retail shares, where confirmation of the apparent buoyancy of the Christmas trading period was keenly awaited. The price-cutting round inspired among food retailers by supermarket group J. Sainsbury depressed some high street names. UK business organisations - including the Confederation of British Industry  -and also Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, expressed optimism for the UK economy in the new single market in the EC. By New Year's Eve, retail business in equities had begun to recover from pre-Christmas sloth as some funds anticipated a further advance.</p>

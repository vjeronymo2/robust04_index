			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Restructured NWA returns to the black NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday reported net profits of Dollars 112.3m for the the third quarter compared with net losses of Dollars 19.7m for the same quarter last year. The company said the results showed that actions taken to restructure the troubled airline over the last year had begun to take effect. Earlier this year the heavily indebted company narrowly escaped filing for bankruptcy by securing wage and benefit concessions from labour unions and agreeing a restructuring of its bank loans. The company's shares are privately held following a 1989 leveraged buy-out led by Mr Alfred Checchi and Mr Gary Wilson, now co-chairmen. Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive officer, said the third quarter was the strongest period of the year for airlines. Last year's figure had been unusually depressed by a fares war initiated by a competitor, so some improvement had been expected. However, Mr Dasburg said the substantial improvement in the result demonstrated progress in positioning Northwest for long-term profitability. 'We still have much work ahead of us, but we are pleased with our results in the third quarter and grateful to the people of Northwest for their diligent efforts to restore Northwest to profitability,' he said. Traffic for the quarter decreased 9.1 per cent to 15.94bn passenger miles from 17.54bn the previous year, but profits improved because loss-making domestic routes were cut and costs came down. Turnover rose by 5.9 per cent to Dollars 2.393bn and operating profits rose to Dollars 270.1m from Dollars 61m.</p>

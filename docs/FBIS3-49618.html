"I do not think at all that our interest in joining NATO is  less intensive than the interest of the other Visegrad Group  countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland). Many times, on  every occasion we clearly showed our interest," Moravcik said.  He was reacting to the fact that British Prime Minister John  Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had omitted Slovakia  when listing the countries which have come closest to NATO  membership.    "I would not overestimate the reach of such statements. At  personal talks with the politicians who had omitted naming  Slovakia, we were always assured that Slovakia was counted on as  the other Visegrad countries.... We really do not have the  least reason to consider Slovakia a less prepared partner,"  Moravcik emphasized. He said that the Slovak Government was  ready to sign the Partnership for Peace initiative, and a  special group of officials from the Foreign and Defense  Ministries would be soon created to prepare the special  agreement and its realization.    Asked whether or not he would discuss the question of  Slovakia's Hungarian minority with his Hungarian counterpart at  their meeting in Prague, Moravcik said that the problem could be  mentioned only in connection with Slovakia's efforts to work out  a pan-European document, because the question of the minority  status was Slovakia's internal affair.    The Slovak delegation to meet with U.S. President Bill  Clinton on the occasion of his Prague meeting with  representatives of the Visegrad Four will include President  Michal Kovac, Premier Vladimir Meciar, Moravcik, Deputy Premiers  Jozef Prokes, Sergej Kozlik, and Julius Toth, Economics Minister  Jan Ducky, Health Minister Irena Belohorska, Foreign Ministry  State Secretary Jan Lisuch, Slovak Ambassador to the Czech  Republic Ivan Mjartan, and the Slovak ambassador designate to  the United States, Branislav Lichardus. At a government session  today, Moravcik said that Slovakia wanted to use the Prague  meeting with Clinton to express again its interest in NATO  membership, and to present a proposal to intensify Slovak-U.S.  economic relations.</p>

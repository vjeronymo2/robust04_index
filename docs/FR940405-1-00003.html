The proposed revisions would amend existing regulations to define washed ungraded eggs and clarify the definition of a quality assurance inspector. The proposal would add age and disability as types of prohibited discrimination in providing grading services. Additionally, the proposal would clarify the type of facilities and equipment to be supplied to a grader and the method by which cartons of eggs are to be identified. Further revisions would update grading room requirements to include mechanized shell egg operations and to require rinse water to be at least as warm as wash water. In addition, the standards for quality of individual shell eggs for B quality in U.S. Nest-Run grades would be harmonized with the U.S. Standards for Quality of Individual Shell Eggs for B quality, and the wholesale shell egg grades and weight classes would be deleted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send written comments, in duplicate, to Janice L.

It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMS Administrator has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), because the revisions reflect current industry production and marketing practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements that appear in &sect;56.17(b) and &sect;56.37 to be amended by the proposed rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0128, under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Periodically the Poultry Division of AMS reviews its existing regulations. As a result of a review, it was determined that several revisions were necessary to make the shell egg standards and regulations for grading shell eggs more useful and efficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grading of shell eggs by the AMS is a voluntary program, provided under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and is offered on a fee-for-service basis. The grading program is designed to assist orderly marketing of shell eggs. Therefore, the standards must keep abreast of new technology and advancements in production and marketing practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

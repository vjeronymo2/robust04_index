			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE STAYS CALM, STOPS LOSING STREAK AT 19  </P> <P> Garden Grove High School stopped its 19-game losing streak Thursday night with  a 17-12 victory over Savanna, but not without a nervous moment or two at Glover  Stadium in the season-opener for both teams.  </P> <P> The streak, which had been the longest current one in Orange County, seemed  sure to end as Garden Grove led, 17-0, with 10:04 left in the second half.  </P> <P> But Savanna rallied for two late touchdowns. Leon Landry scored on a seven-yard  run with 3:15 left. Savanna cut it to 17-12 when Landry scored on a 50-yard  punt return with 1:21 left.  </P> <P> The Rebels recovered the ensuing on-side kick at the Garden Grove 40 with 1:18  left. After an incomplete pass, Garden Grove's Tim Silva intercepted a pass at  his own 21 to clinch the victory.  </P> <P> The scene of a last-minute Savanna rally was all too familiar to Garden Grove  and second-year coach Jeff Buenafe. In last season's first game, Savanna scored  on a long pass on the final play to win, 9-6.  </P> <P> "I started to have dreams and nightmares of last season's game in the final  minute," Buenafe said. "I had visions of that Hail Mary pass all over. We've  had that streak on our backs from two years. It's good to be done with it."  </P> <P> Garden Grove's last victory prior to Thursday, was over Savanna in the 1987  season opener.  </P> <P> Thursday, Garden Grove had taken a 6-0 lead on a two-yard run by Alex Ripley  midway in the first half.  </P> <P> The Argonauts missed two other scoring chances in the first half because of  penalties. Receiver Joe Squyres caught a 26-yard pass that appeared to be a  touchdown but was ruled out of bounds at the 10-yard line and come back before  catching the ball.  </P> <P> Garden Grove reached the Savanna four-yard line early in the second quarter,  but a series of penalties stopped the drive. Garden Grove was called for 14  penalties for 128 yards. Savanna was hardly better, getting 11 flags for 100  yards.  </P> <P> Squyres caught a 34-yard touchdown pass in the with 1:08 left in the third  quarter. Guy Uesegi added a 32-yard field goal with 10:04 left in the fourth  quarter and Garden Grove built a 17-0 lead and hung on from there.  </P> <P> Ripley, a junior, led all rushers with 106 yards in 29 carries. Garden Grove  quarterback Bob Ioja was six of 12 for 81 yards with an interception and a  touchdown.  </P> <P> Kenison PoChing led Savanna with 55 yards in 13 carries.  </P> <P> Canyon 10, Corona 7 -- Canyon broke a 17-game winless streak and a 12-game  losing streak by defeating host Corona.  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-3, Canyon drove 63 yards on nine plays -- with the help of a face  mask penalty and Marcus Mitchell's 19-yard run -- and scored on Fred Velez'  six-yard run with two minutes, 15 seconds left in the game. Canyon was able to  hold on.  </P> <P> Velez had 87 yards on 19 carries to lead all rushers.  </P> <P> Canyon scored first on a 28-yard field goal by Chris Snitko with 45 seconds  left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Corona scored on a 39-yard pass from Steve Bernier to Mike Shockley.  </P></p>

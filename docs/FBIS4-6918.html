			<p>BFN     [Text] The issue concerning the DPRK's suspected nuclear  program will reach a turning point by early May because that is  when the time limit is due for North Korea to respond to the  presidential statement issued by the UN Security Council [UNSC]  at the end of March. The statement calls on the DPRK to accept  additional nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA). Pyongyang recently announced it would  allow IAEA inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at an  experimental reactor, though it is not among the nuclear  facilities for the IAEA is demanding inspection. This move was  unexpected. Nevertheless, the DPRK's nuclear issue may enter a  severe phase depending on the contents of the report the IAEA  will soon submit to the UNSC. The new Hata administration will  face this grave issue immediately after its inauguration on 25  April.    A top Foreign Ministry official pointed out a change in the  DPRK's attitude toward the nuclear problem, saying "Pyongyang  appears to have dropped its conventional attitude of `refusing  to talk with anyone'" in the face of the time limit.    As an indication of the change, he cited recent "soft-line  remarks" by President Kim Il-song. The president said to  foreign news media: "If the United States provides North Korea  with a light water reactor, it may make the existence of a  radiochemistry research institute in Yongbyon unnecessary"; "the  remark by a North Korean Government official that `Seoul will be  engulfed in flames' was inappropriate"; and "I would like to  visit the United States."    Nonetheless, a prevailing view in Tokyo is "it is too early  to conclude that North Korea has changed its stand." Concerning  Pyongyang's proposal to allow the IAEA to monitor the exchange  of fuel rods, a Foreign Ministry source said: "The proposal  does not include the acceptance of additional nuclear  inspections, which is of great importance. Although the  proposal may be a strategic move towards accepting additional  inspections, we need more time to find out."    Japan will be urged to prepare itself for various  situations.  In particular, it will be asked to cooperate in imposing  economic sanctions against the DPRK, which will possibly be  carried out without a UN resolution. While examining for  reference the sanctions against Iraq during the Gulf war, the  Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, and other government offices  have studied relevant laws and government and ministerial  ordinances. As a result, the government has decided to place  priority on unified actions by Japan, South Korea, and the  United States whether or not the United Nations adopts a  resolution.    If economic sanctions are imposed, a naval blockade will be  enforced by U.S. and other foreign warships. In this case, the  issue will be taken up for discussion when reviewing the  Self-Defense Forces Law and the Commodity Control Law to enable  Japan to provide "logistical support" to those warships,  including suppling such commodities as foodstuff, fuel, and  weather service vital to navigation. It will also be necessary  for the government to draw up a rescue plan to evacuate Japanese  nationals in South Korea in case of emergency.</p>

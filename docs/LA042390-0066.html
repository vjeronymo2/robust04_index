			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> PROGRAM LAUNCHED TO COMBAT CAR THEFT  </P> <P> In response to a burgeoning auto theft problem, the Police Department has  launched an innovative new program that calls on residents to give officers  permission to stop their cars if they are spotted on the road during early  morning hours.  </P> <P> Police Chief Richard Tefank said the program is intended for people who do not  usually drive their cars between 1 and 5 a.m. He said participants in the  program will be given a small bumper sticker as a signal to patrol officers  that the vehicle should not normally be operating during that period.  </P> <P> The participants will also be required to sign a form authorizing police to  stop their vehicles if they are spotted on the road during those hours.  </P> <P> Operation CAT, which stands for Combat Auto Theft, is also being conducted in  Huntington Beach. It was unveiled by Buena Park police last week.  </P> <P> The program is aimed primarily at personal vehicles, but Tefank said the police  hope to eventually include business cars or trucks and heavy equipment.  </P> <P> According to police statistics, the number of auto thefts in Buena Park has  increased from 702 in 1986 to 1,024 in 1989. Tefank said one of the reasons  that the statistics are getting worse is victim apathy.  </P> <P> If their car is stolen, people think "I get a new car," Tefank said.  </P> <P> Operation CAT is being operated in association with the Automobile Club of  Southern California, which is providing the bumper stickers. Representatives  from the Automobile Club said their auto insurance services paid about $13  million in claims on stolen cars in Southern California last year.  </P> <P> People interested in signing up for the program must bring their car and  registration to the Police Department.

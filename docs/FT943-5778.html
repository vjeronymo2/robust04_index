			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / ID cards still unpopular The British public retains an ingrained aversion to the introduction of identity cards. A poll by MORI for the computer company ICL found that almost 50 per cent of 1,029 people interviewed were against the idea. About 33 per cent were strongly opposed. Those polled (510 men and 519 women) were asked if they would like an ID card incorporating their photo and fingerprint and various personal details. About 37 per cent were in favour. Only 16 per cent were in strong agreement. The poll found that 51 per cent would like to see their photograph on their credit cards, especially men, who were 57 per cent in favour, compared with 45 per cent of women. Almost 32 per cent of respondents would like to see their fingerprints incorporated. Although identity cards are common in Europe there is a deep-seated mistrust of them in Britain. They conjure up images of a police state, and part of the dislike is thought to date from the second world world, when they were introduced in Britain. They were abolished for most purposes in 1952. There has, however, been much discussion in government about the introduction of national ID cards and Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said to favour them. The only proposals which have been made are that driving licences have a photo attached from 1996 and that a pilot scheme using cards for social security claimants be introduced from next year.</p>

As  you heard in the news bulletin, today, Hojjat ol-Eslam  val-Moslemin Fallahian, the honorable minister of intelligence,  revealed new aspects of the treacherous plot to assassinate the  well-loved president of the Iranian nation.    Mr. Fallahian stressed that all those arrested have, during  the preliminary interrogations, confessed to all their evil and  counterrevolutionary aims and intentions. There is no doubt  that the sworn enemies of the Islamic revolution are doing their  utmost today to inflict blows on the glorious revolution of the  Muslim nation of Iran. The assassination of well-loved  prominent and pivotal personalities of the Islamic revolution  has been the unchanging policy of the United States and its  mercenary agents.    The victory of the Islamic revolution inflicted a heavy and  fundamental blow to the interests of the United States and  international Zionism and it was natural that, from the very  start, these sworn enemies of the revolution would make the  pivotal personalities and dignitaries of the revolution the  targets of their conspiracies.    A review of the history of the Islamic revolution during the  past 15 years reveals the personalities and dignitaries who were  targeted by the enemy from the very beginning of the revolution.  The assassination of the regime's dignitaries, whether in  physical terms or in terms of propaganda, has been part and  parcel of the general strategy of the enemies of the Islamic  revolution to damage the Islamic republic.    We can recall the years when the enemy first tried, by  various means and by the dissemination of lies and rumors, to  assassinate the character of the harmless martyr Beheshti, and,  since it met with the decisive reaction of the Islamic nation  and the imam of the Ummah [Khomeyni] and since its conspiracy  was foiled, it embarked on the wretched 7th of Tir [28 June --  reference to bomb explosion at the Islamic Republic Party  headquarters in 1981] incident and martyred that faithful friend  of the imam, along with 72 of the best companions of the Islamic  revolution.    Today, too, the Islamic revolution is faced with those same  old enemies and they have not let up for a moment their efforts  to inflict blows on the Islamic republic.    Just as the eminent leader of the Islamic revolution  [Khamene'i] said in a gathering of religious scholars and  clergymen, satanic powers are today also trying to physically  eliminate the clergymen who are effective and important for the  country and for Islam and Muslims, and their latest attempt was  the recent incident of 1 February during which they intended to  deprive the Islamic Ummah of a prominent and effective  personality who is devoted to Islam, Muslims and the Islamic  regime, that is, our well-loved president, who has given his  life and his youth for this. But, thanks be to God, the satans'  agents failed once again, just as they have in many of their  previous plots and evil deeds.    The enemy is unaware of the divine succor supporting the  Islamic revolution and the unfailing determination of the nation  to back the regime's officials. The Islamic Republic of Iran is  marching forward with the assistance of the nation's support and  God's blessings and ultimate defeat will, God willing, belong to  the enemies of God and Islam.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 4 (BTA) -- After their two-hour talks  today Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign  Affairs Willy Claes and Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov signed a joint political declaration. Mr. Daskalov was  invited to visit Brussels.    The declaration points out the two countries' willingness to  develop relations of friendliness, understanding and  cooperation, based on mutual confidence and respect. The  declaration outlines the trends of Bulgarian-Belgian relations  in all spheres of mutual interest: political, economic,  cultural, consular etc., and states the two countries'  willingness to cooperate in a number of international issues,  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters. Mr. Claes  pointed out their unanimity on the development of mutual  relations, which will be further promoted by a series of regular  political consultations. Here are main spheres of cooperation  listed in the declaration: economy, social issues, industry,  finance, environment protection and technology. The two  countries intend to encourage investments and direct contacts  between firms, to intensify their cooperation in agriculture,  industry and power engineering and to work on joint projects in  third countries.    The two countries express their readiness to support the  authority of the United Nations, and acknowledge the role of the  CSCE for maintaining stability and security in Europe, the  usefulness of position coordinating through consultations within  the Western European Union and the important role of the Council  of Europe. They share the conviction that security and  stability should be based on the observance of international law  and the principle of defence sufficiency. Bulgaria and Belgium  declare that their "own security is directly related to that of  NATO member states, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and  the Partnership for Peace programme."    Belgium is willing to support Bulgaria's participation in  the  integration process in Europe. In accordance with the EU  resolutions of Copenhagen (June 1993) the two countries'  cooperation will be aimed at Bulgaria's admission to the  European Union.    Bulgaria and Belgium have similar views on the significance  of the illegal immigration problem and are convinced that every  state should allow its citizens to return. They should agree on  the practical application of this principle.</p>

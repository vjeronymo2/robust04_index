			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Extended family ties stretched from Chicago to Durban - Relatives of the ex-Wace chief appear on takeover share registers UNTIL THREE weeks ago Mr John Michael Clegg was one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs. At the age of 33 a glittering business career stretched ahead of him. In one week last month it was shattered. In his own words, his departure from Wace Group, the company he created eight years ago and built into the UK's largest printing services company, has caused him 'great anguish'. But the reasons for his departure remain a mystery. He now sits behind drawn curtains in his house in an affluent suburb of Chicago, where he moved a year ago from London to devote his time to Wace's expansion in the US, the greatest commercial challenge he had faced. His wife shields him from knocks at the door and the insistent telephone calls. The only clue he has given to his sudden exit was to say that 'he had little alternative but to resign', because of 'continuing rumours regarding myself and my family . . . which might be damaging to Wace'. The comments, however, are unlikely to die away. Since he left, Wace said its internal inquiry had revealed a pattern of 'potentially unlawful dealing' in the shares of Parkway Group, its main rival and one of its biggest acquisitions. Last night the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it had launched a formal inquiry into the shareholdings of Wace Group and Parkway. One task of the inquiry will be to establish whether insider dealing took place - trading in shares while possessing sensitive information not generally available. The shareholder registers of Parkway and Tinsley Robor, a second acquisition target of Wace, contain the names of relatives of Mr Clegg and others connected with them. Mr Clegg has stated through his solicitors that he has 'never acted on or provided to others any price-sensitive information', and that he is 'more than happy to co-operate' with the DTI. A number of questions arise: Nearly 4m shares were bought in Parkway in the months before Wace launched a bid on August 1 1990 in the names of 15 people. Of these, 11 are the names of relatives of Mr John Clegg - either directly or by marriage - and the other four share the relatives' addresses. Who are these people, and what led them to buy the shares? Six of these names - and three names of other relatives of Mr Clegg  - appear in 1990 on the share register of Tinsley Robor, recording the purchase of 1.4m shares in the company, a printing company which Wace considered taking over in early 1990, although the deal was not concluded. Do these purchases reveal a co-ordinated 'dealing circle', trading on information about Wace's plans? Did the registered owners of the shares know that shares were being bought in their names? Where did the money to buy the shares come from? Where did the money from selling them go? The pursuit of the answers will take the DTI inspectors not just to Chicago, but to affluent suburbs of Durban, South Africa, to a decaying tower block in north-west London, to Belfast, to Dublin, and to the streets of Sheffield, Mr Clegg's home town. The trail takes in two generations of Cleggs. But the complexity of the family connections is a formidable obstacle. Mr John Clegg's father and uncle, identical twins, each had two wives, produced between them eleven children, and Albert employed numerous aliases. The share deals scrutinised by Wace in its internal inquiry involve names scattered through the extended family tree. Financial Times reporters have followed the trail over three continents to shed light on the mystery. The first key to the puzzle lies in Berea, Durban, half a world away from Mr Clegg's Chicago home - but not immune to the pressures which have turned his life upside down. Visitors are kept firmly out behind the steel gates, inscribed with the names Jayne and Keith, and telephone callers are now threatened with lawyers' injunctions. Mr Clegg has always described Mrs Jayne Riley as his cousin, previously Ms Jayne Wright. He has repeatedly said that she gave him, from the proceeds of a family inheritance, the Pounds 700,000 he used to buy into Wace in 1983. However Mrs Riley is his half-sister, the daughter of Mr John Henry Clegg, his father, and Ms Anne Lilian Wright, of Sheffield. She married Mr Keith Riley on emigrating to South Africa. Shortly before the Wace purchase, an investment in Helical Bar, a property and development company, made a profit of around Pounds 200,000 for Mr Albert Clegg, Mrs Riley's and Mr Clegg's uncle. Although the Helical Bar shares were registered in Mrs Riley's name, they were bought by a Mr Michael Clark, an alias used by Mr Albert Clegg in the past. In 1988 Mrs Riley's 30 per cent stake in Wace was sold. The company's outstanding growth meant that the stake fetched some Pounds 8.5m. The DTI inspectors are likely to consider not just the original source of money but the destination of that profit. Among other questions is whether any of the proceeds were used to buy into Parkway and Tinsley Robor. Between May and August 1990 650,000 shares in Parkway were registered in the names of Jayne and Keith Riley, and 490,000 shares in Tinsley Robor were registered in the name of Keith Riley in 1990. However the Rileys' shares were registered not in South Africa but at addresses in north London and at the Anglo Irish Bank in Dublin. One of those addresses, a dingy ground-floor flat in a north London local authority tower block was the second key to the puzzle. It was used to register shares in Parkway by seven other people - according to one of Wace's advisers, the piece of the pattern that 'set alarm bells ringing' among the advisers. A Financial Times reporter visiting the flat this week knocked hard for several minutes with no response. Inside the open door was a small untidy room, the furniture strewn with clothes. On the walls were large oil paintings in gilt frames. A young man with short-cropped red hair, appeared at the kitchen door. He would not give his name but said he was the nephew of Mr John Henry Clegg, Mr John Michael Clegg's father, who he said owned the flat. Mr Clegg snr is registered at the address on the electoral role. The man said he knew nothing about the 1.25m Parkway shares that were registered there before the Wace bid. In nearby Hendon, is a smart detached house whose registered occupants include a Mrs Jean McHale - the sister-in-law of Mr John Henry Clegg. She was also registered as the buyer of 575,000 shares before the Wace takeover. Another 600,000 shares bought about the same time were registered at the same address in the name of Mrs Vivienne Johnston. The third key to the puzzle lies in Sheffield, where Mr John Henry Clegg spent most of his life, and where his son John was brought up. It has become clear that a total of 120,000 shares in Parkway were registered at two Sheffield addresses in the name of four Cleggs - Vivienne, David, James Robert, and Christopher Stephen. Some 25,000 shares in Tinsley Robor were also registered in the names of Mr David and Mr Christopher Clegg in 1990. These are all children of Mr Albert Clegg by his first wife Jeanne - and are thus Mr John Michael Clegg's cousins. The first Sheffield address, used to register the share purchases in the name of Mr David Clegg, was that of Ms Jeanne Clegg's spinster sister, who calls herself Auntie Noreen. She told the Financial Times that she recalled letters for David popping through her letterbox but took no interest in them and merely passed them on, she said. They were a good family, she said. The second Sheffield address, in Westbourne Road, is occupied by Christopher Clegg. Outside stands his Jaguar, with its personalised number plate. Wace's brokers handling the Parkway purchase noticed some of these dealings in the name of Clegg at the time of the deal and questioned Mr John Michael Clegg, their client and then chief executive of Wace. He assured them in writing that he had not communicated with these cousins for years. Other questions arising include dealing by Mr Albert Conroy in Tinsley Robor shares - registered at the north London tower block. Mr Conroy was one of several aliases used by Mr Albert Clegg. It will also look at dealings in Parkway and Tinsley Robor registered in the names of Kathleen and Daniel Dunne, sharing the same address in Belfast. Kathleen Dunne was the name of John Henry's first wife. The DTI's final port of call will be to Dublin, to the Anglo Irish Bank. Mr John Clegg resigned as a director of the AIB when he left Wace. Much of the Parkway share-buying went through the same broker - Porter Irvine, a subsidiary of AIB. Mr Henry Irvine, its principal at the time, handled many of the transactions that were investigated by the Stock Exchange. He says he gave a statement to the Stock Exchange at the time and has nothing more to say.</p>

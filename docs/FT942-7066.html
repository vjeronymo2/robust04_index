			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US seeks to cool Canada farm row The US has moved to lower the temperature in its acrimonious farm-trade dispute with Canada. Mr Jim Blanchard, US ambassador in Ottawa, made an unusual appearance on Canadian television to attack the increasingly aggressive tactics of Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. 'I don't think he had authority from the president and I don't agree with him,' Mr Blanchard said, referring to recent efforts by Mr Espy to secure Brazil's support for Washington's case against Canada. Mr Blanchard is a former governor of Michigan. According to diplomats, his TV appearance had Washington's blessing. Mr Espy claimed on a recent trip to Latin America that Canada was dumping wheat in Brazil. He offered to provide the Brazilians with evidence of unfair trade practices by Canada. US and Canadian agriculture and trade ministers will meet in June in another effort to resolve their dispute, which centres on a surge in US purchases of Canadian durum wheat, used mainly for pasta. The US plans to impose a punitive tariff on imports of Canadian wheat, flour and barley above a specified level if agreement is not reached by July 1. The action would be taken under Gatt Article 28, which allows a country to impose new trade curbs in cases where existing duties are considered too low to provide adequate protection for domestic producers. But it also permits the target country to seek compensation through tariff increases of its own. Canada has threatened to retaliate against a wide range of US products. Washington charges that Canadian rail subsidies and the Canadian Wheat Board's secretive pricing practices give Canadian wheat an unfair advantage. However, a number of investigations in recent years have dismissed these arguments. Despite his criticism of Mr Espy's hardline tactics, Mr Blanchard reiterated Washington's demand for Ottawa to liberalise bilateral trade in agriculture, notably Canadian imports of dairy products, eggs and poultry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Military authorities  should seek ways of improving the electronics installed in the  Mirage 2000- 5 jet fighters Taiwan has bought from France,  Legislator Ting Shou- nhung said Monday [18 April].    The Kuomintang lawmaker made the call after a military  intelligence bureau publication revealed that Mainland China  imported two Mirage fighters from France last year and has  removed electronic equipment from one of the fighters for  research.    Ting, convener of the Legislative Yuan's national defense  committee, said France apparently has adopted a two-pronged  strategy of simultaneously selling mirage fighters to both  Taiwan and Mainland China.    Against this background, Ting said, the military should  consider improving the performance of the fighters, particularly  their electronic systems and equipment.    France agreed to sell Taiwan 60 Mirage 2000-5s for about  U.S.$6 billion in 1993. The first batch is expected to be  delivered in 1996. Taiwan has also ordered six Lafayette-class  frigates from France.    Under pressure from Beijing, France announced earlier this  year that it would discontinue sales of offensive weapons to  Taiwan. However, the French Government reaffirmed that it would  honor its Mirage and frigate deals with Taiwan.</p>

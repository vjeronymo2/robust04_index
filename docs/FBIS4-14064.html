			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam's Palace Shelled"] </F>   [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Iraqi opposition  sources have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that at dawn on 15 April four  60-mm mortar shells were fired in the direction of the  Republican Palace, located in Baghdad's Karradat Maryam on the  Tigris river.    They said that the shells were fired from a position  opposite  the palace somewhere in the Abu-Nuwwas Street, which runs  parallel to the Tigris in the eastern Karradah quarter on the  al-Rasafah side. Three shells fell on the palace and the fourth  fell in the river.    Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC] sources have told  AL-HAYAH that "some members of the Iraqi National Assembly  (parliament) and some Army officers have taken refuge in Irbil,"  which is under Kurdistan Front control.    A statement issued by the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic  Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] said that "the special security organ  in Baghdad arrested Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Malik al-Juburi  on a charge of covering up embezzlement at the al-Radwaniyah  military industries plant." SAIRI sources said that al-Juburi,  who was commander of the 10th Armored Division during the war  with Iran, "was recently released after being sentenced to seven  years in prison on suspicion of complicity in the coup attempt  plotted by a number of officers from the al-Jubur tribe after  the Gulf war."    Meanwhile Kurdish administration sources have told AL-HAYAH  that Iran has amassed large forces from the 5th and 11th Corps  of the Revolutionary Guard supported by tanks and artillery on  the borders with Iraq, in the area opposite Banjwin to the east  of al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate. They added that the Iraqi  Kurdish villages of Nukan, Tuqla, Kurah Shir, and Bidlan [last  four names as transliterated] were shelled again. Most  inhabitants of these villages have had to leave before as a  result of previous Iranian aggression.    On 24 April an Iranian force entered the village of Kani  Khan  in the Banjwin area after shelling it. The same sources  described the situation on the Iraqi-Iranian border as tense.</p>

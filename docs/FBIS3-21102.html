			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rodolfo Bosio: "Fiat: 10 New Models Are Ready"] </F>   [Text] Since 15 January, when talks with labor unions  broke off and the decision was taken to lay off first 1,800  white-collar and then 4,500 blue-collar workers full time, Fiat  Auto has been caught up in strikes and protest demonstrations  and has been the focus of disputes and controversies, with  interventions by government officials and even bishops. All  this was perhaps inevitable.    As a result of this situation Fiat Auto Managing Director  Paolo Cantarella decided to run through the contents of his  strategic plan again, explaining its reasons and goals. He  began by analyzing the trend in demand (after the collapse in  1993 a recovery is forecast starting this year and a subsequent  gradual improvement), as well as the moves by European and  American competitors. All companies are resorting to  investments and restructuring, but Fiat Auto is investing more  than anyone, and with complete confidence. From 1992 to date it  has already invested 20 trillion lire and the same amount is  planned for the future.  <H5>  Strategy </H5>   The large investments and restructuring in progress are two  aspects of the same strategic plan, aimed at the development of  Fiat Auto, even in the long term. It is based on four areas of  action: Product and range, costs, sales network and service, and  the break- even point. These are the factors which Fiat  considers essential for ensuring global competitiveness,  profitability, and the conditions for ongoing improvement.    Some fundamental policy milestones have already been  achieved, symbolically represented by the Punto model and the  Melfi plant, although others remain unfulfilled. This explains  the conflicts within Fiat Auto, whose results are still  disappointing (a drop in sales and market share, full-time  lay-offs, and continuing losses) yet more new models are being  introduced and the company appears fully convinced of its future  success.  <H5>  Product and Range </H5>   Paolo Cantarella's plan foresees valorization of the group's  brands, coverage of market niches, and definition of life cycles  in line with the top international competitors (the lifespan of  Fiat Auto models, already down to 8.4 years, the European  average, is destined to fall to six years, like the Japanese).  The group's 14 basic models listed in 1993 are to rise to 19 in  1996: Fiat brands will increase from six to nine, and both  Lancia and Alfa from four to five.    According to the plans, 1994 will see the introduction of 10  new models. Fiat is to launch the coupe, the Punto cabriolet,  and the hatchback, as yet nameless (code name U60), as well as  the new Ducato. Lancia is to introduce the Dedra station wagon,  its first of this type, and at the end of the year, the  follow-up to the Thema. Finally Alfa is to present a sports  model and a coupe, plus two different models for the segment  that currently only has the 33. All these new cars, presented at  the Mirafiori plant, give the impression of reliability, thanks  also to their well-defined features.    The total renewal and extension of the range are combined  with corresponding efforts aimed at mechanical components. For  example, the Mirafiori plant has begun to produce transmissions  for segment B and C models (4,300 a day at full capacity, an  investment of 810 billion lire); while in the spring the Pratola  Serra plant (formerly Arna) is to produce the first  five-cylinder engines and later, again at the Mira plant, the  revolutionary "Torque" (base of 1,600 cc, 16 valves, 1,100  produced per day, an investment of 380 billion lire).  <H5>  Plants </H5>   The plan approved at the end of 1993 calls for  reorganization  to obtain maximum competitiveness levels from each final plant  (with an average daily production of 1,400 vehicles), quality  (assigning specific missions), and flexibility. The models for  the Mirafiori plant are Panda, Punto, Type D sedan and station  wagon, and Uno (completely knocked down); for Rivalta both the  Dedra versions; for Cassino the Tipo, Tempra, and two Tipo C's;  for Melfi Punto and Y11; for Termini Punto; for Pomigliano the  two new Alfa automobiles, the Delta, and 155 model; finally for  Arese the sports model and the Alfa coupe.  The Arese plant, still the "driving force" behind the Alfa  brand, has been assigned the mission of manufacturing special  vehicles; Mirafiori becomes strategic for the D segment (23  percent of the European market), Rivalta for the E (10 percent),  Cassino for the C (31 percent), and Termini Imerese for the B  (27 percent). Pomigliano (C and D) already produces 1,200  vehicles a day, double the capacity of the former Alfa Sud, and  a rate destined to rise further.  <H5>  Costs </H5>   Reorganization of the industrial structure, according to  Cantarella, is fundamental for cost optimization, together with  the introduction of the integrated factory and rationalization  of the system of suppliers, drastically reduced in number but  now working even closer with the firm and even in partnership  with it.    This area also involves efforts at lowering the break-even  point (the goal is 1.2 million vehicles, the number sold by Fiat  Auto in Europe in 1993), via a reduction in fixed costs  throughout the company, at the same time ensuring by making the  necessary sacrifices, maintained flexibility so as to exploit  opportunities.  <H5>  Network and Service </H5>   In order to extend and improve the sales network over 230  billion lire were invested last year which will rise to around  300 billion lire this year. This is confirmation of the  interest shown in this area, which is as strategic as  after-sales service. Various measures are planned or already  implemented, including dualizing of a number of sales outlets  and service centers to enable dealers to enhance  competitiveness, above all when the market trend is unfavorable.  Cantarella aims at 1,060 European Alfa Romeo outlets (974 today  and 840 in 1987) and 1,224 for Lancia (1,127) for 1996.  <H5>  Overseas </H5>   An important item in the investment program is Fiat Auto's  operations abroad, in particular Turkey, Poland, and Brazil.  These three markets are recording constant growth in sales and  the Fiat market share. Last year Tofas (a Fiat joint venture)  gained 47.2 percent of the Turkish market (410,000  registrations), Fiat Poland 54 percent of the domestic market  (241,000), and FIASA (100 percent Fiat) 22.8 percent of the  market in Brazil (972,000).    Fiat Auto has allocated approximately 3 trillion lire to  development projects in these areas, convinced of the  opportunities they will offer, also as outlets for products  manufactured in Italian plants (one example being the completely  knocked down Uno). In 1993 Fiat Auto exported 76,624 vehicles  there, compared to the 18,354 of 1991, and should exceed the  185,000 mark in 1996 (18,000 to Brazil, 34,000 to Poland, and  133,000 to Turkey).</p>

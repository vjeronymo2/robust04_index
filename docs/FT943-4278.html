			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spurs blame 'draconian' FA fine for sharp fall Tottenham Hotspur, the quoted North London football club, yesterday blamed a sharp fall in profits on a 'draconian' fine over irregular payments to players. Shares in the company closed down 10p at 143p after the group said pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.36m to Pounds 885,000 in the year to May 31. Mr Alan Sugar, the club's combative chairman, said the decline was due mainly to 'the outrageous fine handed down by the Football Association'. The company is understood to be considering legal action over the Pounds 1.5m penalty which, together with tax payments to the Inland Revenue, contributed to exceptional items of Pounds 1.79m. Following 'these unsavoury events', Mr Sugar said the board had decided to pay only a token dividend of 1p, compared with a 5p pay-out last time. The club chairman, who also heads the electronics group Amstrad, said he was waiving his entitlement to dividends worth Pounds 81,000 on his 50.88 per cent shareholding. Operating profits, meanwhile, fell from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 1.14m on reduced turnover of Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 25.3m). The figures were undermined by losses on player trading of Pounds 656,000, against a profit of Pounds 1.82m in 1993 following the sale of Paul Gascoigne to Lazio, the Italian club. Earnings per share fell from 19.1p to 3.7p. Nevertheless, the group's merchandising division defied the difficulties affecting the club by reporting profits of Pounds 339,000 (Pounds 208,000 losses). The club, which has spent more than Pounds 5m on new players since the year end, was now well placed 'to go forward profitably', according to Mr Sugar. Spending on the players - Jurgen Klinsmann and Ilie Dumitrescu - is said to have been financed from cash resources and bank borrowings, which stood at Pounds 2.6m at the year end.</p>

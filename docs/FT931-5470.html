			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Heineken boosted by higher prices for beer HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewery group, yesterday reported a 12.9 per cent rise in net profit before extraordinary items in 1992, reflecting higher beer prices, increased sales by volume and improved margins. Net profit before extraordinaries rose to Fl 463m (Dollars 250m) from Fl 410m the year before. In addition, Heineken realised a Fl 101m extraordinary gain on the sale of land in Singapore, after posting a Fl 33m extraordinary gain the year before as part of the same property transaction. The company said volume sales were clearly higher but it declined to give specific figures ahead of the publication of its annual report on April 7. However, the rise was due mainly to the Netherlands, Greece, Italy and to export operations, which cover 105 countries, the company said. Turnover was up 2.9 per cent at Fl 8.9bn but was held back by the decline in the lira and the peseta. Heineken has expanded heavily in the traditional wine-drinking countries of southern Europe in recent years. Higher restructuring costs in Spain, where Heineken brews the Aguila brand, meant that group operating profit rose to Fl 733m from Fl 730m. However, Heineken benefited from a 'considerable' but unspecified decline in interest costs last year. The company's dividend is to be held at Fl 3.50. Heineken said it also achieved an improvement in profit margins, thanks to a shift in favour of its international premium brands such as Heineken and Amstel, where profits are higher, and away from more local brands. This is an important development for Heineken because the overall European and US beer markets stagnated in 1992.</p>

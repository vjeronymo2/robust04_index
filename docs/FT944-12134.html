			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Baltic neighbours feel chill from east The chill in Polish-Russian relations symbolised by the last-minute postponement of prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin's official visit to Warsaw this week may be part of a new hardening in Moscow's relations with with its Baltic neighbours. In London yesterday the Lithuanian prime minister, Mr Adolfas Slezevicius, said that his country is facing unexpected difficulties in its negotiations with Russia over a military transit agreement. A law regulating the movement of Russian troops and equipment through Lithuania, en route to and from the Russian Baltic province of Kaliningrad, was due to come into force in September. But Russian negotiators have objected to the troop transit rules being incorporated into a general law which also regulates the transport of hazardous materials across Lithuania. This Baltic state sandwiched between Poland and Belarus is on the most direct route from Russia to Kaliningrad. Moscow, meanwhile, is seeking an alternative transit route to its isolated province which would avoid the Baltic states entirely and go through Belarus and north-eastern Poland. This was to have been one of the subjects for discussion at the aborted Polish-Russian summit meeting. Kaliningrad, the former German port city of Konigsburg, and the surrounding province, was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of the war. Moscow has retained control, using it as a staging post for the repatriation of troops and equipment from former east Germany and Poland. Some 100,000 Russian troops are believed to be in the enclave. Lithuania, together with other Baltic basin states, is hoping to persuade Moscow to demilitarise both port and province over time. Mr Slezevicius, a former minister under the Soviet-era government, and whose Democratic Labour party heavily defeated the nationalists led by Mr Vyatautis Landsbergis in the 1992 elections, was in the UK to encourage greater trade and investment. A priority project is construction of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) oil pipeline from the port of Klaipeda to the refinery at Mazeikia to reduce dependence on Russian oil. Lithuania is also seeking Dollars 150m to modernise the refinery whose 12m tonnes a year capacity is currently less than half used. Shell has just completed the first of a string of planned petrol service stations. Last month the IMF approved a Dollars 201m standby agreement loan in support of economic reforms which have led to rapid privatisation and a resumption of economic growth. In April Lithuania pegged the Litas, its internally convertible currency, to the US dollar. Inflation is expected to fall to 40 per cent this year from 189 per cent in 1993 and gross domestic product is expected to rise by 1.5 per cent in 1994 and by up to 6 per cent next year.</p>

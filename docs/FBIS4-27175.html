			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A senior Japanese Trade  Ministry official Tuesday [31 May] denied a newspaper report  that Japan will scrap tariffs on sheet glass imports.    The report is "totally groundless," the official at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said,  speaking on condition of anonymity.    The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN newspaper said in its Tuesday  evening edition that MITI will propose to the United States its  removal of the tariffs, currently set in a range of 0 to 6.3  percent, sometime in June.    The step is intended to boost Japanese imports of sheet  glass, which accounted for only 7.7 percent of the total  consumption in Japan in 1993, the daily said.    "MITI has not heard anything about the reported plan," the  official said.    Sheet glass is expected to be included in the expanded  priority trade sectors under the Japan-U.S. "framework" talks  scheduled to resume Wednesday.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Diet worries cut milk consumption FOUR MILLION fewer pints of milk are drunk every week compared with five years ago, according to a report by the National Dairy Council. The report blames concern about fat in the diet, a sharp drop in doorstep deliveries and a fall in the number of children, who are the product's best customers. The industry's biggest success was semi-skimmed milk, which hardly existed in the 1970s and now has a 44 per cent share of sales to households. The report voices concern that only 62 per cent of homes in England and Wales have a milk delivery, compared with nearly 90 per cent a decade ago. Cheaper milk in supermarkets was one reason for this decline, even though more than 90 per cent of doorstep customers say they value the availability of milk delivery. About 200m pints a week are drunk in England and Wales with sales worth Pounds 3.2bn - 98 per cent of homes buy milk and with the child population expected to rise this decade there are hopes that demand will increase. Total demand is slipping by about 0.5 per cent a year, but the council said its advertising saved the sale of millions of gallons and 'misconceptions' about milk were being overturned. Surveys show 90 per cent of people believe milk is a valuable part of the family diet, compared with 80 per cent in 1986, and 92 per cent say milk is 'full of natural goodness'. But 17 per cent also told an NOP survey that adults would be healthier if they drank less milk.</p>

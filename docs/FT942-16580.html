			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Water price-rise secrecy urged: Industry watchdog writes to companies threatening to exclude them from review process Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, has threatened to bar water companies from part of the price review process if they do not sign secrecy agreements. If utilities do not agree to keep secret the draft price increases which they are due to receive from Ofwat at the end of May - known as draft Ks - they will have to wait until a final decision is reached in July. This means they would neither receive a draft K - the rate above inflation by which water companies will be allowed to increase prices - nor be allowed to make representations to Ofwat for an improved increase. In a letter sent to the managing directors of the regulated businesses, Mr Byatt said that after discussions with the Stock Exchange it was not deemed necessary for companies to divulge the draft Ks to shareholders. But companies are worried about limiting their flexibility to inform shareholders as fears increase of a false market in water shares in the two-month interval. 'Directors will find it difficult to sign away their rights to take the necessary action if a false market develops in their shares,' said one water company executive. 'It looks like some compromise will have to be reached.' Institutions and companies have voiced strong concerns over the difficulty of keeping the draft proposals secret. Some estimate that substantially more than 250 people will have the price-sensitive information, with many outside the control of companies being asked to sign agreements. For example, Mr Byatt has said that where possible the 10 regional chairmen of the Ofwat customer service committees would be involved in representations by water companies. Ofwat said yesterday there was no chance of a leak from its organisation. 'We have no fears or anxieties about the watertightness of our organisation,' it said. The companies disagree. 'God knows how many people at Ofwat will have the information,' said one executive. Mr Byatt is privately criticised by companies and institutions for deciding to release the date of the draft increases, unlike the process in the electricity industry. 'Byatt has made it a formal process and the whole world knows the provisional Ks are knocking around,' said another executive. 'Professor Littlechild (the electricity regulator) has to go through the same process, but it is informal.' Electricity companies have not faced a false market developing, he said. Lex, Page 24</p>

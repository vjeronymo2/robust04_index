			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Lloyd's in new moves to settle with Names out of court Lloyd's of London is to make a fresh attempt at striking an out-of-court deal to end the mass of legal action blighting the insurance market. A 'step-by-step' strategy for breaking the impasse between lossmaking members pursuing claims totalling at least Pounds 3bn, and professional Lloyd's agencies being sued, was unveiled yesterday by Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive. The process - which at first will not involve negotiations between the parties - is expected to last a few months, with March suggested as a possible deadline. The Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market  -are seeking compensation in court for heavy losses incurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As an early concession, Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland announced the shelving of plans to force them to use any damages won in court to settle their debts at Lloyd's. The proposals have themselves become the subject of legal action with groups representing lossmaking Names saying the plan sought to make Lloyd's a preferential creditor and amounted to a retrospective change in regulations. Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton said they wanted to learn lessons from the last attempt at an out-of-court settlement, worth Pounds 900m, which Names rejected in February. The first stage this time would be to tackle the dispute between Names and those who provided insurance to the Lloyd's agencies being sued, over settlement funds available. Solicitors will be asked to verify computer figures showing sums that might be available from 'errors and omissions' (E&amp;O) policies, which provided insurance against negligence. The calculations will be controversial because they depend on the strength of Names' claims, the detailed wording of policies and on assumptions about whether the first cases in the legislative queue should scoop most of the E&amp;O 'pot'. E&amp;O insurers believe Names have overestimated the sums available, and they are opposed to fresh negotiations. Reporting change delay, Page 9</p>

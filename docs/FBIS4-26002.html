			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text of White Paper: `Intellectual Property Protection in </F> China'"]    [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The information office  of China's State Council released a white paper entitled  "Intellectual Property Protection in China" here today. The  full text of the white paper follows:  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   Chinese civilization has a long history. The Chinese nation  has a vast reservoir of creativity. The brilliant culture  created by the Chinese people has exerted a deepgoing influence  on the progress of human civilization. Over the past several  thousand years, vast numbers of outstanding Chinese scientists,  inventors, writers and artists have given the glorious fruits of  their mental labour to the development of humanity's common  civilization, making enormous contributions.    The intellectual property protection system emerged as a  product of the development of human civilization and commodity  economy and, in various countries, it has increasingly become an  effective legal tool for protecting the interests of the owner  of intellectual products, promoting the development of science,  technology and the social economy, and allowing international  competition. As a whole, China, however, for a variety of  historical reasons, began work on its intellectual property  rights protection system at a comparatively late date. After  China started reform and opening to the outside world, it  accelerated the process of establishing an intellectual property  rights protection system in order to rapidly develop social  productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet the  needs of developing a socialist market economy and expedite  China's entry into the world economy. Since the end of the  1970s, China has done a tremendous amount of effective work in  this field, covering in a little more than a dozen years a  distance which took other developed countries scores of years,  even a hundred years, establishing a relatively comprehensive  legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights,  thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not  only in establishing the system but also in enforcement.    Today, intellectual property protection is an issue of  universal concern in the international political, economic,  scientific, technological and cultural exchanges. International  bilateral and multilateral negotiations on this topic,  especially the reaching of the Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have raised worldwide intellectual  property protection to a new level.    In today's world, great importance is attached to  intellectual property protection. What is China's specific  position regarding this question? What is China's current  legislation on intellectual property rights and how is it  enforced? What measures has China taken to ensure its  international commitment to intellectual property protection? A  brief introduction to these issues will prove useful.    I. China's Basic Position Regarding the Protection  of Intellectual Property Rights    It is the Chinese Government's view that the intellectual  property protection system plays a significant role in promoting  progress in science and technology, enriching culture and  developing the economy. It functions both as an important  institution ensuring the normal running of the socialist market  economy and as one of the basic environments and conditions for  conducting international exchange and cooperation in science,  technology, economy and culture. China considers the protection  of intellectual property an important part of its policy of  reform and opening to the outside world and of the building of  its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late 1970s, China  has been formulating laws and regulations for intellectual  property rights protection, and has been participating in  activities organized by the relevant international organizations  aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in  the field of intellectual property rights. From its inception  China's intellectual property rights protection system was  directed towards the world and geared to high international  standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has  carried on its intellectual property protection legislation at a  speed never before known.    On March 3, 1980, the Chinese Government submitted its  application for admission to the World Intellectual Property  Organization, and became a member state as of June 3, 1980.    The Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China was  adopted at the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the  Fifth National People's Congress on August 23, 1982, effective  March 1, 1983, significantly marking the beginning of the  systematic establishment of China's modern legal system for the  protection of intellectual property rights.    On March 12, 1984 the fourth meeting of the Standing  Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress adopted the  Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, effective April 1,  1985.    On December 19, 1984, the Chinese Government submitted its  instrument of accession to the Paris Convention for the  Protection of Industrial Property to the World Intellectual  Property Organization and became a member state as of March 19,  1985.    The General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's  Republic of China were adopted at the fourth session of the  Sixth National People's Congress on April 12, 1986, effective  January 1, 1987. In this legislation, intellectual property  rights as a whole were clearly defined in China's basic civil  law for the first time as the civil rights of citizens and legal  persons. This law for the first time affirmed citizens' and  legal persons' right of authorship (copyright).    The Chinese Government has also worked hard in helping to  build up an international environment wherein intellectual  property rights in integrated circuits are protected. The World  Intellectual Property Organization adopted the Treaty on  Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuit at a  diplomatic conference held in Washington D.C. in 1989; China was  among the first signatory states.    The Chinese Government presented its instrument of accession  to the Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of  Trademarks to the World Intellectual Property Organization on  July 4, 1989, and became a member state as of October 4, 1989.    The Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China was  adopted by the 15th meeting of the Seventh National People's  Congress Standing Committee on September 7, 1990, effective June  1, 1991.    On July 10, 1992, the Chinese Government presented its  instrument of accession to the Berne Convention for the  Protection of Literary and Artistic Works to the World  Intellectual Property Organization and on July 30, 1992 its  instrument of accession to the Universal Copyright Convention to  UNESCO, becoming a member state of both conventions as of  October 15 and October 30, 1992 respectively.    On January 4, 1993, the Chinese Government presented its  instrument of accession to the Convention for the Protection of  Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of  Their Phonograms to the World Intellectual Property  Organization, and became a member state as of April 30, 1993.    The Law of the People's Republic of China on Combating  Unfair  Competition was adopted by the third meeting of the Standing  Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on September  2, 1993, and became effective on December 1 of the same year.    On September 15, 1993, the Chinese Government submitted its  instrument of accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty to the  World Intellectual Property Organization, becoming a member  state as of January 1, 1994. The Patent Office of China is  China's agency dealing with cases involving the Patent  Cooperation Treaty, performing international patent searches and  preliminary examinations.    The above are only part of the records of China's  intellectual property legislation and its participation in the  activities organized by related international organizations,  demonstrating the importance China has attached to intellectual  property protection.    The basic framework for China's intellectual property rights  protection legal system was completed for the most part in the  1980s. In the 1990s, international economic relations and the  international economic environment have already undergone great  changes. In November 1990, multilateral trade negotiations in  GATT's Uruguay Round produced a draft Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This signaled that a  new international standard of intellectual property rights  protection was taking form. The Chinese Government actively  participated in the negotiations and made unremitting efforts  towards their final success. In order to meet the needs of the  ever-wider opening up, China has consciously sought to fulfil  its international obligation in intellectual property rights  protection, endeavoring to bring its intellectual property  protection level near the new international standards, and has  taken many major measures to further raise its current level of  intellectual property rights protection.    The Chinese Government's sincerity in its efforts to  scrupulously abide by international conventions and bilateral  agreements regarding the protection of intellectual property  rights, and its capacity to fully implement its international  obligations have been appreciated and supported by world  opinion. When reviewing the World Intellectual Property  Organization's past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr.  Arpad Bogsch, Director-General of the Organization, pointed out  that "China had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in  the history of intellectual property protection."    China adheres to the principle in legal system that "there  shall be laws to abide by, everyone should abide by the law, the  law must be enforced strictly, and those who violate the law  must be dealt with." Still, the intellectual property rights  protection system has only comparatively recently been  introduced in China, and some portion of the population has a  rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights.  In order to better implement this principle, while improving  its legal system, enforcing the laws earnestly and striking  relentless blows at infringements and other unlawful practices,  China has spared no efforts in publicizing and providing  education about the intellectual property protection legal  system and in accelerating the training of professional  personnel in this field. In China the promulgation of every  intellectual property law was followed by widespread publicity  through the media and distribution of large quantities of  educational video-tapes and separate editions of the law.  Meanwhile, governments at all levels ran legal knowledge forums  and training classes so as to promptly make the relevant law  known to all the people. After the revision of the Patent Law,  for instance, millions of people throughout China attended such  classes, the attendance in Hunan Province alone reaching 600,000  people. The fact that there has been an increasing number of  cases involving intellectual property rights in recent years and  that these cases have been remedied through recourse to law  reflects the people's heightened awareness and the wide spread  of intellectual property rights knowledge throughout society.  In order to speed up the training of personnel in this field,  the Chinese government has, in close cooperation with related  international organizations, sent people abroad to study or to  attend training classes and seminars. Together with the World  Intellectual Property Organization, China has held more than 30  training classes and seminars, with the attendance of over 3,000  people. Programs in intellectual property rights education and  research have also been initiated at over 70 institutions of  higher learning throughout the country. In 1986, a teaching and  research centre for intellectual property rights was established  at the People's University of China, enrolling non-law majors to  study for a second degree in intellectual property rights;  Beijing University's School of Intellectual Property Rights was  founded in 1993 on the basis of the achievements it had attained  in teaching and research in this regard. An education system  for training professional personnel in this field for their  second, Master's or Doctor's degrees has gradually taken form in  China, providing the nation with batch after batch of qualified  personnel in intellectual property rights protection.    II. China Has a High-Grade Legal System for  Intellectual Property Protection    Along with its progress in reform and opening up, China has  made big strides in intellectual property protection. In  accordance with its national conditions and current tendencies  in international development, China has formulated and  fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual property  protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal system for  intellectual property protection with Chinese characteristics.  The scope of the intellectual property rights protected in  China and the degree of protection afforded have gradually  conformed with international practices and the high degree of  legal protection for intellectual property rights has been  realized.    Effective as of March 1983, the Trademark Law of the  People's  Republic of China and the rules for its implementation set forth  the principles of application, examination and registration in  trademark registration procedures which are entirely identical  with common international principles. In order to meet the  requirements of the reform and opening up and of economic  development, to more effectively crack down on trademark  counterfeiting and stop acts of infringement, and to  conscientiously protect the right to exclusive use of a  registered trademark, in 1993 China revised both its Trademark  Law and the rules for its implementation to expand the range of  trademarks protected. Regulations on commodity trademarks were  joined by regulations on the registration and management of  service trademarks; in examination as to form, a revision  procedure was added, and in examination as to substance, a  written comment system was established to provide convenience  for registered trademark applicants. All these regulations  coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's Agreement on  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. In  addition, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce has  issued a series of regulations including the Regulations on the  Administration of the Printing of Trademarks and the Procedures  for Filing License Contracts for the Use of Trademarks. In  February 1993, the National People's Congress Standing Committee  adopted the Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Criminal  Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks to further intensify  punishment for such counterfeiting and other infringements.  These laws and regulations fully and effectively guarantee the  right to the exclusive use of Chinese and foreign registered  trademarks.    The Patent Law of the People's Republic of China and the  rules for its implementation came into effect in April 1985,  expanding the scope of intellectual property protection in China  to include inventions and other new creations. In order to  bring the level of China's patent protection closer to  international standards, the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress adopted an amendment to the Patent Law on  September 4, 1992, which included important revisions.  Proceeding from the needs of expanding the opening up and  accelerating scientific, technological and economic development,  first, the revised Patent Law expands the scope of patent  protection: patents may be granted to all types of  technological inventions, whether new products or new  techniques, including pharmaceutical products and substances  obtained by means of a chemical process, foods, beverages and  flavorings. Second, an invention patent's duration has been  extended from 15 years from the date of application to 20 years;  the duration of utility model patents and of exterior design  patents has been extended from 5 years from the date of  application to 10 years. Third, the protection of patent rights  has been further strengthened. In addition to extending the  protection of a patented process to include products directly  produced by that process, the law clearly stipulates that the  importation of patented products requires the permission of the  patent holder, thereby giving more effective protection to the  rights and interests of patentees. Fourth, conditions for  imposing compulsory patent license were restipulated. These  measures mark the reaching of a new level of patent protection  in China. In this way, the Patent Law of China has essentially  been brought in line with the GATT Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.    The Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China and the  rules for its implementation explicitly protect the copyright  and other legitimate rights and interests of the authors of  literary, artistic and scientific works. The law provides that  in addition to protecting the copyright of written works, oral  works, music, operas, quyi (folk art forms including ballad  singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, cross  talks, etc), choreography, works of fine arts, photographs,  films, TV programs, video tapes, engineering designs, product  designs and their descriptions, maps, sketch maps and other  graphic works, China also protects computer software. China is  among a select group of countries that have explicitly listed  computer software as the object of protection by copyright laws.  The State Council has, moreover, promulgated the Regulations on  the Protection of Computer Software, providing the specifics  whereby the laws protecting computer software will be  implemented. These regulations, a necessary adjunct to the  Copyright Law, came into effect in October 1991. On September  25, 1992 the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the  Implementation of the International Copyright Treaty, providing  specific regulations on protecting foreign authors' copyrights  in accordance with the international treaty.    These laws and regulations have been joined by the  Technological Contract Law of the People's Republic of China and  the Law on Scientific and Technological Progress of the People's  Republic of China as formulated by the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress, as well as a series of  administrative regulations concerning intellectual property  protection worked out by the State Council, together further  optimizing the nation's legal system for the protection of  intellectual property rights, in the whole bringing the system  close to and in coordination with international levels of  protection.    China has a complete legal system for the protection of  intellectual property rights. China's intellectual property law  stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone who  violates the law, including civil liability, criminal liability  and exposure to administrative sanctions.    China's Patent Law provides that in the case of infringement  arising from the exploitation of a patent without authorization  of the patentee, the patentee or other affected parties may  request the patent administrative authorities to deal with the  matter or may directly file suit in a people's court. In  investigating and dealing with the matter, the patent  administrative authorities are empowered to order the infringer  to stop all acts of infringement and compensate for any losses.  Whoever counterfeits a patented product or wrongly appropriates  a patented technique will be ordered by the patent  administrative authorities to cease all acts of counterfeiting,  to provide the public with notification of his or her violation,  and to pay a fine. In the case of serious violations, the  criminal liability of the person directly responsible shall be  investigated through application of relevant articles of the  Criminal Law, and if found guilty, the person directly  responsible shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not  more than three years, criminal detention or a fine.    China's trademark laws and regulations stipulate that in the  event of infringement on the right to exclusive use of a  registered trademark, the administrative department for industry  and commerce can, in line with its functions and powers or on  the basis of a consumer complaint, examine and deal with the  violation on its own initiative. The party whose right has been  infringed may also, at the place where the infringer lives or  where the act of infringement took place, request an  administrative department for industry and commerce at or above  the county level to handle the matter. The relevant  administrative department for industry and commerce has the  right to order the infringer to immediately cease infringement  and to compensate the party whose right has been infringed for  its losses. If the act of infringement on the right to  exclusive use of a registered trademark does not constitute a  crime, the administrative department for industry and commerce  may still impose a fine on the infringer. If the party  concerned wishes to challenge the decision of the administrative  department for industry and commerce, it may bring suit in a  people's court within a fixed time and the court will render  judgment on the case. These regulations provide convenience to  the litigants, and, moreover, ensure consistency, impartiality  and seriousness in administrative law enforcement and judicial  adjudication. In the event of an infringement on the right to  exclusive use of a registered trademark, the party whose right  has been infringed may also directly bring suit in a people's  court. If the counterfeiting of registered trademarks  constitutes a crime, the person who committed the act shall be  ordered to compensate the party whose right has been infringed  for losses suffered and his criminal responsibility shall be  investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law. In  accordance with the Supplementary Regulations on Punishing  Criminal Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks, in cases where  the illegal gains are relatively large or other serious  circumstances are involved the counterfeiter of a registered  trademark will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not  more than three years or criminal detention, and/or fined; if  the illegal gains are very large the counterfeiter shall be  sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three  years and not more than seven years and be fined. If an  enterprise or institution is guilty of criminally counterfeiting  a registered trademark, the unit will be fined and the criminal  liability of the person in charge and other people directly  responsible for the counterfeiting shall be investigated and  dealt with in accordance with the law. If a government employee  knowingly covers up the criminal counterfeiting of a registered  trademark or if a person charged with enforcing the law  compromises the law for personal gain, his or her criminal  malfeasance will be determined by law.    The Copyright Law of China provides that the following  acts shall be regarded as infringement: publication of a  copyright owner's work without his or her permission, and the  unauthorized publication of a cooperative work as the work of a  single author; claiming authorship of another person's work  without taking part in its creation with the intention of  gaining fame or profit; distortion or alteration of another  person's works; exploitation of an author's work in any manner  without prior permission; the use of another's work without  providing the legally stipulated payment; and live broadcast of  a performance without the performer's prior permission. In such  cases, the infringer shall bear civil responsibility for the  cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any  negative effects caused by his actions, for offering a public  apology, and for compensation for any losses. Those who  plagiarize other people's works, or reproduce and distribute  another person's works for their personal benefit without the  copyright holder's permission, those who publish a book without  the permission of the owner of the publishing right, and those  who duplicate and distribute video and audio tapes without  getting the permission of the tape manufacturers bear civil  responsibility for their actions. The copyright administrative  authorities may confiscate their illegal income or impose a fine  on them. In the case of a copyright infringement or of  violation of other related interests, the party whose rights  have been infringed may also directly bring suit in a people's  court. With regard to illegal activities that gravely  jeopardize the social order or seriously infringe on the  legitimate rights and interests of a copyright holder or the  holder of other intellectual property rights, in cases where  such violations constitute a crime the criminal liability of the  infringer shall be investigated and dealt with in accordance  with the relevant laws.    With the implementation of intellectual property laws,  intellectual property rights are effectively protected in China.  These laws are also actively encouraging invention and other  forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the  protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered  trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of  trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in  China. By the end of 1993, the number of effective registered  trademarks had exceeded 410,000. Of these, 350,000 were  domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and  regions. Companies from the United States, for example, had  only 122 trademarks registered in China before 1979; by 1993  that number had soared to 16,221, more than a hundred times the  earlier figure. In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for  trademark registration annually in China, including more than  130,000 applications for new trademarks registration, among the  highest number in the world. In addition, the Patent Law of  China has greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in  China, and has proved a magnet to patent applications from other  countries and regions. On April 1, 1985, the first day the  Patent Law came into effect, 3,455 applications for patent  rights were submitted. By the end of 1993, the Patent Office of  China had handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights.  Of those, 27.5 percent were for inventions, 62.8 percent for  utility models, and 9.7 percent for exterior designs; domestic  applications accounted for 86.4 percent, while 13.6 percent were  applications from 70 countries and regions. By the end of 1993,  175,000 patents had been approved, including more than 20,000  invention patents, more than 130,000 utility model patents and  over 20,000 exterior design patents.    III. China Has a Complete Law Enforcement System  for Intellectual Property Protection    China has formulated comprehensive intellectual property  rights laws and regulations. Today, it is earnest and fair in  executing these laws, and much has been accomplished in this  regard.    These great achievements in the execution of the  intellectual  property rights protection laws and regulations are above all  the product of comprehensive judicature and administration  provided for in these same laws and regulations.    1. China's judicial institutions for intellectual property  protection.    In China, any citizen, legal person or organization entitled  to intellectual property rights whose rights and interests have  been infringed may bring a lawsuit to the people's court in  accordance with the law and receive practical and effective  judicial protection.    The people's courts exercise judicial power independently  according to law, are subordinate only to the law itself, and  are not subject to interference by any administrative organ,  public organization or individual.    Earnest execution of the law is the core of the  administration of justice. The judicial activities of a  people's court are carried out on the basis of facts, and with  the law providing the criterion. Cases are tried strictly in  accordance with substantive and procedural laws. Cases are  heard in an open court, and a collegial system, a challenge  system, a system whereby the court of second instance is the  court of last instance, and a trial supervision system are  practised. Judicial work, in accordance with the law, is also  subject to supervision by people's congresses and people's  procuratorates at all levels and by the masses, so as to ensure  openness, impartiality, and seriousness.    The establishment and fortification of the judicial organs  for trying intellectual property rights cases and the  optimization of the judicial system are important guarantees for  the people's courts correctly to handle such cases and  conscientiously to protect intellectual property rights  according to law. In recognition of the specialized nature of  intellectual property rights cases and the advanced nature of  the technology often involved, the higher people's courts in  several provinces and municipalities directly under the central  government such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and  Hainan have since 1992 established such intellectual property  rights courts as their actual needs demand. The intermediate  people's courts in all the special economic zones as well as  Beijing and Shanghai have also established intellectual property  rights courts. Intermediate people's courts in the capital  cities of other provinces and autonomous regions and in  municipalities have set up collegial panels specializing in  cases involving intellectual property rights protection. In  this manner the hearing of intellectual property rights cases is  centralized with the advantageous results that unity in  executing the law is ensured, experience in dealing with the law  is amassed, and the quality of judicature in intellectual  property rights cases is strengthened.    With the implementation of China's law on intellectual  property protection and the increasing improvement of the  judiciary's protective power, people's courts at various levels  in China have accepted and decided a large number of civil  disputes concerning intellectual property rights. A total of  3,505 cases concerning intellectual property rights disputes  were accepted and handled by people's courts throughout the  country from 1986 to the end of 1993, 1,168 of which concerned  copyrights, 1,783 patents, and 554 trademark rights. The  people's courts in accordance with the law defend the legitimate  rights and interests of the foreign and domestic intellectual  property rights holders through trying cases concerning  intellectual property rights disputes. For example, the  inventor of a new "technique for sinking piling using drill  holes," brought a suit against the Beijing Subway Foundation  Engineering Company to determine ownership of the patent on the  invention. After trying the case, the Beijing Higher People's  Court held that this invention was not a service invention as  described by the Patent Law, so the patent right belonged to the  inventor and not to his employer. In another example, Hong  Kong's Sendon International Co., Ltd. brought suit against  Shenzhen's Huada Electronics Co., Ltd. For trademark  infringement. After hearing the case, the Shenzhen Intermediate  People's Court ruled that the trademark "SENDON" was registered  in China mainland by the plaintiff and should be protected by  law. The defendant's use of the trademark "SENDON" on the same  commodity sold by the plaintiff under that name constituted  infringement on the rights to exclusive use of a registered  trademark. The court decided that the defendant should pay the  plaintiff 468,314.4 yuan in compensation.    Intellectual property rights are important civil rights.  In civil infringement cases, the people's court is empowered to  order the infringer to bear civil responsibility for the  cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any  negative effects caused by his actions, for offering apologies,  and for compensation for any losses in accordance with the law.  Furthermore, it is empowered to confiscate the infringer's  illegal gains and/or adjudge the infringer to criminal detention  or a fine.    If the infringement of intellectual property rights is so  serious that it has disrupted the economic order and constitutes  a crime, the infringer's criminal responsibility is investigated  and dealt with according to law. When a people's procuratorate  institutes prosecution for a criminal act of infringement, if  the evidence is sufficient to prove that the defendant has  counterfeited another's trademark or patent right and the case  is so serious as to constitute a crime, the people's court shall  promptly and precisely impose punishment in strict accordance  with the law. Between 1992 and 1993, people's courts accepted  743 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of which 731  have been tried with 566 people being sentenced to fixed terms  of imprisonment, criminal detention or other punishments. The  People's Court of Zhongshan City in Guangdong Province in  separate cases imposed fines on five persons directly  responsible for counterfeiting the American Mobil Oil  Corporation's trademark "MOBIL," further sentencing the  defendants to fixed terms of imprisonment from one year to two  and a half years. This amply demonstrates that the people's  courts of China are resolute in their stand towards punishing  criminals and safeguarding intellectual property rights.    According to China's Administrative Procedure Law, if a  citizen, legal person or organization wishes to contest a  judgement or order of an administrative department for  intellectual property protection in a dispute concerning  intellectual property rights and to initiate administrative  procedure litigation, the people's court shall try the case and  shall, in accordance with the law, make a decision to maintain,  rescind, or alter it.    When a people's court tries a case arising from intellectual  property rights involving foreign nationals, it acts in  accordance with Chinese laws and relevant international  conventions to which China is a party, adhering to the principle  of equity and reciprocity. In this way, the court provides the  solid legal guarantees necessary for expanding international  economic, technological and cultural exchange and cooperation.  The Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court accepted the American  E.F. Houghton Company's suit against the Shenzhen Hailian  Chemical Co., Ltd. for the latter's trademark violations.  Investigation proved the defendant's infringement and held it  responsible. The two parties negotiated a settlement through  mediation. The defendant promptly stopped its acts of  infringement, offered public apology to the plaintiff, and  handed over 130,000 yuan as a compensation for the plaintiff's  economic loss. The court, in addition, adjudged the defendant a  civil sanction fine. Ten days passed from the court's  acceptance of the case to its resolution, expeditious remedy  much appreciated by the American plaintiff. In acknowledgement  of this, the E.F. Houghton Company presented the court with a  silk banner reading: "Chinese law is just; judges try cases  expeditiously."    Over the past few years, in an effort to raise the level of  the administration of justice, the people's courts have adopted  a series of potent measures to improve their quality and  efficiency in handling cases. In order to amplify their impact,  the people's courts have selected typical cases and tried them  publicly, conducting information campaigns through the various  public media. Undeniable social effects have been achieved  through the use of specific cases in the popularization of legal  education and the dignity of the socialist legal system has been  maintained.    2. Administrative channels for intellectual property  protection in China.    In addition to judicature in accordance with international  practices, China's system for the protection of intellectual  property rights comprises the Patent Law, the Trademark Law, and  the Copyright Law and other administrative channels designated  in intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's  actual conditions.    Under the Patent Law, the competent authorities in the State  Council and local people's governments have the right to  establish patent offices. Today, China has more than 50 patent  offices established by local governments and more than 20 patent  offices established by various ministries and departments under  the State Council. The State Copyright Administration and local  copyright administrative organs have been established in  accordance with the Copyright Law. Trademark administration  calls for unified registration of trademarks by the central  government and level-by-level administration by the various  local governments. Trademark administrative departments under  the administrative bureaus for industry and commerce have been  established at the central, provincial, city, prefectural and  county levels; below the county level, there are administrative  offices for industry and commerce. Today, there are well over  7,000 full-time trademark administration personnel throughout  China, in addition to 300,000 part-time personnel.    Chinese intellectual property rights administrative  departments exercise their legally stipulated powers and  functions to safeguard law and order within the field of  intellectual property, encourage fair competition, mediate  disputes, settle cases involving violations of intellectual  property rights, and protect the interests of the broad masses  of the people by maintaining a good social and economic  environment.    In China the administrative procedures for solving disputes  concerning intellectual property rights are simple and  convenient. Cases can be quickly filed for official examination  and possible prosecution, investigation follows promptly, and  efficiency in handling the case is high. This is advantageous  to the owners of the rights. The patent administrative organs  in China always treat patent violation claims seriously and deal  with them without delay in accordance with the law.    Since the Copyright Law was put into force, local  administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs  investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases involving  pirated books and video products from June 1991 to the end of  1993. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and  levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. In 1994, the  Chinese Government has organized the departments concerned to  launch an assault, investigating and dealing with the illegal  duplication of laser discs and illegal reproduction of books.  In April 1994 in Guangdong Province, the administrative  departments in charge of copyrights, cultural affairs,  broadcast, film and video-tapes, the administrative departments  for industry and commerce, and public security departments took  joint action to deal with the illegal duplication of laser  discs. Subsequently, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Hunan also took  actions to deal with these problems. These measures dealt a  heavy blow to the production and selling of pirated products.  Over this same period, relevant departments of the Chinese  Government took steps to strengthen administration over the  establishment of enterprises manufacturing compact discs and  supervision over their production in accordance with the law.    The Trademark Law of China has been in effect for more  than ten years. During this time, the administrative  departments for industry and commerce have dealt with 130,000  cases of trademark violation and counterfeiting, including a  number of particularly serious cases, e.g. Trademark violations  or counterfeited trademarks for "Zhonghua" cigarettes, for  "Forever," "Phoenix" and "Flying Pigeon" bicycles, for "Guizhou  Maotai" wine, and for "Xingkaihe" ginseng. Effective protection  was thus given to the lawful rights and interests of the  registered trademark owners.    China's intellectual property rights administrative organs,  in accordance with Chinese laws and relevant international  treaties to which China is a party, adhering to the principle of  equal treatment for nationals and non-nationals and reciprocity,  give protection to foreigners' intellectual property rights in  accordance with the law. For instance, the Zhejiang Provincial  Patent Administration Office recently reached a just settlement  in a complaint brought by a foreign plaintiff concerning  unlicensed production of a cigarette lighter to which he held  patent. The competent authorities ordered the factory concerned  to cease all acts of infringement and compensate the foreigner  for his losses. The State Copyright Administration investigated  and then dealt with a series of cases in which a dozen odd arts  and crafts factories in Fujian and Guangdong had manufactured  pirated toys copying several foreign companies' toy designs, and  a case in which an electronics enterprise in Jiangsu was  illegally producing compact discs. Administrative departments  for industry and commerce have investigated and dealt with 3,000  cases involving the counterfeiting and other violations of such  foreign trademarks as TDK, Toshiba, Sony, IBM, 3M, ESSO, P&amp;G,  Head &amp; Shoulders, Xiaotiancai, and Philips.    A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of  foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and  dealt with by China's intellectual property protection  administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in  accordance with their prescribed functions and powers.    China's administrative departments for industry and commerce  have undertaken the responsibility of maintaining economic order  and can make market investigations on their own initiative so as  to effectively protect the rights of the registered trademark  owners. Since 1988, administrative organs for industry and  commerce at various levels in Guangdong Province have  investigated and dealt with 30l cases concerning the violation  of U.S.-owned trademarks. Out of these 301 cases, one third were  filed by the American trademark owners, with the remaining cases  being the product of market investigations by the administrative  organs for industry and commerce or consumer complaints.  China's intellectual property rights administrative offices are  impartial, and firmly safeguard the lawful rights and interests  of those who hold such rights. This has earned them praises  from many foreign enterprises and joint ventures. Some of these  companies presented the administrative departments for industry  and commerce silk banners or gilt boards, bearing words of  praise such as "upright and honest, firm as a rock in  administering justice," "impartiality in enforcing the law,  support right, eliminate wrong," "just settlement, protection of  commerce," "strict and impartial justice, conqueror of fakes and  frauds," and "strict and impartial in executing the law,  consummate impartiality." They praised the personnel handling  the cases as "conscientious in work and resolute in action,"  "such speed in handling a case is seldom encountered anywhere in  the world," etc.    Concluding Remarks    As China implements its reform and opening to the outside  world, it is changing with each passing day. Today more than a  few international observers have come to the conclusion that in  terms of intellectual property protection China has reached  international advanced levels. China's backwardness in its  intellectual property system is now a thing of the past.    However, there remain some naysayers in the world seemingly  willfully blind to China's development and transformation who  incognizant of present realities pass improper judgements on the  nation's current situation regarding intellectual property  protection. They allege that China has not yet established a  "full and effective intellectual property system," and that  China "lacks the ability to undertake international  obligations." Such unfounded opinions do not bear argument; the  truth speaks for itself.    Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the  achievements it has already made. China is a developing country  and still has much work towards optimizing its intellectual  property system. This system in its modern form was established  only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of  intellectual property rights remains underdeveloped in society  at large. In some regions and in some governmental departments  there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of  intellectual property protection. Some serious acts of  infringement have violated not only the legitimate rights and  interests of the holder of the intellectual property right, but  also the dignity of the law. Accordingly, even as the nation  continues to otherwise improve the intellectual property legal  system, the State Council has drawn up Decisions on Further  Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property. China is  confident that the implementation of all the important measures  contained in the Decisions will mark a great new step forward in  the nation's efforts to ensure the protection of intellectual  property rights.    China will continue actively to promote international  cooperation in the field of intellectual property. China itself  has received active assistance from the World Intellectual  Property Organization and from others working in the field in  establishing and fine-tuning its intellectual property rights  protection system. The nation will, as in the past, actively  join in the activities of relevant international organizations  and fulfil the obligations described in the international  intellectual property treaties and agreements. Operating on the  basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and in  accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit,  China will continue to cooperate with the rest of the world's  nations, working and making positive contributions towards the  development and optimization of the international intellectual  property system.</p>

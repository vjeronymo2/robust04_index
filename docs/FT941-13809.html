			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Half of dairy farmers join co-op Almost half the 28,500 dairy farmers in England and Wales have now signed to join Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative which is to be formed from the Milk Marketing Board. The board, the monopoly buyer of milk for distribution and processing for more than 60 years, meets the government today to complete changes to its plans to turn itself into Milk Marque. Government objections to its original plans have set back introduction of competition to the market from April to August or October. But Britain's largest dairy companies are already scrambling to secure milk supplies before the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales becomes a competitive free-for-all. Many companies are promising farmers higher prices for their milk, which could lead to a rise in the price of the doorstep pint. But many farmers believe they should stick together in the face of the powerful dairies. Mr George Harrison, a dairy farmer from Clifton in Cumbria, said: 'By joining Milk Marque, I was thinking that as farmers we'd all hold together and that way keep our power. But there's always a small minority that think otherwise and go for the extra money.' Mr Chris Wood, a neighbouring producer, is one of the dairy farmers attracted by the extra cash. He plans to sell his milk to a cheesemaking plant in Appleby which is run by Express Dairies. Express has offered him a premium above the price paid by Milk Marque, giving him an extra Pounds 2,000 in the first year. With milk supply in England and Wales limited to 85 per cent of the market's needs by Brussels quotas, dairies will have to pay more money for their supplies in the free market - the current system for setting wholesale prices keeps them artificially low. Low wholesale prices have led to widespread overcapacity in the dairy processing industry - estimates put it at between 30 per cent and 60 per cent. Intense competition for milk supplies is expected to see the closure of many processing plants. Mr Richard Atkinson, another Cumbrian dairy farmer, said that is why he has decided not to tie himself to the local Appleby plant, but is leaning towards signing with Nestle. 'Nestle has enormous financial backing and has a strategy of concentrating in the UK and Holland - you're assured of a market,' he said. While the shake-out in the industry is likely to favour the bigger, stronger dairies, producers fear the days of the smaller farmer are also numbered. Since transport costs make up the bulk of the expense of handling liquid milk, it is more economic for the dairies to send tankers out to the bigger farmers rather than make many small collections.</p>

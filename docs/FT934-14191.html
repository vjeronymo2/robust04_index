			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3): A triumph for the EC's liberal conscience - Impact of liberalisation - Europe's business community seems to take a simple view about telecom services, the more competition, the faster, the better FOR EUROPE'S telecommunications industry, the red-letter day of the decade is January 1, 1998. That is the deadline agreed by the European Community for exposing existing voice telephony operators to competition in their home markets. From one perspective, agreement on the 1998 deadline was a triumph for the European Community's liberal conscience, championed in this instance by Britain, the Netherlands and the European Commission's own telecommunications directorate. Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the directorate since 1983, is wont to remind visitors that is only two years since France, Spain and Italy were mounting legal challenges in the European Court of Justice to Commission's powers to liberalise the markets for telecoms equipment and specialised services. In practice, however, telecoms competition is an idea whose time has come, and the question facing the EC ministers in June was when and how, not whether. Indeed, the competition is already there. Although most of the EC's Public Telephone Operators (PTOs) formally retain their domestic fixed-line monopolies, the monopoly is being eroded by the month. Almost all EC countries now have competing cellular mobile services. Whereas the first generation of analogue cellular services were mostly provided by PTOs as monopolies, in most EC states licences for new digital services built to the pan-European GSM standard have been given to two operators, generally the PTO and one private consortium, the latter often including overseas companies. In Germany, three digital networks are coming on stream: Deutsche Telekom has only one, and that is now operated a free-standing subsidiary of the parent company. The Commission has undertaken to publish, by January 1995, a paper on mobile and personal communications. However, the most important decisions have been taken, and a liberalised European market is already in existence. It is the same story in data services, where liberalisation is advancing by stealth. Even in the 'voice' market, call-back and other business arrangements are eroding de facto monopolies. They are also forcing PTOs to bring prices for long-distance and international calls down towards cost, so undermining - for PTOs and governments alike - the political and financial advantages of preserving the state telecoms monopoly. However, all is not as straightforward as it might seem: 1998 is only one stage in the liberalisation process, and the EC's June 16 accord raised as many questions as it answered. The 1998 deadline applies only to eight countries; Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, judged to have 'less developed networks', have been granted an extra five years' grace. Separately, 'very small networks' will have two years extra 'where justified.' Then there is the question of licensing new entrants. Post-Maastricht, an EC version of the Federal Communications Commission is out of the question; regulation will come from national agencies, with an initial steers and periodic prods thereafter from Brussels. There will nonetheless need to be co-ordination of policies on the licensing of new entrants, particularly the larger US operators whose ambitions send shivers down many the spines of many PTO directors. Are licences issued in one country to be recognised automatically in others? If not, why not? These questions, hypothetical at the moment, will be only too pressing should the UK government grant AT&amp;T a PTO licence in the next year. THE June 16 accord contains but one sentence on the subject: 'The opening of the Community telecommunications market for third countries should be linked to comparable access to such countries' markets.' Another critical, but unresolved, issue is that of infrastructure. The June accord envisages competition between operators over the public network. It deliberately side-stepped the vexed question of whether operators should be able to build new networks - either to operate themselves, or to lease out to others. The EC will publish a Green Paper on infrastructure by January 1995. It will also look at the future of cable TV networks - which is integrally linked with infrastructure, since cable companies offering combined TV and telephony services is one way of securing competing fixed-wire telecommunications networks quickly. The infrastructure debate looks to be going the same way as the 'voice' debate: by the time the EC decides a policy, liberalisation will be all but inevitable. The UK has already liberalised. The Netherlands government is considering a plan to licence its railways, cable companies and utilities to provide a national network to compete against its PTO, which is to be privatised next year. Finland - outside the EC, but a telecoms pace-setter - has licensed a second national network, comprising existing regional operators. There are already indications from Germany that infrastructure will be liberalised at the same time as voice services. If it makes an early announcement to that effect, the EC will be no more than a rubber stamp. However complex the negotiations and processes, Europe's business community seems to take a simple view: the more competition, the faster, the better. A survey of 500 senior executives across Europe, carried out over the summer by the Harris Research Centre on behalf of BT, found 60 per cent saying that telecoms was the industry they most wanted to see liberalised. Almost three-quarters would consider changing their supplier, while 79 per cent did not agree that doing so would be an 'unnecessary risk' to their business. The greatest resistance to change came from French and Swedish executives, only a fifth of whom would consider changing operator. By contrast, 94 per cent of Italians said they were ready to switch. And virtually everyone - including 85 per cent of the French - thought that liberalisation would improve the range of services on offer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Declaration on the Dismissal of Four Members of the Slovak </F> Television Council" issued by the former and current members of  the Council in Bratislava on 5 May]    [Text] We, the former and current members of the Slovak  Television [STV] Council, declare the following: All the  accusations against our Council have been fabricated. Our  Council, by its actions, has demonstrated frequently its  impartiality and has provided all the major political entities  with equitable and clear-cut guarantees for their appearances on  television. The Council, despite the amateurish conditions  arising from the flawed law on STV, had begun to function  successfully in dealing with the chain of chronic problems  affecting Slovak Television. By its verdict of no confidence in  four of our members -- that is, by breaking up the Council --  the parliamentary coalition majority has forcibly interfered  with the process of introducing order into STV and has thus  accepted full responsibility for all the consequences arising  from this.    At the same time, the decision about the Council was made  undemocratically without dialogue, for which we had appealed  repeatedly, and without the opportunity to defend ourselves,  which we consider to be a mockery of the fundamental principles  of democracy and of normal human decency. We will submit -- via  the appropriate channels -- the text casting doubt on STV's  Statutes to the Slovak Constitutional Court for its  consideration and we will inform the Council of Europe of the  unprecedented decision by the National Council of the Slovak  Republic [NR SR] in order to bring its attention to the gross  disregard for the principles enshrined in its recommendations  Nos. 429/70 and 1147/91. We state that the main reason for the  dismissal of four of our members was a preelection,  party-politically motivated attempt to gain crucial influence in  television and also to assert the economic interests of certain  groups that are benefiting financially from agreements  disadvantageous to Slovak Television. We consider the dismissal  of four of our members to be an act of political despotism and  to be an attack against the freedom of speech and the  independence of Slovak Television. We appeal to the  journalistic community to respond appropriately to this act. We  reject all forms of pressure -- unfortunately well-known from  the break up of STV's preceding councils -- pressure oriented  toward wearing down and intimidating the members of the councils  with the aim of forcing them to resign.    Signed: Jozef Darmo; Eva Kristinova; Milan Ozvald; Jergus  Ferko; Dusan Jariabek; and Miroslav Kollar.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   I identify wholly with my dismissed colleagues from the STV  Council and I reject the smears that have been cast against our  work to date. I consider the method of dismissing my colleagues  "twice" to be a purely expedient and dishonorable act.    Signed: Dusan Jariabek.  <H5>  A Letter From Eva Kristinova </H5>   "I was outraged by the expression of no confidence in four  members of our STV Council. We took up our honorable, unpaid  posts with full responsibility and, as nonpartisan Council  members, we conscientiously and courageously defended the  interests of our Slovak television viewers," says STV Council  member Eva Kristinova in the letter she addressed yesterday to  NR SR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. In her letter of resignation,  she asks NR SR deputies to bear in mind that she does not  consider herself to be less honorable and courageous than her  four dismissed colleagues; therefore, she stands with them.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 6 May on page 1,  under the headline "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's  Intraparty Slanging Match," carries a 600-word "(jo)"-signed  report on the parliament session convened to discuss the  proposal of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac.  The report also reveals that a secret ballot was held to elect  six new members to the STV Council. According to the report,  they are "J. Prusak (nominated by the Union of Slovak Television  Producers); P. Kollar (Coexistence Movement); T. Salayova  (Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement); K. Bezak (Christian  Democratic Movement); K. Foldvari (Democratic Union of  Slovakia); and S. Benicka (Party of the Democratic Left)."]</p>

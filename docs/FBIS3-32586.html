			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotes in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] The Committee of Actions for National  Reconciliation [CARENA] national conference at the Holiday Inn  Hotel finally reached an end at 2256 on 8 February. After  debates that were to say the least thorny, the national  conference decided to form an exceptional government in charge  of managing the state while awaiting a court decision on the  accusations brought against President Aristide. Despite the  warnings of Osner Fevry, despite the warnings of Rodaille [not  further identified], the assembly castigated President Aristide.  The cards will have to be shuffled again and it is supposedly  all over regarding the president-in-exile.    An exceptional government is in sight. The campaign began in  the Toussaint Louverture Room itself. The Revolutionary Front  for Haitian Advancement and Progress [FRAPH] vainly attempted to  impose the five members of this team. [FRAPH leader] Emmanuel  Constant asserted that if a referendum had to be made he would  be elected president of the Republic by plebiscite given that he  is the most popular. Disregarding pressure, which included  bargaining, intimidation, hemming, and hawing, the assembly  refrained from designating the members of this government. But  Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the  Nerette-Honorat government] was campaigning for the man whose  clear-sightedness he never stopped vaunting, the man for whom he  showed his profound admiration: General Raoul Cedras. [passage  omitted]    But during the debates, Rodaille nevertheless warned against  such solutions. His was a solitary voice talking to a brick  wall. At least, gentlemen, to console those who are waiting  rightly or wrongly for the return of the president, take this  possibility into account, said Rodaille during these debates  that were taking place at the Toussaint Louverture Room of the  Holiday Inn. [passage omitted] Be aware that jurist Osner  Fevry warned that on the juridical plane only one scenario was  possible: Return to constitutional order in accordance with the  principle of precedence. Let us listen to Attorney Fevry.    [Begin Fevry recording] "The first political matter is that  the president of the country should designate his prime  minister, that President Aristide should immediately designate  his prime minister who will form his government. The second  political matter is to straightforwardly form an exceptional  government. This exceptional government can have several names.  We can call it a military government. It can be a  civilian-military government, it can be a civilian government,  it can be a government of public security, and it can be a  government of national reconciliation. No matter what name is  given to it, it can be a political matter to form this new  government, this exceptional government, this military  government, this civilian government, this government of public  security, this government of national reconciliation." These  are the political matters. "The juridical and legal means to  form this new government include first....[pauses] We said it  is only one big method through a kind of general synthesis, we  call it" return to constitutional order and -- if you wish --  return to constitutional and legal order. This means supremacy  of the law, that is the acknowledgement of the law as the  supreme force and in accordance with the principle of  precedence. "This means it is either the law or not. Either you  are courageous enough to play the game of the law or you  (?imprison) the law and do not [words indistinct] to play the  political game." [end recording]    The CARENA officials will meet with the press for the  official and solemn signing of the final resolution of this  conference. This will take place very soon with the formation  -- in prospect -- of the exceptional government. Between now  and then the parliament will have to be won over to the cause of  the conference. But it will also be necessary to convince the  international community so that the sanctions can be lifted.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: One shot only for high-tech Sir, May I add to Mr Hartley's letter (June 29). There are spectators who hope, perhaps vainly, that tennis play will develop beyond the power service into a more interesting volley game in which players will demonstrate their wider skills. Those who do not, presumably enjoy the spectacle of a gladiatorial contest in its own right. My suggestion to compensate for the high-tech racket's impact on the service is to deny the second chance to serve. Aspirants to world-class championships should be prepared to get their service right first time. In fact, such a rule should be effective in opening up the game. Meanwhile, I suspect that the pressures of the market will prevail. Demand for seats at Wimbledon, for example, exceeds supply. Until spectators vote with their feet, I doubt that the authorities will introduce the change. N F Knollys, Amberley House, Haig Road, Arlesford, Hampshire SO24 9LX</p>

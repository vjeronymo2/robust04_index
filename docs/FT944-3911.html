			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / RJB raises Pounds 894m to secure coal pit deal RJB Mining, the coal company, yesterday confounded critics of its controversial bid for British Coal's English regions by announcing it had signed a purchase deal with the government and raised the Pounds 894m needed to finance it. The agreement will return the English industry to the private sector at the end of this month after 47 years of nationalisation. It is a significant achievement for RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its financial adviser, which yesterday placed with institutions all the shares being issued to help fund the acquisition after underwriting the offer. RJB's Pounds 815m bid has been sharply questioned within the coal industry because it is based on what rival bidders say are over-optimistic assumptions about coal markets. The fund raising, through which the company aims to triple its value to Pounds 552m, has also coincided with difficult stock market conditions. However RJB's existing institutional shareholders have been strongly supportive, buying 80 per cent of the 125m shares on offer. The share issue will raise Pounds 400m. In addition a banking syndicate including Barclays, Chemical and Midland has agreed to lend the remaining Pounds 494m. RJB needs Pounds 894m to pay the bid price and provide working capital. The shares are being issued at 320p, 20p less than the 340p which BZW had previously told institutions. Some analysts said the price fall suggested that placing the shares had proved more difficult than expected. BZW said the placing price reduction reflected market conditions. However even analysts who have been sceptical about the bid said the level of support suggested the price of RJB's shares would be steady, assuming a reasonable market, when trading in them resumes on December 30. Of the shares being issued, 85 per cent have been sold to institutions and the rest placed conditionally. This is to allow small investors up to 15 per cent. Project Hawk, Page 10</p>

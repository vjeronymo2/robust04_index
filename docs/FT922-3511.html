			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UN paves the way for supply troops in Sarajevo UNITED NATIONS military officers arrived in Sarajevo yesterday to prepare the way for 1,000 UN troops who hope to lift the siege on the city's airport and allow the transport of supplies for thousands of residents. The officials hope to arrange the removal of all anti-aircraft weapons held by Serb irregulars surrounding the airport and oversee their withdrawal from the immediate vicinity. UN officials stressed that the operation 'was highly dangerous' since it depended on all sides honouring a ceasefire. The officials also warned that they did not have the means to provide air cover for the UN troops. 'Ceasefires come and go, but we have to keep trying,' said Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN's chief negotiator. Last weekend, Mr Thornberry forged an agreement between the Bosnian presidency and the Serb army in Bosnia, led by General Ratko Mladic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, to reopen the airport. In Washington, a senior US senator warned that military action might be needed to curb Serbia's territorial ambitions. 'The time for drawing the line has come,' said Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. 'The UN should authorise nation states to use force. Nato should draw up plans for a comprehensive use of force as thorough as that formulated for air, sea and ground forces in Desert Storm,' he added. Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to end US political indifference to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. This afternoon the Senate foreign relations committee is to take public discussion further in special hearings. A convoy of 41 UN cars, trucks and an armoured personnel carrier left Belgrade on the 180-mile drive to Sarajevo, where 300,000 residents are trapped by fighting and face starvation. Rival militias kept up shelling and street battles in the city yesterday. The UN troops, drawn from Canada's Royal 22nd Regiment, are preparing to leave Sector D, the UN-protected area in central Croatia, where they have been deployed for some weeks. They will be equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers to safeguard the flow of humanitarian relief supplies through the airport into Sarajevo. Under the terms of the agreement, the airport can only be opened once all anti-aircraft weapons have been withdrawn from surrounding areas. Those areas will then be placed under UN supervision. In addition, all artillery, mortars, surface-to-surface missiles and tanks that are within range of the airport will be concentrated in areas agreed by the UN. If these terms are met, the airport will be brought under the control of the UN, which will supervise air traffic. That will comprise humanitarian aid, and UN and other official missions. The UN will also throw a ring around the airport and establish two corridors into Sarajevo to send in food to the city, which will be under UN supervision. No shelter from the storm Page 20</p>

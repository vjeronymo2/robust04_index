			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Stue" report: "Industrial Output in Western Germany </F> Constant"]    [Text] Bonn, 5 April -- Industrial output in western  Germany has not changed over the first two months of the year  compared with January-February 1993. The FRG Economics Ministry  has announced that the processing industry experienced 0.3  percent growth. This is primarily due to production in the  basic materials and producer goods industry, which was 4.3  percent. In contrast, the output of investment and consumer  goods was lower than during the same period last year. The  construction sector reported an increase of 3.3 percent. A  two-month comparison between January-February 1994 and  November-December 1993 also shows that the activities of the  producing industry remained generally constant. There were,  however, different developments of output in individual sectors:  The construction sector reported an increase of 7.5 percent; the  production volume in mining went up slightly by 0.5 percent. In  contrast, the processing industry experienced an 0.5-percent  decline in output. In February 1994, west German industrial  output went up by 1 percent in real and seasonally adjusted  terms. In this connection, it must be taken into account that  the January result was revised downward by 1.5 index points.  The February increase was supported by mining and the  processing industry. The ministry accounts for the production  decline in the construction sector of 7 percent compared with  the previous month, primarily with reference to the extremely  cold weather.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan is likely to resume  extending official yen loans to Cambodia as early as this year  after nearly 25 years of suspension, Foreign Ministry [MOF]  sources said Thursday [13 January].    The Japanese Government plans to provide the loans in  cooperation with the World Bank to ease Cambodia's international  balance of payments problem, the sources said.    The amount of the loans, however, remains undetermined, they  said.    Japan last extended a 1.5 billion yen loan in March 1969.    The government is likely to decide on resumption of the  loans  after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assesses the  Cambodian economy in February, they said.    It is not clear whether Tokyo will be able to make an  announcement on the new loans at the International Committee on  the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) scheduled to be held in  March, because a meeting of Paris Club creditor nations is to be  held in April, the sources said.    The ICORC was set up in June 1992 at a ministerial meeting.  At its first meeting in Paris last September, donor nations  pledged 119 million dollars in new aid in addition to the 880  million dollars pledged at the ministerial meeting.    Cambodia is estimated to owe Japan some 2.6 billion yen. The  accumulated debt is an obstacle to Japan's resumption of yen  loans.    Japan has been offering Cambodia grant-in-aids for projects  to improve the war-torn country's infrastructure. Japan  extended 6.12 billion yen in fiscal 1992 and 8 billion yen in  fiscal 1993.</p>

The total value of household products produced in Taiwan has  dropped to US$210 billion in 1993 from US$250 billion five years  ago, the statistics showed.    Taiwan's household product industry groups businesses which  produce shoes, giftware, toys, adhesives and tape, jewelry,  sporting goods, educational products, and the printing industry.    Shoe manufactures registered the largest decline of the  group, dropping 50 percent from US$110 billion in 1989 to US$55  billion in 1993.    IDB officials attributed the large decline in shoe  production  values to the mass relocation of OEM (original equipment  manufacturing) factories, which in turn decreased export value.    Both the giftware and sporting goods industries also showed  declines of 33 percent and 14 percent respectively.    However, the printing and adhesive industries grew 32  percent  and 100 percent each during the period. The adhesive industry  grew from US$5 billion in 1989 to US$10 billion in 1993 while  the printing industry increased from US$38 billion five years  ago to US$50 billion, the statistics showed.    Increases in domestic demand fueled the growth, the  officials  added.    The production value of Taiwan's toy industry was also up 21  percent, totaling US$24.5 billion, the statistics showed.    IDB officials said that although the relocation of  industries  and increasing production costs undermined competitiveness,  improvements in the industrial structure and the upgrading of  technology helped the industry remain profitable.    More than 1.32 million people are employed in Taiwan's  household products industry.</p>

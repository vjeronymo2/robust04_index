			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Text] In cooperation with the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Education, the Science  and Technology Agency has decided to construct a high-speed  communication network to connect the research divisions of  government laboratories and corporations, tentatively called the  Ministry Research Information Network. Verification research  will be addressed in a three-year plan starting in 1994. About  &yen;1 billion will be allocated from the Special Coordination  Funds for Promoting Science and Technology for the first year.  The information accumulated by each research organization will  cross the fences between agencies and be freely used. The aim is  to provide an infrastructure to foster academic and pioneering  research activities and have it open to foreign research  organizations. At the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic  Conference which begins next month, the American side is  expected to raise the problems of scientific and technical  information in Japan in the working group on technology access;  the objective is to beat them to the punch.    The target of the Ministry Research Information Network is a  Japanese version of the High-Performance Computing and  Communications (HPCC) Program that is being promoted in the  United States with the aim of strengthening international  competitive strength in science and technology. In addition to  being behind in providing local information bases, such as local  area networks, Japanese research is far behind in communications  speed in networks between research organizations. Therefore,  from the perspective of information flow and shared use of  computers, Japan is far behind the United States. Not only  Japanese researchers, but foreign researchers have voiced  dissatisfaction.    Under these circumstances, representatives from the Science  and Technology Agency, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry, and the Industry of Posts  and Telecommunications visited the United States in June of this  year to look at the HPCC structure and the state of progress of  one of its links, the information highway concept. Based on this  result, studies progressed on the realization of a research  information network centered at the Science and Technology  Agency.    In this plan, not only the building of a computer network,  but research on the software used like electronic mail,  electronic conferencing, electronic bulletin boards, and for  sharing computers will be closely examined. At the same time,  database construction for researchers to load information onto  the network is given technical support and is actively  implemented.    In addition to these four organizations, the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and  Welfare, the Ministry of Construction have also expressed an  interest in participating. The objective is to include all  government laboratories and research divisions of corporations.    Currently, communication lines leased from  telecommunications  companies are being tested. In the future, research  organizations will be connected by optical fiber cables. By only  plugging computer connectors into the cable terminal,  information from various domestic and foreign research  organizations can be obtained or information can be exchanged.    According to the Science and Technology Agency, "In the  United States, a communication network is being provided that  will enable the full text of a speech by the President States to  be extracted as a hard copy by a personal computer and read on  the same day. Even in Japan, we would like to have personal  computers extract important research announcements at academic  conferences on the same day from the research information  network.</p>

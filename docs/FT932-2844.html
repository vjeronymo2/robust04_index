			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Timex pickets expect factory rescue TIMEX MAY have announced that it is to close its Dundee factory after five months of bitter industrial dispute, but the dawn patrol of strikers was picketing the locked factory gates on a hill outside the city yesterday, as it has every day for the past five months. Today the strikers meet in the city's Caird Hall to hear an offer from the company to re-employ some of them so as to ensure an orderly wind-down of work before the factory closes at Christmas. But there appeared to be little enthusiasm among the strikers to work for what they see as a 27 per cent cut in pay and benefits to assist the company's withdrawal from the city, which was announced on Tuesday. Few seemed inclined to go back to work even if the company changed its mind about closure, which it has insisted it will not. Mr Alec Miles receives about Pounds 30 a week in strike pay and Pounds 40 a week on the dole. He will continue to protest, and said: 'What else am I going to do? I am 51 and I have had three heart attacks. No one is going to employ me.' Many of the pickets, particularly women who have been with Timex a long time, refuse to believe that the factory will close and expect someone to come to the rescue. Ms Margo Bell, who worked for the company for 27 years, said: 'They are trying to get coolie labour. How would you like it if you were asked to accept a 27 per cent pay cut? We want reinstatement at proper wages - if not with this company then someone else who would take it over.' Many protesters believe that Timex was determined from the beginning of the dispute in January to close the plant. But Mr Charles Fairley, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise Tayside, does not believe there was any grand design. He had discussions with Mr Peter Hall, the former president of Timex UK, before the dispute began. Mr Fairley said: 'Timex has become a sub-contractor of printed circuit boards. He wanted to launch new products and expand production in Dundee. But he needed to increase productivity. This hardly suggests he had a master plan to shut the factory down.'</p>

A third series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with the interest rate fixed at 93/8% per annum, payable semi-annually (``Fixed Rate Bonds''), and these Fixed Rate Bonds were issued subject to optional redemption following an initial period not to exceed ten years. The proceeds of the Series 1985 Bonds were used to cover a portion of the cost of construction of the Project and to refund the outstanding short-term Series 1984 A Bonds in the principal amount of $150 million.

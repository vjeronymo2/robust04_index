Apart from the murder of the teenage daughter of one of the defendants, there was no evidence that the accused members of the Abu Nidal group carried out their plans or were connected with the February 26 bombing of the New York World Trade Centre that killed six people and wounded over 1,000. The charges were announced by the Justice Department a day after it was returned in secret by a federal grand jury in St Louis, Missouri. Accused were Tawfiq Musa of Milwaukee and Zein Isa, Saif Nijmeh and Luie Nijmeh, all from St Louis. Isa already had been in custody while the three others were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday.

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Letter: Banking excellence needs to be more convincing Sir, I receive many lobbies asking me to promote the excellence of the City of London and to help establish its position as the banking and financial centre of the European Community. During the past week, I sought to change into sterling BFr 50,000, through one of Britain's high street banks. With a mid-point between buy and sell of almost BFr 50 to the pound, this bank, of which I have been a customer for 30 years, offered me Pounds 912.17. With the same mid-point, a Belgian bank offered me Pounds 970.0. If this is typical of British bank practice, I need to be re-convinced before promoting its excellence.

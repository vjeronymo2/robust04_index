			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK builders Yesterday's admission from Raine Industries that late last summer it bought a 3 per cent stake in fellow builder Y J Lovell is instructive indeed. From one angle it looks like a disappointing stumble by a company which hitherto had proved commendably sure-footed in the recession. Raine's shares, after all, have kept pace with the market as a whole and outperformed the sector by 220 per cent over three years. There is certainly room to question the judgment of those who signed off the Lovell rights issue document last April, on which Raine apparently based its decision to invest. But given Lovell's now fragile condition - its shares are roughly a sixth of Raine's average purchase price - there is no escaping the Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m loss which will have to be taken as an extraordinary item in Raine's interim figures. On a wider front, it is worth noting that Raine's move was partly prompted by Taylor Woodrow's equally ill-timed stakebuilding in Lovell. The sector's most conservative blue chip representative and one of its most admired second-liners have therefore both had their fingers burned at the same game. At the very least, this is a reminder for investors that hostile bids for contractors are fraught with danger and cannot be taken for granted even at this dire stage in the cycle. Takeover hopes for Lovell are certainly wide of the mark. It also raises a question over general management ability in the sector at a time when it will be badly needed. Perhaps it is no accident that the new year has started as gloomily for the builders as the end of 1991.</p>

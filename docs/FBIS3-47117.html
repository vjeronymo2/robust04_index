He says there are about 50,000 of them  in Tak Province, 10,000 in Kanchanaburi Province, and several  thousands in Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khirikhan Provinces.  Under the original plan, these people will be sent back to  Burma once the situation has improved and there is no fighting.  But they have not been sent back yet because they claim that  the situation in Burma is never safe for them.    The NSC deputy secretary general said these Burmese refugees  have been here for more than 10 years now. They received help  from seven or eight private organizations, the so-called NGO  [preceding word in English], which have been allowed to carry  out operations without strict control by Thai authorities. Some  of those NGO officials are involved in political activities with  the refugees. Certain organizations used Thailand, which has  diplomatic relations with Burma, as a transit point for certain  leaders of the resistance ethnic minority groups to leave for a  third country where they can launch resistance activities  against the Burmese Government. Such an act could affect  relations between Thailand and Burma as well as security along  the Thai border.    In order to promptly control these refugees, Khachatphai  Burutphat said that concerned authorities would form an  apparatus in order to oversee these people. At the beginning,  existing officials will be told to take strict action against  them. The new agency to be set up will deal with these refugees  based on humanitarian principles, but it will not permit them to  engage in any kind of activities in violation of Thai law or  activities which will affect security along the Thai-Burmese  border.</p>

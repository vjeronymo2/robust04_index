As the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and  Sakigake [Harbinger Party] work more actively for a so-called  "tripolar" structure, Shinseito's concept of forming a new-new  party by unifying all the ruling coalition parties has become  improbable. It is now concentrating on unity with the Japan New  Party [JNP], the prime minister's home camp, and working for the  restoration of its leadership in the coalition.    With regard to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who  has not appeared in public for some time, while some people  think "he is beginning to distance himself from the prime  minister" (according to a ruling party source), there has  actually not been any change in his support for the prime  minister. He is working on assisting the prime minister from  the sidelines to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    Shinseito did not participate in the meeting of ruling party  representatives on 7 March, and party chief Tsutomu Hata (deputy  prime minister and foreign minister) alone attended the meeting  of ruling party leaders. Ozawa was also absent from the plenary  session of the House of Representatives on that day, and the  explanation given by his office was: "(He is) tired and taking  a rest."    Hata said, "There should not be any problem since the party  head was present," denying speculation about a Shinseito  boycott. Another party official asserted, "Since Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura said he would act as the coordinator, then  let him do so." This indicates that Shinseito is actually  abstaining from steering Diet affairs. It probably intends to  watch out for any misdeeds by Takemura in his coordination  efforts, then take the opportunity to impair the trend of  support for the "social democratic-liberal" bloc.    However, close associates of Ozawa say that "Japan-U.S.  relations constitute a national issue," and Ozawa is prepared to  offer full cooperation. Ozawa has recently been busy  circulating around, making contact with U.S. Government  officials. He met with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale  on 28 February.    It is said that the reason Ozawa was absent from the meeting  of government and ruling party leaders convened on the evening  of 2 March to announce the cancellation of plans for a cabinet  reshuffle was because he was discussing ways to bring about a  breakthrough in the insurance sector negotiations with Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii at a hotel in Tokyo.    It is also true that this situation of "semi-boycott"  (according to a senior Shinseito official) is making the party's  strategy ineffective. Shinseito has been working on a strategy  of accepting potential deserters from the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] by urging the former Kato group [of the LDP], with  which Shinseito forms a Diet floor group called the  "Shinseito-Kaikaku Rengo [Reform Alliance]," and the  "Kaikaku-no-Kai [Association for Reform]" led by Takeo Nishioka,  former chairman of the LDP General Council, to form a floor  grouping of independents. Part of the reason for this new group  is that by allowing members of the group to participate in the  meeting of ruling party representatives, they can join hands  with Shinseito and Komeito to defeat the SDPJ, DSP, and Sakigake  by numerical strength, in order to effect a change in the  present balance of power.    However, after passage of the political reform bills, while  Shinseito "has been making secret contacts with LDP members,  they are very unresponsive," (according to a senior Shinseito  official). It seems that another split in the LDP is not  forthcoming in the immediate future.    Therefore, Shinseito's strategy for the moment is to, at  least, take in the former Kato group in an effort to accelerate  the momentum of political realignment. It will further work at  winning the JNP over, and conducting more active exchanges with  this party.</p>

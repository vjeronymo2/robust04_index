			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yemeni Foreign Ministry Denies Polish </F> Arms Deal"]    [Excerpt] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Yemeni Foreign  Ministry has denied concluding "arms deals with Poland in favor  of a party to the current crisis in Yemen." It also denied "any  indication that the Foreign Ministry, represented by its  minister, has any link with that." It is worth mentioning that  this denial comes in response to an article supported by  documents which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT published last week.    The Foreign Ministry promised to publish a response  supported  by documents to back its position, in order to "prevent it from  being pushed into the dispute which has been raging since the  crisis erupted," and to ban its employees from exercising  partisan activities during their work abroad.

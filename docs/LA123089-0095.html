			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI POLICE BREAK UP PEACE MARCH IN JERUSALEM  </P> <P> Police fired tear gas, pulled demonstrators by their hair and struck them with  night sticks to break up a peace march in Jerusalem on Friday by more than  3,000 Israeli, Palestinian, European and American women.  </P> <P> The hourlong procession from Jewish West Jerusalem to Arab East Jerusalem was  without incident until the end, when an outlawed Palestinian flag was raised,  and police dispersed the marchers.  </P> <P> Police said 16 people were detained. Reporters saw police drag several women  away by their hair or clothes. Some were struck with night sticks and several  were kicked. All foreigners were later released.  </P> <P> The women's march was part of a program organized by peace activists that is to  culminate today with about 1,200 visiting Europeans and Americans expected to  link hands with Israelis and Palestinians in a human chain around Jerusalem's  Old City.  </P> <P> The "1990 -- Time for Peace" demonstration today is intended to symbolize the  unity of peace activists who endorse a negotiated Middle East peace settlement.  Most of the marchers were Europeans and Jewish Israelis, with a smaller number  being Americans and Israeli Arab women.  </P> <P> Penny Rosenwasser of Oakland, who joined the march, said she came to find out  for herself about the situation. "I came because our government is so heavily  involved in the occupation and, as a Jew, I felt I had to do something,"  Rosenwasser said. She added that she also was ashamed of the Israeli treatment  of Palestinians.  </P> <P> The army also said Friday soldiers accidentally shot two 12-year-old  Palestinian boys during an assault on masked Arabs a day earlier in the  occupied Gaza Strip. Both were reported in good condition at a Gaza hospital.  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Jus one of those things - Appetisers I have just received the menu from the acclaimed London restaurant 'Aubergine' (11 Park Walk, SW10. Tel: 071-352-3449) and I am perplexed. It reads like a badly translated tourist menu from the backstreets of Marseille. Alright, I am a pedant, but what exactly is 'vinaigrette crustaces' (French genders are not the strong point of the chef, Scotsman Gordon Ramsay). Why is it a roasted and not a roast pigeon? Is a 'vinaigrette of vegetables presse (nor are plurals) a soup, given that the implication is that everything has been liquidised? 'Girolles', 'beignets', 'pomme' (sic) 'sauce epices' all have English translations which would be less bewildering. Pigeon poche grille is presumably 'poche et grille' or 'poached and grilled' in English? The most striking thing is the repeated use of the trendy word 'jus'. The standard French dictionary Petit Robert tells me that this could be 'juice' in the accepted sense of the word or 'meat/pan juices' in the form of an unthickened gravy which has not become a sauce. This would explain 'Jus tarragon', 'jus rosemary', 'thyme' 'Madeira' etc, but not excuse them. Keep them wholly in French: 'jus parfume au romarin', 'a l'estragon' etc, and be less eclectic. As for the 'jus Granny Smith' on the creme brulee I suppose that is plain old apple juice. Elucidations and examples of similar gobbledegook gratefully received. The Guild of Food Writers, sponsored this year by restaurateur Nico Ladenis, has launched the 1994 Jeremy Round Award, to find the best young food writer. Entrants, who must be under 25, are invited to write a stimulating, mouthwatering or witty piece about sausages, in no more than 800 words. The prize of Pounds 500 will be presented at a luncheon at Nico at Ninety, Park Lane, London, in mid-June. Closing date for entries is Friday May 13. Entries should be sent to The Secretary, The Guild of Food Writers, 27 Lebanon Park, Twickenham, Middlesex TW1 3DF. If you plan to be in Cambridgeshire over Easter and are looking for an outing that will satisfy a variety of tastes, you might aim for Elton, just off the A605, eight miles west of Peterborough. For those who cannot resist stately homes, Elton Hall will feed the mind, and a branch of Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, housed in Elton Hall's old dairy, will feed the body with west coast seafood. Prices are modest and opening hours from 9am until 9pm seven days a week. For menu details ring 0832-280298.</p>

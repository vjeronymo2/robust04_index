			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Kodak delights Wall St by recruiting Motorola chairman EASTMAN KODAK, the photographic products group, yesterday named Mr George Fisher, the chairman and chief executive of electronics group Motorola, as its new chairman in place of Mr Kay Whitmore, who was forced to resign in August because of the company's lacklustre financial performance. Mr Fisher, 52, is one of the most highly regarded managers in the US and his appointment delighted Wall Street. His name had not featured in market rumours of Kodak's shortlist. 'This is an appointment beyond my hopes - beyond the dreams of avarice,' said Mr Michael Ellmann, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder. The market expected a strong rise this morning in Kodak stock, which closed last night up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 58 3/4 before the appointment was announced. Mr Fisher, who will succeed Mr Fisher on December 1, is expected to move much more decisively to address Kodak's problems, which include competition from own-label manufacturers in the mature film market, a copier business which is barely profitable, and an insular, bureaucratic culture. Mr Fisher, who has been chief executive of Motorola since 1988 and chairman since 1990, will contribute technical expertise and a strong reputation as a team builder. He is a leading proponent of the business philosophy known as total quality management. Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Cola-Cola and a director of Kodak, who led the search for the new chief, said Mr Fisher was 'the energetic leader who the board believes will move Kodak to higher levels of achievement'. Mr Fisher's departure from Motorola comes as a surprise. He told fellow board members yesterday morning of his intention to take up 'an exceptional offer from another very good company'. By accepting the top job at Kodak, Mr Fisher has cleared a path for the career of Mr Christopher Galvin, 42, grandson of Motorola's founder. Mr Galvin is expected eventually to follow his grandfather and father to become chairman and chief executive of Motorola. Kodak results, Page 34</p>

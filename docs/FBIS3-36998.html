			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- "Our position on the Bosnian  settlement is absolutely clear, it was defined by the president  of the Russian Federation," Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign  affairs of Russia, said in conversation with journalists in the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation today.  The Security Council, the United Nations should take additional  measures to guarantee safe areas in Bosnia, including,  naturally, Sarajevo, and "exclude the possiblity of continuous  cease-fire violations in the region," the minister said.    If there are exchanges of fire, attacks on places where UN  forces are deployed, where they are carrying out their tasks,  the command of UN forces appeals to the organization's secretary  general who, after a vote in the Security Council, makes the  appropriate decisions on supporting them, including aerial  support, that is, on the possibility of launching an air strike  to defend the UN contingent in Bosnia, the Russian minister  continued.    "Our position is immutable," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. It's  another matter, he noted, whether such military support needs to  be 'obtained' in every specific case, at every specific moment.  This question still remains open.    But Russia does not exclude aerial support in principle,  since it is provided for directly in the Security Council  resolution, which Moscow voted for.    Three weeks ago, the Russian side put forward the proposal  to  reinforce safe areas and to take additional measures, the  minister recalled. "Unfortunately, it took the tragedy at  Sarajevo market (I want to express special gratitude to CNN,  thanks to whom the world learned of the horror) for our partners  to be concerned about reinforcing safe areas, for the United  Nations, the Security Council, the UN forces to step up their  participation in resolving the problem," he noted. "I want to  reiterate that an air strike is not excluded in principle, but  for that to happen, the UN forces on the spot should raise the  specific question, on a specific situation, and the UN secretary  general will make a decision in coordination with the members of  the Security Council."    Speaking of the proposals by the ministers of foreign  affairs  of France and Germany for Russia to join in the settlement plan,  Andrey Kozyrev said that these proposals were the basis of the  plan of the European Union. This document contains many  elements which were discussed by the minister of foreign affairs  of the Russian Federation and Klaus Kinkel, and which Vitaliy  Churkin, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the London  conference on the former Yugoslavia, are working on now. The  United States has now put forward its proposals for seeking a  peaceful settlement.    As far as the NATO ultimatum is concerned, the minister  noted, this decision by NATO accords with the Security Council  resolution, the part which provides for involving individual  states or regional organizations (in this instance, NATO) in  aerial support, if the UN command on the spot appeals for help  to defend its personnel. "There is no point in joining this,"  Andrey Kozyrev thinks, "but we said immediately that the NATO  decision contains elements which the Security Council resolution  does not spell out, at least clearly." Heavy artillery is not  enumerated, nor are the UN forces' functions to take heavy arms  under control, while this is mentioned in the text of the NATO  decision.    We think, the minister continued, that the decision on the  UN  forces should be made by the UN Security Council. And the  letter by the organization's secretary general says that the  United Nations will instruct its forces to carry out certain  functions, and NATO's proposal to defend these forces accords  with this.    The letter says that the UN mandate must be clarified. The  minister recalled that he wrote two letters to the UN secretary  general on these questions even before the UN ultimatum on the  need to reinforce the functions of the UN forces, to defend safe  areas. Had it been done earlier, CNN might not have had to show  the tragedy at the market in Sarajevo.    But in this case the point is not competition, or priority,  but acting together, without any claim to the truth, to bring  the matter of a settlement to a conclusion.    We all now have to work in the Security Council, the Russian  minister said, and in Geneva on the "Sarajevo group" (of  issues), that is, to address the problems of withdrawing heavy  weapons and strengthening the security zone, and on guarantees,  including, if such a specific need should arise, "perhaps, also  carrying out air strikes." The second group of issues, he  continued, is the actual Bosnian settlement.    Speaking of Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement,  Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that the essence of the problem lay  in the fact that Bosnia will have to be divided, while  preserving the framework of a single state, into parts that are  quite independent according to the ethnic principle. There are  various options for division, he said. One of them is the  well-known Vance-Owen plan, now there is another -- simpler and  easier.    The point is that Russia and the European Union have  elaborated a plan which determines the division of Bosnian  territory between the three sides. We are pressing these sides  to agree to a compromise in solving territorial questions.  Until recently the United States did not join us, the minister  said, it did not give us full support, displaying restraint in  this matter. But now Washington supports the plan and is  pressing all three sides in the conflict to agree to a  compromise. "In the main we have been working with the Serbian  side," Andrey Kozyrev said, and Germany with the Croatian, and  there was a kind of "missing link" -- the Muslim side. Maybe  the United States could exert a certain pressure and work with  the Bosnian Government. This is why, the minister believes, it  is good news that Washington is joining the efforts of the  European Union and Russia in trying to reach agreement.    "As concerns the Russian side," Andrey Kozyrev said, "we  will  continue what we were doing before -- cooperating with the  European Union and the United States in seeking a peace  settlement in Bosnia."    Talk about air strikes is leading some representatives of  the  Bosnian sides to be tempted temporarily to postpone making a  decision on a settlement, and to direct all attention to the  problem of air strikes, the Russian minister stressed.  Unfortunately, this talk is stimulating some people in Serbia  itself, since they understand that in military terms such air  strikes will be quite limited, but in moral terms it frees their  hands for various kinds of military campaigns and actions.    The Russian minister said in conclusion that for the defense  of UN forces "air strikes may be used, if the UN forces  themselves ask for this, as it must not be allowed for  peacekeeping forces to be left defenseless, and not only in  Bosnia, but also in Somalia, Abkhazia and other places. This is  why we are taking such a cautious attitude toward the idea of  air strikes, as this distracts world attention from the search  for a political settlement in Bosnia."</p>

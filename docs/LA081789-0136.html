			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOME-GROWN SNAILS INCHING AHEAD ON MENU  </P> <P> S-l-o-o-o-w-l-y but surely, Californians are beginning to raise, and eat,  locally grown snails.  </P> <P> Fresh snails are turning up on Westside menus, and small-time snail farmers are  turning up in such unlikely places as North Hollywood and San Pedro.  </P> <P> Chef Roland Gibert of Tulipe, who opened the Melrose Avenue restaurant in April  with fellow chef Maurice Peguet, wouldn't dream of using snails from a can --  even one imported from France.  </P> <P> When Gibert prepares his ravioli of dried cured duck with California snails in  a lovely green sauce, or parsley coulis, ($8 per appetizer serving), he uses  only the liveliest gastropods, delivered, on the foot as it were, from a dealer  in La Jolla.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Kind of Respect  </P> <P> Gibert buys 50 dozen live snails a week. With fresh snails, he explained, "I'm  sure of what I'm getting."  </P> <P> Chef Michael Roberts of Trumps on Melrose agrees that moving mollusks are  superior to tinned ones. "From a chef's point of view, it's always better to  start with something that's alive than with something that comes in a can,"  Roberts said. "You have a different kind of respect for food when you've  started at the first step."  </P> <P> Fresh snails have more "integrity" than canned ones, Roberts said, which is why  he has served them as specials from time to time, either in red wine sauce with  a whisper of garlic, or baked in a puffed pastry shell.  </P> <P> "They are adorable," Roberts said of live snails. "They crawl around. You feed  them. They become pets, and then you kill them."  </P> <P> Most serious cooks and serious eaters prefer fresh snails, but preparing them  for the table is no piece of cake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Purged of Impurities  </P> <P> They must be purged of impurities before they can be safely cooked and eaten, a  process that traditionally involves feeding them cornmeal or giving them only  water for days or even weeks.  </P> <P> Susan Feniger of City Restaurant on La Brea Avenue and the Border Grill on  Melrose recalls that she and partner Mary Sue Milliken once shared their  kitchen for several days with 10 buckets of California-grown snails. Eventually  the women combined them with Serrano chilies, lime juice and cilantro to make  snail salad for a restaurant-industry crowd. But as chef Gibert noted of the  fresh snail: "From the live one to the plate, there's a lot of nasty work to  do."  </P> <P> A growing number of back yard snail farmers are willing to deal with the  mundane unpleasantness of "snailiculture" in hopes of eventually making money  on the mollusks. Like an earlier generation of worm farmers, they hope, naively  or not, to spin a profit from a small initial investment and a lot of hard work  nurturing unusual livestock.  </P> <P> Sandy Simmons, who has been eating back yard snails since 1975, is gearing up  to farm them commercially. She has about 12,000 head of the common garden  variety -- Helix aspera -- in a homemade snailery on her property in North  Hollywood. Simmons said her voracious stock eats all kinds of greens (something  home gardeners already knew). They also like commercial catfish food, although  they turn up their tentacles at hen food.  </P> <P> Simmons shields her snails from the sun so they won't dry out. She devises ways  to keep them well watered without allowing them to tumble in the water and  drown. She tidies up after them, doing the snail farmer's equivalent of mucking  out the stable. And she keeps them out of her neighbor's dahlias by edging the  snailery with copper.  </P> <P> "When the copper hits their slime, it gives them a slight shock, and they  usually won't crawl over it," she said.  </P> <P> According to Simmons, snails were the first C rations. The Roman army found the  live gastropods a convenient food to carry into war. They are a superior,  low-calorie source of protein, said Simmons, who also believes that snail slime  has curative properties.  </P> <P> Simmons can't imagine why more Americans don't harvest the bounty slowly  traversing their own back yards, as Europeans have done for centuries. "How  better to rid your garden of the little creatures than to eat them?" asked  Simmons, who likes hers dusted with a little seasoned flour and fried.  </P> <P> Like hundreds of others, Simmons has been encouraged in her dream of better  living through snail farming by Ralph Tucker, 72, a retired insurance salesman  who lives in Fresno.  </P> <P> Tucker is the nation's leading booster of the home-grown or boutique snail,  founder and president of the Snail Club of America, which has 750 members in  the United States and 300 in other countries. According to Tucker, half the  members of the club have commercial aspirations.  </P> <P> Tucker, who calls himself the snail king, is not amused by the sniggers with  which listeners sometimes greet his strong pro-snail views. "They are  laughing," he said, "at the greatest food God put on Earth."  </P> <P> According to Tucker, the diner who downs a canned snail "might as well be  eating paper." Tucker has given seminars in which he advises prospective  farmers to start out with a half whiskey barrel, filled with moist dirt, snails  and some lettuce to munch on, topped with a piece of "screen-door screen." For  safety's sake, he warns converts never to eat a wild snail whose diet they  haven't personally supervised for at least 30 days. "If a snail is alive at the  end of a month, you know that's a healthy snail," he counsels.  </P> <P> Tucker's next project will be a videotape for cooks on what to do with them  besides drowning them in garlic butter. His own uses for the gastropod, which  he supplies to several restaurants in the Fresno area, include snail calzone  (which he calls the Tucker Turnover) and snail jerky.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $300 Million in Imports  </P> <P> Tucker believes that there is a largely untapped market among "the upper crust"  (the name of his newsletter) for domestic snails. Tucker said the United States  imports $300 million worth of inferior snails from France, Taiwan and elsewhere  each year. He believes that Americans could take over the snail market and that  their product -- good domestic snails for the gourmet palate -- might command  as much as $100 a pound. (Canned snails imported from France are selling for  $10 a pound in some local supermarkets.) Tucker also believes that they could  be dried and turned into a protein-rich, powdered food for the world's poor and  hungry (possible slogan: "Let them eat escargots!").  </P> <P> Tucker said he has about 4,000 snails in a wooden back yard "oasis." As they  fatten for market, he serenades them with classical and easy-listening music.  "Right now their favorite song is 'Wind Beneath My Wings,' " he said. "They  also like Stevie Wonder's 'I Just Called to Say I Love You.' But they don't  like Stevie. They like the instrumental version."  </P> <P> In San Pedro, Giuseppe Cracchiolo has also hitched his wagon to a snail.  </P> <P> A 26-year-old native of Italy, Cracchiolo makes his living as a fisherman. As a  sideline, he raises white snails -- Otala lactea -- which he said are far more  tender than the common variety. Once people discover that succulent fresh  snails are readily available, they'll never go back to the rubbery canned kind,  he said. "You wouldn't want to eat a fish that was three or four days old," he  noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sicilian Style  </P> <P> Although Cracchiolo sometimes keeps snails nearing market size (about 1 1/4  inches) in plastic containers in his garage, the bulk of his herd is penned in  a snailery on rural property owned by his uncle. There the feed bag is often  filled with bread crumbs.  </P> <P> In Sicily, Cracchiolo's mother stewed snails, still in their shells, with  potatoes and tomatoes. He still likes them best that way.  </P> <P> Although the young entrepreneur sells his product to a retailer in the Fresno  area for 35 cents each, Cracchiolo hasn't been able to sell his wife, Geralynn,  on snails.  </P> <P> "She's American," he explained. "She thinks they're gross."  </P></p>

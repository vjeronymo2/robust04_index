			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Former premier loses immunity Ukraine's parliament yesterday revoked the immunity of Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky, the former prime minister accused of embezzling millions of dollars in barely eight months in office, thus opening the door to his prosecution. Detailed charges against Mr Zvyahilsky, who headed the government from October 1993 to last June, centre on allegedly fraudulent business deals, illegal currency trading and skimming off state contracts. The prosecutor, Mr Vladislav Datsyuk, yesterday said the former prime minister, now a deputy, would be charged with theft and grand larceny - activities which, he said, cost Ukraine Dollars 25m. Mr Datsyuk claimed the former prime minister was accused of arranging the sale of strategic high-grade aviation fuel to a Greek-registered company at low prices; the state only received Dollars 10m of a reportedly Dollars 15m contract, he said. The prosecutor also told deputies that Mr Zvyahilsky, a former coal mine director from Donetsk, a large city in eastern Ukraine, was suspected of embezzling around Dollars 3m from a state-owned agro-industry company. The funds, allegedly transferred to a Swiss bank account, have not been recovered. Mr Zvyahilsky is currently in Israel undergoing medical treatment. After yesterday's vote, the prosecutor may seek his formal extradition. If convicted, the 61-year-old faces a minimum of 15 years in jail.</p>

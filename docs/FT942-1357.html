			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: TSB On the surface, TSB looks a picture of health. First-half profits are up nearly threefold, net return on capital is 15.5 per cent and the tier 1 capital ratio is 9.1 per cent. The awkward thing is that recent growth has occurred in peripheral businesses which are supposed to be winding down. Thus both the bad loan administration unit and Mortgage Express extended the recovery manifest in the second half of last year. Operating profit before bad debts in retail banking and insurance fell 5 per cent. That, unfortunately, is precisely the area on which TSB's longer term ambitions are focused. Nor is the outlook encouraging. The process of shifting customers into higher yielding deposits, which has been a drag on TSB's funding costs, may soon have run its course. But margin pressure looks set to intensify in the mortgage market. Life assurance and pensions premium income is dropping and conditions will become even tougher when commission disclosure is required next year. No wonder TSB is still talking about buying a building society. Acquisition looks the only plausible route to growth. As long as Lloyds Bank cannot even make a friendly offer for a building society work, though, there seems little chance of TSB pulling off a significant deal. With its tier 1 capital ratio heading over 10 per cent as bad debt provisions drop further, it may soon have to start considering alternatives like a scheme to buy back its own shares. Otherwise competition may quickly erode its handsome returns.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC sets minimum fish import prices THE EUROPEAN Commission last night set minimum import prices on white fish, but warned that tougher measures would be taken if this did not stem the flood of cheap imports coming into the EC and driving down prices. The minimum prices will apply to cod, haddock, whiting and monkfish until the end of June, and are based on the reference prices normally used to monitor the EC fish market. They are unlikely, therefore, to restore fully the 15 to 30 per cent drop in white fish prices caused by this year's import surge, because prices were drifting downwards anyway because of the industry's own structural problems and a fall in consumption because of recession. The move follows a vigorous campaign by Breton fishermen, who on Tuesday partly destroyed the Paris fish market at Rungis. It has as its main target Russian imports, as well as fish from Iceland, Norway and Poland. 'This decision should allow us to correct the disturbances caused by imports from third countries at extraordinarily low prices,' said Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC's environment and fisheries commissioner. But commission officials warned that if the situation was not stabilised quickly, the community could resort to an embargo on imports. French fishing interests had also called for action to correct the distortions caused by recent devaluations of sterling and the Spanish peseta. Commission officials pointed out, however, that that form of exchange rate compensation was no longer practicable in the EC's border-free internal market. 'We have a single market but we do not have a single currency,' one official said. The commission's decision followed a vote at the EC management committee for fisheries, made up of senior civil servants from the member states. A slight dissident note was sounded by the UK, which abstained after failing to limit the minimum import regime to three months, instead of the six months called for by Brussels and the four months finally agreed. Belgium may challenge the EC banana import regime through an appeal to the European Court of Justice, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's office said, Reuter reports from Brussels. In a statement issued after a cabinet meeting, the government said it was considering measures to counter the regime.</p>

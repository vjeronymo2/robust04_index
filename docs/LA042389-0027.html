			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUNNING HOUSE  </P> <P> Paul Gordon, you're a good man. How nice you are to fight to save the Dunning  house when the owner could care less about its future. I give you a lot of  credit to put so much dedication into a structure that you don't even own.  </P> <P> I live in West Los Angeles, near Santa Monica, and it's so distressing to see  them tear down quaint bungalows to put in these god-awful modern apartment  buildings.  </P> <P> All anyone cares about now is money. They don't think about the originality or  history of a building.  </P> <P> SUSAN MIGLIACCIO  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

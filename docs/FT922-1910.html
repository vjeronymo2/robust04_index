			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / NZ changes line on immigration NEW ZEALAND is to target the British Isles this year in a pilot programme to attract 'quality' migrants. The emphasis recently has moved from promoting migration to New Zealand in Britain towards attracting immigrants from round the world. This has led to substantial numbers of Asians gaining citizenship. While there is no change in what is, in effect, a global quota of 25,000 a year, the new scheme is expected to see 4,000 British migrants this year compared with 3,000 last year. Cumbersome rules - such as intending migrants must first have job, and no New Zealand resident should be able to do it - have been relaxed.</p>

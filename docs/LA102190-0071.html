			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE  </P> <P> Can someone tell me why the TV channels that show movies right before the news  are obsessed with showing a head shot of the newscaster (we all know what he or  she looks like anyway) while giving teasers of the news to be presented?  </P> <P> When they do this, the cast credits are pulled into an insert so small they are  unreadable.  </P> <P> Some artsy TV directors even tilt the insert. (Audio direction for  embellishment on Calendar's letters page: Readers point your forefinger upward  and move it in a circular motion. Now all together shout, "Whoopee!")  </P> <P> By the time the self-indulgent little dance is over and the credits are  returned to full screen, we don't know who the actors and actresses were but  we're on top of who the construction foreman, head carpenter, assistant  hairdresser and wrangler were.  </P> <P> I suppose the purpose for the whole charade is to hold the audience for the  upcoming news. It doesn't hold me -- in fact I select another channel to watch  my news because of these senseless promotion antics.  </P> <P> DON KUMFERMAN, Ridgecrest  </P></p>

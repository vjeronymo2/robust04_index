			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office: </F> "Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Germany:  Joint Projects for Security-Related Cooperation"]    [Text] Germany and the United Kingdom will be putting a  proposal to Hungary for a trilateral peacekeeping exercise to be  held in 1995. It would take place within the framework of  Partnership for Peace. We intend to involve the NATO authorities  fully in the planning and would hope to include arrangements for  suitable participation by other interested partners.    To reflect our strong support for the U.S./Russia/Ukraine  trilateral agreements and our commitment to a successful outcome  for this enterprise, Germany and the United Kingdom will  continue to participate actively in the coordination of national  efforts to help Ukraine achieve the elimination of all nuclear  weapons on her soil. We will share with each other information  and experience arising from our respective programmes of  assistance, with a view to maximising the contribution we can  make thereby to our shared goal of security and cooperative  relations throughout this region.    We will engage also in a close exchange of views about  experience already gained, especially in German retraining and  housing progranunes for Ukrainian military personnel. The  structures already established in the course of these programmes  lend themselves to future efforts in these fields.    Our traditional Anglo-German Seminar of the two ministries  of  defence, which is scheduled with high ranking participation for  next January at the Fuhrungsakademie in Hamburg, this time will  also focus on our relations with Central and Eastern European  countries. The theme for discussion will reflect the new quality  of cooperation. It is our common intention and understanding  that participation will include representatives from partner  countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong  Yiren discussed the philosophy of commercial activities with a  delegation of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry led by  its vice- chairman Yasuhiko Ueyama here today.    Rong told the visitors that the guiding principle for  Chinese  enterprises stresses both enterprise benefits and social  benefits.    Noting that China is in the process of building a socialist  market economy, Rong said an important aspect of socialism is to  constantly raise the people's living standards.    This calls on all the enterprises to consider not only their  own interests but also social benefits and their commercial  activities must be in accord with the interests of the state and  the people, Rong said.    He also expressed the hope that Chinese and Japanese  industrialists and businessmen will have more exchanges in  enterprise culture.    Present at the meeting was Jing Shuping, president of the  All- China Federation of Industry and Commerce.    The visitors, who arrived here yesterday, are on a five-day  visit with the purpose of knowing about China's enterprise  culture.</p>

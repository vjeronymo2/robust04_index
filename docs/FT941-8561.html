			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (7): How Australia can soar - Turnover is growing faster than that of manufacturing in general Aerospace is not an industry associated in large measure with Australia. Yet scratch at the surface and, as one industry player puts it, 'there is rather more than you might think'. On the aircraft industry front, local revenues amounted to ADollars 1.2bn (about Pounds 580m) in 1990, and the sector employed some 14,600 people. Neither figure looks sizeable in the global context. Even in the Australian setting, the sales figure compared with total manufacturing revenues of ADollars 166bn in the same year. But turnover in the Australian aircraft business did grow quite healthily during the 1980s, with real sales advancing at an annual rate of around 4 per cent, according to a recent Bureau of Industry Economics study. This was a significant notch above that of the manufacturing sector generally. Whether that happy situation can persist in the face of the rapid growth in aircraft manufacturing within the Asian region, and the loss of some government assistance, is more debatable. Some commentators, including the authors of the BIE report, see at least some temporary benefits to Australia from the Asian surge, but warn that the competitive environment may not bode well for the long term. In reality, the aircraft sector in Australia breaks down into two parts. First, there is manufacturing. The country houses a handful of medium-sized companies which are involved in making aircraft components, systems and the like for the big US and European producers. These businesses, in turn, are supported by a raft of smaller local specialist suppliers. Among the larger Australian component companies, two stand out. The first is Hawker de Havilland is now owned by BTR Nylex, which in turn is part of the British BTR group; the other is AeroSpace Technologies of Australia (Asta). The latter business was born out of the former Government Aircraft Factories, being constituted a government business enterprise in 1986. Asta remains wholly-owned by the government, but is widely thought to be on its privatisation list. It is generally acknowledged that the existence of this modest component manufacturing sector is the result of indirect government assistance. Until 1990, Australia's aircraft manufacturing sector benefited from the civil and defence offsets programmes - which demanded that overseas suppliers of aircraft place a certain amount of work with local manufacturers. Four years ago, however, the civil offsets programme was halted for new contracts and, although defence offsets continue to operate, there has been some relaxation of their conditions. As a result, Australian manufacturers are being forced into a more competitive stance. Where this will leave the sector is unclear: the optimists suggest that, with sufficient emphasis on research and development, the local producers may yet carve out niche roles; the pessimists suggest that the future could be tough. The second, and slightly larger, element to the local aircraft industry centres on maintenance work, training, and the general provision of aircraft services. Both HDH and Asta have a foot in this camp - in addition to their manufacturing roles - and much of the work is centred around the two domestic carriers (Qantas and Ansett) and the nation's defence forces. Nevertheless, the general growth in the Asia-Pacific region has created some new opportunities. Last year, for example, the Singapore air force located its training facilities in Western Australia. This is expected to generate around ADollars 23m-worth of infrastructure building - hangars, tarmac and so on. Australian personnel are also due to replace the Singaporean maintenance labour in the few years' time, creating valuable jobs. Australia's space industry, meanwhile, is in a similarly equivocal position. During the 1960s and 1970s, the nation played a fairly significant role in the evolving space technology. Its Woomera Rocket Range, in South Australia, became a base for UK and European launch activity, and Australia proudly claimed to be the third nation to launch a satellite from its home territory. However, much of the financial support emanated from Europe, and when the UK began to reduce its space effort and the European launch cap- ability moved to French Guiana, the Australian role diminished. Today, the country's space involvement is by no means extinct: the Australian Space Office, for example, manages the Tidbinbilla Space Tracking Station, outside Canberra, for Nasa. The notion of re-creating a local launch industry - either at Woomera or in Cape York - has also circulated. But the industry receives only minimal amounts of local funding, and there has been much debate over what Australia's priorities in this field should be. An expert panel in 1992 suggested a pragmatic approach - targeting future applications of satellite-based mobile communications, increased utilisation of earth observation data and a continued focus on collecting such data, and development of the supersonic compulsion Ramjet work led by Professor Stalker but 'with a view to fostering international collaboration'. More recently, the country formally established the Australian Space Council, in an effort to bring a more consistent approach to space-related work and prevent efforts being fragmented between universities, federal and state governments, and the private sector. The first task of this body, only formally legislated into existence earlier this month, will be to deliver a five-year plan. The document is currently said to be in draft.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SOUTHON'S JAZZ STYLE CAN COOL TO EXCESS  </P> <P> Like an air conditioner stuck on high, Sonny Southon's cool-jazz stylings are  first gratifyingly refreshing, but soon become uncomfortably excessive.  </P> <P> At the Roxy on Thursday, the New Zealand native presented an hour's worth of  half-good songs, culled primarily from her debut album, "Falling Through a  Cloud."  </P> <P> Just as a melody would assert itself, her two drummers and one very loud  percussionist would kick up a sort of generic ethno-beat that overwhelmed her  voice and invariably meandered on for too long.  </P> <P> When the band (which also included a bassist, guitarist and two back-up  singers) was kept in check, some provocative songs emerged that could give Sade  a run for her money on the adult contemporary charts. Southon's spritely tunes  bely profoundly dark lyrics about prostitution, heroin addiction, the futility  of life and the like. It's a wonder that she was able to smile.  </P> <P> Her vocalizing has a muffled huskiness to it, as if she were singing through a  surgical mask. The affect is subtly sexy, a perfect complement to her overt  physical beauty, which she sets off well with a peculiar sort of hand jive and  fluid dance steps. Southon may not yet have a handle on a workable musical  personality, but at least she looks like a star. That's often half the battle.  JEAN ROSENBLUTH  </P></p>

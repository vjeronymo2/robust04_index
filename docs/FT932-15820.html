			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas strengthens The best performance from the energy sector of the market came from British Gas after the stock was given a strong boost at the annual oil seminar given by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The broker's bullish presentation on Gas drove the shares up to an all-time high of 313p before profit-taking left the stock closing a net 3 ahead at 310 1/2 p. British Gas was the Kleinwort oil team's prime buy recommendation, with the broker highlighting Gas's growth potential over the next five years. 'Gas's upstream arm will transform the company over the next five years,' said Kleinwort's Mr Paul Spedding. The broker put a valuation of Pounds 5bn on Gas's upstream division, and forecast a startling acceleration in cash flow generated by the upstream arm from 1994-95 onwards as many of Gas's North Sea projects are developed and move into production. Mr Spedding estimated that cash flow would surge from 1993's Pounds 100m to above Pounds 1bn by 1997 and that the division should provide some 30 per cent of Gas's profits by the turn of the century. Kleinwort also focused on the increasing importance of rising unregulated upstream earnings which should give a push to Gas's price/earnings multiple. Regarding the MMC review, the broker 'does not expect a tightening of the regulatory regime'.</p>

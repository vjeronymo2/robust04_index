			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Safety executive to cut jobs The Health and Safety Executive is cutting 230 jobs in the next two years because of reductions in government funding. Trade unions have linked the cuts to what they claim is a lower priority on health and safety laws. The GMB general union said: 'This confirms the government's real intention not to enforce effective health and safety laws. Between April 1986 and April 1992, 3,513 people were killed due to accidents at work. The government has the lives of future workers in their hands.' In the latest public expenditure round the HSE's funding falls from Pounds 195m in 1992-93 to Pounds 190m in 1994-95. The 1995-96 figure is Pounds 192m, Pounds 10m less than requested. Mr John Rimmington, director-general, has assured staff it should be possible to achieve 100 job cuts this year and 130 next year by natural wastage. The GMB has been campaigning against any weakening of health and safety rules in the de-regulation bill to be published next week. Unison, Britain's largest union, has signed a no-strikebreaking agreement with Manpower, the employment agency. Manpower, which placed 66,000 people in temporary employment last year, said it had agreed not to support strike breaking or to let agency staff cross picket lines. In return, the public services union has agreed not to obstruct commercial opportunities open to Manpower. The deal is designed to keep the agency and the union on friendly terms.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Prince Charles is seeing . . .: Dominic Lawson spills the beans about the secret life of gossip A DEAR friend, whom I shall have to call Mrs A---, was startled at a recent cocktail party. A woman, who had never met my friend before, said to her in a tone of strictest confidence: 'My dear, have you heard, the Prince of Wales is having an affair with Mrs A---.' 'Well,' my friend replied, when she regained her composure: 'I am Mrs A---, and if the Prince of Wales is having an affair with me, he could at least have had the courtesy to let me know.' At this point her interlocutor retreated in some confusion. But my sympathies are partly with the gossip. If she had addressed her fatuous remarks to any other person - with the exception of the Prince of Wales himself - she could have been sure of a credulous response. The information would soon have been hurtling around le tout Londres. Indeed it is quite likely that many of Mrs A---'s friends had already been apprised of the non-existent scandal - and were talking to each other of little else that week. It does not take long for society - which in these undiscriminating times includes the higher ranks of the journalistic profession - to be utterly convinced of any number of imaginary illicit relationships. Of course it may be that one or two of them may happen to be real. But how would anyone actually know that X was Y's lover? There really is such a thing as 'just good friends'. In the days when divorce was almost impossible to obtain without evidence of adultery, it was necessary for the 'guilty party' to contrive to be observed  -usually by a private investigator - in flagrante delicto with the lover. Nothing else would satisfy the court's desire for genuine evidence. The same degree of proof tends still to be demanded by the libel courts, which is why the journalistic element of cafe society is reluctant to publish even a fraction of what they claim to know about the love affairs of the famous and high-born. In a way it would be much better for the victims of gossip if the libel laws were less demanding. Once the tittle tattle has appeared in print it is at least possible for the victims to damn the stories publicly as lies. Instead they are subjected to an interminable whispering campaign, which it is as easy to counter as it is to shoot a ghost. In the corridors of the Palace of Westminster and in the air-conditioned open-planned offices of Fleet Street's diaspora the names of mistresses of the most senior cabinet ministers are bandied about insouciantly by the know-alls who know nothing. Lower down the gossip ladder the names of these phantom women are less readily available. Instead one is told that Cabinet Minister X's girlfriend 'is black and lives in Brixton' as if such apparent detail was proof that there must be something in it. The recent 'revelation' in the tabloid New York Post that George Bush had had an affair with Jennifer Fitzgerald, the deputy chief of protocol of the White House, perhaps came as something of a surprise to the US people, but was stale, stale news to the cocktail party whisperers on both sides of the Atlantic. Why, everybody knew that. Of course they did not know it, and now that the New York Post - operating in a country with relatively lax libel laws - has tried to do its bit for the Democratic presidential campaign, Bush has for the first time had the opportunity to denounce as a 'sleazy lie' one of the shiniest old items of Washington gossip. It being August we are unfortunately in the height of the gossip season: the vacuum of real news is the environment in which trivia seem of compelling importance. So all I can do is offer two retorts, useful for countering the party trawling gossip whose stories you wish to squash without actually being rude about it. They are: 'How interesting. What is your evidence for this fascinating piece of information?' or, more archly 'Oh really? And are you personally acquainted with the lady?' Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PANEL TO DISCUSS STADIUM LIGHTS  </P> <P> A group of homeowners that has been seeking for a year to get the stadium  lights lowered at Ventura High School asked Ventura Unified School District  board members Tuesday to form a committee to study the idea.  </P> <P> Despite staff recommendations that the current lights are the best option for  stadium security and illuminating track and field events, board members agreed  to meet with members of the Hillside Homeowners group to discuss their  concerns.  </P> <P> Board members John Walker and Vincent Ruiz volunteered to serve on the  committee.  </P> <P> Residents in the neighborhood surrounding Ventura High's Larrabee Stadium in  the 2200 block of Poli Street have charged that four new stadium lights are too  tall, block ocean views, reflect sunshine during the day and shine into their  homes during nighttime events.  </P> <P> The 60-member group suggested forming a committee of two board members and two  homeowners who would visit Nordhoff High School in Ojai to look at that  school's stadium lights, which are about 70 feet tall.  </P> <P> Members of the homeowners group have said lowering the lights would cost about  $20,000, and they have offered to help raise funds to pay for the modification.

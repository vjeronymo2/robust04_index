			<p>BFN     [Text] An authoritative source has told the Omani News  Agency correspondent in Amman that talks held with Jordanian  officials in Amman by Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, the  minister of state for foreign affairs, centered on the Yemeni  issue and the Omani-Jordanian efforts to preserve Yemeni unity.    Speaking at the conclusion of Bin-'Alawi's visit to Jordan  today, the source said that Oman and Jordan will support all  Arab efforts to promote Yemen's interests based on the  principles and guidelines of the pledge and accord agreement  signed by the various Yemeni groups in Amman last February  through the joint Jordanian-Omani good offices.    Concluding his statement, the source said that the  Omani-Jordanian contacts will continue to follow the Yemeni  issue as long as the Yemeni brothers remain in need of backing  and support from Oman and Jordan.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: LEECHES ARE BACK IN CIRCULATION BUT NOT RECOMMENDED  </P> <P> Question: I am from the old school and believe in preventive maintenance. I  prefer to avoid pills whenever possible.  </P> <P> I have some problems with blood circulation in my legs, and would like to try a  remedy popular in George Washington's day -- medicinal leeches (Hirudo  medicinalis).  </P> <P>  Can you tell me where to find them?  </P> <P> Answer: When my grandfather was a pharmacist in the early 1900s, he had a big  bottle of leeches on the counter for a variety of health problems. But leeches  went out of fashion decades ago.  </P> <P> Today surgeons are rediscovering valid uses for these blood suckers. They are  used in microvascular surgery, for example, in reattaching severed fingers. The  leeches inject an anticoagulant into the local bloodstream where they are  feeding. This prevents blood clots from forming. The leech also removes excess  blood that may accumulate.  </P> <P> Whether leeches would be of any use in your circulatory condition, however, is  hard to say. We can't recommend leech therapy for you nor do we know where to  obtain the little critters.  </P> <P> Q. My husband has a cholesterol reading way over 300. His doctor is very  concerned and has prescribed two different medicines, Lopid and Mevacor, to  bring it down.  </P> <P> He has started complaining about muscle pains and some days he can barely climb  out of bed. He never had anything like this before. Could it be related to his  medicine?  </P> <P> A. Contact your husband's doctor immediately! The combination of Lopid and  Mevacor may lead to a life-threatening adverse reaction called rhabdomyolysis.  </P> <P> Side-effects that have been reported when these two cholesterol-lowering  compounds are combined include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. Urine and  blood tests reveal the breakdown of muscle tissue.  </P> <P> Prompt medical supervision is essential since kidney failure may result if the  medications are not stopped.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TAXI SERVICE FOR SENIORS IS APPROVED  </P> <P> After a three-month delay to resolve insurance questions, the Torrance City  Council voted unanimously this week to award a contract for a city-subsidized  taxi service for senior citizens.  </P> <P> A six-month contract for the city's Dial-a-Taxi service was awarded to  Wilmington Cab Co., which operates similar services for Carson, Lomita, Rancho  Palos Verdes and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The service, which was requested by senior citizens in Torrance, is expected to  start Aug. 1.  </P> <P> The annual cost of the service will be about $210,000, with riders paying about  23% of the cost and the rest coming from the city's share of Proposition A  transportation funds.  </P> <P> One-way tickets will cost $1.75, with low-income seniors paying 75 cents.  </P> <P> Senior citizens will be limited to 20 tickets per month. Tickets enable senior  citizens to travel to any point within the city limits and to El Camino College  and eight hospitals outside the city.  </P> <P> The agreement provides that if a cab does not respond to a call within 25  minutes, the taxi company will pay for the ride.  </P></p>

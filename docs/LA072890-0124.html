			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET SAILORS READY TO STRUT THEIR STUFF  </P> <P> About 50 Soviet sailors steaming toward San Diego have their sights set more on  singing and dancing than military matters.  </P> <P> The group, known as the Soviet Song and Dance troupe, will show their cultural  wares at several public places around town during the brief visit.  </P> <P> Dance buffs can catch up with the entertainers at 12:15 p.m. Wednesday at Sea  World. At noon Thursday, they will be at Balboa Park's Spreckels Organ  Pavilion, and at 6:30 p.m. that day they will perform at San Diego State  University's Open Air Theatre. At noon Friday, the Soviets will return to the  organ pavilion before giving a farewell performance at 7:30 that night at  Tidelands Park in Coronado.  </P> <P> The troupe is aboard the Soviet naval ships that will be making their maiden  visit to San Diego and the West Coast on Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> The fleet of three ships will moor at the Naval Station in San Diego for a  five-day stay. Soviet officers and enlisted personnel will engage in  professional exchanges with the three U.S. fleets hosting the visit.  </P></p>

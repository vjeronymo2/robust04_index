			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Poklad] </F>   [Text] [Poklad] The second congress of the People's Party  of Free Russia [PPFR] was held in Moscow today. A number of  program documents were adopted and the powers of Aleksandr  Rutskoy as party leader were confirmed. Having harshly  criticized the policies of the existing power structures, he set  the task of creating a nationwide social patriotic movement on  the basis of the party to which centralism and compromise should  be alien. In the end, this means the organizational formation  of an uncompromising opposition, although Aleksandr Rutskoy  himself is against such a term.    [Begin Rutskoy recording] If we are talking about an  opposition, then it has to be uncompromising. Why not  uncompromising? What is the point of an opposition otherwise?  The opposition is there so as not to agree with what is  happening in the country today, and can you agree with it? [end  recording]    [Poklad] The PPFR program directives are little different  from the aims proclaimed by many other parties. However, two  tasks can be singled out--the restoration of the state within  the frontiers of the USSR and the holding of early presidential  elections in Russia. The delegates also spoke in favor of  stepping up work with various sectors of the population and  increasing the party's electoral readiness.    The prospects for the Social Patriotic Movement that  Aleksandr Rutskoy is trying to organize are as yet unclear.  However, today it is already possible to say that the  uncompromising opposition has obtained a leader in him.    [Announcer] We have just received a report that the PPFR has  changed its name to the Russian Social Democratic People's Party  [Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Narodnaya Partiya].  Aleksandr Rutskoy has been voted its chairman by a huge  majority.</p>

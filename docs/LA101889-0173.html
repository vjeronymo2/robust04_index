			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WELCH'S FUTURE HOME HARD HIT  </P> <P> Bob Welch, the scheduled pitcher for the Oakland Athletics in Game 3 of the  World Series, looked with dismay at his earthquake-damaged future home today  after a walk through the hard-hit Marina district.  </P> <P> Welch, with a pained expression on his face, turned to his wife, Mary Ellen,  and gave a "thumbs down" sign. His wife held the couple's 10-week-old son,  Dylan, in her arms and tried unsuccessfully to hold back tears, after a short  walk from their current residence, an apartment which suffered no serious  damage.  </P> <P> The couple recently bought the condominium unit in a two-story building. As a  result of the quake, the exterior of the building has large cracks, mostly  around the ground-level garage door and building entryway.  </P> <P> "One good thing, we've got earthquake insurance," Welch said just before seeing  the damaged building.  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blenheim pays Pounds 17m for three acquisitions Blenheim Group, the exhibitions organiser whose shares have almost halved over the past year, has made three acquisitions for a minimum Pounds 17m in cash. They include its first purchase in east Asia, a fast-growing exhibitions market where it has little presence. The first buy involves a complicated restructuring of France's giftware and interior decoration exhibitions. Blenheim, which has two small exhibitions in the sector, is buying the rival MIC exhibition for FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) and injecting all three into the market leader, the Paris Ateliers d'Arts Show, which is owned by a trade association. Blenheim is also commiting a further FFr30m in cash in return for a 50 per cent stake in the joint company. Mr Christopher Crowcroft, finance director, said that the smaller exhibitions had suffered from the recession and the industry did not like the competing shows. Mr Crowcroft said the deal would enhance Blenheim's earnings this year. Blenheim has also agreed to pay L22.6bn (Pounds 9m) for Editoriale PEG, an Italian publisher of technical magazines covering heating, plumbing and sanitation. It also organises Mostra Convegno Expocomfort, an exhibition in Milan covering air conditioning and heating equipment. Editorale PEG made a profit of L3.7bn (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover of L34.2bn (Pounds 13.7m) in 1992. The third deal is designed to give Blenheim a base from which to replicate some of its existing exhibitions in Japan. It is paying Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 900,000) for 70 per cent of Vertical Planning International, which organises the Japanese Aerospace exhibition every four years. Blenheim has agreed to acquire the remaining 30 per cent in 1999 for up to Dollars 8.7m.</p>

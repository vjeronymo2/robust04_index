			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips hit by decline in consumer electronics THE DOWNTURN in the consumer electronics industry pushed Philips, the Dutch electronics group, into a loss of more than Fl 150m (Dollars 88m) in the third quarter, prompting the company to consider making restructuring provisions that are likely to depress full-year results. The company's shares fell heavily on the news, closing down Fl 1.70 at Fl 17.40 Philips, which has gradually scaled back its 1992 forecast over recent months, said it could no longer make a profit prediction because it does not yet know the size of the provisions it will need to take in the key consumer electronics and components divisions. Until now, Philips had said net profits from normal business operations would be about half the previous year's Fl 981m. The company also said that it would not be paying an interim dividend, though it declined to comment on a possible final dividend. Philips has not paid a dividend for two years. Results in the quarter swung into a net loss of Fl 154m from a net profit of Fl 188m in 1991, reflecting the continued difficulties besetting the consumer electronics division and the knock-on effects for the components division, which makes the group's television tubes. The downturn also hurt associated companies such as Grundig of Germany and MEC, Philips' components joint venture with Matsushita of Japan. Mr Henk Appelo, finance director, said that business areas unrelated to consumer electronics, such as lighting and professional products, put in a better performance than a year ago. 'This is evidence to me that Operation Centurion is working,' he said, referring to the wide-ranging restructuring campaign unveiled two years ago by Philips' president, Mr Jan Timmer. Mr Appelo said he was confident that Philips would produce a profit in the fourth quarter, when results are traditionally stronger because of Christmas sales of consumer products and end-of-year purchases of capital goods. Philips would be taking 'clear and tough' measures in consumer electronics and components and examining the future of loss-making areas of these businesses. But Mr Appelo repeated earlier company statements that Philips had no plans to sell entire divisions or to withdraw from consumer electronics. 'Our problem is an industry-wide problem with which we are grappling, just as other manufacturers are,' he said. In the first nine months, net profit from normal business operations totalled Fl 102m against Fl 510m a year earlier. This figure would have been Fl 850m higher if it had not been for the consumer electronics-related businesses. Other areas produced a Fl 400m improvement so far this year. Mr Appelo said price erosion in consumer electronics had 'stabilised' at 3 per cent in the third quarter. Group turnover in the first nine months fell by 3 per cent to Fl 38.5bn.</p>

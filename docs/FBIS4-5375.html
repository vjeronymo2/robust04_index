			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korean delegation  leaves for Marrakech, Morocco, Sunday to sign the Uruguay Round  agreement in the midst of fierce opposition at the home front.    Trade, Industry and Resources Minister Kim Chol-su leads the  16-member delegation to be joined by nine others at Marrakech.  He will be one of the representatives from 123 nations there  marking the conclusion of the global trade pact that comes after  seven years of gruelling negotiations since the first meeting in  Punta del Este, Uruguay, back in 1986.    While protesters rocked the entire nation Saturday to oppose  South Korea's signing of the agreement, Seoul officials declared  they will go ahead to commit to the pact. But Seoul will delay  signing the mandate for the World Trade Organization (WTO) and  its annex protocol until after the parliamentary ratification,  officials said. The mandate for the WTO includes country  schedules in agriculture, industry and services.    Kim will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  while in the Moroccan city where the two officials are expected  to formally discuss wider opening of South Korean market to  American automobiles. He also meets other trade ministers from  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members for an informal  conference to decide on the time, site and agendas to the APEC  trade ministers' talks scheduled or sometime in September or  October.</p>

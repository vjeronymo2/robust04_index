			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro placed a  wreath at the spot where a Cuban plane crashed in 1976, victim  of a criminal sabotage. Outstanding sportsmen who were returning  home bringing many trophies for the fatherland died in this  accident.    In Bridgetown, our top leader assessed some aspects of the  Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island States  with the local and foreign press. Conference special  correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia has provided a portion of the  news conference granted by Fidel Castro in Bridgetown:    [Begin recording] [Heredia] Do you feel satisfied with this  first visit to a Caribbean state?    [Castro] Yes, very much so. And now I would like to know  this  island better because during the days of the conference one gets  to know only the streets and buildings. But the people are very  friendly, very educated, and hospitable. I am taking home a very  good impression of them.    [Unidentified reporter] Would you ratify the idea that Cuba  has attended this forum with a very broad political commitment  with the people of this island?    [Castro] Of course. It could not be otherwise. It could not  be different. These contacts began in Rio de Janeiro with the  group of island states, and I was able to perceive a great  concern conveyed by all those countries, namely over the  climatic changes and the increase in water level. The situation  of these islands is very dramatic. It is a situation of life or  death because a phenomenon of this nature is much more serious  for them more than for anybody else.    [Reporter] But many developed nations have been absent or  are  absent from this conference.    [Castro] Yes, they were absent, but I have noticed a little  more awareness concerning this problem, more than what I saw in  Rio de Janeiro.    [Reporter] Do you think this conference of the Caribbean  states will pave the road for closer relations?    [Castro] Well, the path was being paved, and we hope it will  contribute to a tighter relationship. It is very important to  get to know the leaders, to become aware of their way of  thinking, and as you know, I was not absent a single minute from  this event. I do not know whether you have been here all this  time and seen everything.    [Reporter] Yes, we have been here. The Barbadian prime  minister has said he will try to overcome all differences  seeking Cuba's integration into the organization of Caribbean  states. What are those differences?    [Castro] He was not referring to differences between us;  between us there are no...    [Reporter, interrupting] No, but to some obstacles that  could  exist in...    [Castro, interrupting] The obstacles are well known. [end  recording]    The Cuban president today held a meeting with Governor  General Nita Barrow, sister of the late Barbadian Prime Minister  (Harold) Barrow. Fidel said that for him, it was a commitment to  make this visit because the current governor general is the  sister of the former president who had excellent relations with  Cuba. Today, he has scheduled meetings with reporters from the  regional news agency CANA and from the Caribbean Broadcasting  Union [preceding words in English] television station which  transmits for the entire area.    Today, Fidel Castro is scheduled to visit the Rainbow  Warrior  boat of the ecologist group, Green Peace. This boat has anchored  at Bridgetown port with an onboard fair on sustainable  technology in environment preservation.    Bridgetown, capital and main port of the Barbados islands,  with a little more than 20,000 inhabitants, has just been the  place of one of the most important meetings this year for the  not very much publicized alliance of small island states.    The first Global Conference on Sustainable Development of  Small Island States, which concluded its sessions yesterday,  approved its plan of action and the Barbados declaration as the  guide for sustainable development of the smallest islands.    But can there be sustainable development in one single part  of the world, and development in all other countries? And can  there be such development in extremely wealthy societies which  believe that only by growing will they survive, and which can  grow only at the cost of all its natural resources? Why do they  need more wealth? President Fidel Castro referred to these  questions in the speech he delivered at the conference held at  the (Cherbrum Center) in Bridgetown.    From the very beginning, Fidel said the poor and the small  countries always try to know how are we going to survive in the  next decades, while the powerful nations discuss ways for a new  distribution in the world. For the super developed societies,  the problem is not to grow but to distribute, and not only to  distribute among themselves but to distribute among all.    The Cuban president then said that sustainable development  is  impossible without a more just distribution among all nations.  Whether we want it or not, today, mankind is a single family,  and we will all have the same fate. We must use less deceitful  words and change the current philosophy because this selfish  philosophy has only served to cause the catastrophies we are  suffering today and the worse ones we will suffer in the future.    Shortly after the Cuban president's speech, Barbadian  Foreign  Minister Branford Taitt told Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina during a bilateral meeting that no foreign pressure can  prevent the Caribbean community from taking the necessary steps  to reinstate Cuba into the economic mechanisms of the Caribbean  Community and into the future Association of Caribbean States.    He also said that Fidel Castro's speech to the plenary  session of the conference was brilliant. He added that his  presence in Bridgetown has enhanced the conference and has  helped to establish fundamental elements in the strategies for  sustainable development of small islands.    Expressions of solidarity were also conveyed to Roberto  Robaina during bilateral meetings. Robaina said: We hope and  wish that ties will be strengthened between Cuba and the rest of  the Caribbean islands, and we can cooperate to help Cuba  overcome its current problems.</p>

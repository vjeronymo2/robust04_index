			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- "There are, unfortunately,  still forces in the world which would like to weaken Russia, to  make her a weak country with a cheap working force and a low  intellectual potential" said Russian President Boris Yeltsin on  Thursday, speaking at an all-Russia meeting of the leadership of  the Russian Federal Counter-intelligence Service.    With this in mind, the president emphasized that ideological  conflicts are being replaced by a struggle for spheres of  influence in geopolitics, in which Russia's integration into the  world economy is seen as a threat to the national interests of  several leading states who see Russia as a competitor in  everything.    Therefore, Yeltsin said, "no matter what changes occur in  Russia and the world, it will be a very long time before  counter-intelligence specialists are threatened by unemployment".    There are those who would like to take Russia's natural  resources and acquire her leading technologies in several  spheres. The recent exposure of several foreign spies in Russia  is evidence of this, the president said. But the work of the  federal counter-espionage people should not be judged by the  number of spies they catch. The most important thing, Yeltsin  said, is preventive work; first of all, "espionage activities in  Russia must be prevented".    The president also expressed serious concern over the  "dissolution of the state secret system". The reforming of  ministries, the destruction of the control over secrets which  was formerly exercised by individual government and economic  sectors, and the unfounded liquidation of many supervising state  bodies have resulted in the disorganisation of the former system  of keeping state secrets.    Russia has adopted the law, "On State Secrets", but a new  system of defending state secrets has not yet been created on  its foundation. Yeltsin expressed his opinion that only the  federal counter-intelligence service is capable of reliably  protecting state secrets under the current conditions.  Non-state structures especially need that department's help in  developing and implementing protection measures, the president  said.</p>

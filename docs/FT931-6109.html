			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour demands aid cash details THE LABOUR party is to challenge the government to publish details of its regional spending plans. It wants to highlight how much EC aid to high-unemployment areas may be lost because of Whitehall's failure to provide matching funds. The opposition intends to demand the details at Treasury question time tomorrow, according to Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow Treasury chief secretary. Ms Harman was in Brussels yesterday for meetings with European Commission and parliament officials including Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy. Mr Millan last week confirmed that the UK risked losing large sums of aid to depressed regions because it was not matching EC allocations. Britain has yet to take up a total of Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 1.02bn) in its EC regional fund entitlement for areas in industrial decline for the 1989-93 period. Ms Harman said: 'We want to measure (the government's) allocation against the (EC) funds available.' She also wrote yesterday to Mr John Major, the prime minister, calling on him to take up an estimated extra Pounds 82m the UK should receive from the EC social fund as a result of the devaluation of sterling. The fund is to train the younger unemployed or those out of work for more than a year. Unspent money in the 1989-93 EC structural aid budget will be lost if it is not taken up by the end of this year, even though the Treasury would get some of it back via the UK's EC budgetary rebate. Failure to resolve the 'matching' finance dispute with Brussels could affect the UK's ability to take up its share of the much greater regional funds it looks set to receive under the 1994-99 programme worth Ecu156bn.</p>

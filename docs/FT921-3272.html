			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Evolutionary monkey business - Radio THE BUDGET and the rest were all on Radio 4, but this is not the place to discuss these things - especially after some parliamentary wit observed that this was not a Budget for Britain but for Sam Brittan. After its four debates, Radio 4 adorned Sunday evening this week with The Great Monkey Trial, almost as much a debate as a play. It is an expert adaptation by Peter Goodchild of the transcripts of the trial of schoolmaster John Scopes in Tennessee in 1925. The charge was that, contrary to Tennessee law, he taught that man was not created as described in Genesis, but descended from creatures of a lower order. The prosecution was led by the biblical orator, Williams Jennings Bryan; the defence, by the eminent lawyer Clarence Darrow, an agnostic, who appeared on principle, without payment. At the climax of the trial, Darrow had Bryan in the box as a witness. Did he believe the story of Jonah and the whale? that Joshua stopped the sun for three days? that all living things were destroyed in the flood? that there were morning and evening in the first three days of the creation, when the sun was not made until the fourth day? 'God could have taken care of it,' was a typical Bryan reply. So could the State of Tennessee; such matters were ruled irrelevant, and after a nine-minute deliberation the jury found Scopes guilty. He was fined Dollars 100 - and Bryan died a few days later. The production was recorded in the Warner Brothers studios in Hollywood, under Susan Loewenberg and the BBC's Martin Jenkins. The playing was first-rate, with Edward Asner as the assured Bryan, Charles Dorning the attacking Darrow, the lively presentation by Tyne Daly, whom we know from Cagney and Lacey. There wasn't a dull moment in the whole two hours. The Food Programme last week, fronted by the imperishable Derek Cooper (Radio 4, Friday), was disguised as a sports feature. First, the competition for the 1992 Croque d'or, reported as if a Rugby match (Thanet the winner). Next, sports medicine, starting with, of all things, racing drivers, for whom an extra pound may cost a second, and then Olympic archers, who care less. Other sports, other diets: a girl cox needing hurriedly to reduce from 51 kilogrammes to 45 was on 1800 calories a day, whereas a cyclist in the Tour de France might need 10,000. Frank Dick, of the British Athletic Team, spoke dubiously of infusions of items like vitamin B12, 'prescribed' by locker-room chat. The ethos of sport, he thought, was being damaged by such matters as retarded growth, and the rules might well be rewritten. All Radio 4 this week, for I couldn't find what I was after, FEM FM, the first all-girl station, when I looked for it. Thursday's The New Recruit is a series dealing with newcomers to various professions. Last week, air hostesses; this week, in a similar style, prostitutes. Mostly we heard talk between a 60-year-old veteran and a newcomer, Vanessa. Vanessa needed advice about condoms from her older colleague; after all, as she said, 'I've got to be clean for my baby.' They thought little of the punters, and Vanessa had to laugh at bondage (they said 'bandage"). It was 'like a hobby', only done when broke. I heard no judgment, one way or the other. Also on Thursday, Butterflies Don't Count, a play by Wally K Daly about a priest who hears a confession of murder, which of course he may not tell anyone else. The murder is contrasted with a child's killing a butterfly, which he is told need not be confessed as a sin. There is much talk between priests; there is some over-writing that Daly must have retained from his science-fiction days; and I found it hard to keep up with events. Perhaps it will all be made clear in the sequel next Thursday, Broken Butterfly.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Swedish companies look overseas for salvation: Gustavsberg's response to recession at home and internationally-high production costs THE name Gustavsberg may not have the international resonance of Volvo, Electrolux or Ericsson, but within Sweden it has been a leading brand name for more than 150 years. It is a rare Swede who has not drunk from coffee cups adorned with its anchor symbol, washed in its basins and baths - or sat on a Gustavsberg loo. The company is not just famous for its products; it has a long history on the forested island of Varmdo, off Stockholm, and is noted for its very Swedish tradition of looking after its workers. But as with much else in Sweden's struggling economy, things have changed radically at Gustavsberg as the young chief executive battles to keep the company competitive. Like many medium to large Swedish companies it increasingly finds that the joint pressures of recession at home and internationally-high production costs force it to cut domestic production and look overseas for survival. Mr Lennart Evrell, chief executive at Gustavsberg, explains the strategy: 'Since 1990 we have sold and left different business areas in Scandinavia where we thought we were not going to be able to keep an internationally-competitive position. Then we have acquired companies outside Sweden in areas in which we want to be.' The result at Gustavsberg has been a transformation of the company's traditional profile as a domestically-oriented producer. The process began in the late 1980s with the shedding of a number of companies to establish a core of four divisions - pipes, taps, sanitary ware and baths and showers. Among the units sold off in 1987 was the china tableware factory that dated back to 1825 and which symbolised Gustavsberg to many people. It is now owned by a Finnish company which will end all production on Varmdo this year. In 1990 Gustavsberg made a strategic leap by buying Koralle, a German manufacturer of shower cubicles, making it Europe's second biggest shower box maker. But recovery was still far off, prompting KF, the big co-operative conglomerate which owns Gustavsberg, to bring in Mr Evrell from the engineering group Atlas Copco. He has pushed on with the restructuring. He has closed Gustavsberg's factory making pipe lengths - no advantage of scale for a Swedish producer - and concentrated on joints and bends where more added value can be achieved. A plant making steel baths has shut with production shifted to a German associate - a decision made more expensive by the devaluation of the Swedish krona last autumn, but one which still makes long-term sense, Mr Evrell insists. The result has been dramatic. Overall sales have dipped only marginally to SKr1.35bn (Pounds 113.4m) last year. But operating profit in the first four months of 1993 reached SKr23m, compared with SKr2.2m in the whole of 1991. Most striking of all, two thirds of sales are now outside Sweden, compared with just one third in 1990. Where once there were around 2,000 employees in Sweden, there are now only 600, out of the total group workforce of 1,300. Out of 20 companies in the Gustavsberg group, 13 are outside Sweden. Mr Evrell intends to continue the trend and he says it is one that most Swedish companies are following. He stresses, too, that a company like Gustavsberg does not solve its problems by shifting abroad. With Europe in recession, the danger is that a company buys itself on to a higher profits base - but one where the line is still pointing down. Sweden is looking next year to exports - or internationally-based companies  -to restore some growth to the economy. But the example of Gustavsberg suggests that it will be slow going - and that it will do little to help bring about a turnround in unemployment at home.</p>

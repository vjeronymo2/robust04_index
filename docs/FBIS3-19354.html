			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] We are now going live to our  colleague Carlos Basto at the Altis Hotel in Lisbon where  Antonio Guterres has been reelected secretary general of the  Socialist Party [PS]. Good morning Carlos Basto.    [Basto] [passage omitted] The Socialist Party's new National  Committee has been holding its first meeting here at the Altis  Hotel. You may recall that this National Committee was elected  on 25 February, for the first time directly by the party's rank  and file. This morning the committee has been voting on the  party's other executive bodies. [passage omitted] The results  will be announced shortly. There were no competing candidates,  all the votes were on single consensus lists. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Carlos, perhaps we should point out that this  new  scheme of things is the result of changes to the Socialist  Party's statutes. [passage omitted]    [Basto] The congress at which Antonio Guterres was elected  secretary general was also the party's last congress, insofar as  it was decided that the party's supreme decisionmaking body  would henceforth be called the National Convention. This year's  version will be held in Oporto on 19-20 March. The convention  is shorn of the dramatics that used to be the hallmark of the  congresses, what with the bargaining for votes, the last-minute  candidates, and the back-room negotiations. Under the new rules  the leadership bodies will have been elected by the time the  National Convention is held. [passage omitted] Almeida Santos is  now going to announce the results.    [PS Chairman Almeida Santos] [passage omitted] The National  Political Committee has been elected with 173 votes for, 17  against, 10 abstentions, 18 blank papers, and one spoiled paper;  [applause] the National Secretariat has been elected with 173  votes for, 16 against, 15 abstentions, 13 blank papers, and one  spoiled paper; [applause] The party chairman has been elected  with 194 votes for, seven against, three abstentions, 11 blank  papers, and three spoiled papers. [applause]    [Basto] To a standing ovation, Almeida Santos has just  announced his own reelection as Socialist Party chairman.    [Almeida Santos] Finally, the secretary general [party  leader] has been elected with 210 votes in favor [applause],  four against, one abstention, and three blank papers. My  congratulations to elected and electors alike. [passage omitted]</p>

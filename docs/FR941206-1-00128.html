Written public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses to the regulatory flexibility analysis. The Secretary shall cause a copy of the Notice, including the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, to be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601 et seq. (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Reason for action. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Completion Act of 1992 requires the Commission to prescribe rules and regulations for determining reasonable rates for basic tier cable service and to establish criteria for identifying unreasonable rates for cable programming services. The Commission's existing rate regulations permit operators to pass through to subscribes the costs of obtaining programming plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs. The revised rules, adopted pursuant to the Sixth Order on Reconsideration and Fifth Report and Order, permit operators to use a new per channel adjustment methodology for channels added on or after May 15, 1994, and to eliminate the 7.5% mark-up on new programming costs for those channels. This Notice proposes to determine extent to which cable operators electing to use either the existing or the new going forward rules, can continue to pass through to subscribers a 7.5% mark-up on increases on new programming costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II. Objectives. To propose rules to implement Section 3 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. The Commission also desires to adopt rules that will be easily interpreted and readily applicable and, whenever possible, minimize the regulatory burden on affected parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III. Legal Basis. Action as proposed for this rulemaking is contained in Sections 4(j), 303(r) and 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV. Description, potential impact and number of small entities affected. The Commission anticipates a possible impact on small entities because the Notice addresses the extent to which cable operators, including small cable operators, electing to use either the existing or the new going forward rules, can continue to pass through to subscribers a 7.5% mark-up on increases on new programming costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V. Reporting, record keeping and other compliance requirements. None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VI. Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with this rule. None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VII. Any significant alternatives minimizing impact on small entities and consistent with stated objectives. None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Paperwork reduction Act. The requirements adopted herein have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to impose no new or modified information collection requirements on the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H.

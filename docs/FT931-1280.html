			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher Kingfisher's decision to extend its everyday low pricing policy at B&amp;Q looks like the market leader tightening the screw on the competition. The timing, just ahead of the crucial Easter trading period, is certainly tactical. But the strategy depends upon longer term performance improvements which the others will find hard to match. Texas may find a refuge in the softer home furnishings and decoration area. Do It All has nowhere to run. Only the high costs of exit will prolong the agony. Kingfisher's other big idea is Europe. The Darty acquisition is proof of this commitment, but the proposition still seems suspect. If markets are becoming increasingly similar, then how can Darty's high margins in France be squared with Comet's weaker showing in the UK? Any convergence seems likely to be in the direction of lower, not higher margins.</p>

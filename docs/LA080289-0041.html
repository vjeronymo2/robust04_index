			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The House on Tuesday voted, 399-18, to give an antitrust exemption to the TV  industry so it can try to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent  programming. The bill would give television networks, local stations, producers  and the cable TV industry a three-year antitrust exemption to work up  guidelines for depicting non-news violence on television. At present, such  discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, which caused the demise of  previous industry self-regulation under the Television Code of the National  Assn. of Broadcasters. A Senate version of the bill was approved May 31 with an  amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that also would allow the TV industry to  discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and portray sexually explicit  material. A House-Senate conference committee will have to work out differences  in the two bills, which probably won't take place until after the August  congressional recess. Broadcasters, aware that Congress could impose mandatory  restraints, have supported the legislation but are concerned that they would be  vulnerable to lawsuits from anyone they did not include in the talks on curbing  violence. Broadcasters instituted a "family viewing hour" in the 1970s but  abandoned it in 1976 when the TV industry was sued by the Directors Guild of  America on First Amendment grounds.  </P></p>

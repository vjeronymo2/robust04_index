			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Doubt cast on Spain's deficit target for Emu The Bank of Spain yesterday cast strong doubts about the government's ability to reduce the public sector fiscal deficit this year in accordance with plans to meet the target of Economic and Monetary Union (Emu), Tom Burns writes from Madrid. A Bank report said the fiscal deficit was growing faster than the government had hitherto acknowledged and that it would be difficult to achieve any significant reduction this year. The government has committed itself to reducing the deficit, which stood at 4.4 per cent of GDP at the end of 1991, by at least O5 per cent a year.</p>

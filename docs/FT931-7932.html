			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Rocard's move MR MICHEL ROCARD has long been one of the leading contenders to succeed President Francois Mitterrand as the standard-bearer of the French Socialist party. At various times he has seemed to have at least an evens chance of defeating the most plausible conservative rivals in that election. So his call last week for the creation of a new broad-based liberal-left political movement, to encompass socialists, ecologists and others, is doubly striking since it comes on the very eve of next month's general elections. The most immediate explanation, is that the socialist vote appears to be facing a collapse of catastrophic proportions next month. From a peak of more than 35 per cent in the late-1970s and early-1980s, the socialist score looks set to fall to about 20 per cent; whereas the conservatives may take 40 per cent of the vote, with a huge majority in parliament. It is even conceivable that the socialists may be overtaken by the ecologists. The dilemma for the socialist leaders is that they cannot be sure how much of the likely voting swing is due to temporary factors, and how much is structural. Undoubtedly, there is a large element of popular protest at the corruption in the Socialist party, coupled with indignation at the contaminated blood scandal. No doubt there is also disillusionment that the socialists have offered no remedy for rising unemployment. The unknown question, is how far the fall of the Berlin Wall has stripped the socialist label of political credibility. But if the projected voting figures should, even in part, represent a structural realignment of political sentiment in France, the socialists might never be able to recover power on their own, and they would obviously have an incentive to seek electoral allies. Even so, Mr Rocard's move is a high-risk strategy, both in itself and in its timing. The Socialist party leaders and the grass roots federations will not support Mr Rocard's suggestion if they think it means the dissolution of the party. In any case, it is hard to see how such a radical strategy can be implemented in time to affect next month's elections.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TOYOTA EXPORTS OFF, NISSAN'S UP  </P> <P> Japan's leading car makers, Toyota and Nissan, today reported mixed results in  exports for 1989, with Toyota's exports declining 8.1% from the previous year  and Nissan posting its first rise in four years.  </P> <P> Toyota cited sluggish exports to the United States as the main reason for its  drop.  </P> <P> Toyota, Japan's No. 1 car maker, said total exports for 1989 were down 8.1% to  1,669,130 units -- the first time in two years that total exports fell below  those of the previous year.  </P> <P> Nissan's exports for 1989 amounted to 1,064,172 units, an increase of 2% over  the year before. "This increase in exports reflects 1988's low figure and the  favorable reception of new Nissan models in the U.S. market," the company said.  </P> <P> Both Tokyo and Nissan reported record domestic vehicle sales in 1989 amid  booming domestic demand.  </P></p>

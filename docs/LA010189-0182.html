			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIFTING THROUGH YEAR'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and  thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look  back, some of those thoughts are recalled:  </P> <P> Pamela Dilday-Davis on leash laws:  </P> <P> The Newport Beach police have finally caught up with me. After a year of  reckless disregard for the law, I was cited recently for walking my dog off the  leash. I have difficulty with the leash law, which dictates that all dogs, even  those with no criminal record, have to be restrained when outdoors. No such law  pertains to the roving gangs of tough cats. The officer allowed that he thought  it was indeed a shame that dogs in Newport Beach had no place to run free. I  don't walk Sophie without a leash anymore. I'd like to say that I've been  rehabilitated. But every once in a while, when it's dark and no one can see us,  the old urge to run free takes hold, and we're off on another crime spree in  the streets of Newport Beach.  </P></p>

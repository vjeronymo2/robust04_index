			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on poor figures THE DOLLAR dropped against key currencies yesterday after disappointing US economic statistics offered little hope of prospects for recovery from the recession, writes Andrew Jack. Early on, its downside was tested, since the dollar has failed recently to break through the DM1.68 topside. It fell to its considered sup-port level of DM1.6550 at mid-session. The US Commerce Department released durable goods figures for February showing a decline of 0.1 per cent against a revised rise of 2.4 per cent for January, driven by declining demand for industrial machinery, electrical equipment and defence orders. That compared with expectations of between 1 and 2 per cent growth, and helped to push the dollar down half a pfennig to DM1.65. It later rallied on statistics from the US National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales for February were up 16.1 per cent from a year earlier. At the London close, the US unit was down from DM1.6665 to DM1.6520. Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London said: 'The market was relatively soft all day. But it is difficult to take too seriously these figures on changes in the economy.' He added that housing sales only supported what was already known. He said the market was waiting for a series of important indicators for March which would be released next week and provide more solid evidence of whether the US recession is ending. Earlier in Asian trading, the dollar had closed little changed against the yen at Y133.78 compared with Y133.50/60 at Tuesday's Tokyo close. It was easier against the D-Mark at DM1.6608, down from Tuesday's DM1.6635/40 finish in Tokyo. Dealers attributed the fall to stop-loss selling from early European traders caught long in dollars. The D-Mark ended at Y80.55, against a previous close of Y80.20. In New York yesterday the dollar finished unchanged from London at DM1.6520 but mildly higher at Y133.50. In Europe, the dollar also fell from SFr1.5140 to SFr1.5025 against the Swiss franc, and from FFr5.6525 to FFr5.6140 against the French franc. There were also declines against the Australian and Canadian dollars. The US currency's poor performance allowed sterling to pick up in London yesterday in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the latest batch of opinion polls on the UK general election. The pound rose almost a cent to end at Dollars 1.7287, and later in New York closed higher at Dollars 1.7320. Sterling managed to gain 0.1 on its exchange rate index to 90.1, but remained firmly placed at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism and declined 39 basis points against the D-Mark to finish at DM2.8596.</p>

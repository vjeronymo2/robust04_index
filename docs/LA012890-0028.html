			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOK IT UP  </P> <P> Jeff Vande Wege, whose Jan. 7 letter complains about a Lawrence Christon  article, has it absolutely wrong, though his is, I'm afraid, an increasingly  prevalent viewpoint. It isn't The Times' fault that Mr. Vande Wege wasn't  paying attention in school or didn't consult a dictionary when he first he  heard the words acedia, mediagenic and pusillanimity.  </P> <P> The only criterion for use of any word, obscure or just uncommon, should be  that it is properly invoked. When I come across a word with which I am  unfamiliar -- something which happens many times each week -- I grab the  dictionary that I always keep within reach while thinking how much I appreciate  the writer for exposing me to another previously unlearned aspect of our  remarkably rich language.  </P> <P> Please, please, don't ever dumb-down The Times just to placate those who are  intellectually lazy. If this publication is, as Mr. Vande Wege says, too  "exacting" for him, may I suggest USA Today, or perhaps My Weekly Reader?  </P> <P> BRYAN STYBLE  </P> <P> Mar Vista  </P></p>

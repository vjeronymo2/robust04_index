			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television That bugbear of mankind, religious doctrine, is rearing its ugly head again in India, a country where competing fantasies about the supernatural have proved just as murderously dangerous as in Ireland or the Middle East. Voting in the Indian elections begins next week and the anti-Moslem BJP is expected to make the biggest gains. It wants to turn India into a Hindu rather than a secular state and the country's 160 million Moslems are alarmed. Brian Barron reports for Assignment (7.45 BBC2). As with postage stamps and the industrial revolution, England led the rest of Europe when it came to replacing the divine right of kings with socialist ideals: the Diggers and Levellers of the mid 17th century would have had little to learn from Lenin or the French egalitarians. The fourth of C4's Civil War series concentrates on the radical ideas of the period. A new six part drama series with Brenda Blethyn is a pleasant thought. In All Good Things (9.30) she plays a mother with two teenage sons whose life changes with the arrival of an unplanned baby. That is followed (10.20) by a profile of the Romanian dictator, Ceausescu - Behind The Myth, from journalist Edward Behr.</p>

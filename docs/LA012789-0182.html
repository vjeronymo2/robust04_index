			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO. 2 STATE BOXING OFFICIAL REPORTED TARGET OF INQUIRY  </P> <P> Martin Denkin, the second highest ranking California boxing official, is under  investigation in connection with charges that he extorted money in exchange for  giving career breaks to certain boxers, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> The San Jose Mercury News reported that three managers, who asked that their  names not be used because they fear retaliation, told the newspaper that they  felt pressured into giving Denkin jewelry and cash totaling more than $10,000.  </P> <P> The paper also cited unidentified sources in the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office as saying Denkin has been the target of a probe since similar  allegations were made to that office last summer.  </P> <P> A "top official" in the prosecutor's office, not identified by name, was quoted  as saying, "We are pursuing the allegations, and we are taking them seriously."  </P> <P> Denkin earns $40,000 as assistant executive officer of the state Athletic  Commission, a post where he is responsible for enforcing rules aimed largely at  ensuring safety of athletes in ring sports. He has denied the allegations.  </P> <P> "This is so far-fetched, so ridiculous, so stupid," he said about the managers'  accusations to the Mercury News. "I'm not worried about it."  </P> <P> Denkin also works as a referee at major fights around the world and has  appeared as a referee and announcer in Sylvester Stallone's "Rocky" films. He  said he's made a lot of enemies by rigorously enforcing boxing rules.  </P></p>

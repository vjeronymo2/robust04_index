			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS has previously expressed concern that outmigrating juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may be adversely impacted by the disposal of contaminated dredge sediments at disposal sites located in the San Francisco Bay area. The residence time for outmigrating winter-run chinook salmon through the Bay is thought to range from 1 week to more than 2 months depending on the water year type. Prey organisms utilized by juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may bioaccumulate contaminants originating from in-bay disposal of contaminated dredge sediments, thereby exposing juveniles to these contaminants as they forage and migrate through the Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although NMFS continues to be concerned about the potential effects of in-bay disposal, the Corps has taken recent action to ensure that in-bay disposal of contaminated materials does not occur. In June 1992, the Corps, EPA, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission published proposed interim testing guidelines for dredged sediments that would be disposed of at in-bay sites. On February 1, 1993, the Corps formally adopted these guidelines in Public Notice 93&hyph;2. These interim testing guidelines are designed to ensure that sufficient information is available to characterize sediments to be dredged for all projects so that disposal does not result in chemical or biological degradation of the disposal site. These guidelines are intended to apply to all open water disposal projects until a long-term plan for managing dredged sediments in the San Francisco Bay area is developed and implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the interim testing guidelines adopted by the Corps represent an important short-term action aimed at preventing the in-bay disposal of contaminated sediments, NMFS believes it is essential that a long-term strategy be developed and implemented for San Francisco Bay area dredging and disposal activities. To meet this need, the Corps and several other Federal, state and local agencies, including NMFS, are developing a Long-Term Management Strategy (LTMS) for managing dredging and disposal activities. The LTMS is designed to provide appropriate dredged material disposal alternatives for a 50-year planning horizon through the designation of ocean, in-bay, and upland disposal sites and the identification of beneficial reuse options. Implementation of the LTMS management programs is anticipated to begin in August 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Bank Stabilization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bank stabilization projects in the Sacramento River are believed to adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon rearing habitat. The Corp of Engineers has developed the Sacramento River Bank Protection Project as a long-range program for construction of bank erosion control works. On October 28, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion to the Corps that concluded Phase II of the project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. However, the incidental take statement issued with the opinion requires the Corps to select the least damaging bank stabilization methods available and to provide NMFS with detailed mitigation plans for each bank protection project in Phase II that would adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon habitat. Based on recent information developed by the FWS concerning bank protection methods that minimize impacts and the importance of protecting shaded riverine aquatic habitat, NMFS requested the Corps to reinitiate consultation on Phase II of the project in late 1992. The Corps is currently developing additional environmental documentation for the remaining Phase II bank protection projects, and NMFS anticipates that further consultation will be initiated when that documentation is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

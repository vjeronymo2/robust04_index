			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: RESEARCHERS FIND GENETIC LINK TO SHYNESS, HAY FEVER  </P> <P> Do shyness and allergies go together?  </P> <P> Maybe, say researchers who have found that shy people are more likely to have  hay fever.  </P> <P> "We think there is a small group of people who inherit a set of genes that  predispose them to hay fever and shyness," said Jerome Kagan, a Harvard  University psychology professor.  </P> <P> With three co-authors, Kagan surveyed 379 college students, asking them to  report on their own shyness and their allergies. Their findings were published  recently in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.  </P> <P> Those students who reported a history of professionally diagnosed hay fever had  significantly higher scores on the shyness index, Kagan and his co-authors  found. Hay fever is an allergic reaction accompanied by sneezing and  inflammation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. It is caused mainly by  exposure to grass and tree pollens.  </P> <P> Extremely shy adults seem to be more likely to have hay fever than outgoing  individuals, said Kagan. But in the study, shy individuals were not more likely  than outgoing people to report other types of allergies.  </P> <P> A link between shyness and hay fever might reflect differences in the receptors  along the olfactory (smell) pathways or central nervous system circuits that  regulate both mood and immune function, the authors said. In the past, other  researchers have linked shyness with depression and allergies other than hay  fever.  </P> <P> These recent findings are preliminary, Kagan emphasized, and may not be borne  out in further research. Parents should not imply from the research that they  should coax shy children out of their shells to alleviate allergies, Kagan  added.  </P> <P> "If you have allergies, treat the allergies," agreed David S. King, a UCLA  neuropsychology researcher and a co-author of the study. "If you are too shy,  treat that."  </P> <P> But a Southern California allergist says the researchers might be looking at  the link backwards.  </P> <P> "It's more likely the hay fever causes the shyness, not vice-versa," said Dr.  Robert Ziering, a Vista allergist and UC San Diego assistant clinical professor  of pediatrics. "A child with allergies may have a constantly runny nose. He  hears teachers and parents telling him to take care of it. And that kind of  input can cause kids to retreat into a shell to avoid the correction."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GROUPS ACT TO HELP VICTIMS;  </P> <P> RELIEF: CASH DONATIONS ARE BEST FOR STARTERS, RED CROSS SAYS. IRANIAN  ORGANIZATIONS MAP COORDINATED EFFORT.  </P> <P> Relief organizations and Southern California's Iranian community geared up  Thursday to solicit money and other assistance for victims of Iran's  devastating earthquake.  </P> <P> "The best way to provide assistance now is to send a cash donation," said Peggy  McGinley of the American Red Cross. "Those funds will be channeled through our  international network to the Red Crescent Society in Iran."  </P> <P> McGinley said the Red Cross will help in providing other aid "once we learn  what their needs are. But cash proves to be more efficient."  </P> <P> Checks can be made out to the American Red Cross, Iranian Relief and sent to  2700 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90057. Contributions can also be sent to any  local Red Cross chapter, McGinley said.  </P> <P> About 500,000 Iranians live in Southern California, and the statewide total is  more than 700,000, representatives of Iranian community organizations said.  </P> <P> In Orange County, leaders of the 80,000-member Iranian-American community  rallied to send supplies to the devastated areas.  </P> <P> "We are calling people to bring blankets, clothing and medicine, especially  antibiotics, to the Westminster Cultural Center," said Dr. Farrokh Shadab, a  physician and president of the Iranian Cultural Affairs Center.  </P> <P> Coalitions of Iranian community groups across the state met Thursday evening in  an effort to develop a coordinated approach to assisting their stricken  homeland.  </P> <P> "We've had 1,500 to 2,000 calls today from people asking how they can help,"  said Bijan Khalili, a board member of the Van Nuys-based Iranian Refugee Relief  Organization. "The most important thing is to concentrate the efforts that  Iranians in this country and anybody else can give."  </P> <P> The refugee relief organization has opened a bank account at Bank of America to  accept contributions, Khalili said. Donations can be made at any Bank of  America branch, he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' Islamic Center of Southern California will offer a special prayer  for the victims today and begin collecting money, clothing and medicines, said  center spokesman Maher Hathout.  </P> <P> "The money will be sent to the Red Crescent in Iran through the Red Cross," he  said.  </P> <P> Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based relief organization, asked that funds,  rather than specific items, be donated so that only necessary relief supplies  are brought into the earthquake zone.  </P> <P> Cash contributions can be sent to Operation USA, 7615 1/2 Melrose Ave., Los  Angeles 90046 (213) 658-8876.  </P> <P> In Orange County, leaders of the Iranian Cultural Affairs Center issued a call  for blankets, clothing and medicine -- especially antibiotics. They are being  collected at the Westminster Cultural Center, 8361 Westminster Blvd. in  Westminster, said Shadab  </P> <P> Soliciting financial contributions has been frustrating at times because  distrust of the current regime is preventing many Iranian-Americans from making  donations, some community leaders said.  </P> <P> Farrokh Shokooh, a civil engineer from Mission Viejo, said "it's a shame" that  political considerations are blocking needed aid.  </P> <P> Times staff writer David Reyes in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

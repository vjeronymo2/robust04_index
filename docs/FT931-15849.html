			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / France may use force over camps in Bosnia: Paris ready to act alone as Geneva negotiations remain deadlocked FRANCE said yesterday it was prepared to act alone if necessary to liberate by force Bosnian prisoner camps where civilians are reported to have been raped and tortured. The suggestion, made by Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, came as negotiations for a peace settlement remained deadlocked in Geneva. Speaking on France's RTL radio, Mr Dumas said: 'I suggest . . . we ensure that this liberation is put into effect if necessary by force, since we now have the legal right to intervene and there is evidence of the existence of these camps and of tortures and rape that are committed there.' In Bosnia-Hercegovina, British troops yesterday returned fire against Serb positions for the third time, the first time with cannons, after coming under attack while escorting an aid convoy. No injuries were reported. The UK government is expected to decide soon about sending reinforcements. The aircraft carrier Ark Royal has been placed on alert. Mr Dumas said he had asked Health and Humanitarian Affairs Minister Mr Bernard Kouchner to arrange 'if necessary on our own' for convoys under military escort to go to the camps and liberate them. The French foreign minister's remarks follow the assassination in Sarajevo on Friday by a Serb militiaman of Mr Hakija Turajlic, the Bosnian deputy prime minister, in the presence of French peacekeeping troops, and a visit to Paris at the weekend by Bosnian leader Mr Alija Izetbegovic. It is not clear whether Mr Dumas's threat of unilateral action amounts to a plan. French officials said his proposal to liberate the Bosnians from Serbian camps would only be implemented with the United Nations' sanction. But his statement underlined the intensifying pressures on the French and other western governments to intervene militarily in Bosnia-Hercegovina should the current round of peace talks fail. Diplomats at the UN are preparing a resolution authorising enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia which may pass within days. Separately, a group of Islamic states is meeting in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, today to discuss increasing their support for Bosnian Moslems. Yesterday's clash between British troops attached to the UN in Bosnia and Serbian forces took place near the town of Kladanj as the troops were returning to their base from Tuzla on the route used daily by aid convoys. After coming under fire from Serbian positions, the British troops responded with cannons, firing 17 rounds from light tanks and over 100 rounds from machine guns. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has urged that international military intervention be delayed to give peace a last chance. In an interview to be published today in the US magazine Newsweek, Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia, said such western intervention on the ground would be taken by the Serbs to imply UN support for the Moslems. 'That isn't to say I would rule out a military option,' he said. 'But I'd ask myself, 'What are you doing it for?' Have no doubt: once there's intervention . . . The United Nations will be associated in Serb eyes with the Moslems.' In Geneva yesterday, new proposals by the Bosnian Serbs, intended to give the impression that they may compromise, proved unacceptable to the Bosnian Moslems and international mediators. However, the fact that the talks were resumed at all came as a relief to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, his co-chairman. Mr Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, left the talks in the afternoon for the conference of Islamic states in Dakar. But Mr Vance and Lord Owen emphasised his departure was not 'a walk-out'. They said he would be back in Geneva tonight and would be at the talks on Tuesday. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who it is hoped will put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to reach an agreement, is also due to join the negotiations today or tomorrow.

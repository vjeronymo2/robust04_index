			<p>BFN     [Text] In a written statement today, President Glavkos  Kliridhis stressed that the signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement  has already gone down in history as a courageous and significant  step toward peace that will have a positive effect on the Middle  East and the rest of the world. In his statement, Kliridhis  hails the international community's interest in the Middle East  issue and appeals for greater support by the international  community, particularly the Security Council, to resolve the  Cyprus issue.    Kliridhis said: If the Turkish side remains a prisoner of  the  past, then the Cyprus issue will remain a source of disputes and  danger that could poison the atmosphere in the entire region.</p>

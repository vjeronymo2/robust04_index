			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "With Arms Folded"] </F>   [Text] The Rio police, schizophrenically split in two  halves, one civilian and the other military--but both  incompetent--work only when pressured to do so. Major crimes  that get a lot of attention force them to take action. But with  the passage of time, things go back to "business as usual," as  exemplified by the gangs of drug traffickers who wallow in  bloodbaths in the Acari shantytown, the scene of a dispute over  drug markets.    Under the eyes of police who are in league with them, the  rival bands portray the two faces of the collusion-dependent  personality of organized crime: Parazao, the Red  Command's enforcer, accused on one occasion of having cut up a  10-year-old boy with a chain saw because he had been playing on  their turf, is the bad side, the one that encourages terrorism.  His archenemy, Jorge Luis, is worshipped as a god by the  community for maintaining an atmosphere of tranquility, as if he  were the good side. The shantytown is the stage where the gang  members cavort, always with violence.    These gangs prosper only because there is no police  presence.  Filling the vacuum, the drug traffic and the numbers game lords  take their positions, give orders, and revoke them, counting on  the complicity of the police. In last week's bloodbath, in which  12 people were killed after 30 traffickers arrived by truck and  vans, armed with machine guns and grenades--there is, as always,  a suspicion that the police were involved. Before the violence  broke out, three [police] vehicles had driven through the  favela, as if casing the area. Traffickers identify  police from the Drug Enforcement Division as being associates of  Parazao.    Thus accused of corruption and complicity, the Rio de  Janeiro  police are once again the focus of attention, in a privileged  position alongside the traffickers in their fury. That is where  one finds the examples of insubordination, corruption, abuse of  power, violence, and promiscuous collusion with organized crime.  The police complain about low wages--a pretext for  under-the-table actions. But money is not their only problem.  The cancer originates in poor training, of both civil and  military police. Society itself, at the mercy of organized crime  and corrupt policemen, has contributed to the spread of the  outrages.    When the three police forces--federal, civil, and  military--work together under pressure from public opinion, we  get some results. But normally they are rivals, very often  pursuing the same booty. The drug traffic should long ago have  been made the number one priority of the police because of its  toxic effects, the violence, its tremendous power to fragment a  society. What characterizes the Brazilian police is precisely  its failure to set priorities: its activities dissolve into  indecision, into lack of purpose. The result is a disproportion  that is less and less perceived, between the ability of the  police to curb delinquency and the increase in the security  crisis.    The Acari favela is a typical example: the police  know the gangs are there, know who the leaders are, know their  hideouts, and know what territories they are fighting over. But  the police cannot manage to get organized--or do not want to  organize--to combat them. The dispute has become so acrimonious  that it has been suggested that the army intervene to battle the  traffic in the shantytowns. Political considerations have killed  that initiative.    After the massacre, the police visited the favela.  Strategically, organized crime waited for them to leave before  going back into action. It is a vicious circle. It has come to  the point where violence not associated with any spiritual  principle has degenerated into a gratuitous force, into satanic  frolic, into violence for violence's sake, and it will  ultimately destroy everything around it. Meanwhile, the police  are still standing by, arms folded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today urged Australia to relax  conditions for its technology transfer to China and encourage  more businessmen to invest in China.    During the two-hour-odd talks with visiting Australian  Foreign Minister Graeth Evans, Qian noted that the volume of  Sino-Australian trade reached three billion U.S. dollars last  year, registering a 28 percent increase over that of 1992 and  hitting the all-time high in history.    He said China's economy is developing in a sustained and  healthy way and there exists a great potential for furthering  bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy and communications.    Qian said it is his hope that Australia will soften its  terms  for transferring technology to China, encourage more Australian  businessmen to invest in China so as to further push forward  bilateral economic and technological cooperation in the  high-tech field.    He said that both China and Australia are in the Asian and  Pacific region, sharing common interests and responsibility in  safeguarding the peace and stability in the region and promoting  the economic cooperation there.    "Maintaining bilateral friendly cooperation will be a factor  for the stability in the region," he said.    The Chinese foreign minister said over the past few years,  the Sino-Australian ties have grown rapidly, adding that the  exchanges between leaders of the two countries have increased  and economic cooperation and trade expanded.    "The Chinese side is satisfied with the development of its  relations with Australia," he said.    Evans said that Australia-China relations have been  developing rapidly and yielded fruitful results.    The Australian people, he said, are pleased to follow the  vigorous development of China's economy and they have come to  realize that in China there is a very good opportunity for  cooperation. Australian enterprises are willing to strengthen  cooperation with China, he said.    Evans said the Australian Government wants to explore with  China new ways to further bilateral cooperation.    He reaffirmed that Australia has always supported the  restoration of China's status as a signatory party to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and hopes that  this will be realized before the establishment of the World  Trade Organization.    Evans said that his country will continue to stick to the  "one- China" policy.    During the talks, the two foreign ministers also exchanged  views on other issues related to bilateral ties and  international issues of common concern.    After the talks Qian gave a dinner in honor of Evans and his  party.    The Australian foreign minister arrived here as Qian's guest  earlier today.    Before coming here, Evans and his party visited Guilin.</p>

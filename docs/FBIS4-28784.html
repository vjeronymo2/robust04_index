			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 100 leading academics yesterday made  public an open letter demanding the government and the  opposition jointly set up a special committee to draft a new,  more democratic constitution.    One hundred and thirteen intellectuals from institutions  across the country -- including Chulalongkon, Chiang Mai,  Songkhla Nakharin, Khon Kaen, Mahidon and Thammasat universities  -- signed their names to the letter.    Organizers said it would be submitted to House Speaker Marut  Bunnak on Monday.    The letter said all politicians should cooperate to resolve  the political impasse fuelled by activist Chalat Worachat's  hunger strike as soon as possible, before a national crisis  develops.    The academics accused the Democrat Party of being insincere  in its effort to ease the current political tensions.    Efforts to end Chalat's hunger strike should not be used as  a  bargaining chip by any political group seeking to take advantage  of the situation.    All politicians, and in particular government MPs, should be  decisive in resolving the impasse, the letter said. Opposition  MPs had already declared their full support for Chalat's demand  for a House committee to draft a new charter.    Surichai Wankaeo, deputy dean of Chulalongkon University's  Political Science Faculty, said the letter was aimed at  prompting the government to introduce more democratic changes.    He said if democracy was enhanced Chalat may decide to quit  his hunger strike.    Academic Suchai Trirat said the people should not consider  Chalat's hunger strike "pressure outside Parliament" as Chalat's  purpose was to help develop the parliamentary system.    "Politics does not mean only the people inside Parliament,"  he said.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Record year at J&amp;J as earnings top Dollars 1.4bn JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the leading healthcare products manufacturer, yesterday turned in a 15 per cent increase in underlying 1991 earnings, led by strong sales growth in its pharmaceutical business, and an expanded over-the-counter products line. Net income in the fourth quarter rose about 18 per cent to Dollars 274m, or 83 cents a share, from Dollars 232m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Sales grew nearly 13 per cent to Dollars 3.15bn from Dollars 2.79bn. Stripping out the impact of currency exchange rates, the company said sales increased 15 per cent in the quarter. About half of Johnson &amp; Johnson's revenues come from outside the US. For the year, the company had record earnings of Dollars 1.46bn, or Dollars 4.39 a share, on record sales of Dollars 12.45bn. In 1990, it earned Dollars 1.27bn, or Dollars 3.81, excluding non-recurring first-quarter charges of Dollars 125m, or 38 cents. Sales were Dollars 11.23bn. The company increased its spending on research and development by 17.5 per cent in 1991, to almost Dollars 1bn. Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive, said more than 25 per cent of sales came from products introduced in the past five years. The company's consumer products operations had US sales of Dollars 2.46bn in 1991, up 17.8 per cent. International sales were flat at Dollars 2.12bn. Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals segment performed better than consumer products overseas, bringing in sales of Dollars 2.26bn, up 13.9 per cent in the year. Domestic pharmaceutical sales advanced 16.4 per cent to Dollars 1.53bn.</p>

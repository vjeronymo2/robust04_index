			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brooks Bros staff to vote on strike New York-based staff at Brooks Brothers, the US menswear chain owned by Marks and Spencer, will vote tomorrow on a proposal which could authorise strike action. The 200 employees at the four New York stores who are members of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union have already rejected a new employment contract. The union said yesterday that no formal talks were taking place between the company and itself ahead of the strike vote, although it acknowledged that some informal contact was continuing.</p>

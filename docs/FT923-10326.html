			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Mr Portillo's chance to write the script Of the five junior ministers promoted to the cabinet on April 10, the one who has made the most dramatic start is Mr Michael Portillo. We will come to why in a moment, but first consider the also-rans. The new employment secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, got her name in the papers when she secured a compromise deal on the European Community's plans to impose a maximum 48-hour working week. 'In a word, we've won,' she proclaimed, exhibiting a trace of the tendency to exaggerate so characteristic of her predecessor, Mr Michael Howard. She is becoming known to a small but widening circle of British and European officials for her fluent French and pleasant disposition. Yet she has not sought to advertise herself. This befits the current status of her department. In the 1980s it was the scourge of the organised working class. Mrs Shephard will press ahead with just one more union-bashing bill, as promised in the Conservative election manifesto - but that apart, she says, the government's war against the trade unions is over. Now the employment department is becoming the fiscally hamstrung manager of Britain's training services - the head office that has to keep the training and enterprise councils happy while the Treasury keeps them poor. Nothing dramatic there. Consider next the new Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew. He is not expected to succeed in his job. No Northern Ireland secretary ever is. Yet Sir Patrick seems to have made a breakthrough by persuading unionists, nationalists and the Irish government to sit in the same room with the British for talks on the future of the province. If he eventually produces a solution, such as an agreement that enables Northern Ireland to become self-governing, he would have pulled off a coup that all his predecessors since Stormont was dissolved in 1972 could hardly dream of. Then, in a fairy tale world, his reward might be promotion to home secretary. If, indeed. Yet Sir Patrick does not seek the limelight. In his position that would be wrong. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, on the other hand, cannot help being a focus of public attention. Anyone in charge of the health service must be. She has the job because she has a sympathetic face, one that might convince a doubting public that the Tories really believe in the NHS, even while London hospitals with surplus beds are closed. Her recent white paper on healthy living, which set targets for the reduction of named killer diseases, was one means to this end. Mrs Bottomley is an over-conscientious minister who has yet to learn that there is a level of detail below which the head of a great department need not stoop. She has no great schemes to offer. She seems content to occupy herself with consolidation. She will do well if she makes the NHS reforms work and puts in place the new scheme for community care. It is a fitting task for a quintessential public servant. Mr John Patten is ambition made flesh. He spent a decade aching for a cabinet post while others of his generation seemed to pass him by. Now that he has arrived the new secretary for education has taken to setting off firecrackers. One, of which I heartily approve, was the opening essay in this week's white paper, which the minister himself wrote. It sets out the principles of a rigorous approach to teaching in schools, with the emphasis on demanding that teachers must have high expectations. Terrific. The second Patten firecracker aims to end local authority control over schools. A new funding agency, answerable to the secretary of state, will do the job instead. Mr Patten will be lucky if he gets moved from education before this dangerous new device blows up. Bits will constantly be added. One day it will explode, damaging the careers of those associated with it. Of the above four, Mr Patten is the only one with brains enough to match Mr Portillo. Yet the latter is displaying that it is not a matter of being clever, it is more that you have to be clever in a particular way. As chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Portillo is well-placed to influence the strategic thrust of government spending, both next year and in the medium term. His predecessors have had to harry and cajole spending ministers into compromises. Mr Portillo's job is quite different. He will write the script for the chancellor to approve. It happened this way. After the election our new chief secretary opened the envelopes containing the initial bids from ministers and found claims totalling Pounds 14bn above the previously planned total spending of Pounds 244.5bn for 1993-94. He calculated that the average success rate of chief secretaries in clawing back similar demands was 30 to 40 per cent, which means that the overshoot next year would have been Pounds 8bn to Pounds 9bn. This would be too much even in a good year. In a year in which the Treasury's panic about the growth in government borrowing is tangible, it could not be allowed. There are various accounts of who first thought of last week's plan, which was to say at the beginning that Pounds 244.5bn would be the limit of spending, but Mr Portillo is the one whose job is changed. It is he who will consult the spending ministers and report back to the chancellor's new expenditure committee. This puts the chief secretary in a pivotal position. He has the political sense to understand that he must be seen as the servant of the new system, not the master of departments, or, heaven forbid, as one who aspires to control the political balance of the governments' policies. So next week polite letters will go out asking each spending minister to say how plans (a) to, shall we say, (d) would affect their departments. Plan (a) would inflict equal cuts on everyone; subsequent options would vary as between departments. The chief secretary already knows what must be spent and what is at the margin. Treasury officials expect what they call the 'McEnroe response' - that is, 'you can't be serious'. Mr Portillo will then talk with each minister, after which he will prepare menus of options for the chancellor's committee, always faithfully recording the departmental position on each proposed reduction or increase. His own views will be in there, but they will not be identifiable. There will be room for appeal and the committee might change the mix of any Portillo menu. Yet the one that the chancellor sends to the full cabinet for ratification will be based on the chief secretary's initial work. This new public spending mechanism is more rational, and more collective, than the old. It recognises that increases in one line must be matched by decreases in another. Make no mistake. The primary means by which the proposed new reasonable expression of the government's political will is to be realised is the writing hand of Mr Michael Portillo. Then the chancellor may exercise his greater power. But that is another story.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Toxic chemicals found within half a mile of Anderson Reservoir outside San  Jose, which provides water for one-fourth of Santa Clara County, will be  cleaned up at a cost of $20 million by United Technologies Corp., a  rocket-motor company. The firm was ordered last January to clean up the area by  October, 1990, after the solvents trichloroethylene, or TCE, trichloroethane  and freon were found in the ground near the company's facility. The sites had  been used to dispose of toxic chemicals for three decades before dumping was  banned. The reservoir supplies drinking water for 300,000 people.  </P></p>

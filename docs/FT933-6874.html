			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Taiwan air IF THE negotiations between Taiwan and British Aerospace over their proposed joint venture seem to be dragging, there is room for sympathy. For both parties, the failure of the deal would have serious implications. BAe would be harmed both financially and strategically. For the Taiwanese government, the money is less important than the fact that the deal carries the burden of an industrial policy which seems to be causing some argument within the administration itself. Taiwan's basic problem is familiar enough. After decades of growth and rising wages, it is no longer a low-wage economy. At the same time, it lacks the technology to compete at a higher level, for instance with the US or Japan. Like many other countries, it has identified aerospace as one of the crucial technologies of the future. Since it has almost embarrassingly large financial resources, it proposes to buy its aerospace technology wholesale. The debate revolves around the fact that by comparison with Korea or even Japan, Taiwan has succeeded mainly through the skills of the small-scale entrepreneur rather than those of the large-scale planner or corporation. The other two countries based much of their early success on the art of picking winners. How far Taiwan can acquire the knack at this late stage is an open question. This in turn leads to the next question at issue, which is whether aerospace is the right horse for Taiwan to back. Full-scale aircraft assembly is rare both in Japan, which has much more of the relevant technology, and in Korea, which knows all about giant-scale planning. Taiwan has yet to develop an independent motor industry, which is in some ways a plausible precursor to aerospace. Taiwan might perhaps argue that it is a special case. Historically it was not allowed to buy western military aircraft, and thus had to start a fighter programme of its own. In the past year US policy has changed, so that Taiwan now has US fighters and a fledgling domestic components industry which is looking for new business. That is one argument for linking up with a full-scale aircraft assembler. Another is longer term in nature. There is a vast potential market for short-haul aircraft in the Far East generally and China in particular. Taiwan has good assembly skills and still relatively inexpensive labour to marry with BAe's technology. It also has capital for an industry which is famously cash hungry. If the project did succeed, it could be very rewarding for both parties. All in all, it is not surprising that the negotiators are having a few late nights.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Stomp appeal - Post-punk, pre-grunge, Sophie Constanti enjoys this troupe's industrial style Stomp is a troupe of DIY music makers; a sound and motion relay team of six men and two women, all of whom have the tough, dusty, whitewash-spattered appearance of building site labourers. As they wander onstage - coughing, sniffing and shrugging - you almost expect them to start passing bricks and planks to one another or to call for a tea break. But in the workmanlike fashion which, it soon transpires, is an essential part of Stomp's heavy handed, unadorned, industrial style (and a major element of their appeal), they set about manipulating dustbins, brooms, rubber pipes, buckets, newspapers and each other to create walls of sound which rise and cascade to often thrilling effect. Post-punk, pre-grunge and hellbent on discovering rhythmic possibilities in the most simple, everyday actions and objects, Stomp's performers treat the stage as workshop floor. Here they not only practice their trade, but engage in the petty rivalries of the workplace - frustration, one-upmanship and glee made visible by body language, facial expression or a single aural response delivered with an acute sense of comic timing. When the foreman, a cherubic, too clever by half wideboy character, is not keeping an eye on his colleagues or leading them in a militant tap dance, he is challenging the audience with a repeat-after-me series of clapping rhythms, making participation seem like an activity charged with fun rather than embarrassment. Other members of the cast devote most of their energy to the total physical theatre of noise-making: they use knotted rags to thrash at the shallow pools of water on top of an arrangement of oil drums; standing in tea chests, they hulk across the stage, gasping furiously with each burst of effort; harnessed to the facade of the show's junk-laden scaffolding tower, they swing from side to side, beating a selection of items to mimic the delicate chimes and hypnotic spectacle of figures on a huge, decorative, outdoor clock. The muscular strain involved is unconcealed, even celebrated; a brute strength which colours and defines Stomp's brand of disciplined, humorous yobbery but is frequently interrupted by more subtle assertions of power, authority and wilful non-co-operation. A thumbs-up, a look of disdain, refusing to play the game or initiating one's own amusement and excluding everyone else - these are the quiet, personalised moments of a show which relies heavily on team effort. Anyone who derives pleasure from rummaging through skips full of useless junk, or is convinced that every scrap of rusting metal and piece of splintered wood is potentially recyclable will love Stomp. So will anyone who has tried to find light entertainment in the most mundane of household chores. After watching Stomp in their Socialist Worker meets Fred Astaire opener - all swishing brooms and dancing feet encased in Blundstone boots - or in their washing the dishes routine in which four men, each wearing a kitchen sink unit in the way that a cinema usherette wears her box of ice creams, plunge their rubber-gloved hands into soapy water for a droll, anarchic, scrub and rinse ballet, you might even start to believe that the task of removing stains on the carpet can be turned into a domestic artform. At Sadler's Wells until February 5</p>

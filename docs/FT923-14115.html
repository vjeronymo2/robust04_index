			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Two Zandra Rhodes companies go under MS Zandra Rhodes, the fashion designer whose creations have adorned the great and glittering for more than a quarter of a century, has been forced to put two of her trading companies into voluntary liquidation. Zandra Rhodes UK,the company that manufactured her fashion creations, and Zandra Rhodes Shops, which sold them, have been declared insolvent after a drop in orders, particularly from the US. Ms Karen Kaliszewski, Ms Rhodes' co-director, said: 'It is not a question of Zandra Rhodes going out of fashion. We still have our loyal customers who will always buy Zandra Rhodes.' The parent company emphasised that the core of the business remained sound and would continue to sell Ms Rhodes' distinctive and elaborate fashions. Manufacturing work, however, will now be subcontracted to selected outworkers. Six factory workers have lost their jobs. Another eight to 10 will be re-employed elsewhere in the company.</p>

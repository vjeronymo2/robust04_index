			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas met again today with Joe  Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus. The  meeting, which began at 1200 at the president's residence and  continued through lunch, lasted approximately two hours.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he held  constructive and beneficial talks with Clark and the contacts  were positive for the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas reported  that he explained the situation to Clark within the framework of  the letter sent to the UN secretary general. Denktas added: I  believe they were satisfied.    Pointing out that the UN envoy will also meet with Greek  Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis and is trying to  obtain results from the talks, Denktas remarked that he is  trying to be of assistance. The president stressed that the  Turkish Cypriots' position and principles are known, adding that  he reaffirmed that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to conduct  any kind of negotiations as long as these principles are upheld.    Asked if he is subjected to any pressure, Denktas said: No,  there is no such thing. In reply to a question if he was given  a message on a possible change in Kliridhis' attitude, Denktas  remarked that it is the result that is important in such  contacts and there is no result yet.    Denktas was also asked if any distance was covered, to which  he retorted: We did whatever was necessary. Now, we think that  the Greek Cypriot side must inform the secretary general in a  letter on what they plan to do and what they accept.    Recalling that Clark arrived on the island in a bid to  accelerate the negotiating process, the president expressed the  belief that he achieved this. Answering another question,  Denktas said that the preliminary preparations must be conducted  in Cyprus before going to New York.    Denktas underlined that the changes for progress in the  talks  will increase if the Greek Cypriot side conveys to its new  generation and accepts the fact that the Cyprus problem stems  from the Greek Cypriots' wish to annex the island to Greece.    Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Clark  expressed the conviction that all the meetings he held in Cyprus  were useful. Noting that he does not wish to make any comments  at this stage, Clark said that he may issue a statement before  departing the island tomorrow. Asked if he will meet again with  Denktas after his meeting with Kliridhis, Clark said that he may  establish contact on the telephone.</p>

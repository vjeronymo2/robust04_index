			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Ya. Varshavskiy, M. A. Kozykina, and Ye. G. </F> Monastyrskaya, NPP ``Avtor'', Mytishchi;  UDC677.529-96:541.182.12]    [Abstract] The need to develop low cost carbon sorbents  caused a rise in interest in the use carbon fibers made from  pitch for this purpose. Compared to carbon fibers made from  acrylonitrile or viscose, these fibers are made from a low cost  and readily available source using an effective fiber-forming  method (from a melt) and an ecologically clean method of  production of the carbon fiber at high (75-80 percent) product  yield, and the possibility of developing a fully mechanized  technological stream of high unit capacity. A simple and  effective method for activating carbon fibers made from pitch  has been developed under laboratory conditions. An experimental  set-up, developed for studying the dynamic characteristics of  the sorption process on activated fibers, was used to study the  porosity of the fibers (pore volume, specific surface, and pore  size distribution). Based on this study, the process was  optimized for producing sorbent samples capable of sorbing up to  600 mg benzene per gram of fiber. Pore size of the samples did  not exceed 35 Angstroms, the average being 10-15 Angstroms. The  fiber has a strong activity towards both polar and non-polar  substances: benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, acetone, and ethyl  cellosolve. The goal of further research will focus on the  development of a technological process for activating  carbonaceous materials made from pitch and its related equipment  design.</p>

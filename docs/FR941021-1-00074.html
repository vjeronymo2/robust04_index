			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended (NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (RRA) (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary to permit the use of any areas within the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) for any purpose, including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the purposes for which each refuge was established. The Service administers the Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary. The RRA gives the Secretary additional authority to administer refuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purposes for which the refuges were established. In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under this Act, the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available for the development, operation, and maintenance of the permitted forms of recreation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Opening Package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In preparation for this opening, the refuge unit has included in its ``openings package'' for Regional review and approval from the Washington Office the following documents: a hunting/fishing plan; an environmental assessment; a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); a Section 7 evaluation or statement, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, that these openings are not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat; a letter of concurrence from the affected States; and refuge-specific regulations to administer the hunts. From a review of the totality of these documents, the Secretary has determined that the opening of the Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge to upland game and big game hunting is compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management and will otherwise be in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has also determined that this opening for upland game and big game hunting is compatible and consistent with the primary purposes for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available to administer the programs. A brief description of the hunting program is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 101&hyph;593, enacted by Congress on November 16, 1990, authorized the establishment of Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The refuge is located in Concordia Parish in east central Louisiana. It was established to protect some of the last remaining, least disturbed bottomland hardwoods in the Mississippi River Delta. These forested wetlands represent one of the most valuable and productive wildlife habitats in the southeastern United States. The stated purposes found at 104 Stat. 2957 provide that the refuge purposes are (1) the conservation and enhancement of wetlands; (2) the general wildlife management as a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System, including management for migratory birds; and (3) for fish and wildlife-oriented recreational activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total refuge acreage is proposed at 17,269 acres, including an 11,230-acre core tract formerly owned by The Nature Conservancy. The remaining 6,039 acres are adjacent, privately-owned tracts. Acquisition to date totals 9,805 acres of the core tract. The area offers attractive shallow-water feeding habitat for pintails and other dabbling ducks such as mallards and blue-winged teal, and provides excellent habitat for resident game, including white-tailed deer, turkeys, woodcock, and grey and fox squirrels. The bottomland hardwoods also serve as both permanent homes and migration habitat for many species of passerine birds, including songbirds and neotropical migrants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

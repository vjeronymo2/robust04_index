			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FEAR OF WESTLAKE NORTH  </P> <P> As residents of Lake Lindero, we are very fearful of the Westlake North  project. The density is enormous. We fear for our lake -- no provision has been  made for a construction debris basin, no long-range plans for runoff.  </P> <P> To us that means the project doesn't anticipate much runoff due to everything  being covered with buildings, asphalt, grass and planting. That still permits  chemical runoff that will disturb the delicate balance of our small lake.  </P> <P> We also fear stepping out of our house on Lake Crest Drive to be cast in the  shadow of a wall of office buildings. Traffic will be our worst nightmare, well  on the way to creating another San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> We urge the city of Westlake to please stick to your general plan. Please don't  sell out your neighbors in Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> JACK and GINNY KING  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / MPs demand national public debate on NHS trusts THE GOVERNMENT'S National Health Service reforms demand a 'public debate at national level,' the Commons health committee said yesterday. In its first report during the present parliament, the committee sets out plans for a four-year programme to monitor the effects - 'both positive and negative' - of last year's measures and next April's community care changes. Included in its plans are questions about what citizens are entitled to demand from the health service and what resources are necessary to meet those demands. The Commons committee's programme was announced in an interim report on NHS trusts, which have day-to-day managerial responsibility for their own affairs, published yesterday. It concluded that it 'remains difficult at this stage' to distinguish benefits of trust status from the wider effects of the NHS reforms and the impetus likely to arise from any management restructuring. Some early concerns about the impact of trust status - including potential loss of the benefit of strategic planning - might not be said to have been totally allayed, the report says. But it complains of a 'lack of clarity in the government's policy towards future investment in the NHS'. In addition, it suggests that difficulties might arise from dismantling the national framework for negotiating terms and conditions of employment, the committee reports. It also highlights questions of accountability and involvement of NHS users in consultation on allocation of financial resources. Publication of the report gave rise to immediate political disagreement. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, interpreted the health committee's report as putting added weight behind growing acceptance of trusts as the model of NHS organisation for the future. 'The fact that trusts represent the future of NHS provision makes it more important that any problems, some of which the select committee has identified, are properly addressed. I welcome debate on these issues,' she said. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the report showed that the government's reforms were leading to fragmentation of strategic planning, the further destruction of accountability and the development of a two-tier health service.</p>

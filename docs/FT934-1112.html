			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / ABB man to lead new Volvo board Leading Volvo shareholders, which forced the Swedish carmaker earlier this month to abandon its planned merger with Renault of France, have agreed on the composition of a new board. Institutions yesterday proposed a seven-man board to be chaired by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish operations of Asea Brown Boveri, the leading European electrical engineering group. He is chairman of the Swedish Engineering Industries association and vice-chairman of the Federation of Swedish Industries. Nominations, to be proposed at a shareholders' meeting on January 19, preserve a balance between the two main power blocs in corporate Sweden, represented by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and the Wallenberg interests and by Svenska Handelsbanken. Other proposed board members include Mr Tom Hedelius, chairman of Handelsbanken, and Mr Per-Olof Ericsson, president of Sandvik, the engineering group and also a member of the Handelsbanken board. Mr Svanholm comes from the Wallenberg sphere. He is also a member of the board of Atlas Copco, the engineering group and a key Wallenberg company. He will be joined on the Volvo board by Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president of SE Banken and a board member of Wallenberg companies including Ericsson and Stora. The institutions are also proposing Mr Hakan Frisinger, a former president of both the Volvo group and of the Volvo car operations, who emerged as an outspoken opponent of the planned merger with Renault, as well as Mr Soren Gyll, president of Volvo. The board will be completed by Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault - the biggest single shareholder in Volvo with 10 per cent of the votes. Mr Schweitzer was one of the architects of the failed merger, along with Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, and is the only foreigner proposed. Under the leadership of Mr Gyllenhammar, Volvo had fought hard to remain apart from the Swedish financial establishment and to maintain its independence from single-owner groups. Institutions, which have more than 40 per cent of the votes, are seeking to bring the carmaker into the mainstream of the Swedish corporate and financial establishment. Profile, Page 19</p>

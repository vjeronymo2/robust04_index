			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Martin Minkov] </F>   [Text] There is no doubt that this [downing of planes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina] is a very serious incident, but in my view  one should not overdramatize the situation. The planes were  downed as a result of them violating the no-fly zone that was  imposed under the UN resolution last year, and it has no direct  connection with the NATO ultimatum that, as our listeners are  certainly well aware, led to the peace that reigns in Sarajevo  at the moment. However, what is alarming is that the violation  of the no-fly zone happened after the ultimatum. In my view, it  is this aspect that transforms the violation into a deliberate  provocation aimed at testing out [the no-fly zone] and  establishing to what extent the international community,  represented by NATO, is firm in its intention to use force in  the event of an action that contravenes the categorical  conditions specified in the key documents -- the UN resolution  on the no-fly zone and the NATO ultimatum.    The point of the sounding-out operation was to find out the  following: If, in the event of a violation of the no-fly zone,  the monitoring forces limited their reaction merely to a  warning, then if the NATO ultimatum was breached, one might also  be able to get off scot-free, speaking figuratively. It is now  clear that this will not be the case, and the people who  continue to look for loopholes in the firmly adopted stances  should draw the proper conclusions, namely that they [the NATO  forces] will act firmly, that is, use weapons, in the event of  any attempted violation.    Regarding the issue of the identity of the planes in  question, at the moment it appears that they belonged to the  Bosnian Serbs, according to NATO claims. However, the Bosnian  Serbs hastened to deny that this was the case, and Belgrade also  says it knows nothing. There has been no official reaction from  the Croatian and Muslim sides. Accordingly, all this has to be  further investigated. Nonetheless, it is most likely that the  planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs, who are in the best  position to deny the fact. It is very doubtful whether anyone  in Pale, or wherever else their military command is located,  would allow himself to conduct such an experiment without first  consulting Belgrade and without carefully considering the  possible consequences if the planes were downed, as in fact was  the case. Since the attempt did not come off, the position of  denial or possibly shifting blame to some third-level commander  is now the only possible alternative, to prevent an escalation  of the international military pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

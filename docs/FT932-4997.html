			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Top union officials meet Timex executives in London A SECRET meeting was held last night in London between senior executives of Timex and the national leaders of the AEEU engineering union to discuss how to resolve the four-month dispute at the company's Dundee plant. Thursday's unanimous rejection of a peace plan negotiated between the company and the union shocked both sides and they want to see whether any further progress is possible. Privately, union officials are amazed at the derisive way in which the strikers - most of whom are women - treated the offer. When the officials arrived in Dundee they were ready to recommend the deal to the workforce, but the shop stewards refused to accept it. The shop stewards made clear they would settle only for a return to work for all 340 strikers without any strings attached, such as the proposed 12-month wage freeze and cuts in fringe benefits. The chasm between the strikers and local union officials and the union's national leadership has never looked wider. The union is concerned that the strikers are living in an unreal world, buoyed by media publicity. 'The danger is that Timex will turn into a circus,' said one official. On June 19 a demonstration is planned in Dundee against Timex, which has few friends left in a city with a strong union tradition. Hard-left supporters see Timex as a chance to revive their fortunes after many years of defeat on the industrial scene, and are holding collections all over the country. Timex may not have realised the momentum that has built up behind the strike it precipitated when it sacked the workforce and replaced it. One official said: 'The women are in no mood for compromise. They feel insulted and they won't give up.'</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): Not just jumbos are larger than life WIDE-BODY: THE MAKING OF THE 747 by Clive Irving Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 18.99, 384 pages DOGFIGHT: THE TRANSATLANTIC BATTLE OVER AIRBUS by Ian McIntyre Praeger Publishers (dist. by The Eurospan Group) Pounds 34.50, 312 pages JUST LIKE the new 600 to 800 seat extra-large airliner now being studied by the world's leading manufacturers, the commercial aircraft industry has always had a larger than life quality. Every aspect of the business seems to take on a jumbo dimension: not just the conception and construction of ever bigger jets with ever bigger engines, but the money, the politics, the internal infighting and the international repercussions are all of gargantuan proportions. Two new books sustain the image. Wide-Body by Clive Irving is a detailed account of how Boeing risked the entire company to develop and build the 747 jumbo, an aircraft that revolutionised air travel by bringing the world into everybody's reach and pocket. Dogfight by Ian McIntyre is the byzantine story of the transatlantic battle over government subsidies for the European Airbus consortium and trade in aircraft. Very different in content and approach, the two books are complementary. Wide-Body tells the early story of the jumbo jet and how it enabled Boeing to dominate the world commercial airliner market. Considerable research has gone into this book which dwells at length on the technological challenges undertaken by Boeing to build the 747. Dogfight takes the story on with the emergence of the Airbus consortium providing a concerted European challenge to the American manufacturers and to Boeing's particular hold on the market for very large aircraft. This book concentrates less on technology and much more on the international politics of commercial aviation, with a lively account of the propaganda war between the US and Europe, of the Airbus animal and the less than orthodox way of selling aircraft to airline customers around the world. Selling an Airbus or a jumbo is a bit more complicated than persuading someone to buy a Mercedes or a Pontiac motor car, Mr McIntyre explains and then goes into some of the ferocious campaigns fought between the rival manufacturers to secure a big order from an airline. The book is more directed to students of the GATT, of international trade and of opaque accounting and business practices rather than to the aircraft enthusiast, who will probably find more absorbing the aerodynamic wranglings of Boeing engineers in Mr Irving's book. The trouble with writing about the commercial aircraft industry is that you need to update constantly your material to keep pace with developments. The 747 will soon be superseded by an even bigger jumbo which Boeing has now agreed to study jointly with the four European partners in the Airbus consortium, its deadly rival. If the project goes ahead, it will lead to an entirely new realignment in the aircraft manufacturing industry - which will tax not so much the fair trade negotiators as the anti-trust experts.</p>

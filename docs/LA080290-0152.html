			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN DELETES MONEY FROM BUDGET FOR LA CANADA'S GLOBAL STUDIES PROGRAM  </P> <P> A proposed global studies program to prepare La Canada High School students for  the international world of business was among educational items cut from the  state budget late Tuesday by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> In deleting the proposed $293,000 grant to the La Canada Unified School  District, the governor said the "project is not as high a priority" as issues  affecting other school districts that are too crowded.  </P> <P> The grant had been written into the budget by the Legislature at the request of  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "I guess the governor wasn't convinced"  that the program was important enough to retain, Nolan said.  </P> <P> School officials had planned to work with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and  Pasadena Community College in developing the program. It would have been a  pilot project for similar programs in other districts, Nolan said.  </P> <P> La Canada district officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P></p>

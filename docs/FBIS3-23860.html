			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Dobyndo, deputy director of </F> Body-Assembly Production of the Volga Passenger Vehicle  Production Association, by Sergey Bystrov, TRUD correspondent:  "VAZ After Conveyor Start-Up"]    [Text] The second work week at AvtoVAZ this year  ended today. Only the second, because the motor vehicle giant  delayed the start for a whole month. This was a mild shock to  the country. But what about the plant? In general, what awaits  it, its motor vehicles and our motor vehicle fans? Our TRUD  correspondent interviews Mikhail Dobyndo, deputy director of  body-assembly production of the Volga Passenger Vehicle  Production Association.    [Bystrov] Mikhail Nikolayevich, the future of AvtoVAZ is,  after all, the future of all our passenger vehicle building as  well. We suddenly learn that our motor vehicle giant, perhaps  even as a surprise to itself, is begining to stumble. What has  happened to it?    [Dobyndo] As the person responsible for the direct finished  output of motor vehicles, and as deputy production director, I  would in this situation still single VAZ out from the complex of  problems which exist around us as a whole today. We stood idle  for a month, fearing that complications might arise with the  start-up of the equipment, because the conveyor had never before  been shut down for such a long time. For planned repair work,  for two to three days -- of course. But this was for a month.  The conveyor came to a standstill. Large-scale repair work on it  was in full swing -- it was being modernized. Naturally, we  feared for the control system: it was easy to disturb it and  hard to put it right, and we also feared some sort of unexpected  losses. This does happen. Nevertheless, we started it up  successfully and did the entire program for a whole week. I  don't remember having done a program for a whole week running  like that in the last five or six years. Last Saturday, we even  had to shut down the conveyor 45 minutes early, so that we would  not put out superfluous motor vehicles.    This indicates that the plant has lost nothing on the  organizational-technical plane. It has not lost its traditions  or its stability, and most important -- has not lost its people.  The plant will operate -- we have no doubt of that.    As for matters linked with price formation, with product  sales and with non-payment problems -- they are very critical  for us even today, and they are holding us back.    In the first week we assembled 12,500 cars, and sold 7,000  at  best. Not only do we now have finished vehicles parked in  fenced-off areas, we have gone out beyond them. This is because  we don't have the proper sales. Before the new year we had  uncompleted cars standing in the same place, but now they are  marketable ones. It is already a bit easier. True, even now we  have some things not completed, but that is all right: for  example, there is no upholstery in the trunk compartment, nor  cigarette lighters.    Money is coming in with paralyzing slowness, however, even  for the goods that have been sold. This year we began to receive  payments only after 25 January. After all, the supplier plants  have no money either, and cannot get started without it. But the  money was late coming to us, and it is late getting to them. We  had to seek internal reserves. On 4 February, a trilateral  agreement on delaying wage payments was signed between the  administration, in the person of our president, the production  council and the trade-union committee. Wages for our plant now  constitute about 25 billion rubles [R]. We have not paid wages  for January to those who were working, and we did not pay for  December. We paid only monetary allowances. It was decided in  February to pay half of the wage for December and January. This  will give us a saving in the order of R15 billion, which can be  thrown in to help the suppliers. In March, however, we will try  to pay the rest. Our people were understanding about this.    [Bystrov] It is clear that your main problem is creating  normal conditions for conveyor operation. When these conditions  do not exist, it causes great difficulties for the plant. Can it  be that some sort of basic changes are needed? And moreover,  quickly, while work is going on? Let us say, with that very  non-liquidity of the product?    [Dobyndo] How did our plant's non-liquidity form? Primarily  because we have lost the market of the former Union. It used to  be that only about 40 percent of our motor vehicle sales were  made in Russia. Last year we sold 97 percent of all the sales on  the territory of the former USSR in the Russian Federation. We  have completely lost Ukraine and all the southern republics,  including Kazakhstan. Why? It is the same problem of  non-payment. The problem of unstable currency. There is no  clear-cut mechanism for clearing operations between the former  republics. Even though we receive from Ukraine, let us say, a  lot of completing items (all the wiring for the motor vehicles  and the zinc-plating for the gas tanks come from there), we get  it for payments. We generally settle accounts with the  neighboring countries in full, mainly with commodities. Today  this is not very profitable, because this does not allow our  sales offices to develop normally or study the market. We are  forced to be attached to monopolists, who hold us back.    The Russian motor vehicle market for us today is almost  saturated. I don't think that our motor vehicles are too  expensive right now. They were expensive when, beginning on 1  November last year, we very sharply raised the price level,  thereby virtually suspending shipments and sales for two months.  In the past we would follow inflation, but still lagging behind  it, we raised the prices by 15-20 percent almost every two  months. For us this process delayed sales by about a week or  two. In November, however, not counting on the stabilization of  the ruble exchange rate, we decided to create for ourselves the  conditions for stable work, at least for one quarter. Our  desires, however, were not realized. Still, we can see that  everything around us is in much worse shape than our motor  vehicle plant.    [Bystrov] Will you perhaps now have to take special care of  your independence in all your relations? After all, it is to be  hoped that the economy surrounding the plant will stabilize  quickly?    [Dobyndo] Formally, we now have enough independence. We have  the independence to make all our decisions. If, however, by this  you mean economic self-provision, it cannot help but depend on  the situation in Russia in general. In any developed country,  the motor vehicle industry is an indicator of the state of the  entire economy and the state of industry. Our country, it seems  to me, does not want to think about this. Any motor vehicle  industry, in the time of its crisis, enjoys powerful financial  support from the state. Right now Chrysler and Ford are working  on the creation of a motor vehicle for the next century. They  have powerful support from the state. This does not happen in  our country. Apparently, it feels: whoever comes to the surface  will swim out. Very serious destruction of industry continues.  After all, while VAZ once provided 1 percent of the gross  national income, today, together with our subcontractors, we  provide 10 percent of Russia's gross national income. Even under  these conditions, they don't show all that much concern for us,  and it is difficult to survive.    What funds did we have for development up to now? We had  enough from what was sold on the domestic market for our  internal consumption and development without reproduction.  (After all, we are left 18 kopecks from the ruble, and the other  82 kopecks go for taxes, for inordinately high taxes. When we  ask the state for help, we are merely asking it to return part  of what it took from us.) We obtained the funds for reproduction  from export sales. Because reproduction is primarily the  reproduction of technology -- and you need currency here.    But while the state formerly took almost all the profits  from  us, one could "break loose" money from it, and quite a lot, for  the development of any sort of programs. To be sure, when  readying the VAZ 2110 model, we counted on the appropriate help.  According to all the schedules, the motor vehicle should already  have come off the main conveyor, and this year we planned on  coming out with the planned output of the "Ten." We had bought  virtually all the equipment, and moreover, a long time ago. It  has been lying around our plant for over 18 months now, that is,  the equipment manufacturer's warranty period has already passed.  There were no funds. When we start pinching from the cash boxes,  we don't know what will happen. In general, though, we have no  funds at all for development. For the first time we have begun  to sell currency, in order to ensure normal production.    With any foreign partner, a contract is concluded when  deferred payments are stipulated. Moreover, they are solid. It  is normal practice throughout the world. In Russia, however,  there is pre-payment everywhere. Where can we get it? Who will  give it to us?    I realize that from the monetary standpoint, any state  infusion today causes some additional percentage of inflation.  Without it, though, industry cannot develop. Where, when, which  belt should be shut down, which one intensified -- this is the  art of those who are responsible for reform in the country.    [Bystrov] I understand that the plant's future rests on the  "Ten," and that without this step, the next ones are almost  impossible?    [Dobyndo] The "Ten" is not the future of the plant, but a  necessary step, without which we will lose the sales market.  This year Russia seems to be protected from the influx of  foreign makes. Our future is the next motor vehicle and  extensive modernization of the plant and the assembly conveyor,  at least the second belt, where the "Five" and the "Seven" are  assembled. It is still hard to say, though, when this future  will be traced out. The second future is connected with the  production of the "Niva." At this production site, modernization  will begin in literally two or three years, in order to produce  the lengthened "Niva" in accordance with the standard for normal  modern "jeeps." And with a new engine, up to two liters, etc. At  the same time, a separate assembly plant should continue to  produce 100,000 "Sixes" for the domestic market, so that we have  money. We have the capacities for this.    These are the prospects, although the situation may change  at  any moment. The "Ten" has already been created, it has only to  be launched on the flowline. The quicker that happens, the more  profitable for the plant, the consumer and the country.    [Bystrov] The most important question for VAZ right now is  the transition to new technology, for after all, the basis of  the existing technology has its roots in the late 1960's. Modern  technology, though means cutting back the number of people in  the production process. This is a good thing, as long as people  don't suffer. What awaits the plant here?    [Dobyndo] Yes, the fewer people employed in production, the  more improved the technology. We will have no superfluous  people. It is enough to remember that the AVVA program requires  a huge number of specialists. This means we must fight  resolutely to cut back the number of workers in the shops.    Where do we see reserves? In the first place, welding.  Today,  we have about 800 people working in the shop producing the  "Six," but for the same program for the "Eight" and the "Ten" we  have half the number of people working in the shop. True, there  are more mechanics here, and very highly skilled ones. In the  new, modern shops, however, if we succeed in stocking them up,  the program for 200,000 motor vehicles a year can be ensured  with only about 100 people. In the second place, painting. Today  Chrysler, it is true, has just a little less than our capacity,  and employs 56 people, but in our plant -- there are almost 800.  In the third place, assembly. All modern motor vehicle plants  today operate translifts -- self-powered electric bogies, which  run on monorails according to their own program. There are none  of these pusher conveyors, no weighting of structures and no  interweaving of conveyors aloft or unnecessary service  personnel. There must be translifts, because one can't manage  without them, even though the principle of the conveyor remains  the same as in our plant, for even in the West they have not  been able to think up anything better. On the other hand,  though, "wheeled technology" has long been in existence there.  That is, there are no warehouse facilities. The transport unit  which delivered the completing items to the conveyor is the  warehouse.    [Bystrov] There was a time when you delivered completing  items by air. This kind of "wheeled technology," however, is a  very expensive pleasure.    [Dobyndo] Right now, unfortunately, the situation is the  same. We use planes and helicopters. This is where the expense  lies, and we should by all means eliminate it.    [Bystrov] The problem of supplies of completing items is in  general a sore point for any plant. As far as we can see, mass  losses of suppliers are taking place these days. Won't you also  have to lose them or change them?    [Dobyndo] It is not that easy to change suppliers today,  even  if you feel like it. Those same bundles of electric wires from  Kamenets-Podolskiy. The motor vehicle plant's currency funds  were invested there, and all the cooperation ensuring the output  of these bundles is directed there today. What does it mean to  organize this type of production all over again today, let us  say, in Russia? A lot of time and capital. Is it necessary?  International cooperation is branching out all over the world. I  do not think that we have to take a different path. Our plant  always had the policy: develop our own suppliers, in order to  raise the level of the motor vehicle as a whole. It is simply  senseless to lose what we have invested now. On the contrary, we  are striving to help our suppliers, we are now tracing the  entire chain of suppliers from the ore to the finished item  which comes to us, in order to ensure uninterrupted supply. It  is a very difficult matter, but we are forced to deal with it.    At the same time, of course, we are gradually developing a  network of suppliers, and are also using defense enterprises for  this. We have set up Lada-Konversiya, a joint venture, with  headquarters in Moscow, which deals with working out a program  of interaction. Possibly, in time, we will revise something  somewhere, but it is simply impossible and purposeless to change  mass supply immediately. After all, cooperation unites not only  our economy, but also our people, so that supply volumes,  including those with former socialist countries, even with the  former Yugoslavia, are not cut down anywhere.    [Bystrov] Will it be somewhat easier for the All-Russian  Motor Vehicle Alliance than for you?    [Dobyndo] If they manage to put the business on a normal  market basis, then it will, of course, be considerably easier  for them. Their starting point is different from that of the  plant. The plant has piled up its losses in the last few years.  The president signed an edict on the AVVA and on the motor  vehicle plant, which removes the excise tax and all taxes on  products made for development of the AVVA. Loans are provided  for....    In the last few years we have long been trying to find some  sort of foreign partner for normal investment and development.  It seemed that we were just on the point of signing an agreement  with Fiat -- it did not happen, and then we were close to  signing a contract with West German firms. Why? The motor  vehicle plant still seemed to them an unreliable structure, even  after it became a joint-stock company, because as before, state  psychology was still retained there. The AVVA, however, is a  completely new psychology, a new level of relations, virtually  that very capitalization which organizes them. Our technical  level is no lower than that at foreign plants, and the level of  our specialists is quite high. Foreign firms are now after  contacts, on their initiative, because they can see: this is  precisely the form of ownership which the AVVA will have, which  guarantees the investment of capital. There is a  military-industrial complex with its own assets, there is the  plant with its own assets.... This is an absolutely  denationalized structure.    [Bystrov] Everyone hopes that the All-Russian Motor Vehicle  Alliance will, all the same, produce vehicles that the people  can afford. There are few people who can afford yours at this  time.    [Dobyndo] Inflation will do its job, and our motor vehicle  will again become affordable for the buyer. Even before,  however, our vehicle was not affordable for the population  masses.    [Bystrov] Even recently, though, almost every worker would  put his name down on the waiting list for a Zhigul.    [Dobyndo] Yes, he put his name down because they were  selling  in a different way. At that time a motor vehicle, under the  conditions of its scarcity, had two prices: the state price and  the market price. The latter was sometimes three-fold higher.  One out of a thousand, however, had the chance of buying a new  vehicle at the state price. Even at the state price, many people  acquired a car on borrowed money, to part with their purchase at  a profit later, thereby putting his material situation in order.    In general, however, we always delayed in establishing  prices  for our motor vehicle, so that its wholesale factory price would  constantly be lower than the market price. Only last year did we  anticipate the market with respect to prices and we therefore  slowed down sales. The plant is not free to dictate prices,  though. There is a lower limit, which production expenses  restrict, and there is an upper limit, restricted by buyer  capability. This interval is very narrow, and we must not only  be able to survive within it, but also to expand it, for freer  maneuvering. The country needs our motor vehicle. Without it  Russia will never be truly independent. It is not an easy task.  But what is easy today?</p>

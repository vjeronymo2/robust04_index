			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: Iriplaceable Running Iri, Italy's giant state holding company, has invariably proved a thankless job. Maybe that's why Silvio Berlusconi's door has no anxious queue of contenders outside it. No one is hurrying to replace departing chairman Romano Prodi. Berlusconi and his boys have yet to fix on a suitable candidate. Time is running out - Prodi is leaving on Thursday, after Iri's annual meeting. One front-runner still appears to be Ennio Presutti, the 63-year-old head of Assolombardo, the Lombard business federation and Italy's most powerful regional business lobby. His credentials are impeccable. Though Roman-born, he is an honorary Milanese through his work, and thus in sympathy with the predominant 'northern' strain in the government. Presutti made his career with IBM in a host of senior executive posts in Italy and Europe. He also has numerous board directorships in the private sector. On paper, precisely the kind of managerial experience needed to wind up a debt-ridden and outmoded institution such as Iri. There's a catch. With a cv like his, Presutti appears rather too radical for the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance ministers. After all, Iri was a Mussolini invention and a central pillar of his corporatist state . . .</p>

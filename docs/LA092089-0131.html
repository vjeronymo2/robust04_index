			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGNERS' FACTION DID L.A. ITS WAY  </P> <P> Even the names suggested there could be some friction. "California Collections"  was an amiable assortment of Los Angeles designer shows, held in daylight under  an airy white tent. "L.A. My Way" was a fashion show with an air of defiance,  staged at night, in a building under reconstruction.  </P> <P> More than the crowds, the cover-girl models imported from New York, or the  clothes themselves, it was the tension between these two fashion factions that  pointed to significant change during this year's spring '90 California press  preview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Sampling of Styles  </P> <P> But first the clothes. Several dozen designers presented a sampling of their  new styles in the annual event, sponsored by the California Mart. The "My Way"  show included three Los Angeles designers -- Andrea Vincent, Peter Cohen and  partners Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli -- along with New Yorkers Carmelo  Pomodoro and Patricia Clyne. It was located in, and sponsored by, the Eastern  Columbia Building, one of several newer, downtown sites where designers rent  showrooms.  </P> <P> Together, all of the shows demonstrated, after a slow progression from swimwear  and Hollywood glamour gowns toward individualistic ready-to-wear, a strong  group of younger designers has developed a definite foothold.  </P> <P> It's as if they finally get it: Los Angeles isn't the home of exquisite  tailoring, couture-quality fabrics and five-digit price tags. At least not in  its contemporary market, which is the one singled out in these shows.  </P> <P> At this level, fashion is all about moderately priced and spirited  "interpretations" of New York and European styles, from the most classic to the  most outrageous.  </P> <P> Not only do the designers seem to get it, they're making the most of it. Their  works look more wearable, and better made, in better quality fabrics, than ever  before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Best of the Bunch  </P> <P> The best of the bunch in this week's shows included Peter Cohen's styles, as  basic as baseball jackets and T-shirts, in luxury fabrics that give them an  attractive air of arrogance.  </P> <P> Katayone Adeli brought lady-like elegance to two labels: Laundry for weekdays,  and Ricky for weekends. The Ricky collection didn't lose in her obvious  translation of denim and khaki looks from Donna Karan's DKNY collections.  </P> <P> Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli held the lead in what once was referred to as  "patio dressing." Their lingerie-like, black lace bustiers worn instead of  T-shirts under tropical print pants suits were a surprising mix that looked  right for L.A. nights.  </P> <P> </P> <P> World-Class Imports  </P> <P> The fact that the famed model, Iman, a veteran of Paris and New York runways,  wore the clothes didn't hurt. In fact, the "My Way" show in which Beach and  Cappalli participated featured a number of top models, each imported for the  occasion. It was the first time any of them participated in Los Angeles press  week and it was an object lesson. A world-class model can make even the most  ordinary outfit seem to sizzle.  </P> <P> James Tarantino's meticulously finished dresses looked like classic  architecture -- the kind that considers human needs. Cut-out shoulders,  V-backs, oversized collars, all in sophisticated pastel shades of linen, were  his entry. Earlier this year Tarantino won the Sil d'Argent award for  excellence, presented in Monte Carlo where Paris superstar designer Christian  Lacroix commended him on the quality of his work.  </P> <P> Among the dozens of neo-hippie and ethnic looks Los Angeles designers showed  for spring, Sue Wong's and Gary Roark's Moroccan and Indian styles were both  notable. Wong used origami shades of silky jacquard, Roark used trinkets and  tiny bells as trim. Pepito Albert's late-night wear -- especially the ivory  unitard with net cape -- was flamboyant and fun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More to Come  </P> <P> Some highly regarded designers -- Mimi Levitas-Cox for Opera, Mark Eisen, Karl  Logan, Antony Moorcroft and Robin Piccone for Body Glove -- are nominees for  the Mart's Designer of the Year award and will unveil their work at a separate  show.  </P> <P> To some extent, the strength of the collections, and the new confidence of the  designers, are behind this year's rift. For close to 10 years, press week has  been sponsored and subsidized exclusively by the Mart, which is also the  landlord to nearly all designers in the shows.  </P> <P> This time, some of the best established designers (both renters and non-renters  of Mart showroom space) wanted to stage solo shows. Others wanted to stage  group shows during press week, but outside the auspices of the Mart.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to go against the Mart," says Yvette Crosby who produced the  "My Way" show. She approached the Mart building owners, the Morse family, about  staging her event under their tent but she was turned down. "There is growth in  the Los Angeles fashion industry, and inevitably that means change," she  maintains.  </P> <P> David Morse, a partner of the Mart building, says he couldn't "sanction"  Crosby's show because of one specific consideration -- real estate.  </P> <P> "We want our own real estate to be successful," he begins. "The other event  allowed another real estate project to put their name on it." (Crosby wanted to  credit Barclay Associates, a group of eight investors, landlords of the Eastern  Columbia Building, for subsidizing her show.)  </P> <P> If Morse's critics have a shared complaint, it is the family's attention to  property holdings above all else that concerns them. They worry that property  takes priority over the growth of the city's fashion industry.  </P> <P> But Morse begs to differ. "We agree with the idea of other shows. Our feeling  is, there's a lot of room. We just want to be the umbrella."  </P> <P> Next year's shows could be even more interesting.  </P></p>

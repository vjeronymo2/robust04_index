			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marta Salomon] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The mint is getting ready to print the  equivalent of $2 billion in bonds that will serve to back the  financing of the elections for president, governor, and federal  and state senators and deputies in October. This is the  preliminary estimate of the cost of the campaign this year --  the first one in which the law will allow donations from  companies and individuals. From the stamps on the letters to  voters to opinion polls, shows, small jet expenses, and  television programs, everything must be accounted for by the  political parties and converted into electoral bonds that will  be issued by the national Treasury.    According to TSE [Superior Electoral Court] Director General  Alysson Mitraut, without having received the official campaign  budgets from the parties yet, the TSE has suggested that the  Finance Ministry print 20 million electoral bonds with values in  UFIR's [reference fiscal unit] and real cruzeiros ranging from  the equivalent of $100 to $100,000. Despite the high value of  the bond issuance, the members of Congress who approved the law  last September admit that part of the campaign money will not be  controlled by the TSE.    The TSE cost estimate has shocked Finance Ministry experts.  The proposal sent to Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal  coincides with an unofficial scale that circulates in Brasilia  on the election costs. According to the scale, a deputy can be  elected for approximately $500,000. A campaign for governor  costs between $10 million and $15 million. And the election of  the president of the Republic might cost something between $50  million and $100 million.    At the end of the campaign, if the law is fully obeyed, the  TSE will have identified the financing sources of each  candidate. Without testing the law's efficiency, the TSE is  certain of one thing: The expenses that will be officially  declared will be much higher than those in 1989. For example,  during the last presidential elections, the coalition that took  former President Collor to power declared having spent $850,000  in the two election rounds -- nearly 100 times less than the  average cost estimated for the presidential campaigns this year.  [Workers Party presidential candidate Luiz Inacio] Lula [da  Silva] said he has spent $365,000, which would only pay for  three hours of television programs.    "Everything used to be registered in a double accounting in  the past," admitted Deputy Eraldo Tinoco (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front  Party- Bahia], responsible for the financial guidance of the PFL  candidates. "There was a lot of hypocrisy in the past," Senator  Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Pernambuco] summarized. During the times  of the CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] on PC [Paulo  Cesar Farias], Maciel suggested that campaigns be financed by  the government like in Germany -- the only way, he says, to put  an end to double accounting by companies, the diversion of funds  from the national budget, or the reception of funds from the  illegal numbers lottery.    "We will be very careful with the campaign money," said  former Mayor Pimenta da Veiga, one of the coordinators for  Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy. PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] Secretary General Sergio Motta thinks Cardoso's  campaign will cost something between $50 million and $70  million. "It is absurd to speak of hundreds of thousands of  dollars," Motta said.    The campaign committee of PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva believes Lula should spend more than what  he spent in 1989 but not spend very much. According to PT  members, transportation expenditures will be the highest but  this will be compensated for by the low cost of television  programs because the law demands that they be filmed in studios.    Electoral bonds are an innovation in Brazil. They were  designed while the electoral laws were being amended, and their  objective is to make transparent the relations between  candidates and their financial agents. They operate as an  electoral "currency," with receipts issued as in a legal  financial operation.    The existing law sets forth that they will be printed by the  mint as bearer bonds, numbered and valued in reference fiscal  units (UFIR). The law also sets forth that they will be issued  for a total equivalent to the overall expenses estimated by the  parties for each election, at all levels.    Parties will have to operate with those bonds and will  identify recipients -- the enterprises and individuals who make  donations for the campaign, for example, this year, for the  candidates for the presidency, state governorships, Senate,  Chamber of Deputies, and legislative assemblies. Financial  supporters are entitled to an income tax reduction. For their  part, parties must keep a list of donors, identifying each  delivered bond, for five years.    It is expected that the bonds' creation will break the  "underground" connection between candidates and entrepreneurs,  especially contractors, avoiding in the future the repayment of  investments made during the campaign in exchange for projects,  favors, and budget amendments to satisfy the interest of  electoral "donors."    Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Sepulveda Pertence  fears  that despite the issuance of bonds, irregular donations to  campaigns will continue. In fact, the electoral courts will have  a very short time -- less than one month -- to analyze party  accounts before the elected officials take over their posts.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Hungary to seek finance for projects HUNGARY is set to open up infrastructure development to western investors in an effort to pull the economy out of recession, the new finance minister said yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Foreign companies could finance the construction of motorways, airports, railways and eventually mines, Mr Ivan Szabo said at a parliamentary confirmation hearing. The finance minister's infrastructure drive will receive an early boost from the naming in the coming days of a western-led consortium to finance, build and operate an extension of Hungary's M1 motorway to the Austrian border. Mr Szabo also promised to back write-offs of bad debts to allow partial sales of Hungary's four large state-owned commercial banks. This makes life easier for the five western investment banks which last week began advising on the privatisation of the banking sector.</p>

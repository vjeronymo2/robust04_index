			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S BEST: ABC HAS FUN, FUN, FUN; OPRAH GETS A SERIES AND THE MATERIAL  GIRL HAS HER OWN WEEKEND ON MTV.  </P> <P> DIRT ON THE BEACH BOYS  </P> <P> ABC is sure to point out that its Sunday-night movie, "The Story of the Beach  Boys: Summer Dreams," is based on an unauthorized biography, and that the music  in the film is not performed by the Beach Boys. With that disclaimer out of the  way, the TV drama plunges into a tale of betrayal, sudden stardom, family  control, paternity suits, divorce, death and personal battles with drugs and  alcohol. It all starts in 1961, when Dennis Wilson, played by Bruce Greenwood,  privately urges shy brother Brian to quit writing Lawrence Welkish music with  their father and give rock 'n' roll a try.  </P> <P> "The Story of the Beach Boys: Summer Dreams" Sunday 9-11 p.m. ABC  </P> <P> LIFE AFTER DEATH  </P> <P> Stephanie Zimbalist stars as a woman presumed dead for 15 years who returns to  the family fold right before a large inheritance is due in the CBS "Hallmark  Hall of Fame" presentation, "Caroline?" The problem is, not everyone is  convinced of Caroline's identity. The film co-stars George Grizzard as the  workaholic father, Pamela Reed as the suspicious stepmother, Patricia Neal and  Dorothy McGuire. The movie, from veteran TV director Joseph Sargent, is based  on E.L. Konigsburg's novel, "Father's Arcane Daughter."  </P> <P> "Caroline?" Sunday 9-11 p.m. CBS  </P> <P> A KICK OUT OF SINATRA  </P> <P> Frank Sinatra's library of 13 TV specials spans almost 25 years-from 1965's "A  Man and His Music" to 1988's "Concert for the Americas." In the specials, he  shares the spotlight with entertainers such as Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, Orson  Welles, Princess Grace, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jr. As part of its  regular "Sunday Night Showcase," the Disney Channel is presenting a different  Sinatra special every other month. The first, "Ol' Blue Eyes is Back," debuted  in 1973 when Sinatra came out of retirement. Gene Kelly joins him singing "New  York, New York," "Me and My Gal" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."  </P> <P> "Ol' Blue Eyes is Back" Sunday 9-10 p.m. Disney Channel  </P> <P> OLIVIER'S TUBE TRIUMPHS  </P> <P> Laurence Olivier's 1986 TV role as an aging vaudeville comic in the  "Masterpiece Theatre" production "Lost Empires," which got him an Emmy  nomination, capped off a shining TV career. Best known for his stage and film  roles, Olivier was an actor, producer and director for a variety of TV  projects. This electronic side of him is celebrated in "One Man in His Time: A  Tribute to Laurence Olivier." The biography features clips from Olivier's TV  work, including "Cat On a Hot Tin Roof," "The Collection" and "Come Back Little  Sheba."  </P> <P> "One Man in His Time: Tribute to Laurence Olivier" Tuesday 5-6 p.m. and 9-10  p.m. A&amp;E  </P> <P> POLITICAL INTRIGUE  </P> <P> The story of Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev is a political epic with the  sweep of Tolstoy and the turmoil of Dostoyevsky. We have already absorbed  perestroika and glasnost into our vocabulary, but do we really know what those  words mean? "Inside Gorbachev's USSR" with Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent  Hedrick Smith is a four-part PBS series that provides viewers with a complete,  intimate and factual portrait of the world events that are shaking the Soviet  system to its foundations. The opener, "The Taste of Democracy," illustrates  the exhilaration of reform and renewal as Gorbachev and his generation try to  exorcise the ghosts of Stalin and Brezhnev.  </P> <P> "Inside Gorbachev's USSRS Monday 9-10 p.m. KCET  </P> <P> A BROADWAY EXTRAVAGANZA  </P> <P> Latino communities throughout Southern California gather on Broadway in  downtown Los Angeles Sunday to celebrate the country's largest Cinco de Mayo  fiesta. "La Fiesta Broadway," stretching 10 city blocks, transforms the streets  into a family festival. KMEX plans to broadcast live fiesta segments throughout  the day, featuring Latin stars such as Luis Enrique, Laureano Brizuela, Angela  Carrasco and Beatriz Adriana. KMEX will also broadcast taped performances from  the fiesta in a national three-hour special Thursday at 8 p.m., and a local  one-hour special Saturday, Cinco de Mayo, at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> "La Fiesta Broadway" Sunday 12-8 p.m. KMEX  </P> <P> OPRAH: THE SERIES  </P> <P> You've seen the movie (RThe Color Purple"). You've seen the talk show. You've  seen the miniseries. Get ready for Oprah: The Series. "Brewster Place" is Oprah  Winfrey's dramatic series, based on last season's highest-rated miniseries,  "The Women of Brewster Place." The show is set in an inner-city black  neighborhood in 1967, where Winfrey plays the strong and spirited figurehead of  her community. The series previews Tuesday behind another heavy-hitter,  "Roseanne," with a new episode next Tuesday, before settling into its regular  time slot Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P> "Brewster Place" Tuesday 9:30-10 p.m. ABC  </P> <P> VICTOR OR VICTIM?  </P> <P> For five years, Charles Keating Jr. thwarted government and regulatory  interventions to prevent his troubled Lincoln Savings from sinking $2.5 billion  into the hole. Keating, a central figure in the national savings and loan  scandal, contends he has been victimized by power-hungry agencies and  government officials with a personal vendetta. In "Other People's Money," on  "Frontline," Judy Woodruff paints a portrait of Keating and his financial  empire, and explores the savings and loan financial disaster, which will cost  U.S. taxpayers an estimated $315 billion.  </P> <P> "Frontline" Tuesday 9-10 p.m. on KCET Tuesday 10-11 p.m. on KOCE  </P> <P> CROSSING THE ARTISTIC DIVIDE  </P> <P> Nigeria is a country that, according to producer Carroll Parrott Blue, was  "never meant to be." The area was a vast region of peoples and cultures, until  Great Britain drew a line around the land and unified it as a country. In  "Nigerian Art- Kindred Spirits," Blue profiles Nigerian artists who are trying  to maintain their cultural distinctions while forging a national voice. The  "Smithsonian World" documentary on PBS is hosted by Ruby Dee.  </P> <P> "Nigerian Art-Kindred Spirits" Wednesday 8-9 p.m. KCET  </P> <P> THE WORLD'S A STAGE  </P> <P> "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue," a sort of weekly "Entertainment Tonight" with  a global flair, debuts Friday, hosted by former NBC News correspondent Eric  Burns. The weekly news show on the A&amp;E cable network is, by its own  admission, for discriminating palates. It's aimed at sophisticated audiences  who want more than Hollywood gossip. The hour-long show spotlights  entertainment news from around the world. Segments include news updates and  stories on performers, artists, new trends and lasting traditions in the realms  of movies, TV, theater, dance, art, literature and pop culture.  </P> <P> "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" Friday 5-6 p.m. and 9-10 p.m. A&amp;E  </P> <P> BLOND AMBITION  </P> <P> Beware of flying sparks from your TV set-it's Madonna weekend on MTV.

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The emergence of right-wing nationalism  in the recent Russian elections was the main concern expressed  by Milos Zeman, head of the Czech Social Democratic Party, in an  interview published after a recent conference of social  democratic parties. Zeman, in his 20 December interview in the  right-of-center Prague daily CESKY DENIK, said that the  social-democratic parties of Central Europe must develop a  strategy to counter the danger presented by the emergence of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to political power in Russia because "Mr.  Zhirinovskiy belongs to the extreme Right, the extreme Right is  extremely nationalistic, and this nationalism, combined with  expansionist ambitions, presents a clear threat to the region of  Central Europe." The conference, which took place in Bratislava  on 18-19 December, was the first meeting of the seven social  democratic parties of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and  Poland.    Asked by CESKY DENIK reporter Petruska Sustrova whether it  did not bother him that "at least two of your partners are  parties directly descended from communist parties," Zeman said  he had to respect the results of elections and pointed out that  the parties in question enjoyed rather high voter support. In  fact, he said, "One of them, in Poland, was so high that it won  the elections."    Zeman said that the Bratislava meeting was also attended by  representatives of the German, Swedish, and Austrian social  democratic parties, and that the formulation of strategy by the  Central European parties "must naturally be conducted in close  coordination with the West European social democrats."    Voicing the hope that the social democrats would win the  coming West German elections, Zeman revealed that "we are  holding a two-day get-together with SPD [Social Democratic Party  of Germany] Chairman [Rudolf] Sharping in March." He expressed  the hope that cooperation among the region's social democrats  "could lead to a social democratic Central Europe in a few  years." As an example of socialist resurgence, Zeman noted that  the Hungarian Socialist Party has taken the lead in the latest  public opinion polls, with elections scheduled for next May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has warned Finland  against joining NATO. According to Zhirinovskiy, membership of  NATO would turn Finland into an enemy of Russia. Zhirinovskiy  will arrive in Finland tomorrow together with a delegation from  the Russian parliament. Correspondent Martti Hosia met him in  Moscow.    [Hosia] Absolutely not -- This was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  reply when asked to give his view of Finland joining the  European Union [EU] and in time, possibly NATO. He completely  left aside EU membership, but was more than eager to seize on  NATO. Keep away from NATO and all military alliances which are  directed against Russia, otherwise you will turn into enemies of  Russia and cannon fodder. German and Russian tank divisions  will be fighting on your territory, Zhirinovskiy depicted the  scene in his customary style.    His party's deputy chairman, Ahmed Khalitov, for his part,  complained that there is a lot of anti-Russian feeling in  Finland at present. Weapons are being acquired and hostile  propaganda is on the rise. The stick has two ends, Khalitov  warned.    Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democrat party comrades are  known for their tough talking. Zhirinovskiy is an opposition  leader and he does not need to be diplomatic in his choice of  words. However, Zhirinovskiy does have close links with  conservative officers in the army; the words have the same tone.  NATO is still a red rag to the conservative officers here. For  instance, a retired general who addressed a meeting of Slav  nations in Moscow today, organized by Zhirinovskiy, was  seriously of the view that the West's and NATO's peacekeeping  activities in former Yugoslavia are only a dress rehearsal for  an occupation of Russia.    Against this background, it is understandable that NATO's  Partnership for Peace project has also aroused severe  condemnation here. Moscow does not like the fact that NATO  first approached the East European and Baltic countries as well  as Sweden and Finland. Russia was left last. In Moscow's view,  the marching order should have been precisely the opposite.    In Russia's official foreign political leadership, NATO's  Partnership for Peace has caused chaos. In the opinion of  President Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov, it may take  more than six months to reach agreement on Partnership for  Peace, while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is talking about  one month. As leader of the opposition, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  is happy to spit into this NATO soup boiling in Moscow by  warning Finland of the dangers of NATO and western leanings in  general.</p>

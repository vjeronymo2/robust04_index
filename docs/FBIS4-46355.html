			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ecuadoran "Red Sun"  armed movement announced today that it reached a "peace  agreement" with the Ecuadoran Government, which will permit it  to surrender its weapons and quit subversive activities.    Ramiro Celi Garces, foremost leader of the subversive group,  admitted at the National Defense Ministry the movement's  "military defeat" and announced it will join the peaceful  democratic struggle. He recognized the mistake of acting with  weapons when violence is not favorable "at this historic moment"  and he denied the group had engaged in terrorism or kidnappings.    Celi Garces said the struggle of the "Red Sun" was directed  at ending the injustices of "a totally atomized society" and the  misfortunes of people subject to an unconscientious government.    Our organization "has deemed it necessary to stop using  weapons as an alternative" and "to proclaim our will to secure a  peace agreement," he stated.    The proposal by the Red Sun and Inti Puka [red sun in  Quechua] is based on commitments that establish eliminating the  organization, quitting clandestine activities, surrendering  weapons to the Army, and rejoining the country's democratic  activities.    In exchange the group asks the government "as a  demonstration  of its will to achieve peace to redefine its social and economic  policies in order to improve the living conditions of the  people."    Inti Puka also requests the government to release of one of  its leaders and the to end all police and military control of  the demobilized militants of the "Red Sun Communist Party," as  Celi Garces calls it.    Defense Minister Jose Gallardo expressed his satisfaction  with the decision of the group, which has been linked to the  Peruvian Shining Path because of its actions and slogans,  although no connection has ever been proven.    Gallardo said the Red Sun's decision to adopt the path of  peace represents a victory for peace-loving Ecuadorans.    The group had been active in Ecuador for three years and had  been blamed for several dynamite attacks against public offices  which only caused material damages, including damage to an  electricity tower of the Papallactal potable water plant last  May.    Leaders Celi Garces and Patricio Alban Sanchez, representing  the demobilized members whose number is not known, surrendered  their weapons to Gallardo at the Defense Ministry.  Sophisticated weapons were exhibited at a sumptuous ceremony.    The ceremony was attended by the military high command,  members of the cabinet, representatives of human rights, and  relatives of those laying down their weapons.    Political analysts noted that the surrender of weapons has  been the result of intense investigations and Armed Forces  surveillance of the movement's activities.    A 19-year-old student, who was captured in August 1993 for  being a member of the Red Sun, denied that the group has any  connection with any Ecuadoran political party, as local media  have reported.    The last subversive group recognized in Ecuador was the  so-called "Alfaro Lives, Dammit" which in 1990 dissolved itself  upon signing a peace accord with the Social Democratic  government of Rodrigo Borja (1988-92).</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Retail deposits to societies increase sharply April is the kindest month for building society retail deposits, according to the monthly savings figures produced by the Building Societies Association. The net retail funds received by societies in April last year came to more than the net inflow for the previous three months put together, while last month's figures represented the first net inflow since October. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said that the turnaround in April's figures released yesterday to a net inflow of Pounds 385m showed that the outflows in previous months had been caused by a series of special factors. These factors included the pre-payment of fuel bills to avoid the imposition of value added tax, and the success of the pensioners' guaranteed income bond which was launched in January. He acknowledged, however, that because of the seasonal nature of the figures, there could still be some net outflows in the coming months. However, he added that he did not expect them to be on the near-record scale of the outflows of Pounds 653m and Pounds 404m in March and February respectively. Societies expect the improvements in the public finances to be reflected in less competition from National Savings products, and believe that the popularity of unit trusts will also fall away somewhat over the year. Mr Geoffrey Lister, association chairman, predicted earlier this week that more funding for societies would come from retail savings in the coming months, in contrast to societies' decision in the first quarter of this year to fund their mortgage lending more cheaply through wholesale funds. Mr Coles said yesterday that the inflow of savings, taken together with the Pounds 376m interest credited to accounts, was closer to the rise in societies' mortgage lending than it had been in March. This was reflected in the smaller amounts of wholesale funding raised, he added.</p>

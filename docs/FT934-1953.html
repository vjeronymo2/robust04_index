			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Raid on Paribas Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland have raided the London ranks at Paribas, the French bank, as part of their efforts to boost their presence in the buoyant fixed-income market. Stephen West, who has run the Eurobond syndicate desk at Paribas for the past seven years, has joined SBC where he will be co-head of the fixed-income syndicate desk with Jonathan Vellacott. The 34-year-old's appointment is part of SBC's ambition to re-establish itself in the primary side of the ever-expanding Eurobond market, where the volume of new issues has jumped to nearly Dollars 400bn this year from Dollars 269bn last year. In the early 1980s SBC was among the top 10 Eurobond underwriting houses but it has slipped to around 15th position as a result of its decision to give a higher priority to developing its derivatives business. Meanwhile, four prominent members of Paribas's emerging markets team have defected to UBS. They include Tom Priday, head of new issues and syndication, Paul Crean, head of sales, Nick Blakey, trading, and Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, research. UBS has also appointed John Giannotti to its debt and treasury division as head of origination in Europe; he joins from Bankers Trust International.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prior to leaving Brussels, the head of  government, Mokdad Sifi, confirmed that he has received firm  assurances that Algeria would get a European loan of 200 million  ECUs before the end of the year.    In a news conference before leaving Brussels for Paris,  Mokdad Sifi said that he had sensed a firm determination in the  European capital, Brussels, to support Algeria in its ongoing  economic and political reforms.    Mokdad Sifi had a meeting today with President of the  European Commission Jacques Delors, after his meeting with his  Belgian counterpart, Jean-Luc Dehaene, and the Belgian foreign  minister, Willy Claes, who had assured him that the Algerian  issue would be discussed at the European summit in Corfu in a  few days.

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR OF REPORT CRITICIZING SDG&amp;E MERGER LEAVES PUC  </P> <P> Terry L. Murray, who recently directed a Public Utilities Commission staff  report that criticized San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with  Southern California Edison, is leaving the state agency to join an  Oakland-based consulting firm, PUC officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Morse, Richard, Weisenmiller &amp; Associates, the firm that Murray will join,  is under contract to the city of San Diego, which is opposing the merger.  </P> <P> At the PUC, Murray served as director of the Division of Ratepayer Advocates.  The city of San Diego strongly supported the division's recent report, which  suggests that the merger would not prove beneficial to customers of either  utility.  </P> <P> Officials at SGD&amp;E and Edison on Friday declined to comment on Murray's  departure. In a prepared release, PUC Executive Director Neal Shulman said  Murray was making the move to be "closer to where she lives in order to handle  an unexpected family health emergency."  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Yeltsin and Major review peacekeeping Mr John Major and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday reviewed a range of peace-keeping operations, with emphasis on Bosnia. Russia has aligned with the UK and other European countries in trying to dissuade the US from seeking to lift the UN arms embargo and increase the flow of arms to the Bosnian Moslems. They also discussed next month's state visit by the Queen to Russia. On the final day of his visit Mr Yeltsin described it as a weekend of 'useful and enjoyable' talks at Chequers, the prime minister's country retreat. Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, held more detailed but equally informal talks with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who will accompany the president on his visit to the UN today. The UN visit will be followed by a two-day summit in Washington with President Bill Clinton. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will meet Mr Alexander Shokin, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of international economic affairs, in London today. They will discuss prospects for trade and investment in the oil industry and other areas. Mr Major, speaking at Brize Norton military airport before Mr Yeltsin's departure yesterday, praised the 'restraint and courage' shown by the Russian leadership in recent months. Mr Yeltsin replied that Russian peace-keeping efforts, often regarded with suspicion in the west, were aimed at 'extinguishing fires and inter-ethnic strife.' Mr Yeltsin said that he was 'somewhat surprised' that western countries had not come forward to participate in peace-keeping operations in areas such as Moldova, Ossetia or Nagorno Karabakh, where Russia was mediating between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Bosnia and Russian peacekeeping operations in the former soviet states of the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected to loom large in this week's summit meeting with President Clinton. But both sides will lay stress on ways of reducing trade barriers and encouraging private investment, especially in areas of weakness, such as telecommunications, agriculture and energy. President Yeltsin will stress that Russian foreign policy is guided by national interest, not ideology, when he makes his maiden speech at the UN today.</p>

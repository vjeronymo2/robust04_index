			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Poland moves ahead on sale of domestic bank THE POLISH government is to press ahead with the sale of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), the first privatisation of a leading domestic bank. WBK is one of the nine banks created in 1989 out of the commercial operations of NBP, the central bank. The sale is being handled by Schroders of the UK. Mr Slawomir Sikora, the official at the Finance Ministry responsible for the operation, says he expected it to be completed by the summer of 1993. WBK was originally identified for privatisation by the government. Mr Sikora said: 'It is the government's intention to sell all nine banks in three or four years' time.' The Allied Irish Bank is providing management advice to the WBK under a three-year contract.</p>

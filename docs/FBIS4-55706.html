			<p>BFN     [Text] News just in from the Croatian Assembly. Branimir  Bilic has a report:    [Bilic] Dear viewers, good evening again. The Croatian  Democratic Union [HDZ] and opposition parties are currently  giving a news conference in the Croatian Assembly. A short  while ago a final agreement was signed between the ruling and  opposition parties. The result of the agreement is the  following:    The posts of the speakers of the Chamber of Representatives  and the House of Counties will go to the ruling HDZ; the current  speakers of the two chambers, Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic,  have placed their posts at the disposal of the Croatian Assembly  in line with this agreement.    In the Chamber of Representatives, two posts of deputy  speaker will go to the parliamentary opposition parties, two to  the deputies of the Croatian Democratic Union, and one to a  deputy from ethnic communities or national minorities.    In the House of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, one post  of deputy speaker will be occupied by the HDZ, while two posts  of deputy speaker will go to parliamentary opposition parties.  Posts of the first deputy speaker in both chambers will go to  deputies of parliamentary opposition parties.    The number of parliamentary committees will also increase to  reflect the newly-created situation between the number of  deputies and individual parties in the chambers. This means  that there will be a reshuffle of committee chairmen and their  deputies and as a result the number of chairman positions to be  occupied by the HDZ and the parliamentary opposition parties  will be in proportion to the number of their deputies in the  Croatian Parliament.    If a committee is chaired by a deputy from the HDZ, its  deputy chairman will be from the parliamentary opposition and  vice-versa. In the committees where the chairman comes from the  ranks of the HDZ, the HDZ will have the majority -- in  proportion to the number of deputies in the parliament. The  committees where the chairman is from the parliamentary  opposition will have the same number of HDZ and opposition  deputies. The status of the ethnic community and national  minorities is not subject to proportional representation. These  elections will take place at the next session of the  parliamentary chambers.    New procedure books for the Chamber of Representatives and  the House of Counties will be drawn up. Draft procedure books  will be formulated by a working group to be set up on a parity  basis and in accordance with the procedure books used by  European countries with a highly-developed level of democracy.  The working group will also be appointed at the next session of  the parliament. The deadline for drawing up both procedure  books is 90 days from the day the agreement was reached.    According to the agreement, the House of Counties will  resume  work on Monday, 23 May 1994, and the Chamber of Representatives  on Tuesday, 24 May 1994, with the election of the presidents of  the chambers and their deputies on the agenda.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ambyo Mangunwijaya, president director of the  state-run Bukit Asam Coal Mining Company, said Indonesia, with  coal export figures of 20 million tons in 1993, has become the  world's third largest coal exporter.    He said that the constant boosting of production would also  increase Indonesia's coal exports, which may reach 40 million  tons by the end of the current Sixth Five-year Development Plan  (Pelita VI) in 1999.    According to Ambyo Mangunwijaya, by the conclusion of Pelita  VI, Indonesia's coal output is projected to increase to 71  million tons per year, of which 31 million tons are for domestic  consumption and 40 million tons for export.    To boost production, the Bukit Asam Coal Mining Company has  entered into cooperation with a number of mining contractors,  both local and foreign.</p>

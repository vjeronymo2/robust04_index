			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORIOLES LOSE MORE GROUND IN DEFEAT BY TWINS  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles' longest losing streak this season reached eight games  Thursday night when Kent Hrbek drove in three runs and led the Minnesota Twins  to a 10-6 victory at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The Orioles' Americsn League East lead was narrowed to four games over Toronto  and Cleveland, their smallest margin since June 17. Baltimore has lost the  first seven of a 14-game trip.  </P> <P> Baltimore begins a three-game series in Kansas City tonight.  </P> <P> Hrbek, who hit two home runs in the Twins' 5-4 victory Wednesday night, hit a  two-run double in the first inning and had a RBI grounder in the third to make  it 4-0.  </P> <P> Roy Smith (6-4) did not give up a run although he faced a bases-loaded, no-out  threat in the first inning. He yielded seven hits, including Craig  Worthington's two-run home run in the seventh, in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Twins chased Pete Harnish with four runs in the sixth. Kirby Puckett got  his third hit of the game, a two-run single, and Brian Harper had an RBI  single. Gary Gaetti drew a bases-loaded walk from reliever Mark Thurmond for an  8-0 lead.  </P> <P> Boston 7, Kansas City 2 -- Kevin Romine had a double and hit his first homer of  the season as the Red Sox ended Royal Tom Gordon's seven-game winning streak at  Boston.  </P> <P> Gordon (11-4) gave up five runs on eight hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings.  It was his first loss since May 28.  </P> <P> John Dopson (9-5), who allowed three hits and seven walks in five-plus innings,  was the winner.  </P> <P> With a 4-0 lead, Dopson walked three consecutive batters at the start of the  sixth and was replaced by Rob Murphy.  </P> <P> Murphy struck out two, but Willie Wilson hit a two-run double before Kevin  Seitzer grounded out to end the inning.  </P> <P> The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first on two walks and singles by Danny Heep  and Nick Esasky.  </P> <P> Romine led off the third with a double and scored when Matt Winters bobbled  Mike Greenwell's single. The hit extended Greenwell's hitting streak to 11  games.  </P> <P> "Batting third and hitting a home run was the furthest thing from my mind a few  weeks ago," Romine said. "I was just hoping I'd get called up again."  </P> <P> Milwaukee 11, Detroit 1 -- Rob Deer's fourth career grand slam capped a six-run  sixth inning as the Brewers won at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Robin Yount had two singles, extending his hitting streak to 17 games and  matching a streak by New York's Don Mattingly as the longest this season in the  AL. Ozzie Guillen of Chicago equaled it Thursday night against the Angels.  </P> <P> Charles Hudson, the second Detroit pitcher, gave up eight hits and eight runs  in three innings.

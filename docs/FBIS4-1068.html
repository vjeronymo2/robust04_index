			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Multiparty  Negotiating Council sitting at the World Trade Centre on  Wednesday [20 April] unanimously accepted constitutional  amendments enabling the Inkatha Freedom Party's participation in  next week's election.    The amendment will be forwarded to Parliament for inclusion  in the interim constitution. Parliament will also consider an  amendment to the 13th constitutional principle on the position  of the Zulu king.    The amendment was accepted together with a resolution  committing all the parties to accepting the election results.    The amendment came about as a result of an agreement on  Tuesday between President F W de Klerk, IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela.    It reads: "A provincial constitution may, where applicable,  provide for the institution, role, authority and status of a  traditional monarch in the province, and shall make such  provision for the Zulu monarch in the case of the Province of  Natal/kwaZulu".    The resolution on the elections committed all the parties to  "free and fair elections and to doing everything to put a stop  to the violence in our country".    "We will accept the results of the elections and will abide  by the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission in  respect of the fairness and freeness of the elections. We will  not resort to violence under any circumstances in order to  pursue political objectives," the resolution said.    Earlier both Mr Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development  Minister Roelf Meyer alleged that the IFP had settled for a lot  less than was originally offered with regard to the Zulu king.    Mr Meyer said it was clear that the IFP had hoped to  postpone  the elections by its tactics.    IFP negotiator Walter Felgate said the IFP had acted not in  its own narrow interests but in the interests of the entire  country.</p>

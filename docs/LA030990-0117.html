			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> RYAN IN WINGS AS SAVINGS &amp; LOAN CZAR  </P> <P> T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a Washington lawyer and former key Labor Department  official, will be nominated as the nation's top savings and loan regulator,  according to Bush Administration sources.  </P> <P> Ryan would become permanent director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which  oversees the S&amp;L industry beleaguered by the financial collapse of hundreds  of insolvent institutions.  </P> <P> "The agency needs strong leadership," said an Administration source. Although  Ryan has no direct experience with S&amp;L regulation, he worked as solicitor  of the Labor Department in the Reagan Administration from 1981 through 1983,  handling litigation and important issues of regulatory policy and enforcement.  </P> <P> Ryan "is a seasoned government veteran, tough and aggressive," an  Administration source said. "We looked at a lot of different people for this  job, and we feel he will provide important leadership and management skills."  The Office of Thrift Supervision is "an agency that needs a change in direction  after a rough period," according to the source.  </P> <P> Ryan would be the permanent replacement for the controversial M. Danny Wall,  who has resigned as the top thrift regulator. Wall came under considerable  criticism from Congress for his management of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,  the old regulatory agency for S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> He was accused of providing overly optimistic estimates of the severity of the  S&amp;L crisis. Wall was repeatedly attacked by members of Congress in  connection with his delay in closing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the  Irvine institution that has become a politically damaging symbol of the entire  S&amp;L debacle.  </P> <P> The shutdown of Lincoln may ultimately cost the government $2 billion. And the  political contributions by Lincoln's former owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., have  caused intense embarrassment for five senators. The Federal Home Loan Bank  Board was abolished by last year's savings and loan rescue legislation, which  provided $50 billion for the shutdown of crippled S&amp;Ls and payments to  depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Ryan has solid connections with the White House, having directed a team of  lawyers that helped the Bush campaign navigate the complexities of state rules  and laws on delegates on the way to the presidential nomination in 1988. He  worked as an advance man in President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 reelection  campaign, served as general counsel in President Gerald R. Ford's losing bid  for election in 1976, and joined (former Sen.) Howard H. Baker Jr.'s brief  effort to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1980.  </P> <P> Ryan, 44, is currently a partner with the law firm of Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp;  McClay. The FBI will be undertaking a background check required of high-level  nominees before his name is formally submitted to the Senate for confirmation.  </P> <P> After passage of the S&amp;L legislation last year, the bank board's powers  were trimmed, it was renamed the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed in the  Treasury Department. However, the office still has the authority to set  financial standards for S&amp;Ls and implement the complex provisions of  S&amp;L law. Its rulings can mean fiscal life or death for hundreds of  financially troubled institutions.  </P> <P> The Office of Thrift Supervision is being run temporarily by Salvatore R.  Martouche, assistant secretary of the Treasury for enforcement. Martouche has  been responsible for the Secret Service, the Customs Service and government  activities aimed at money-laundering from illegal activities.  </P> <P> Martouche will hold the post until Ryan is confirmed by the Senate, according  to Administration sources.

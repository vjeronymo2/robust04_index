			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House holders loyal INSTITUTIONAL shareholders at Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group, under siege from Hongkong Land, yesterday indicated they were unlikely to sell any more shares. Hongkong Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and development companies, has acquired 14.99 per cent of Trafalgar and is tendering for another 15 per cent. It has until the end of next week to try and increase its stake to 29.9 per cent. Six of Trafalgar's 10 biggest shareholders, which sold between 5 and 15 per cent of their stock on Thursday, said they were unlikely to sell any more shares. One institutional shareholder said: 'Since Hongkong Land has set a floor of 85p - the price at which they bought the ordinary shares - there is little incentive for us to sell any more.' Some shareholders are also hoping that another company may be tempted to make a full bid for the group. However, any hopes that this could come from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, were dashed yesterday by Lord Hanson. 'Trafalgar is much more something for Hongkong Land on a long-term basis than it would be for Hanson.' Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, is also a non-executive director of Hanson. Trafalgar is preparing to send a circular to its shareholders on Tuesday telling them that net borrowings for the financial year ended September 30 are less than Pounds 400m. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said: 'Hongkong Land's tender offer is an attempt to gain effective control of all our assets for an investment of some Pounds 175m. We are determined to try and stop them buying any more of our shares.' Trafalgar has also asked its financial advisers, Kleinwort Benson, to seek buyers for its hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford.</p>

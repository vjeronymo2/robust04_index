			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- A government advisory tax  panel will continue its discussions as Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa requested to compile detailed proposals on tax reform,  a forum chief said Friday [8 April].    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, made the remarks  at  a news conference after a panel meeting held amid news that  Hosokawa announced his intention to resign.    The news indeed came as a surprise for the advisory body to  the prime minister that kicked off discussions with newly  appointed panel members after Hosokawa himself requested at the  onset to compile detailed proposals on a tax reform.    His request featured a net tax increase to cope with the  coming aged society.    "There will be no effect on our discussions," Kato said,  noting a tax reform as requested by Hosokawa is a promise both  domestically and internationally to materialize by the end of  the year.    He added any new cabinet will come up with the same  direction  as Hosokawa to deal with the coming aged society.    The greatest missions are to limit the net tax increase as  much as possible and to promote publicity to win public support,  Kato said.    The panel will compile a report in June with "various  options" for politicians to decide, he said, suggesting the  report will include specific figures on the scale of the tax cut  and hikes.    The timing is in line with the ruling coalition parties'  agreement to decide on the tax reform before the current Diet  session ends June 29 and also with Japan's promises in the March  market-opening package to offer details in June before the  summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy in July.    Addressing the resumed meeting, Hosokawa asked the panel to  discuss and present recommendations "in the early stage to  detail a desirable tax system for creating a stable, balanced  tax system on income, consumption and assets," as proposed by  the panel in November in its medium-term report on tax reform.    The November report called for such a balanced tax system to  cope with the coming aging of society in the 21th century.    But Hosokawa said an "increase in public tax burden is  unavoidable" to attain an affluent society amid the aged  population while creating a sound fiscal position without  amassing national debt balance even if thorough administrative  reform and expenditure streamlining are taken.    In specifying tax reform, Hosokawa reminded panel members  that the government and the ruling coalition parties vowed to  bring about full-scale tax reform by the end of the year, when  they decided in February to conduct 6 trillion yen income tax  cuts limited to fiscal 1994.    He also said legislators attached a provision to include a  permanent income tax in the year-end reform when they passed the  single-year bills in March.</p>

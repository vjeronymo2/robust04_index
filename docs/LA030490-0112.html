			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT SHOOK -- FROM TOKYO TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> QUAKES:THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET TUMBLED DOWN AND AN ALREADY SHAKY LOS ANGELES  LANDSCAPE MAY SOON FEEL THE AFTERSHOCKS.  </P> <P> It wasn't the Big One everybody feared, but last week's quake sent pulses  racing for a while; it seemed as if nothing was stable and the rumbling seemed  to go on forever.  </P> <P> But it wasn't the California earthquake that left a crowd of investors feeling  breathless and pale; it was the financial shock in Tokyo, where stock prices  fell farther and faster than at any time since the Crash of '87.  </P> <P> After stabilizing briefly early in the week, the Nikkei Index headed south  again on Thursday, losing more than 2% of its value, and the shock to investor  confidence will not go away. The Japanese, like the Americans, now understand  that stock prices can go down as well as up.  </P> <P> The Tokyo crash won't be good for U.S.-Japan relations. Tokyo market observers  blamed futures markets and program trading for the new volatility in the  market; American pressure forced these razzle-dazzle options on the  conservative Japanese financial Establishment, and foreign security firms still  dominate trading in the new instruments. This spells trouble; American  negotiators have a long list of more "market-opening" measures in a  never-ending quest to export our own increasingly rickety financial system to  the farthest corners of the Earth.  </P> <P> The Tokyo stock market, where stocks routinely trade at price levels many times  higher than those of equivalent U.S. or European securities can command, has  long been due for a correction. Insider trading and conspiracies to raise the  price of favorite stocks are rampant in a country where stock tips serve as  political payoffs. Foreign observers have been predicting a major correction  for years, and the selloff could have been much worse. By Wall Street  standards, the double-digit drop in the Japanese stock market was a relatively  mild and orderly affair.  </P> <P> There had been some fears that a sharp drop in Tokyo would set off a global  explosion like the October, 1987, stock blow-off. Indeed, the most favored  apocalyptic scenarios of today usually start with the Japanese market. But the  Tokyo market crashed and the world didn't come to an end. In fact, parts of the  world hardly noticed. European investors are hypnotized by the historic events  in the Warsaw Pact countries and don't much care about events in far-off  Oriental bazaars. Wall Street shrugged off Tokyo, in part because nervous  Japanese moved this way, getting out of their own market. Worried about a  sudden weakness in the yen, they put their money into U.S. stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> The world may not have come to an end but Tokyo troubles will still have an  impact on our side of the Pacific. The Tokyo market fell because the Bank of  Japan thinks Japan's stock and real-estate markets are dangerously inflated.  Since September, interest rates in Tokyo have been climbing steeply; rates on  90-day certificates of deposit are 50% higher than they were last year, and  long-term rates are higher than they have been in five years.  </P> <P> These rates make Japanese stocks and property less attractive to investors, but  the effects don't stop there. With super-safe 10-year Japanese government bonds  offering more than 7% interest, a better rate than many American real-estate  investments can show, canny Tokyo investors may lose their appetite for  American property. If that should happen, then real-estate markets across the  United States are headed for trouble, and the Southern California market has  more to lose than most.  </P> <P> Five years ago, Southern California was one of a number of booming real-estate  markets, but one by one the other markets have stagnated or gone downhill. In  states like Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts and Arizona, only the most inept  speculators could manage to lose money in real estate. Now all those markets  are filled with unsalable buildings; homeowners and commercial developers are  watching their equity erode; the landscape is littered with untenanted office  buildings alongside savings-and-loans brought low by optimistic lending.  </P> <P> But in California, thanks largely to continuing Japanese interest, prices kept  rising and now stand at levels substantially above those in other parts of the  country. It seems unlikely that those inflated differentials can last. With  both office space and housing significantly more affordable in depressed  markets like Texas and Arizona, more firms are taking a second look at plans to  relocate or expand in expensive California.  </P> <P> California and Japan have more in common than a propensity for earthquakes.  Both were beneficiaries of the great bull market of the 1980s. There was a  tremendous explosion of asset values in the more fortunate parts of the world  over the last decade. At the height of the '80s, bull markets were common. The  art market, junk bonds, commercial real estate -- all soared. It was hard to  lose money in the halcyon days of the boom.  </P> <P> But with the waning of the '80s, those markets have begun to weaken; now there  are fewer pastures of plenty where the bulls roam in peace. Among the world's  stock markets, Tokyo was the last important stomping ground for the  once-rampant bulls; now bears have been spotted even there.  </P> <P> That leaves California real estate as one of the world's last "sure-thing"  markets, and there are ominous signs that a new California earthquake -- of  land values, if not of the land itself -- could bring the good times to a quick  close. Wall Street is less than bullish about the great bear state;  California's bank stocks are down on fears of a real-estate shakeout, and  analysts shake their heads over the short-term prospects of California  commercial property.  </P> <P> More than the movies, more than defense, real estate is the industry that built  Southern California and it continues to be the foundation for prosperity. In  the '80s, real estate grew addicted to foreign capital and now faces the  prospect of temporary withdrawal.  </P> <P> With the defense industries looking at budget cuts, and the financial system  still reeling from the aftereffects of the junk bond market collapse, Southern  California may be facing one of its greatest historic tests.  </P> <P> Those who have worried that the Japanese wanted to buy up America may now have  to cope with a new and much more worrying prospect: that the Japanese might  want to sell it back.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Turmoil alters Japan's view THE turmoil in Europe's foreign exchange markets last week, combined with uncertainty about European political union, could have a lasting impact on Japanese perceptions of the EC. Japanese financiers, industrialists and policymakers have two main concerns. The first is that the US dollar will soon be sucked into the turmoil. That would drag in the yen. A depreciation of the dollar could put Japan on the spot. The Bank of Japan has set itself against further interest rate cuts unless they are needed to stimulate the domestic economy. However, with the dollar falling, Japan could come under pressure to cut interest rates to help stabilise the US currency, according to Mr Yukio Yanbe, the DKB Research Institute's chief economist. He said: 'If the dollar weakens a wider adjustment will be necessary to prevent the dollar falling too far. Some Japanese monetary easing probably will be necessary if the French vote against Maastricht.' The second concern is about the shadow cast over prospects for European integration. The last week could have marked a big shift in Japan's uncertain attitude towards the EC. The Japanese are torn about European integration. They are impressed by the ambition of the project and attracted by the commercial opportunities. Yet they also regard it with suspicion, as an economic fortress in the making. They distrust the grander political ambitions for a unified Europe which could foster protectionism and bureaucracy. The last week is likely to have made the Japanese both more cautious and yet more confident in their approach to the EC. The Japanese would be most alarmed by any signs of fragmentation within the EC as this could undermine the rationale for much of the costly manufacturing investment Japanese manufacturers have made in Europe to take advantage of the single market. A two speed Europe, still committed to a form of integration, would be less worrying. In the long run Japanese policymakers would probably welcome a slowing of the pace towards political and social integration in Europe. Indeed in some quarters there is a thinly disguised air of satisfaction over the troubles besetting the treaty. As the Asahi Shimbun put it in an editorial last week: 'The treaty was a product of convoluted compromises for patching things up, hastily cobbled together by leaders of the EC. The concern at the grass roots is the price to be paid for such a jerry-built treaty.'</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Lib Dems branded 'scavengers' Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday branded the Liberal Democrats the 'scavengers of British politics', as spokesmen from both main parties voiced scepticism about doing deals with Mr Ashdown's party, David Owen writes. He said the party followed 'an extreme rightwing, pretty nasty agenda' in some parts of the country while Dame Angela Rumbold, Tory deputy chairman, said the Liberal Democrats represented 'the left wing of the country's voting population.' Later, the Conservatives were quick to attack the pledge by Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat tax spokesman, in effect to ditch proposals for a top tax rate of 60 per cent on incomes of more than Pounds 100,000. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, paymaster general, accused Mr Bruce of a U-turn 'rapid even by Liberal Democrat standards'.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress surges to Pounds 3m Asset disposals and Britain's growing appetite for fast food fuelled a surge in profits at PizzaExpress, the restaurant group which came to the market last year. Pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 were Pounds 3.1m on turnover of Pounds 13.6m. The comparable profits of Pounds 55,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.8m related solely to trading by Star Computer, the group's reverse takeover vehicle. Mr Glen Tomlinson, finance director, said profits at PizzaExpress had been boosted by Pounds 1.14m from the disposal of the computer business last autumn. After accounting for an interim operating loss of Pounds 285,000, funds received were Pounds 858,000. Mr Tomlinson added that profits of Pounds 2.1m on continuing catering operations represented a significant improvement, although no comparable interim figures were available. Turnover in the 32 wholly-owned restaurants increased 17 per cent. Sales by the 39 franchised outlets increased 11 per cent, while turnover by the wholesale division rose 7 per cent. As part of a strategy to increase the number of wholly owned restaurants, the company said it planned to open four new outlets by June this year at a total cost of up to Pounds 1m. Earnings per share came out at 2.9p (0.8p) and it is to pay a second interim dividend of 0.5p. An initial interim of 0.5p was announced last September in lieu of a final payment.</p>

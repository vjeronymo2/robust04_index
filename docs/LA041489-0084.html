			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORMER MCMARTIN DEFENDANT TESTIFIES  </P> <P> A former defendant in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case testified  Thursday that she never saw either of the remaining defendants "touch any child  in the genital area for what appeared to be for purposes of sexual  gratification."  </P> <P> Asked by a defense attorney whether she ever had the slightest suspicion that  molestation might be going on, Babette Spitler replied, "No, I would have  reported it."  </P> <P> Spitler, 41, who has two children who attended McMartin and recently adopted a  third, taught at the Manhattan Beach nursery school on and off from 1973 until  it closed in January, 1984. After her arrest and preliminary hearing, she was  ordered to stand trial on four counts involving two children, but charges  against her were dropped in early 1986.  </P> <P> She said she never saw either Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin  Buckey, who are charged with 65 counts of molestation and conspiracy, take  children off the school grounds except for routine field trips. Nor did she  observe naked games, picture-taking, animal mutilation, or any other  inappropriate activity during her tenure there, she said.  </P> <P> Spitler, who was called as a witness by the defense, told the jury she watched  Ray Buckey dig a grave for a dead turtle but did not know how it met its end.  She will resume testifying on Monday.  </P></p>

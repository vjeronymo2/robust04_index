			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS '89;  </P> <P> PROFILING THE RAMS  </P> <P> OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD  </P> <P> RUNNINGS BACKS  </P> <P> GREG BELL  </P> <P> The workhorse in the backfield last year was a contract holdout through most of  the exhibition season. A five-year pro, Bell rushed for 1,212 yards on 288  carries last season and led the team in touchdowns with 16. Also caught 24  passes for 124 yards. Traded to the Rams from Buffalo in 1987 deal that sent  Eric Dickerson to Indianapolis.  </P> <P> CLEVELAND GARY  </P> <P> When the Rams' made Gary their first-round draft pick last spring, they hoped  the former University of Miami back would beef up their backfield. They're  still hoping. Gary has been a contract holdout.  </P> <P> GASTON GREEN  </P> <P> Started for part of exhibition season while Greg Bell was a contract holdout.  Coming off a disappointing rookie season, where he carried the ball 35 times  for only 117 yards, a 3.3-yard average. Has shown flashes of brilliance this  season, rushing for 63 yards in the first half against Minnesota. Has shown  flashes of mediocrity, fumbling twice in the third quarter against the Vikings.  Became UCLA's all-time leading rusher and was selected in the first round of  the 1988 draft by the Rams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> QUARTERBACKS  </P> <P> JIM EVERETT  </P> <P> The four-year pro emerged as one of the Rams' team leaders last year, passing  for 3,964 yards. He completed 308 of 517 passes (59.6%), threw 31 touchdown  passes and 18 interceptions. Finished sixth in balloting for the Heisman Trophy  during his senior season at Purdue, where he led the nation in total offense.  </P> <P> STEVE DILS  </P> <P> A Band-Aid solution as backup quarterback. Two weeks ago, Dils was living the  peaceful life of retired NFL quarterback, selling commercial real estate in  Atlanta. But after reserve quarterback Mark Herrmann suffered a rib injury, the  Rams called Dils, who they cut loose last season. In his first game back, he  completed his only pass for nine yards in a 24-14 victory over Minnesota.  </P> <P> MARK HERRMANN  </P> <P> Fractured a rib on his left side when he was blindsided by Phoenix safety Tim  McDonald in exhibition game and isn't expected back until the middle of the  month. Entered training camp as No. 2 quarterback behind fellow Purdue graduate  Jim Everett.  </P> <P> ROBERT DELPINO  </P> <P> Suffered a shoulder injury during exhibition season. Battling for starting  position in Rams' muddled backfield. A two-year pro from Missouri, Delpino  started three of 15 games he played in last year, gaining 147 yards on 34  carries.  </P> <P> BUFORD McGEE  </P> <P> Has a reputation as a fierce blocker. The five-year pro from Mississippi had  only 16 carries but gained 117 yards. Started 12 of 16 games he played.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> GUARDS  </P> <P> DUVAL LOVE  </P> <P> The former Fountain Valley High School and UCLA star recently ended a contract  holdout. The five-year pro started all 15 games he played in last year. Started  three years at UCLA and was twice an All-Pac 10 selection.  </P> <P> TOM NEWBERRY  </P> <P> The three-year pro suffered a hamstring injury in off-season, which forced him  to miss part of the preseason. Good speed for a lineman. Runs the 40 in 4.68  seconds. Can bench press 460 pounds and squat 740 pounds. Was taken in the  second round of the 1986 draft out of Wisconsin-LaCrosse, an NAIA school.  </P> <P> WARREN WHEAT  </P> <P> A neck injury has sidelined the eighth-round draft pick from Brigham Young for  part of the exhibition season. At 6-foot-6 and 275 pounds, Wheat brings size  and pass blocking to the Rams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TACKLES  </P> <P> JACKIE SLATER  </P> <P> Begins his 14th season and anchors an experienced offensive line with Doug  Smith (11 seasons) and Irv Pankey (nine years). Was third-round draft choice in  1976 from Jackson State.  </P> <P> ROBERT COX  </P> <P> A reserve, Cox was a contract holdout for most of the exhibition season. At  6-foot-5, 285 pounds, he brings size and versatility to the offensive line. Can  play both tackle and guard. Spent two seasons at UCLA after transferring from  Chabot Junior College.  </P> <P> IRV PANKEY  </P> <P> Entering his 10th season with the Rams. Adds size and savvy to an experienced  Rams' line. Started all 16 games last year. The Rams' biggest lineman at  6-foot-5, 295 pounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WIDE RECEIVERS  </P> <P> WILLIE ANDERSON  </P> <P> With Aaron Cox out with a hamstring injury, Anderson is making a serious run at  the No. 2 receiving spot behind Henry Ellard. Had 14 catches in the exhibition  season, matching his total of all last year. A threat on deep patterns,  Anderson averaged 29 yards a catch last season, the best on the team. Nicknamed  "Flipper," Anderson boasts a 36 1/2-inch vertical jump.  </P> <P> RON BROWN  </P> <P> Gold medalist in 400-meter relay at 1984 Olympics, came out of football  retirement last year to rejoin the Rams. Playing in seven games, he caught two  passes for 16 yards. Greatest contribution could come as a kickoff returner,  however; his four career touchdowns on returns is a Rams record.  </P> <P> AARON COX  </P> <P> Cox, sidelined with a hamstring injury, was battling Willie Anderson for the  No. 2 wide receiver position behind Henry Ellard. Caught 28 passes for 590  yards last year, an average of 21.1 yards a catch, second on the team to  Anderson. Runs the 40 in 4.39 seconds and is considered an excellent route  runner. Earned All-Pacific 10 honors as a senior at Arizona State.  </P> <P> HENRY ELLARD  </P> <P> The seven-year pro is coming off his best season, leading the Rams with 86  catches for 1,414 yards. A big-play threat as both a receiver and punt  returner. Led the NFL in punt returns his first four seasons, but dropped in  the last two seasons. Was a standout receiver at Fresno State, where he also  was a top collegiate triple-jumper.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CENTERS  </P> <P> TONY SLATON  </P> <P> An experienced backup for Doug Smith at center. Entering his sixth year as a  pro. Former USC All-America selection was signed by the Rams in 1984 after  being waived by Buffalo.  </P> <P> DOUG SMITH  </P> <P> During his 11 years in the NFL, Smith has played four positions on the  offensive line: left guard, center, right guard and right tackle. But it's at  center where Smith has excelled, earning five consecutive Pro Bowl berths. One  of the most experienced linemen in the league along with teammate Jackie Slater  (14 seasons).  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIGHT ENDS  </P> <P> PAT CARTER  </P> <P> Acquired in August from Detroit to try and solve depth problem at tight end.  Carter, 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, was seldom used in the Lions' new  run-and-shoot offense. A three-year starter at Florida State, Carter had a  difficult rookie year. He caught only 13 passes for 145 yards after suffering a  back injury while lifting weights before camp.  </P> <P> PETE HOLOHAN  </P> <P> Missed much of the exhibition season with a knee injury, but returned and  caught a three-yard touchdown pass against Minnesota. Tough on third and  short-yardage situations. After Rams acquired him in a draft day trade with San  Diego last year, he caught 59 passes for 656 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> DAMONE JOHNSON  </P> <P> His long, exhibition-season salary holdout, along with Pete Holohan's knee  injury, left Rams without a tight end for part of the preseason. Caught 42  passes for 350 yards last year.

Moved to cornerback after earning  All-America honors twice as a safety at Texas.  </P> <P> LeROY IRVIN  </P> <P> Currently serving a 30-day suspension for violating the league's  substance-abuse policy.

Was cut by the Rams during last year's  camp. Returned a fumble 19 yards to set up a touchdown in 24-14 exhibition  victory over Minnesota. A two-year starter at San Diego State, Brown was one of  the biggest surprises in the 1987 training camp when he signed as a free agent.  </P> <P> BRETT FARYNIARZ  </P> <P> Signed as a free agent last season. Played in 15 games and registered 10  tackles and one sack. Earned second-team All-Western Athletic Conference honors  at San Diego State.  </P> <P> KEVIN GREENE  </P> <P> Emerged as a force among outside linebackers in the league last year.

Before last season, he missed  only two games in career due to injury and had played in 76 consecutive games.  </P> <P> BRIAN SMITH  </P> <P> At 6-foot-6, Smith looks more like a small forward than a tall linebacker.  Former Auburn standout uses height to deflect passes. One of two linebackers  taken in the second round along with Frank Stams of Notre Dame.  </P> <P> FRANK STAMS  </P> <P> The Rams' second-round pick from Notre Dame was drafted as an outside  linebacker but has moved inside in some of the Rams' alignments. Made his first  big impression in the Rams' 23-20 exhibition victory over Phoenix when he  blocked a punt to set up a touchdown.  </P> <P> FRED STRICKLAND  </P> <P> Coming off a solid rookie season.

Hawkins, 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, helped the  Hurricanes win a national title in 1987.  </P> <P> SHAWN MILLER  </P> <P> Coming off one of the best seasons in five-year career.

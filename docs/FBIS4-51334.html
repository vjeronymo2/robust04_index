			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The Party School of the  Chinese Communist Party Central Committee today announced the  establishment of a research center for studying the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Addressing the ceremony to launch the center, Party School  President Hu Jintao, a standing committee member of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said Deng  Xiaoping's theory for building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the guiding principle for China's reform,  opening-up and modernization drive.    The CPC party school, as a special institution for training  party officials and theorists, is duty-bound to study and  propagate Deng Xiaoping's theory, Hu said, urging the school to  bring its advantages into full play and build itself into "a  base for research" in this regard.    Also, he called on researchers to study new issues, come  with  fresh and correct views, by adhering to the principle of seeking  truth from facts and emancipating the mind, so as to ensure a  democratic and lively academic atmosphere.    Gong Yuzhi, deputy president of the party school was  appointed head of the research center.</p>

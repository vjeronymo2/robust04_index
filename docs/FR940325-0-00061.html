The Service is also designating the USDA port at Wilmington, NC, as a port for the exportation of Venus flytrap ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Dionaea muscipula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) plants. The USDA has adequate facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  March 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Marshall P.

Section 9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section 24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened. (The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation of plants through those ports.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a July 21, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (58 FR 39003), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed that the USDA ports at Mobile, AL, Savannah, GA, Baltimore, MD, Morehead City and Wilmington, NC, Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC, and Norfolk, VA, be listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or CITES. The Service further proposed to designate the port at Wilmington, NC, as a port for the exportation of Venus flytrap ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dionaea muscipula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) plants. Finally, the Service acted to correct a typographical error in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's July 21, 1993, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day comment period ending on September 20, 1993. Four comments were received by that date, from a lumber company, a lumber trade association, a U.S. Senator, and a State port authority. All four commenters asked that Gulfport, MS, be added to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or CITES. In addition, one of the commenters asked that the ports at Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, also be added to that list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

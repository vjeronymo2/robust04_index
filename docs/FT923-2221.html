			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Oliver Group cuts half-year loss to Pounds 4.87m The Oliver Group, footwear retailer, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.87m in the half year to June 30. Overall turnover rose marginally to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.8m), but margins had been hit by rising occupancy and utility costs, and wide-spread retail price discounting, Mr Ian Oliver, chairman, said. The sale of the framing division had been followed by the disposal of a number of uneconomic footwear branches and further disposals were planned, he said. Losses per share increased to 19.28p (18.08p) and there is no interim dividend. Mr Oliver said he was stepping down from the board with immediate effect for 'someone unfettered by recent history'. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman of Boddington Group and Ferguson International, will succeed him.</p>

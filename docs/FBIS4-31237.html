			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edward Krzemien: "Olechowski Could Leave"] </F>   [Text] It would take 10 minutes for the Council of  Ministers to adopt a new statute of the Foreign Ministry [MSZ].  But, for six weeks now, the issue continues to be deleted from  the agenda. The new statute is the first step in the reforms of  the ministry proposed by Minister Andrzej Olechowski.    If the government does not adopt a new MSZ statute within  two  weeks, Minister Andrzej Olechowski could resign in protest, the  minister's associates say.    The draft of the reform was prepared by Jerzy Kozminski, who  has been brought into the MSZ by Olechowski to take the post of  secretary of state. Kozminski was regarded as an excellent  organizer and was Leszek Balcerowicz's closest aide in 1989-91  and then an adviser to Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.  <H5>  To Wait Through Kozminski Stage </H5>   After completing work on the reform, he was nominated  Poland's ambassador to the United States and was supposed to  leave for Washington as soon as the changes in the ministry took  place, and, most importantly, only when an appropriate candidate  had been found to replace him as the future secretary general,  the second post in the MSZ after the minister. It seems that  was precisely one of the reasons for procrastinating with the  reform. The Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] decided to  "wait through the Kozminski stage"--Kozminski cannot  procrastinate too much in his departure for Washington--and only  then to begin negotiations concerning the filling of the post.    In a desperate defense move, Olechowski decided that Jerzy  Kozminski would retain for the moment the post of secretary of  state apart from the ambassadorial post (according to diplomatic  protocol experts, such things are practiced around the world).  Such a solution gives Olechowski plenty of time for coming to  an agreement with Prime Minister Pawlak.    Apart from Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz, the prime minister's  adviser, Kozminski's place could be taken over by Marek Siwiec,  who is being promoted by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].  <H5>  Siwiec Worse Than Konarski </H5>   However, according to our information, Pawlak does not like  Siwiec's candidacy. Siwiec is politically associated with SLD  leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, and he will not be very useful to  URM. That is why the prime minister would prefer another SLD  member, Sejm Deputy Wlodzimierz Konarski, who, by the way, is  supported by part of the SLD leadership and who was mentioned  earlier as the SLD's candidate for deputy foreign minister.    Konarski, a longstanding diplomat in Jaruzelski's and  Rakowski's times, was a representative of the Polish People's  Republic [PRL] in the CSCE during the martial law period.  Skubiszewski's entry in 1989 ended his diplomatic career. In  the Sejm of this term, he is one of the main forces behind the  famous subcommission for personnel review in the MSZ, in which  he cooperates with Tadeusz Samborski of the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL] (also a former MSZ man). Samborski is regarded by URM as  the person who "incites" Pawlak against the MSZ and Olechowski.  <H5>  Who Will Be Shot Down? </H5>   The subcommission accuses Skubiszewski of  "deprofessionalization" of the foreign service, meaning getting  rid of PRL experts of the Konarski kind, and demands that the  qualifications of all of the "new" ones be verified.    On 25 May, ZYCIE WARSZAWY revealed a letter from Tadeusz  Iwinski of the SLD and Tadeusz Samborski of the PSL addressed to  the director of the MSZ's personnel department, on behalf of the  Sejm subcommission for MSZ personnel issues. The authors of the  13 May letter demand "information on the qualifications, the  course of professional career, and the fulfillment of  requirements defined in specific provisions concerning  diplomatic and consular service" regarding 23 persons, among  them two deputy ministers, directors of key departments, and  some ambassadors and consuls.    Neither Pawlak, who is chief of his party's parliamentary  club, nor (which is strange) SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski  has distanced himself from the list. Thus, it is beginning to  function within the MSZ as a list of people whom the coalition  wants to "shoot down."    This situation causes a feeling of insecurity and danger  among the MSZ cadre. There are plenty of forecasts that a  "crisis is approaching" and that an exodus of the best diplomats  will begin. Every one of them will easily find a job in both  Poland and in international institutions for salaries that would  be several times higher. Salaries in the MSZ continue to be one  of the lowest in the central administration, an official said.    In addition, neither the PSL nor the SLD has any personnel  reserves whatsoever with whom it could replace the 23 diplomats  questioned by the subcommission.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / French banks cut base rates France's leading commercial banks yesterday announced they would trim their base lending rates by 0.2 percentage points, from 8.15 per cent to 7.95 per cent. The cuts will take effect tomorrow. The reductions reflect a steady decline in money market rates and follow a series of cuts in official borrowing costs. The Bank of France has lowered the intervention rate, the floor for money market interest rates, six times since last July's European currency crisis. The latest cut, at the beginning of December, reduced the intervention rate to 6.2 per cent. Yesterday's announcements of base rate cuts - by banks including Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais - follow pressure from the government. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has called for commercial banks to pass on more quickly the reduction in official borrowing costs. Economists in Paris said that banks' base rates should continue to fall as money market rates and official borrowing costs were reduced further. They said lower base rates, which provide a reference for most consumer credit and loans to small and medium-sized industry, would help revive the stagnant economy. Market interest rates have fallen over the past few months, particularly at the long end of the bond market. Ten-year government bonds, for example, are currently yielding about 5.6 per cent, compared with about 6 per cent at the end of November. World Stock Markets, Page 21</p>

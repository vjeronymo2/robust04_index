			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Major seeks to calm referendum hysteria Mr John Major yesterday sought to calm speculation about a referendum on further European integration as Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, warned that a plebiscite would not restore voters' confidence in the government. Amid growing expectations that the government is moving towards a referendum, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to put the government's Budget troubles behind it by pledging a continued tough line on inflation and public borrowing. But as the government tried to restore its authority after setbacks on Europe and value added tax, senior ministers were bracing themselves for a crushing loss to Labour in the Dudley West by-election tomorrow. Mr Major, who has hinted repeatedly that the government will promise a referendum, was asked in the Commons at question time what the criteria would be for such a vote. Clearly seeking to calm backbench hysteria on the issue, he told MPs: 'I am not prepared to close the door to the possibility of a referendum, but equally there are very important constitutional matters to be considered, and it would be very unwise to make snap judgments.' Mr Major said it was extremely difficult in advance of the 1996 inter-governmental conference of European Union heads of government 'to know precisely what the question might be in a referendum'. Sir Edward, a fervent pro-European, warned on BBC Radio that promising a referendum would not solve the government's problems with Eurosceptic Tory MPs, and could spark a run on sterling. Voters were demanding a referendum because they had lost confidence in the government and parliament. He added: 'The way to deal with it is for the government to regain its authority, and for parliament to show it does know how to behave.' Mr Clarke, opening a debate on last week's mini-Budget, said that confidence in the government's stewardship of the economy had been maintained by his prompt action in raising interest rates and proposing higher taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol after the government's plans to increase VAT on heating fuel were defeated. He acknowledged fears that the raised duty on alcohol would reduce sales and employment but promised tough negotiations with other EU countries to achieve an 'approximation' of duties throughout the EU. The scale of the task was underlined by Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, who said that other countries could not be expected to increase the duties they levied. He said: 'At some stage you will have to reduce our duty.' Mr Clarke answered: 'That may be so. But I do not wish to anticipate our negotiating position.' He promised to strengthen the measures already in place to counter the activities of those smuggling alcohol and tobacco into Britain. He said it was estimated that the loss of duty resulting from goods being smuggled across the English Channel amounted to Pounds 65m a year. He suggested that there was a case for seeking the approximation of tobacco duty in the EU. Mr Clarke added that the government had no intention of extending VAT to categories of goods now subject to the zero rate 'without primary legislation'. MPs approved the mini-Budget changes in a series of votes at the end of the debate.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZALE, IN SEARCH OF NEW MARKETS, WILL BUY GORDON JEWELRY CORP.  </P> <P> Zale Corp., the nation's largest jewelry chain, moved Wednesday to conquer new  regions and younger markets, saying it will buy No. 2 Gordon Jewelry Corp. for  $310.9 million.  </P> <P> Privately held Zale is offering $36.75 a share for Houston-based Gordon, a  chain with more than 600 stores. The new company will have more than 2,000  stores and annual sales of $1.3 billion, analysts said.  </P> <P> Gordon shares shot up $6.375 to $36.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, a gain  of 21%. The stock was already trading at record levels because of takeover  speculation.  </P> <P> The deal will enhance Zale's status among young buyers and in different  regions, analysts said, citing Gordon's younger customers and its presence in  states where Zale is weak, including Minnesota, Indiana and West Virginia.  </P> <P> About two-thirds of Gordon's stores sell modern, moderately priced jewelry,  almost exclusively in shopping malls. The remainder are traditional, upper-end  stores that operate under different names in each market.  </P> <P> "It's a positive move for Zale -- a good strategic move to grow their business  in highly fragmented industry dominated by independents," said analyst Nancy  Self of Burns Fry Ltd. in Toronto.  </P> <P> "Even the world's largest jewelry retailer must fight on a mall-by-mall basis,"  Self said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $900 Million in Sales  </P> <P> The merged company will also have greater clout in purchasing jewelry and more  freedom to cut overhead costs, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Clearly, in terms of numbers, they will be able to capitalize on their market  position," said George Hartman, an analyst in the Toronto firm of Brown  Baldwin.  </P> <P> Zale, based in Irving, Tex., has more than 1,300 stores and annual sales of  more than $900 million, analysts said. Zale is equally owned by Toronto-based  Peoples Jewellers Ltd. and Switzerland's Swarovski International Holding AG.  </P> <P> Zale officials were not available to comment on the fate of Gordon stores that  compete directly with Zale.  </P> <P> "My inclination is to expect them to use the Gordon stores under the Gordon  name to compete in different segments," Self said. "The Gordon stores attract a  different customer."  </P> <P> Gordon earned $6.2 million on sales of $389.6 million last year. The company  said April 10 that it was considering options to enhance shareholder value,  including a possible sale.  </P> <P> Gordon Chief Executive Daniel Gordon said in a statement: "We believe the  transaction provides excellent value for our stockholders and are extremely  pleased with the result."  </P> <P> Zale already owns about 4.2% of Gordon and will launch a tender offer for the  rest of the company. Owners of about 54% of Gordon's shares have already agreed  to sell to Zale, Gordon said.  </P></p>

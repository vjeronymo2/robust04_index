Commenting on his nonattendance, a spokesman at Ozawa's  office said: "He does not have any special plans. But he may  be feeling a little fatigued."    However, as Mr. Ozawa is not known for missing plenary Diet  sessions, the rumor has started that his absence was a silent  protest against the prime minister's failure to reshuffle the  cabinet.    Mr. Ozawa missed a meeting of the government and ruling  party  leaders held on the night of 2 March, at which the prime  minister announced his decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle.  Since then, Mr. Ozawa has made no appearances at the Diet where  he has previously appeared regularly.    A senior Shinseito staff member said: "He is not exactly  dissatisfied with the prime minister, but rather irritated by  the fact the political outlook has become uncertain. Although  he may not make an appearance for about a week, he will show up  sooner or later."</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): Cutting the cost of calling - Mobile phones Hollywood would have us believe that mobile phones are the answer to life. In between the bullets, Keanu Reeves, hero of the high-adrenalin movie 'Speed' spends hours on a mobile. In Harrison Ford's in 'Clear and Present Danger', mobile phones are used to run a covert mission. Reality soons parts from fantasy. Mr Reeves' mobile batteries never seem to wear out. And Harrison Ford is not seen paying any phone bills. But for the company whose phones aren't running on charisma, paying the bill is a costly business. One way of keeping costs down when phoning the office rather is to link the office PABX (switchboard) directly to a mobile phone network. Even if a company has only five heavy mobile phone users calling the office regularly, this approach can cut costs by up to 45 per cent, according to Mike Short, a spokesman for cellular network operator Cellnet. To get these savings, a company must rent a telecoms line of up to 30km from Mercury or BT and sign up for Cellnet's Call Access service or Vodafone's Vodanet. The leased line will link the PABX to a switching centre (or a radio base station), which is part of the mobile phone network. The centre will switch calls between the PABX and the cellular network. Call Access and Vodanet can cut the cost of calls to and from the office because these calls don't have to travel through the BT or Mercury network. Another advantage is that dialing and call set-up times are faster. Vodafone spokesman Mike Caldwell says that when he wants to call another member of staff from his mobile, he simply dials a short code (91 in this case), followed by the colleague's extension number. The call does not have to be answered by the receptionist but goes straight to his colleague's desk. Incoming calls to staff who are out of the office can also be handled more conveniently. If they cannot be dealt with by someone who is in the office,they can be transferred to the mobile user - without the caller having to dial another number. Vodanet and Call Access can be used with either analogue (traditional) mobile services or the newer GSM (Global System for Mobile) services. But whether a company wants to link its PABX to a mobile phone network, or simply use mobiles by themselves, it is better to opt for phones based on digital technology, such as GSM or PCN (Personal Communications Network) - a variant on GSM. This is because digital technology has a number of advantages over analogue technology: Clearer conversations. Digital technology cuts out background noise on mobile phones just as it does on compact discs. Greater security. Digital signals are encrypted electronically before they are sent and this makes eavesdropping more difficult. Faster connection. Once the number has been dialed on a digital phone, the call will be connected immediately. On an analogue phone call set-up times are about six or seven seconds. Reduced congestion. GSM networks can cope with eight times as much traffic as analogue systems. This reduces the possibility of congestion. PCN networks are also able to handle more traffic than can the analogue systems. Pan-European coverage. GSM is becoming the standard for new European digital mobile phone services and has been adopted in many other parts of the world. Handsets bought in one country can be used to send and receive calls in another through so-called roaming agreements with national service providers. Very limited overseas roaming is also possible for users of PCN services. Better transmission for mobile data. It is easier to transmit data over digital mobile phone networks than over their analogue counterparts. Vodafone will be launching the UK's first GSM data communications service, Vodafone Data on 19 October. Market researchers are predicting strong growth for digital mobile networks. Dataquest forecasts that there will be 8.31m GSM subscribers in Europe by 1996. High growth is also expected for UK PCN networks with Mercury's One2One gaining over 120,000 subscribers since its launch last autumn. There are plenty of digital mobile phone services to choose from. In most European countries including the UK there are two competing GSM networks, and in a few, PCN networks have also been licensed. The disadvantage is that the handsets cost more than those for analogue services. In the UK the main suppliers of GSM networks are Vodafone (with two GSM tariffs: EuroDigital and MetroDigital) and Cellnet. Registration and monthly charges for using their GSM services are similar to those for their analogue services. But UK GSM handsets cost Pounds 100 more than equivalent analogue handsets and typically range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 500. Handsets for using either of the UK's two PCN networks: Mercury's One2One or Orange from Hutchison Telecom are also expensive. Whereas analogue phones can be had for as little as Pounds 49 and are sometimes given away free, PCN handsets usually cost between Pounds 149 and Pounds 299 depending on the model chosen. However, call charges tend to be lower for PCN than for GSM. Handset prices are not likely to remain high for long. Diana Jones of service provider Mercury Communications Mobile Services, says: 'By Christmas, GSM handsets should be the same price as high-quality analogue phones - ranging from Pounds 99 to Pounds 299.' One way of getting a cheaper GSM handset before then is to shop around in Europe. Charges for phones vary from country to country, and depending on whether they are bought with or without airtime. So it is worth comparing prices. But if you plan to use your GSM phone outside the national network you register with, beware of the huge mark-ups on cross-border calls. These can add an extra 30-45 per cent to GSM call charges, according to Bryan Van Dussen, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group Europe. Despite high call charges when abroad and patchy coverage in some countries, most early customers feel they get value for money in terms of convenience and savings on hotel phone bills. Of course, high handset and call charges do not worry Hollywood mobile users. As well as hijacking a car before giving chase, they now take the mobile too.</p>

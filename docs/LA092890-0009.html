			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HUMORLESS AND ARROGANT OVERREACTION  </P> <P> Getting ticked off because an unreformable old buck uses a double-standard  phrase that was, at worst, the equivalent of a burp, showed Molly Yard  caricaturing the humorless and hypersensitive side of feminism.  </P> <P> Yard came to the hearings on a mission of wild zealotry, consistent with an  abortion-rights fanaticism that led her to say that confirming David Souter  would mean "ending freedom for women in this country."  </P> <P> This style of apocalyptic trembling, fit for an embattled speech at an abortion  rally, puts Yard over the line that separates authentic social revolutionaries  from cause-mongering pop-offs who are so sure of the correctness of their  stance that anything slightly askew -- especially the near-harmless remark of  an 87-year-old codger -- is not allowed to stand.  </P> <P> In arguing against Souter, Molly Yard had much to say about women's rights and  reproductive rights but nothing on fetal rights. She defines women's freedom in  a narrowness that she would find intolerable if expressed by the other side.  For Yard, women's freedom means full empowerment to kill what is alive and  growing, which is a bizarre definition of freedom.  </P> <P> Many credible feminists -- female and male -- reject the violence of abortion  because they oppose all forms of violence. Molly Yard doesn't speak for them.  </P></p>

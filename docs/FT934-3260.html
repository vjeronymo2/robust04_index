			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: ITT to spin off forestry unit to shareholders ITT is to spin off its large forest products subsidiary, ITT Rayonier, to shareholders in a further move to simplify the US conglomerate. Rayonier, acquired by ITT in 1968, has annual sales of about Dollars 1bn. It controls about 1.5m acres of timber resources and operates three pulp and two lumber mills. The US conglomerate plans to distribute in February one share of Rayonier common stock for every four shares of ITT common, and one share of Rayonier for every 3.1595 shares of ITT series N convertible stock. The new company will have about 30m shares outstanding and expects to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. ITT will retain no interest in the business. The move will eliminate the group's exposure to a highly cyclical, capital intensive industry which is suffering from depressed international paper and pulp prices. Fitch Investors Service, the credit agency, noted while affirming ITT's senior debt rating that Rayonier accounted for 12 per cent of ITT's consolidated capital expenditure and 14 per cent of debt while only generating 8 per cent of consolidated operating profit. Mr Rand Araskog, ITT chairman, said that 'after detailed analysis, that included senior Rayonier management, we concluded that Rayonier's financial and operational profile and capital expenditure requirements could best be served by an independent, publicly traded company'. Other important initiatives by ITT over the past year include refocusing its consumer finance business, and expansion of its automotive components business through the Dollars 400m acquisition of a General Motors subsid-iary. In the first nine months of this year, Rayonier reported income of Dollars 112m on sales of Dollars 719m, up from Dollars 102m on sales of Dollars 717m in the same period of last year.</p>

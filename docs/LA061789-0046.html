			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S IN MAINSTREAM ON PORTER RANCH?  </P> <P> City Councilman Hal Bernson's use of a document by one individual opposing the  proposed Porter Ranch development to brand the legitimate opposition to that  project as outside the political mainstream is unfortunate.  </P> <P> For an elected official to use the admittedly somewhat overstated words of a  single individual to ridicule the legitimate concerns of the people he is  supposed to represent is truly unacceptable behavior.  </P> <P> As to whether it is "outside the mainstream" to not want to see badly planned  development run rampant in this area, already beginning to suffer the effects  of overcrowding, I wholeheartedly disagree. When the people who live in this  areas become aware of the fact that our elected officials are trying to turn  the Simi Valley Freeway into a traffic-choked "Ventura Freeway II" by promoting  the same kind of helter-skelter building that has gone on in that area, Mr.  Bernson will find himself not only out of the mainstream, but high and dry.  </P> <P> ALAN P. MORSE  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Athens, 25 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  described as "historic" the agreement on partnership and  cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European  Union signed on 24 June on the island of Corfu. He made this  statement while answering questions from journalists at Athens  airport before his departure to Russia.    A really historic document has been signed, he said. It was  under preparation for a very long time, almost two years.  Europe is now the only continent that has lifted all  discriminatory measures against Russia. Indeed Russia, of  course, gets certain dividends from this. The states of Europe  get a very rich Russian market, and they too, will not lose out  by having signed this document.    The president thanked the Greek leadership and Greek Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou for their involvement in the  preparation of the agreement, and for creating most favorable  conditions for the work of the Russian delegation.</p>

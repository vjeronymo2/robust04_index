			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions for violence against women. Examples of potentially modifiable risk factors which should be examined for each area are listed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Attitudes and beliefs which influence violent behavior against women (e.g., Are boys and men who hold attitudes conducive to violence against women more likely to be violent towards women? What role does culture play in perpetuating these attitudes?);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The impact of early childhood experiences of violence (either as a witness or victim of violence) upon the tendency to develop violent behavior patterns in adulthood (e.g., What childhood experiences mitigate the harmful effects on children of witnessing violent acts against women? What role does past exposure to varying forms of violence play in repeated victimization?);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The role of alcohol and other drugs among batterers and their victims;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Factors in a dating relationship which precipitate violent behavior (e.g., Are young men who commit violent acts against a date likely to continue these behaviors?);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Factors which precipitate battering during pregnancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also of programmatic interest is epidemiologic research having as its focus the development of improved methods for and the evaluation of injury surveillance systems that accurately quantify the incidence and severity of injuries that result from violence against women (e.g., emergency department-based surveillance of injuries due to violence against women). Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of violence against women, from a social, physical, and psychological perspective (e.g., How does violence against women affect productivity in the workplace? How does such violence affect the cost of health care in general?). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses violence against women. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR&hyph;3, pages 5&hyph;11). (To receive information on these reports see the section Where To Obtain Additional Information.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the previous heading, Program Requirements (A&hyph;F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient technical and scientific merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review process. The primary review will be a peer evaluation by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) of the scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results of the peer review together with program need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program review by the ACIPC, and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The first review will be a peer review to be conducted on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad long-term objectives, the intended accomplishment of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The background of the proposal, i.e., the basis for the present proposal, the critical evaluation of existing knowledge, and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

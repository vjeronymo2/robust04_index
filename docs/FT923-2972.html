			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: Encouraging the smart insiders and a lottery Sir, Flushed with the success of funding part of the public sector borrowing requirement and supporting sterling in one manoeuvre the Treasury has dreamt up another two bird, one stone trick: the new insider dealing proposals would appear to be an attempt to convert the stock market into the national lottery. By outlawing information gathering and dissemination, the Treasury wants to create a market where luck is the only determinant of returns. The grit on the roulette wheel is that the stock exchange has failed to get its new computerised system, Taurus, ready in time. I assume from their silence on the matter that quoted companies are happy to go along with this plan to use ther share certificates as lottery tickets.

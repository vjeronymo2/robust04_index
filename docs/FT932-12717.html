			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Gerstner pledges to revive IBM MR LOUIS Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, yesterday pledged to restore the world's largest computer company to profit. 'We can bring IBM back,' he told the company's annual meeting in Florida. 'I'm determined to restore not only the value of your shares, but also your confidence in the company,' he told shareholders in his first public statement since taking over at IBM on April 1. He faces the challenge of winning over shareholders angry at the performance of IBM shares, which have lost half their value over the past year. Much of that anger was directed at the board of directors 'on whose watch' IBM's problems emerged. As a signal of their unhappiness with the board, 28 per cent of all IBM shareholders voted to eliminate retirement benefits for non-employee directors. Although Mr Gerstner appeared to make a favourable impression upon shareholders, several raised questions about his remuneration. His salary is almost double that of his predecessor Mr John Akers. In addition to a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.2m) salary, Mr Gerstner received a one-off payment of Dollars 5m on joining IBM and generous share options. He acknowledged that employee morale was low in many parts of IBM, and vowed to try to complete the 'downsizing' of the company as quickly as possible. 'I don't have a plan that I can describe to you today,' Mr Gerstner said, stressing he has had little time to assess IBM's problems. Mr Gerstner outlined his priorities: first to 'right-size' the company through job reductions. 'Secondly, we will sharply define our strategic priorities, pin down what businesses we'll pursue, which deserve priority and what competitive platforms we'll build on,' he said. 'Third, we will organise the company around that strategy, achieving the benefits of decentralisation while seizing the advantage of our size. Fourth, we will redouble our commitment to our customers.' IBM's share price has plunged over the past year from more than Dollars 100 last summer, to around Dollars 50 in recent weeks. Last year IBM cut its dividend by 55 per cent to 54 cents per quarter. Yesterday IBM's board voted to maintain the quarterly dividend at this level, dispelling fears of another dividend cut.</p>

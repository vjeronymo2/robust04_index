			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE HEALTH EXPERTS WARN AGAINST PRACTICE OF 'DAY CARE' SANDBAGGING  </P> <P> Chinese health experts on Saturday warned parents in northern China against  placing their infants in sandbags, a traditional practice they said may lead to  mental retardation.  </P> <P> As a form of rural day care, peasant parents in north China have for hundreds  of years put their children in large, stationary bags of fine sand, tied at the  waist.  </P> <P> The infants can stretch their legs somewhat in the sand but cannot crawl out,  and the sand acts as a diaper that is changed daily. The infants are removed  from the bags only for feeding.  </P> <P> But the China Daily, a state-run newspaper, reported that experts from the  China Children's Development Center had issued a warning against the practice  after conducting a survey that indicated the sandbags can cause health  problems, including mental retardation.  </P> <P> The experts told the English-language newspaper that the practice has been  found "extremely harmful" to infants, affecting their height, weight and  intelligence. Many of the sandbag-reared children are shorter and skinnier than  the general population, they said.  </P> <P> The research survey, conducted in Hebei and Shandong provinces in northeast  China, found that 70% of the 400 "sandbag children" surveyed had been kept  confined for as much as 20 hours each day before the age of 2.  </P> <P> Nearly 30% of the children, now around 10 years old, were found to be slightly  mentally retarded. The incidence of rickets was also 20% higher than in the  general population because the infants could not move around and exercise, the  China Daily said.  </P> <P> "Their intelligence develops sluggishly due to lack of stimulation from  activities and surroundings in the brain's formative period, when they are left  alone lying in sandbags," a researcher told the newspaper.  </P></p>

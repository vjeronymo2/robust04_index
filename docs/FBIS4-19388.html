			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 15 (AFP) -- France protested Bosnian  Serb harassment of UN peacekeepers on Friday [15 April] saying  it could not accept their being taken hostage or targeted.    French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said: "We  not  accept that United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR), whose  impartiality cannot be doubted, are taken hostage or are  targeted."    French peacekeepers guarding an arms depot near the Bosnian  capital of Sarajevo have been surrounded by Bosnian Serbs,  demanding that heavy weapons be handed over to them.    The Serbs have also mined the entrances to three other arms  depots in the Sarajevo area.    On Thursday the UN Security Council warned there would be  "serious consequences" if peacekeepers were harmed in Bosnia and  demanded that "all parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serb  party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of movement and refrain  from any further actions which could threaten the safety of  UNPROFOR personnel."    Duque also said there was no new information on 11  volunteers  of the French humanitarian group Premiere urgence (First Aid)  whose convoy of relief aid for Sarajevo was halted last Friday.    Premiere urgence says the 11 are being held in a Bosnian  Serb  barracks near Pale. "We are pursuing our efforts to obtain  details and secure their release," Duque said.</p>

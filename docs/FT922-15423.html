			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Pilkington claims lead in cheaper method: Glassmaking PILKINGTON, the glassmaker, said yesterday it had developed a method of turning raw materials into high-quality molten glass using electrically fired furnaces, beating its three main international competitors - St Gobain of France, Asahi of Japan and PPG of the US. Electric melting furnaces are cheaper to install, easier to maintain and are only half as polluting as gas or oil-fired alternatives. Until now, however, the glass produced by this method has contained too many microscopic bubbles to be used for anything other than bottles or jars. Pilkington has developed a method of making the molten glass flow around the furnace's electrodes so that the bubbles come out. This molten glass can then be used to make optically perfect flat glass. The system is already producing commercial quantities of glass from a small float glass plant in St Helens, Merseyside. It now has to be scaled up for use on bigger lines. At present, the method would only pay in the UK or Germany in small plants because of the relatively high price of electricity. However, a hybrid system of electrically boosted conventional melting furnaces offers a medium-term solution for big plants where electricity is expensive. In conventional gas or oil-fired furnaces, sheets of flame are played across the raw materials, so the furnace has to have a roof lined with firebrick. Heat is wasted and polluting emissions are produced by both the flames and the process itself. Electric melting is attractive as a production method because it can be carried on from underneath the ingredients - sand, soda ash and limestone - which melt down so that more can be piled on top. This insulates the molten glass underneath and increases efficiency. The electric method has still to establish a maintenance standard, but Pilkington believes it could be as short as three weeks, against the present 13-week shutdown for conventional furnaces. Sir Antony Pilkington, the company's chairman, said yesterday: 'Electric melting has been an ambition pursued by all the major flat-glassmakers and we are delighted we have been the first to demonstrate success. The process offers the prospect of virtually pollution-free melting.' Pilkington announced yesterday a rise in sales in the US of its glass for car windows. This cuts down the amount of ultra-violet radiation and solar heat reaching a car's interior. Pilkington forecasts an increase in sales of the product in the US alone to Pounds 250m by 1995.</p>

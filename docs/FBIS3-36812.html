In its statement published today, PRUC pointed out that  local  conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina allow to make air strikes  neither limited, nor selective. "The tragedy on a market place  in Sarajevo will be repeated over and over again as a result of  the strikes," the statement stipulates.    A total of 68 people died as a result of the mortar attack  on  a market place in Sarajevo.    Moreover, NATO forces' direct involvement in the hostilities  will lead to further escalation of violence and virtually the  trigger "internationalization" of the armed conflict which is  fraught with unpredictable consequences, the document points out.    The PRUC faction stated that if the UN Security Council  approves air strikes on Sarajevo, the Russian representative  must use his right to veto the decision.    PRUC also believes that the Russian president and government  should take immediate measures to prevent the Bosnian crisis  from turning into a larger war.</p>

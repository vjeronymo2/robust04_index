			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Memotec faces proxy battle A LEADING Canadian securities company, apparently with the tacit backing of telecommunications conglomerate BCE, has launched a proxy battle to unseat senior management of Memotec Data, the Montreal-based company whose interests include Canada's overseas telephone monopoly. Gordon Capital of Toronto said it will seek to replace Memotec's chairman and president on the board with three of its own nominees at Memotec's annual meeting next Thursday. In a proxy solicitation to Memotec shareholders, Gordon criticised Memotec for expanding into high-technology businesses by using cash generated mainly from the telephone carrier, Teleglobe Canada. Gordon estimates that Memotec's computer-related businesses suffered a pre-tax loss of CDollars 14.5m (USDollars 12.60m) in 1990, compared with Teleglobe's earnings of CDollars 30.1m. According to Gordon, Memotec 'has cash flow problems that need to be addressed immediately'. Available cash declined to CDollars 5.7m at the end of last year from CDollars 113.8m two years earlier. Current liabilities exceed current assets by more than CDollars 155m. Memotec's management said yesterday that it 'vigorously contests the accuracy and validity' of Gordon's conclusions, and that it is confident it will retain shareholders' support. BCE has a 31 per cent stake in Memotec. But BCE said yesterday that the company undertook earlier to use its votes only for its own nominees on the Memotec board, and that it thus has no choice but to abstain in the vote. BCE has made no secret however, of its unhappiness with Memotec's recent performance. Gordon, which is well known for its aggressive streak, said that its only direct interest in the outcome of the proxy fight is a CDollars 400,000 fee for its services. Memotec's share price has slid in the past three years from CDollars 19 to just over CDollars 9. Net earnings tumbled to CDollars 8m last year from CDollars 20.1m in 1989. Its 1990 revenues were CDollars 404m. Teleglobe accounts for about 60 per cent of its revenues.</p>

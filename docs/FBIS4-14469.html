			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 31 (AFP) -- Russia is reconsidering  plans to join a partnership program with NATO and will not make  a decision until sometime next autumn, presidential spokesman  Vyacheslav Kostikov said Thursday.    "Boris Yeltsin believes six to seven months is needed" to  make a decision, Kostikov said at a Kremlin news conference.  "The president will not be rushed, he will discuss the matter  with all political parties."    Russian and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  officials had previously indicated that Russia would join the  program, known as Partnership for Peace, in April.    "Russia's interests must be preserved," Kostikov said,  adding  that "dangers exist" to Russia's membership in the program,  which extends a cooperative link from NATO to its former east  bloc adversaries.    Kostikov said that "many people" in Russia supported  membership in the NATO program, notably officials in the foreign  ministry, the Defense Ministry and the federal counterespionage  service.    "But there are arguments against (joining) that must be  taken  into account," Kostikov said.    He said that in particular "one of the documents" involved  in  Russia's membership in the partnership program "does not  correspond to Russia's interests."    Kostikov did not specify what document this was, but he  stressed that an agreement on trade of Russian-made weapons  "needs to be reviewed."    Arguments in favor of joining the program focused on closer  cooperation with the West and maintaining high efficiency of the  Russian Armed Forces comparable to Western levels.    Vladimir Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to Washington  who now leads a pro-reform faction in parliament, earlier  outlined seven questions which he said must be answered before  Moscow could sign on to the Partnership scheme.    Those questions included how responsibilities were to be  divided between member nations, how decisions were to be made,  implications for military ties between the former Soviet  republics, standardization of military hardware and how Russia  was to finance its membership in the scheme.    "The answer to these questions is indispensable for a  decision to be made on whether Russia will take part in the  program," Lukin said at a news conference.    He stressed however that he was not necessarily opposed to  Russia joining the partnership program, but noted that "long  talks" with the NATO countries that proposed the plan were  needed before Russia could make a decision.    In Warsaw, meanwhile, Polish Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk cast doubt on Moscow's sincerity in wanting to  join the Partnership for Peace, suggesting the Russian  leadership had political reasons for doing so.    "I think I am right in wondering if it is not just an  expedient gesture," he told a press conference. "Russia looks  like a besieged fortress. It is a self-isolation which helps  them with their domestic political games."    He said Russian membership would be "a positive thing,"  adding that "the more secure and stable Russia is, the more  secure Europe can feel."    "We hope admission to the Partnership for Peace will make  Russia treat us as partners, and that they will at last  understand that we are no longer their underlings," he said.</p>

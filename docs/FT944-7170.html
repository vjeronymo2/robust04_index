			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Continental hit by 19% rise in rubber price Continental, the German tyre maker, yesterday said growing competition and a 19 per cent rise in the price of natural rubber meant that turnover rose only slightly in the first nine months, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. The group said its pre-tax earnings for 1994 were likely to be higher than the DM65.1m (Dollars 41.9m) reported last year, but would give no further details. Turnover in the period rose 2.6 per cent over the year-ago term. Including new acquisitions, among them Barum, the Czech producer, sales rose 7.1 per cent. Sales of passenger and commercial tyres, which represent about 40 per cent of group turnover, rose 2.3 per cent to DM3.58bn. However, the company hopes to boost sales next year with a new range of summer and winter tyres made with silica, a compound which is said to reduce petrol consumption by about 5 per cent. General Tire, the US subsidiary, is likely to report a loss for the full year because of continuing restructuring costs. ContiTech, the non-tyre division, saw sales rise 23.2 per cent following new acquisitions.</p>

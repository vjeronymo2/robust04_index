			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations presume that if an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity was engaged in for all periods solely for that non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part (it cannot be rebutted entirely because the presumption only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates if the taxpayer establishes that the activity has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose) by establishing that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity was also engaged in for the purpose of making or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting a lobbying communication. Thus, for example, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer regularly conducts an activity in the ordinary course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its business operations beginning at least two taxable years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the taxable year in which the lobbying communication is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made, it would be presumed that the continuing activity was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in to support the lobbying communication, even during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made (and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding taxable year). In this regard, it is expected that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a course of conduct spanning a period of time is a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity will be determined based on all the facts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. In particular, it is expected that a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in the way an activity is conducted will result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised activity being considered a separate activity from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier conduct of the activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also presume that if an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same taxable year as the communication is made or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately preceding taxable year, and is not within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumption described in the preceding paragraph, that activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication. The taxpayer may rebut this presumption (in whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. If, during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same taxable year, the taxpayer commences an activity that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relates directly to the subject matter of specific legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (then in existence) and makes a lobbying communication with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to that legislation, it is expected that the taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally will be unable to rebut the presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations treat certain activities as engaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in without a purpose of making or supporting a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication. These activities consist of performing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity for purposes of complying with the requirements of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law, reading any general circulation publications, or viewing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listening to other mass media communications available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public. In addition, if, prior to evidencing a purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to influence specific legislation (or similar legislation), a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer determines the existence or procedural status of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation; determines the time, place, and subject of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation; or prepares routine, brief summaries of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of that legislation, the taxpayer is treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaging in that activity without a purpose of making or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting a lobbying communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide a special rule for so-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called ``paid volunteers.'' If, for the purpose of making or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting a lobbying communication, one taxpayer uses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the employee's work in support of the trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association's lobbying communication. The proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also provide a general anti-avoidance rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations are proposed to be effective for amounts paid or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred on or after May 13, 1994. Taxpayers will be required to adopt a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of section 162(e)(1)(A) for amounts paid or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred prior to this date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Modification of 1993 Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 27, 1993, the IRS issued a notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (IA&hyph;57&hyph;93) concerning the allocation of costs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying activities. Section 1.162&hyph;28(g)(3) of those proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provides a general rule for determining whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting with certain specified government officials or employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes a lobbying activity (a term that includes influencing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation). Because the proposed regulations contained in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document provide rules for determining whether a taxpayer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in influencing legislation, the IRS will amend &sect;1.162-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28(g)(3), when it is promulgated as a final regulation, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform that provision to these proposed regulations. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, whether sponsoring or attending a meeting constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing legislation will be determined under the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are the subject of these proposed regulations. Thus, for example, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer attends a speech by a legislator at which specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation is discussed, the taxpayer will not necessarily be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be influencing legislation unless the taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a communication with the legislator which refers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if the taxpayer makes a lobbying communication with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to that legislation (or similar legislation) within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same or the succeeding taxable year, the presumptions provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed regulations will apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Grass Roots Lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations do not address grass roots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying. Although the proposed regulations provide a definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of influencing legislation that is similar to the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct lobbying communication under the section 4911 regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it should not be inferred that the IRS will adopt the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of grassroots lobbying communication under the section 4911  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for purposes of section 162(e)(1)(C). As noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the prior law rules disallowing business deductions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses for grassroots lobbying and participation in political  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> campaigns remain in effect under OBRA 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

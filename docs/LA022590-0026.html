			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUGGED U.S. EMBASSY STANDS -- FOR NOW -- AS A REMINDER OF THE COLD WAR;  </P> <P> ESPIONAGE: A CAREFULLY CRAFTED AGREEMENT TURNS INTO A DIPLOMATIC FIASCO. SOVIET  CHICANERY COSTS UNCLE SAM AN EXTRA $270 MILLION AND WASTED YEARS.  </P> <P> It has been 20 years since the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to  build new embassies for each other in Moscow and Washington. In that time, it  is said, the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Cheops.  </P> <P> The Pharaohs didn't have to deal with the Soviets. The U.S. Embassy is still  not finished -- and won't be.  </P> <P> With eight stories up, $170 million spent and water and ice ravaging the most  expensive bricks in the world, the Administration in Washington has decided to  stop there, demolish the building and start over.  </P> <P> That will add five more years and an additional $270 million to the cost of a  modern tale of two cities, a lumbering farce of pachyderms unique to the late  unpleasantness called the Cold War. Walls come down, liberty soars, but in the  new age we are left with monuments to the buffoonery of the old.  </P> <P> The United States finished the Soviet Embassy in Washington, but the Soviets  couldn't move into their chancery until the United States moved into its  chancery in Moscow. That was by agreement, one of several that took 13 years to  reach in tense, careful negotiations. Every major move had to be precise,  simultaneous and symmetrical. It was like two Mafia families trying to arrange  a truce for a wedding.  </P> <P> It took less than two years to build the 102-story Empire State Building in New  York in 1931. In Moscow, the Soviets were into year seven and still not  finished with the eight-story office building of the U.S. Embassy when the  United States threw them out.  </P> <P> The problem was bugs. Mysterious, multitudinous, ubiquitous, anti-American,  subversive, pre-glasnost, godless Russian communist bugs.  </P> <P> In columns and walls, in concrete and steel, in breathtaking numbers and novel  ways that confounded American experts, we were told, the Soviets had sown the  chancery with diabolic devices to overhear, record and transmit American  secrets.  </P> <P> The United States refused to move in until the bugs were moved out, but getting  them out appeared tougher than evicting a poor relative. So tough, in fact, two  Administrations spent four years figuring out what to do. Both concluded that  the only safe course was to build a new building.  </P> <P> Historically, there is no louder uproar among politicians and press than the  thunder evoked by the suggestion that foreigners, especially the Soviets, had  outwitted Uncle Sam. The devilish dither of the embassies had all the makings.  </P> <P> * Sites. After 10 years of negotiations, we gave them Mt. Alto along Wisconsin  Avenue, one of the highest points in Washington. They gave us a plot along  Konyushkovskaya Ulitsa down near the Moscow River.  </P> <P> * Uproar. The United States had given away a strategic height from which,  electronically, the KGB could look down the throats of the White House and  Pentagon.  </P> <P> "The view is terrific," but the intelligence advantage is "considerably less,"  said James R. Schlesinger, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  What's more, other witnesses testified, Mt. Alto was not the Soviets' first  choice for an embassy. And in Moscow, the United States had turned down an  offer of Lenin Hills to be "downtown." The high-low plot wouldn't play.  </P> <P> * Sidewalks. A hearing of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on  international operations. Back from Moscow, Rep. Dan Mica (D-Fla.) reported:  "Where the new building is, (the Soviets) built us a 16-inch sidewalk so that  there is no place to walk. . . . That is harassment."  </P> <P> Rep. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Mass.) asked if the State Department pursued a  "reciprocity" of harassment in building the Soviet Embassy in Washington. She  seemed to think it should.  </P> <P> James E. Nolan, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, replied: "In the  District of Columbia, one does not cut down sidewalk size in half simply  because the State Department thinks it is a good time to do it or because we  think that it is leverage to do it."  </P> <P> * Off site. Here was the real trouble. In Washington, Americans poured concrete  for the Soviet Embassy on-site where the Soviets could watch. In Moscow,  Soviets poured concrete off-site where Americans couldn't, or didn't, watch.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union works at the problem of security penetration 24 hours a day,  365 days a year," testified Schlesinger, who investigated the embassy muddle  for President Ronald Reagan. "If one signs an agreement that permits the  Soviets to precast columns and beams off-site, the principal party to blame is  oneself. . . . As Napoleon once observed, there are limits to rascality, there  are no limits to stupidity."  </P> <P> The result, said the expert witness, was "the best-bugged building ever built."  </P> <P> It contained "a full array of intelligence devices for which we do not yet  understand either the technology or underlying strategy. . . . We failed to  allow for the boldness, thoroughness and extent of the penetration."  </P> <P> During the building of their embassy in Washington, the suspicious Soviets  watched every blow of the hammer. For every American working, said an American  official observer of the Soviet observers, there was a Soviet watching.  </P> <P> They X-rayed "every inch" of steel before it went up, said an architect. They  watched concrete poured on-site. If the work went too fast to watch carefully,  they slowed the work. They insisted that window units assembled off-site be  disassembled and reassembled before their eyes.  </P> <P> One result of their vigilance, the Soviets alleged, was the discovery of  pencil-thin microphones in the walls and bugging wires in the weatherstripping  of the windows put there by their American hosts.  </P> <P> Another result: The windows now leak.  </P> <P> Both embassy complexes include a chancery or office building, consulate,  residential apartments, school, gym, swimming pool, playground, theater and  underground garages.  </P> <P> The new Soviet compound is in a residential area of Washington. The new U.S.  Embassy in Moscow, like the old U.S. Embassy next door, is surrounded by  high-rises where it is assumed that the KGB is in constant attendance.  </P> <P> Across the street is an old Russian church no longer used as such. Among  American intelligence people, who say the place is loaded with electronic  equipment for monitoring its neighbors, the old church is now known as "Our  Lady of Telemetry."  </P> <P> Their mutual distrust was such that the superpowers needed 10 years to agree on  an exchange of sites to be used free of charge for 85 years. The United States  got 11.9473 acres in Moscow. The Soviet Union got 12.5258 acres in Washington.  </P> <P> It took three more years to agree on "conditions of construction" in two  stages, each using local labor and materials in stage one and each using a  mutually agreed maximum number of their own specialists imported for the  second, or finishing stage.  </P> <P> The original agreements stipulated simultaneous exchange of sites, simultaneous  completion of construction, simultaneous occupancy of the chanceries. They also  agreed to exchange architects' drawings, and each would have veto power over  the other. And, since the Soviet Union had no market economy on which to base  costs, they agreed that cost calculation for the Moscow construction would be  based on Washington prices.  </P> <P> Congress originally appropriated $192 million for the whole project. Now, says  a State Department official, it will be asked to come up with $270 million more  for the new chancery. It will cost that much because, to play it safe, all the  labor will have to be brought in from the United States at American scale to  build a building free of Soviet ears.  </P> <P> Time schedules meticulously negotiated by the superpowers bent in the  fluctuating heat of their Cold War and the numbing pace of Soviet labor.  </P> <P> It took two years to finish most of the embassy in Washington; the Soviets  moved into the residential and support quarters in 1979. It took seven years to  complete the equivalent in Moscow, and the Americans moved into those in 1986.  </P> <P> All work had stopped. The United States had "locked out" all Soviet employees  the year before for building an office building abounding in "intentional  defects."  </P> <P> The invisible presence in the woodwork should have surprised no one. In Moscow,  spying on visitors was older than borscht. The czars kept informers busy, and  their proletarian heirs bugged the American Embassy for years.  </P> <P> So regularly that guests at Spasso House, the ambassador's residence, were  given cards welcoming and warning them:  </P> <P> "Every room is monitored by the KGB and all of the staff are employees of the  KGB. We believe the garden also may be monitored. Your luggage may be searched  two or three times a day. Nothing is ever stolen and they hardly disturb  things. . . . If you have anything sensitive to talk about, please call and  make an appointment with the ambassador to discuss it in his office."  </P> <P> The Soviets liked Ambassador W. Averill Harriman so much that they gave him a  handsome replica of the Great Seal of the United States. It was years before  the next ambassador found a tiny microphone nestled in the carved wooden eagle.  </P> <P> Americans have also found, they said, more than 40 mikes in the walls of the  old chancery, bugs in electronic typewriters, signs of microwave assaults on  the building, wires leading to a tunnel between the embassy and a nearby Soviet  apartment building and traces of a "spy dust" called nitrophenylpentadienal by  which the movements of people and objects could be tracked.  </P> <P> Unintentional defects were equally hard on the psyche of Americans trying to  get a new embassy built in the land of Lenin. Which brings us to a tale of  bricks told with a lingering shudder by Charles Bassett, chief architect.  </P> <P> The plans called for the 8-story chancery to be faced in brick. No problem,  said the Soviets. Bassett quickly found problems. Available Soviet bricks were  rough and unattractive. Lithuania looked promising but that didn't pan out.  Likewise the kilns of Western Europe.  </P> <P> Finally, the right bricks were produced in Augusta, Ga., and more than a  million were carefully strapped and packaged on pallets and shipped by boat to  Helsinki and by train to Moscow, tenderly chaperoned all the way by Americans.  There, the Soviets had to be stopped from ruining the bricks by heaving them  into dump trucks for delivery.  </P> <P> Then, Bassett watched with horror as Soviet bricklayers went to work using no  strings or levels and setting bricks from inside a wall on irregular lines.  "Among Soviet workers, meeting quotas was all-important; it didn't matter if  the wall fell down the next day."  </P> <P> All work was stopped until master masons with proper tools could be flown in  from the United States to teach and supervise. And it was stopped again with  the discovery of the bugs, before the building was closed in properly and the  well-traveled bricks could be protected from the weather.  </P> <P> In their original negotiations in what seems like another age of man, the two  parties set up a cumbersome process to arbitrate disputes. The United States  has since claimed $29.9 million in damages resulting from Soviet delays and  defective work. It has also given notice of intention to claim an undetermined  amount for "intentional defects." The Soviets struck back with damage claims  for $18 million resulting from U.S. delays. Settlement is not just around the  corner.  </P> <P> Proving that he was no imprudent country bumpkin, Uncle Sam took out a  $42-million policy with the Granite State Insurance Co. 20 years ago. This was  to insure the government "against unforeseen and sudden physical loss or damage  during construction."  </P></p>

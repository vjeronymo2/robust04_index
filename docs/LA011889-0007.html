			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI SAYS HE'LL DO AWAY WITH ALL STATE INSTITUTIONS  </P> <P> Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, says that all state institutions,  including the "security apparatus" and the nation's news agency, will be  abolished this year.  </P> <P> In a speech Monday night that was broadcast by Libyan Television, Kadafi said  it is the people who should rule.  </P> <P> "All the institutions which are traditionally considered as state institutions  are to be abolished," he said in a speech to a grass-roots political committee.  </P> <P> Tripoli-based diplomats contacted by telephone expressed skepticism over  Kadafi's promises, pointing out that he promised to disband the army and police  last September but that both institutions still exist.  </P> <P> In his speech, Kadafi said the nation's security apparatus must be eliminated  "because complaints are mounting against it and its violations are on the  increase."  </P> <P> He described the official news agency Jana as "a huge octopus with hundreds of  officials."  </P> <P> Kadafi has said he seeks a political system in which people run the country  without parties or government bodies.  </P></p>

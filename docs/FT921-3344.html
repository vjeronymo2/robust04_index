			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: Trouble with the system AFTER COMMUNISM: FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS by Jacques Lesorne and Bernard Lecomte Harwood Academic Publishers Pounds 14,271 pages FOR A NEW RUSSIA by Anatoly Sobchak HarperCollins Pounds 16, 191 pages IN THE old Soviet Union there used to be a joke: 'The past is unpredictable'. Mikhail Gorbachev then declared it was time to fill in the blank spots of history. In theory, this should have opened the way to meaningful prediction of the future. So it is ironic, note the authors of After Communism, that, despite this filling in of the past, today the future seems all but impossible to predict. Still, they chance their arm in this book, as journalists should. Here they focus on the uncertainties in the former Soviet Union, the population explosion around the southern Mediterranean, and the prospects for Germany. Predictions are always liable be to be turned on their heads. Some are a bit obvious. 'The conservatives are stunned for the moment, but have not disappeared from the political scene. They may eventually become part of an authoritarian, xenophobic Slavic movement for the resurgence of an all powerful Russia.' Other predictions are too elliptical to grasp. 'One fine day the world wakes up to find a nationalistic Russia transformed into a dictatorship with a binding grip on other Slavic lands and Kazakhstan. Is this the resurgence of Communism? Not at all. Of a form of Czarism? Most certainly.' This sort of thing is both stimulating and confusing. Full of many such revealing judgments, the book should be accompanied by a bottle of good claret, bottled a year or two before the Soviet coup, so as to give an historic balance. One of the people who stood against the coup, shoulder to shoulder with Boris Yeltsin, was Anatoly Sobchak. The Mayor of St. Petersburg now presents his own story in For A New Russia. First of all, Mr Sobchack writes (though his translator is not given a credit) very well indeed, and a lot better than Yeltsin or Gorbachev. This is indeed a major factor in lending credence to his view of things. He remarks that people in civilised contries as a rule have little interest in politics: will they spend days and nights in front of their TV sets watching live reports of legislative debates? Of course not, says Sobchak - there are things which are much more interesting to this blessed citizen, such as business, culture or sport. It is good to hear that sort of thing from a Russian (or any) politician. In fact his whole account of the last three years is refreshing because it is written from a personal point of view which, in the accuracy of its observations and its humour, carries the ring of conviction rather than self-justification. It is also generous. The courts were not manned by dishonest or mercenary people, Sobchak claims. The majority of their personnel were honest and decent people. 'But the system as a whole, the entire mechanism of law enforcement agencies . . . has led to a perversion of the law and erosion of human rights for all - the accused, the investigators, and the judges themselves.' Making the point about the degradation of society another way, he quotes a Russian joke about the plumber called to fix a leak. 'Thank you very much for coming . . . There's a real deluge in the kitchen every night.' "I see,' responds the plumber, 'the system has to be changed.' 'Will it cost much?' asks the anxious tenant. 'Who said anything about money? I said the whole system has to be changed'. Sobchak is not harsh on Gorbachev and certainly does not condemn him either as a traitorous General-Secretary or a radical dictator. He believes anyone would have to be either a zealot or a madman to retain faith in communist ideals which, all over the world, have led to such inhuman regimes. He judges the former leader as a statesman to whom both politics and ideology are simply means. 'When you start seeing only what's wrong,' a theatre producer told him, 'take a pill and go to bed.' Sobchak remains very much awake. He believes in a Russia populated by prosperous, property-owning democrats who choose to belong to a confederation of self-governing republics. The only question is how to get there. His account of A New Russia suggests that if he were running for office here in Britain Mr Sobchak would be elected by a landslide. Fortunate the country that can produce such men in such hard times.</p>

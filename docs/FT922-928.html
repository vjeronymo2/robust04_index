			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: AMB seeks a solution to its BfG poser - A look at problems facing Germany's second largest insurer OVER recent weeks, bankers and insurance executives have been holding secret meetings in Paris and Frankfurt. At stake is the fate of BfG Bank, Germany's sixth-biggest private commercial bank - and ultimately the independence of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), majority owner of BfG and Germany's second largest insurance group. AMB is under siege from Assurances Generales de Paris (AGF), a state - owned French insurance company which has amassed a 25 per cent plus holding in AMB. Exploiting an arcane aspect of German company law, AMB's management has refused to register the votes attaching to the majority of the AGF stake. Although relations between AGF and AMB are in public far from cordial, the two parties are holding behind-the - scenes talks in which the fate of the loss-making BfG Bank plays a central role. Last week, Mr Wolf - Dieter Baumgartl, chief executive of AMB, met Mr Michel Albert, president of AGF, in Paris. Also attending the meeting were representatives of Credit Lyonnais, the big state-owned French bank. Thereafter, high - level talks have taken place in Germany. It is thought that AGF is trying to broker a deal whereby Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, buys a stake in BfG. This would suit everybody. It would remove pressure on AMB to carry on supporting its banking subsidiary. In return for this favour, AMB management could be expected to come to a compromise over AGF's voting rights. The big French bank would gain access to the German market. While other big German banks reported record profits for last year, the BfG parent bank announced on Tuesday that it lost DM277m (Dollars 175.3m) in 1991, compared with a profit of DM338m in 1990, reflecting rationalisation costs and the bank's exposure to problem country debt. Mr Paul Wieandt, BfG's chief executive and architect of its restructuring in recent years, has made no secret that he would welcome an international banking partner - and that the financially-strong Credit Lyonnais would be a good choice. For its part, AMB has made it clear that in principle it would welcome a reduction of its commitment to the bank. AMB bought its majority stake in BfG in 1987 for DM1.9bn. The idea was to develop BfG - then known as the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft - as a banking outlet for its insurance products. It got more than it bargained for. For a complex series of reasons, BfG soon proved to a serious drain on AMB's resources. It was inefficient and had to engage in costly rationalisation. It had high exposure to problem sovereign debt, requiring increasingly heavy provisions. It was also involved in the costly rescue of Co op, the retailer which nearly went bankrupt in 1989. The net result is that in 1990 and 1991 AMB - together with BGAG, the trades union holding company which holds the balance of BfG shares - had to inject a total of DM1.5bn into the bank. It seems certain that BfG requires a further capital injection, despite signs of an improvement in operating performance at the bank last year. On Tuesday, Mr Wieandt said that after exceptional and extraordinary costs and revenues, the parent bank made a partial operating profit - that is, excluding own-account trading results - of DM60m last year, compared with a loss of DM259m in 1990. However, he made it clear that the bank's difficulties were not yet over, partly because further rationalisation is required, partly because of the bank's high exposure to problem country debt. That exposure - to a total of 32 countries - stands at DM3.3bn and the intention is to increase provisions from 51 per cent of this sum at the end of last year to 60 per cent by the end of this year. Mr Wieandt indicated that the bank's equity capital may need a boost of at at least a further DM450m, to make sure that the bank can continue to expand its lending under tougher capital adequacy rules. Market sources suggest that the shareholders may have to inject a further DM400m, mainly to help the bank increase its provisioning. According to Mr Wieandt, the bank is unlikely to be able to stand entirely on its own feet until 1994. This means that there is a considerable economic incentive for AMB to come to an agreement with Credit Lyonnais and AGF in the months ahead.</p>

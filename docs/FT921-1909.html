			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / As They Say In Europe: Milton Keynes for thrills IT HAS been one of those weeks when one feels nothing has happened in western Europe and when the most interesting article was about the English new town, Milton Keynes, on its 25th anniversary, in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung. More of that later. But the great debates continue and the most instructive is that started by the 'D-Mark nationalists' in Germany. The question is, why only now, well after the Bonn government signed the Maastricht treaty binding it to European Monetary Union, are the Germans having serious doubts about the project? Last year Britain was riven by EMU: today the topic plays no role in the election campaign, and it is the Germans who are split. It is the fault of the German press that the debate never got off the ground before the decisive steps were taken. The left-wing papers had little interest in the symbols of German nationalism - and the DM is the symbol par excellence, while the papers of the right were anxious to support the government at any cost. This created strains. At Handelsblatt, the leading German business daily, editorial policy was steered from Brussels. Continental correspondents at the European Commission all go native on arrival. But the paper's international editor, Dr Klaus Engelen, had different ideas. To call Engelen outspoken would be to do him an injustice, but he failed to get his employers to change their minds. So he has gone into print at home and abroad stating his views: 'I cannot believe that by 1997 or 1999 the Germans will give up their Deutschemark and allow the Bundesbank - a cornerstone and an essential feature of their very successful economic, social and political system - to be dissolved in a new European supranational institution, the European Central Bank' is the sentence which turns up everywhere. But what if he is wrong and it is all too late? The editor-in-chief of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Dieter Schroder argued that Germany's leaders had not calculated that 'the groundswell of the new German nationalism could only be strengthened when the fear was nourished that the highest good of the nation, the Mark, was going to be sacrificed on the altar of Europe.' But, said Schroder, the new public display of German nationalism had to be conducted in a manner that would not to frighten the foreigners. They assumed that the Maastricht Treaty could not be wrecked by the Germans - 'That would be a national and historic tragedy which would isolate Germany for a long period and do considerable damage to the process of European unity.' The conclusion was a bit lame - 'we must not burden the debate with unrealistic demands and European 'Don Quixoteries.'' For once it seems the British government got things right: European Monetary Union is far too difficult a subject to be settled now. It is a pity that Mr Major and his colleagues may not have much opportunity to savour this curious victory. One hope that the government has of retaining power in this election is to be found in Milton Keynes. It is the one constituency that has, amoeba-like, split into two for this election, thereby delivering another Tory to the House of Commons. That is probably the most interesting thing that has happened in the 25 year history of the town so it was appropriate that it should figure in the paper that strives to avoid the title of Europe's most interesting daily, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung. 'Milton Keynes - the English Utopia?' was the headline for Charles Ritterband's piece. He was particularly impressed by the railway station; 'The Keynesians are as proud of it as are the Gullener family when they come into money in Durenmatt's play 'The Visit,' proud that all express trains stop there between London and the great cities of the north.' Ritterband has done more research on 'MK' than anybody in England: 'The legend runs that Milton Keynes is named after the writer John Milton as well as the economist John Maynard Keynes. Legions of speechmakers have extolled Milton's democratic spirit and the pathbreaking research of Keynes as the inspiration behind the town . . . But it is all nonsense.' In fact, it emerges, Milton Keynes got its name from the original village. 'But where that village got its name, nobody knows.' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

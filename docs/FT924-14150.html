			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: A house in fine order - Theatre Garcia Lorca was killed on 19 August, 1936, by the fascist paramilitary Black Squad. He was 38. He had finished writing La Casa de Bernada Alba that June, concluding the folk trilogy he began in 1933 with Bodas de sangre and which he continued with Yerma in 1934; Bernada Alba was first performed in Madrid in 1945. The Gate Theatre, Notting Hill, has staged a tense, powerful production, using Matthew Banks' sinewy translation of Lorca's all-women play. The small theatre refashions the claustrophobia of Lorca's mis en scene: a hacienda, walls dark in the midday heat, shafts of light striking into the gloom. To start, the house of Alba is in black, mourning for Bernada's husband. Bernada has a social station to maintain, five daughters to marry. She tyrannises them: 'I have to fight tooth and nail to keep them tame and decent.' Inside, the daughters sew, plait, and mourn; outside, men pass by, singing, working: 'needle and thread for the women, mule and whip for the men.' According to custom, Bernada's eldest becomes betrothed; but the man loves the youngest daughter, Adela. The middle daughter, Martirio, envies both. Outside swirls a violent, medieval world, with demands of fealty to church and society. A woman is stoned for bearing an illegitimate child. Everything out there proves Bernada right in protecting her daughters as she does. She may appear to be a conduit for men's violence and sexuality rolling down the generations to swamp her daughters; but her viciousness is also her own. The unspoken issue is the oppression of women by men, and of women by each other. This speaks to the 1990s: for as gender becomes sect, great oppression is now gathering in the name of egality. Katie Mitchell's intelligent, emphatic direction allows the play to express itself metaphorically. It speaks of marriage, sexuality, and the constraints and commitments of community. Bernada's house, isolated and xenophobic, is 1930s Spain, run on violence and tyranny. The malaise of the daughters suggests the deeper waste in Spanish society. The sexuality which smashes the social bonds hints at Lorca's own homosexuality. Dinah Stabb as Bernada, Alexandra Gilbreath as Adela, and Kristin Hewson as Martirio act with great tact and assurance, and provide the play's hard core. Ben Livingstone (music) should have chosen something more Iberian-Catholic than Bach's St Matthew Passion to punctuate the acts.

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Pitfalls in pursuit of quality standard Sir, A large proportion of the work of this consultancy is with clients who have achieved BS5750 accreditation - and little else besides. Unless the opportunity is taken to implement a culture change at the same time, then the exercise is likely to produce only a manual. It is not just a 'management exercise', and few companies take the trouble actively to involve the sharp end who actually make the quality. Finance and administration departments are only marginally involved. Measurement is also lacking - how do you know you are getting better unless you know where you are and where you are going? Any company rejecting suppliers only because they do not have accreditation needs to reassess their purchasing strategy. Peter Edwards, Peter Edwards Consultancy, 55 Beverley Road, Royal Leamington Spa</p>

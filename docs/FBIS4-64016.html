			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin's package of six economic decrees  is neither a revolution nor a landmark the policy of reforms,  let alone the second stage of reforms, Russian deputy Pavel  Bunich of the Russia's Choice faction, himself a leading  economist, told Interfax. At the same time, he said they  indicated a number of small steps forward and were positive as  such. But Bunich thinks their effects could be felt only in the  next year's budget. By then, he stressed, appropriate laws will  have been adopted to enshrine the measures indicated in the  package.    Bunich thinks that the package was intended only to declare  some changes in the course of economic reforms.    Deputy Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr Vengerovskiy of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] told Interfax that LDP economists  would outline their own vision of economic reforms and their  attitude to the president's package at a news conference in  Moscow on Friday.    As for himself, Vengerovskiy thinks that the  package-envisaged measures are "largely forced ones, though  positive on the whole".    One other LDP deputy Vladimir Lisichkin, himself an  economist, has praised the package though not the measures it  set out "are belated and should have been taken a year ago".    He said LDP was opposed only to one of the six decrees,  notably the one lifting export quotas and licences. He said the  measure aimed at liberalizing foreign trade and called for by  Yegor Gaydar last year but rejected by the Liberal Democrats was  nothing but a follow up of the shock treatment of the economy.    In the absence of a legislative basis, the measure will  cause  further flight of capital to other countries to back up their  economies rather than Russia's, Lisichkin believes.    For his part, Vladimir Semago of the Communist Party said  that many of the package's points that the opposition raised  during 1991-1993 were reflected in his party's economic recovery  plan.    The president is clearly moving into our camp and the only  thing that prevents us from accepting him, he said, is the  absence of his announcement about early elections and his own  resignation.    At the same time, Semago is opposed to serious economic  decisions being taken by splashing out a series of decrees. He  said such decisions must be legislated after passing through  Duma committees.    He accused Yeltsin of pretending to have forgotten whatever  negative was done. He now pretends to have a new inspiration,  new aides and to be moving forward which nothing but a cunning  game, Semago believes.</p>

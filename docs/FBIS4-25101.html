			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  Air Force last month took delivery of the first of four E-2T  airborne early warning aircraft it purchased from the United  States, and is scheduled to receive the remaining three before  the end of November, a ranking Air Force official said Saturday  [4 June].    "The arms deal is proceeding as scheduled," Air Force  Major-General Lin Yu-ching, deputy chief of staff of the Air  Force General Headquarters, said during a report to the  Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee.    The Air Force has sent 33 servicemen to the US to prepare  for  the commission of the four aircraft, Lin said, adding that  another 72 will be sent to the US later.    Lin also countered reports that the four planes are out of  date. The US, he said, responded favorably to Taiwan's request  for four E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft in 1991, but  demanded that some parts from the older E-2B be used in the  planes. The change was made to comply with the 1987 Shanghai  Communique, which governs relations between the US and Mainland  China.    The legislature earlier approved a Ministry of National  Defense budget of NT [new Taiwan] $5.2 billion (US$192.6  million) for the purchase of the four aircraft.</p>

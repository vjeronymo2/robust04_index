			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Justinian: The appealing laws of cricket Sport and the law are not natural bedfellows. Where they do meet, in the enforcement of the rules of the game and codes of conduct, they need careful nurturing, as the public row between the umpire and the Pakistan captain in the third test match at Old Trafford with England amply demonstrated. When the administrators of a game stray from imposing instantaneous decision-making on the field of play according to simple rules, they flounder in providing any kind of satisfaction to players, the instant audience and the wider sport loving public. Traditionally, all sports have been controlled by a referee or an umpire (two in cricket) who interpreted the rules of the game with an unfettered discretion and without any questioning from those ruled upon. Until recently, a batsman given out accepted his fate gracefully and departed the crease instantly; the most that he might do would be to stand his ground while umpires conferred on whether a catch had been made. Nowadays, however, dissent creeps into the game. Modern technology in the form of action replay on a television screen provides the instant or delayed opportunity for demonstrating the incorrectness of an umpire's decision. And the commercialism of the sport, upon which so much depends for individual players, serves only to feed the appetite for challenging the verdict. Since the umpire's decision cannot sensibly or in practice be reversed, any injustice of a palpably wrong decision rankles and causes friction both on and off the field. Alongside the heightened importance of winning and not losing is the complication of the rules under which the game is played. The interpretation of rules about bowling bouncers led the Pakistan fast bowler, Aqib Javed, to exhibit petulance towards umpire Roy Palmer. The umpire had warned him, as he was empowered to do, for intimidatory bowling at Devon Malcolm, his opposite batsman. In days gone by, any such impetuous dissent would have been passed off as of no moment or the bowler's captain would have intervened - not as Javed Miandad did, to take up his team mate's cudgels - to administer a friendly warning that untoward behaviour on the field was not tolerable. Any disciplining of a player by his captain or team manager would have been dispensed later, off the field. But cricket captains nowadays are sometimes less commanding figures than of yesteryear. We may mourn the passing of the days when umpires and captains were able to maintain order on the field, and players contained any frustration they might have felt at wrong decisions. For there is usually a law of averages operative in which one player given out is likely to be balanced by a team mate being lucky to survive a just appeal. Those halcyon days can be revived only if the administrators of cricket stand firm and proclaim that the umpires have absolute control of the game, including if necessary, the power to send the player off the field for any serious infringement of the rules of the game or other misbehaviour. But, alas, cricket administrators have responded predictably to some process of adjudication external to the play. In doing so, they have failed to appreciate what regulations and rule-enforcement can usefully provide to assist an orderly game. They have not heeded the advice which lawyers could give. The international cricketing authorities have adopted a familiar technique of appointing a match referee who may conduct a post mortem on some incident that has not been immediately resolved on the field. Hence Conrade Hunte, a well-respected West Indian cricketer of the past, had to pronounce on the propriety of Roy Palmer's umpiring decision on intimidatory bowling; Aqib Javed's unseemly outburst at being warned; and at Javed Miandad's undiplomatic intervention. The match referee's verdict was almost wholly un-satisfactory. The bowler was deservedly fined. His captain inexplicably escaped unscathed with merely a pointed request to exercise leadership in the field in the future. Unaccountably, a request in similar vein was made to England's captain. Worse followed. Pakistan's manager, Intikhab Alam, responded to the situation by making an unwarranted allegation that the umpire, at the end of the over, had thrown, not handed, Aqib Javed's sweater to him, suggesting 'persecution' of the Pakistan team by an English umpire. If it is considered sensible to inject a post-match system of regulation, much more attention needs to be paid to procedures and the mode of decision-making. Cricketers who are subjected to this off-the-field process, involving potential criticism and even disciplining, will rightly call for proper avenues of representation before the match referee gives his verdict. And the referee's decision must be properly reasoned if satisfaction to those involved is to be achieved. This means that match referees will need to be appointed according to their abilities as adjudicators as well as for cricketing expertise, and not solely for their past cricketing prowess.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (9): At the heart of the wealth-belt - Germany WESTERN GERMAN business and industry invested more than DM140bn outside its own borders during the 1980s, while foreigners moving into Germany spent a mere DM30bn. At the start of the decade the ratio of fixed capital exports to imports was 3:1 and the position had deteriorated to 6:1 by 1990. Doomsayers among the industrial elite began warning once again that Standort Deutschland was in danger. They argued that potential investors, domestic as well as foreign, were bypassing western Germany to avoid the highest wage costs in the European Community, heavy corporate and personal taxes, rigid labour practices, excessive holidays and environmental charges, and bloody-minded bureaucracy. Possibly even more seriously, the same factors were now preventing the recovery of the collapsed east German industry. Such disincentives to investment were said to be outweighing the established and recently enhanced advantages: a rich domestic market expanded by unification to 80m people, political stability, a highly-skilled and disciplined workforce. Germany also provides a business base in the centre of the European Community's wealth-belt ' 40 per cent of European Community consumers live within a day's drive of Dusseldorf ' and next door to huge potential markets to the east. However, the complaints took no account of the fact that in some respects the investment situation had actually improved. The volume of capital invested in Germany by other European Community countries more than doubled during the decade to DM46bn. Meanwhile, the proportion of new German foreign investments made inside the Community had risen to more than two-thirds. A large part of the increasing imbalances of recent times can therefore be accounted for by strategic shifts spurred on by the impending opening of the European single market and the determination of German industry, relatively secure in its own markets, to maintain and improve its position community-wide. Even so, historical trends tend to support the complainants' fundamental thesis that Germany's competitiveness is threatened by the factors in their 'hit-list', and the government has at last started to take them seriously. A special study commissioned by the economics ministry earlier this year complained that industry's charges were repetitive and often exaggerated. However, it added, 'the warning signals should be taken seriously' because they reflected the real fears of German business. At DM40 an hour, labour costs in west German manufacturing are the highest in the world, and compare with DM23 in Britain, DM27 in France next door, and DM29 in Japan. The average working week is heading steadily downwards towards 35 hours. All industrial workers are entitled to 30 days' paid holiday. Bonn has duly undertaken to play its part: it has promised to cap state spending to avoid over-burdening capital markets and avert the need to increase taxes and social charges. Finance ministry plans to reform corporate taxation have recently been approved by cabinet, and the first steps have been taken towards privatising uncompetitive state monopolies such as Deutsche Telekom and job centres. In addition, the government proposes to offer compensatory relief to companies hit by Germany's restrictive environmental policies. It is now mainly up to employers and unions to find a way through the maze of rigid pay and conditions deals which are widely acknowledged as the most telling constraint on industry in the west, and which has emerged as a severe threat to the attractions of eastern Germany to investors both foreign and domestic. Average pay levels in the former GDR are still around 50 per cent of those in the west, but skilled manufacturing rates are much higher and scheduled to match those in the west by 1994. Meanwhile, productivity in the east is less than 40 per cent of the western level and although official unemployment rates vary between 12 per cent and 14 per cent, around half the former GDR workforce has no productive job. Such distortions were probably inevitable as the east rushed to adjust after 40 years locked in the communists' economic dream world, but the process has been eased by the equally rapid development of the GDR infrastructure. Paid for by the transfer of DM150bn a year in government funds and heavy industrial investment, large swathes of the east have already been transformed in just two years. The cramped road network has been opened up, rail links improved, telephone, gas and power lines replaced. However, many old problems remain: potential investors are still hampered by unresolved questions of ownership of land and buildings, some seized by the Nazis, the rest by their communist inheritors. The environmental burdens in old industrial centres blight investment prospects. But as these obstacles are cleared away, and the new owners of some 7,000 Treuhand companies privatised in the past two years implement pledges to invest at least DM150bn, new difficulties have emerged. International recession, now creeping into western Germany, has dampened industry's will and ability to invest in the five new federal states. The emergence of extremist violence has depressed it even further. The full-scale resumption of Bonn's 'Upswing East' project is likely to have to wait until international economic and domestic social order are restored.</p>

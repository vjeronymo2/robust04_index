			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Cambon: "European Union Summit--Algeria on </F> the Agenda"]    [Text] Algeria is on the agenda of today's European Union  [EU] Council. But while EU members, on the initiative of  France, are ready to help sort out the country's problems in  order to prevent Islamists from achieving their aims, they  expect authorities in Algiers to implement both financial and  political reforms.    The events in Algeria will be discussed today in Brussels at  the meeting of the 12 European foreign ministers. A few days  before an Algerian delegation is due to fly to Washington to  negotiate the rescheduling of the country's external debt (some  $26 billion) with the IMF, the Europeans are expected to  reaffirm their opposition to terrorism, to condemn human rights  abuse, and to insist on the need for democratic dialogue and the  urgent implementation of economic reforms that include solving  the debt problem with the IMF. If such conditions are met, the  EU is expected to confirm its commitment to assisting the  Algerians in their national rescue operation.    There is still some way to go before reaching that stage,  however. And European diplomatic circles -- including French  ones -- can barely conceal a measure of embarrassment. "We are  not breathing down the neck of Algiers authorities. However,  the way the government is working there must be reformed," says  a diplomat. In the meantime, the French Government seems ready  to renew in 1994 a financial protocol at least equal to that of  1993, which was worth Fr6.35 billion, 90 percent of which was  effectively used by Algerians. There also is hope that if an  agreement with the IMF is reached, Algeria may benefit from $4  to $5 billion in immediate aid.    EU circles in Brussels also indicate that, since 1978,  Europeans have continually offered Algeria a project-related  financial assistance whose ceiling was gradually increased  through the years, but which was used...less and less by the  Algerian authorities. To such an extent that only 12 percent of  the ECU239 million granted for the 1987-1991 period was actually  drawn on. As for the ECU350 million allocated for 1992-1996, it  has not yet been touched.  <H5>  Emergency </H5>   This is the proof of the Algerian Government's impotence and  the gradual decay of the country's economy, whose imports have  been halved since 1986. Today, the noose is getting dangerously  tight around Algeria's neck due to the country's political  inability to acknowledge the need to reschedule its external  debt.    Today, taking action has become more urgent than ever. Oil  prices have dropped by about 25 percent since last summer. For  1994, debt service will total $9 billion while export revenues  (derived mostly from oil and gas) are not expected to exceed  this same figure.    "Failure to reach an agreement with the IMF would mean a  total collapse of the economy," stated Algerian Economy Minister  Mourad Benachenhou recently. The IMF requirements for a  structural adjustment program have long been known: devaluation  of the dinar by at leat 30 percent, or even 50 percent; drastic  reduction of the budget deficit; and a wider opening of the  Algerian market to foreign competition. The latter requirement  may increase the difficulties of the uncompetitive local  industry, whose industrial output is less than 50 percent of  production capacity, and inflate the jobless rate in a country  which already has more than 2 million unemployed.    A particularly bitter, albeit an inevitable, pill that  already has the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers)  howling; Abdelbak Benhamuda, its general secretary, has  condemned "the groveling before the IMF" and threatened a  "general uprising" that would stem from the soaring price of  basic food products, of which there is already a near shortage.    Shortly after taking office, Algeria's President General  Zeroual is already caught between undeterred Islamic terrorists  and the danger of a social explosion comparable to the tragic  one Algeria experienced in 1988.</p>

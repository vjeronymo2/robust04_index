Redman was accompanied by Ambassador to Croatia  Peter Galbraith. The meeting was also attended by Jure Radic,  head of the president's office. Ambassador Redman informed the  president about positive U.S. attitudes toward the convergence  of Croatian and Muslim stands regarding the securing of a  cease-fire and the implementation of a final solution in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He supported Croatia's approach based on a peaceful solution  and promised the international community's support in protecting  the Croatian areas that are under siege at the moment. He  stressed in particular the United States' readiness and resolve  to contribute -- in parallel with resolving the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis -- to the establishment of the full  sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia in all areas within its  internationally recognized borders, urging the opening of  communications, and restoration of economic links.    President Tudjman thanked the ambassador and the U.S.  Government for their constructive and active role in resolving  the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

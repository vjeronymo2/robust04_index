			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: Sofia Phil faces the future - Roderic Dunnett talks to the orchestra's conductor Emil Tabakov Bulgaria's leading orchestra, the Sofia Philharmonic, is currently visiting England playing Berlioz, Debussy, Ravel and Mahler at a series of larger provincial venues, climaxing next week with an appearance at Birmingham's Symphony Hall. Under communism, classical music flourished. Sofia's state-salaried opera (Boris Christoff was one of its more famous alumni) throve under a series of conductors, including Emil Tchakarov, who made famous recordings of Mussorgsky shortly before his tragic death two years ago at the age of only 43. The 120-strong Philharmonic regularly plays to capacity audiences at its home base, the 1920s-built Sofia Hall, which boasts one of the best acoustics in Bulgaria. But while politically this may be an auspicious time, financing an orchestra in the former Eastern Europe following Communism's demise is no simple matter. Emil Tabakov, the Philharmonic's Chief Artistic Director and Principal Conductor since 1988, makes no bones about it: 'Cultural life was better under communism,' he says, 'simply because there was an adequate budget. The state made good provision. Our dilemma now is that in the present rush to make money nobody cares sufficiently about culture. The support - both moral and financial - has withered.' The present extended UK tour was set up by London-based firm IMG Artists, liaising with a former Bulgarian State Concert Agency administrator, Nelly Lalova, who has launched her own fledgling private agency. IMG meets all the bills; orchestra and conductor receive expenses and a guaranteed fee. 'Orchestral salaries are still paid by the government, but they're very low  -not enough with inflation (up to 100 per cent recently on some basic commodities). Despite a recent salary rise, players' basic pay is still only around Lv2,500 or Lv3,000 (Pounds 70) a month. So recording and tours are crucial to supplement players' incomes.' Discussions under way with the best-selling Sheffield-based record company, Naxos, could prove a boon. The long term answer may lie in commercial sponsorship from the newly-burgeoning private sector in Bulgaria. 'Everywhere in the west we see commercial sponsorship as the norm,' says Tabakov. 'But we lack this experience of how to go about getting sponsors. We need time to accustomise. Our law still isn't geared up to independent sponsorship of the arts: the relevant bill has yet to be voted through parliament. 'Many people in Bulgaria - new private industry, some of the professions, the banks - sense the value of promoting themselves via the arts. But they will hold back till they can see the tax advantages. We urgently need this legislation: when it comes, it will be good for musicians and good for everyone.' Son of a Bulgarian lawyer, Tabakov studied double-bass in northern Bulgaria and took up the baton at 18. While a student he conducted his local symphony orchestra at Ruse, moving on to the Sofia Chamber Soloists. He graduated to the Philharmonic in 1985, becoming its musical director soon after. As a young string player, he encountered many of the outstanding conductors from both east and west. Watching and listening, he insists, remain as important as any part of a young conductor's training. There are other problems. Some 60 players - virtually half the orchestra - have moved in the past three years, many to seek better-paid work abroad. 'Just about every German orchestra has at least two Bulgarian players; likewise Italy, France and Spain. We have good youngsters emerging from the music academies, but they lack experience. Low salaries prevent us attracting Western orchestral players, any more than we can afford top soloists or conductors.' Is he pessimistic? 'I'm naturally pessimistic, but we have to work at the problem and solve it. The sponsorship possibilities now look good. Once the tax law is agreed, I think we have a lot to offer. Our subscription concerts and the Sofia Music Weeks in May and June are all high profile events which attract a large proportion of Bulgaria's professional people. We can not only promote a sponsor's name at home, splashing it all over Sofia Hall and around the city, but on our foreign tours - to the UK, Germany, the US and Japan. That gives me some optimism for the future.' Is he not tempted abroad himself? 'Well, yes, I am. I have regular commitments, not just in Europe but the Far East, South America and the US. But I try to make the Philharmonic my number one priority, and give it all the attention it needs. The first task is to keep the orchestra together, and its standards high. The key thing is that musical life in Bulgaria is not dead. These are difficult days, but we carry on doing our best. Each problem calls for a different solution. But we will manage to resolve them. Musicians are resilient people, you know.' The Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra performs at Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Monday, November 8 and goes on tour untill November 12.

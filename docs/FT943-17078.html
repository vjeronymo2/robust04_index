			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Space station plan survives vote The planned US space station survived a critical vote in the House of Representatives by a wide margin late on Wednesday, but the Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.7bn) project may have to trimmed back when it comes before the Senate, writes Jeremy Kahn. After intensive lobbying by the administration, the full House voted 278-155 to defeat an amendment to kill the programme. Many feared killing the station would be a death blow for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has been hard hit by congressional budget hawks in recent years. Opponents say the station is 'too much money for too little science'.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Blagden tumbles to Pounds 3m PROFITS of Blagden, the packaging and chemicals group, fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 3.04m pre-tax for the 25 weeks ended June 27. Turnover was lower at Pounds 116.9m, against Pounds 118.1m. With a need for 'prudent husbanding' of group resources the interim dividend is cut from 4.5p to 1.5p. Earnings declined to 2.7p (7.3p). Turnover and pre-tax profits benefited by Pounds 10.2m and Pounds 600,000 respectively from the devaluation of sterling. Profits also included Pounds 617,000 from the sale of property. The directors said comparison with the second half of 1992 was more meaningful when turnover of Pounds 111.8m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.63m were achieved. They said set against these results the performance of the first half of 1993 pointed to a significant recovery. Operating profits of the packaging division fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4.06m while those from chemicals declined from Pounds 2.14m Pounds 1.44m.</p>

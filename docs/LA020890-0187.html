			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BID BY PARENTS TO BAN GRADE SCHOOL TEXTS  FAILS  </P> <P> An attempt by a group of fundamentalist Christians to have a controversial  series of grade school readers banned in Redondo Beach has failed as the city's  elementary school trustees voted unanimously this week to retain the texts.  </P> <P> The decision capped several months of intense lobbying by opponents of the  Impressions series, who said the books promote satanism and include stories  that are inappropriate for youngsters.  </P> <P> The series has been under fire in a number of California school districts,  including the Hacienda La Puente Unified and East Whittier City school  districts, where trustees voted to shelve the books. But Redondo Beach trustees  had said from the outset that they viewed the effort to ban the books as an  attempt at censorship.  </P> <P> Members of the local Coalition of Concerned Parents -- formed by members of the  fundamentalist Hope Chapel -- said they plan to work against the trustees in  the next election, and will put their children in private school.  </P></p>

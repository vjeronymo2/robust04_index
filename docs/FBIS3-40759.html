Correspondents from Reuter, Agence France-Presse, the XINHUA  Chinese news agency, Reuter [sic], the Spanish press agency, the  WTN television network, and periodicals such as SAWT AL-SHA'B  [VOICE OF THE PEOPLE], AL-DUSTUR, AL-SHAYHAN of Jordan, a  representative of the Iraqi Press Agency, and an Associated  Press photographer, came to view the conditions of citizens  residing in the al-Huwayzah marshes in the governorates.    The marsh inhabitants expressed, in chants and songs, their  love and loyalty to the wise leadership of President Saddam  Husayn, and their gratitude for his glorious guidance, in order  to achieve the finest free and honorable way of life.    They asserted their absolute readiness to defend great Iraq  and the unity of his citizens, and to thwart all the imperialist  and Zionist plots aimed at harming the unity of the citizens of  Iraq, their present and their future.    They condemned the criminal sanctions imposed by the forces  of evil and hostility on the heroic citizens of Iraq, which  violated all divine and human standards and laws.    The representative of the Iraqi Press Agency said that the  marsh inhabitants made clear to the reporters their opposition  to the continued acts of provocation committed by certain  infiltrators from Iran to commit acts of aggression and  interference against them. They asked that their voices be heard  by world public opinion when they sought a halt to the course  pursued by the rulers of Iran, their violation of good  neighborly relations, and their infringement on the freedom of  others. They called upon the Iranians to cease these practices,  which are blatant aggression against defenseless citizens.    They also demanded the exposure of the fraud and false  claims  of the hostile media, which are aimed at fracturing the unity of  the Iraqis and creating dissension among them. They reaffirmed  that their living conditions are normal, stable, and safe.</p>

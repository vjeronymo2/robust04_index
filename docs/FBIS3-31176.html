			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tirana, February 10 (ATA) -- Serbian authorities  have recently ordered the banning of 20 book shops and the book  hall surroundings in Pristine. There have been 40 book shops in  Pristine but now there are 6 or 7 where the booksellers are  Serbian or Montenegrin and only publications in Serbian-Croat  language can be bought.    The present attack is not the first one against the Albanian  book. The chauvinistic Serbian insanity is going on and it is  trying to destroy everything in the Albanian culture and art  fields.</p>

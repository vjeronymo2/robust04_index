			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin, in meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry  Kissinger here today, said that world peace and stability call  for improved Sino-U.S. relations, which are not restricted only  to bilateral dimensions, but closely linked with the  international situation.    In the 70-minute meeting, Jiang said that Kissinger, with  the  foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, has  always worked for the development of Sino-U.S. relations.    Discussing the world situation, Jiang noted that after the  end of the cold war, the multi-polarization of the world  structure is increasing, with the international situation moving  towards relaxation and economic interests becoming a leading  factor for the development of international relations.    "It represents the common wish of all peoples in the world  to  seek relaxation of tensions, cooperation and progress," Jiang  said.    "However, the end of the cold war has not brought about  overall peace, and some regions suffer from turbulence and even  continuous wars," Jiang said, adding that such a situation has  aroused concern from across the world.    As two big nations that have international influence, China  and the United States "shoulder an important responsibility for  the future of the world and the fate of mankind," a Chinese  source quoted Jiang as saying.    After a review of the growth of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang  said that confrontation between China and the United States  benefits neither side, while cooperation brings benefits not  only to the two peoples, but to world peace in general as well.    Despite some disputes, problems or differences of one kind  or  another between the two countries, Sino-U.S. relations need to  be improved, Jiang said, calling this "the need for world peace  and stability."    Practice shows that Sino-U.S. relations have never been  restricted to bilateral dimensions alone, but are closely linked  with the international situation, Jiang said.    "When Sino-U.S. relations have enjoyed smooth growth, it has  always been when the two sides could overcome the differences in  social systems and concepts of values, proceed from the common  interests to develop mutually-beneficial cooperation on the  basis of mutual respect, practice non-interference in each  other's internal affairs and equality, and strive to expand  common ground," he noted.    In contrast, when those principles were violated and  ideological differences emphasized, in cases of imposing one's  own views upon the other side or even resorting to sanctions and  exerting pressure, Sino-U.S. relations have encountered  difficulties, set-backs or even retrogression, Jiang said,  calling those "profound historical lessons."    Jiang, noting that the development of Sino-U.S. relations is  facing a good opportunity at present, said that the two  countries should seize the opportunity to work together, in the  spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while  reserving differences, so as to ensure expansion of bilateral  ties along a healthy and normal track, as well as on the basis  of the three Sino- U.S. joint communiques.    Kissinger said that a friendly relationship between the  United States and China is essential for peace and stability in  Asia and the world at large. Also, he said he has always  opposed using the MFN [most-favored nation] status to exert  pressure on China and exerting pressure on China in general.    Kissinger said he hoped to see greater improvement of  u.S.-China relations, according to a Chinese official.</p>

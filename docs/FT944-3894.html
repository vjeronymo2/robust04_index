			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Lagoons with a view / Hawaii's 21st century resort Driving out of Honolulu airport, I remembered just in time not to turn right, as I had done a score of times, to head east into the city along the southern shore of the island of Oahu. That is what the torrent of tourists have always done, most of them flooding into the skyscraper blocks of Waikiki and its famous beach. Instead, making a left on to Highway 1, relaxing as the traffic thinned beyond Pearl Harbour, I was bound for West Oahu's bespoke city of the future, Kapolei, now rising out of a green cane-field site. Its new holiday area of Ko Olina is already plying for trade in the form of the sumptuous Ihilani Resort and Spa and its adjoining golf course. The fledgling city's procreator was a shrewd, adventurous Irish immigrant, James Campbell, who in 1879 sank a well into the then barren Ewa Plain. It uncorked a vast artesian water supply that was to feed prolific sugar plantations for many years. When Campbell died in 1900, leaving an estate worth Dollars 3m, his will began an intriguing tale that will reach its climax a century later. It stipulated that the estate remain intact, administered as a trust named The Estate of James Campbell, to be terminated 20 years after the death of the last of his four surviving daughters. Thus the death of Beatrice in 1987 triggered the distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries (though not necessarily liquidation) on January 20 2007. The value of the Campbell Estate has grown to more than Dollars 2bn, so that even now the heirs of the daughters share Dollars 40m annual profits. With the ending of sugar production in Campbell's corner of Oahu, its development could have meant uncaring urbanisation and despoilment of the rocky coast. Happily, today's four Estate trustees have proved visionaries. They declare that they have 'master-planned Kopolei . . . to create a balanced city . . . with a diversity of people'. They say they have created a self-contained community - not a dormitory - for Honolulu and are offering a different visitor experience for holidaymakers. Ko Olina should certainly do that. For many the Waikiki strip of downtown Honolulu will always appeal, with its high-rise, brash vitality, tacky stalls, elegant international big-name stores, and a crowded beach pervaded by the odour of coconut oil, which has survived the evolution of sun-tan cream into digital block. But one in five of the 6m visitors a year trek back to the airport at some stage for 20 or 30-minute flights to one or more of the so-called neighbour islands. They and others seeking a calmer, unspoilt setting, yet still within half-an-hour's drive of Honolulu, are fixed in the sights of the Ihilani. The other three planned hotels will follow its lead in promoting a 'neighbor island experience' without the hassle. The hotels are being set in four coves - lagoons in local parlance - carved into the coastline, providing crescent-shaped beaches and safe swimming. All will fit with Kopolei's image of quality. At an average of Dollars 365 a day, the Ihilani's capacious rooms are not aimed at the hoi polloi. Its Hawaiian name of Heavenly Splendor is a challenge it meets with style and luxury. It can provide a one-stop holiday with its large, circular swimming pool, four restaurants, each with its own cuisine, tennis club, children's programmes, a spa purveying every known form of pummelling and pampering, and the maturing Ted Robinson-designed golf course, built around masses of still and tumbling water. That is important. For, although Ko Olina is a small blob on the fringe of the Kapolei long-range master plan, the cranes and bulldozers are going to intrude on the city for a long time, as it develops into a spacious community of houses (for 75,000 people by the turn of the century), schools, university campus, commerce and light industry. The upside for Ko Olina's hotel guests is that they are going to benefit from Kapolei's provision of shopping and entertainment facilities, marinas and lots more golf courses - and from a planning philosophy that insists on extensive parks, many miles of cycleways and landscaped walkways, incorporation of traditional Hawaiian architectural styles and a bicycle park for every substantial building. Already a big shopping centre is open and a 16-screen, 3,300-seat cinema complex is on the way. A long-established luau garden, introducing visitors to Hawaiian customs and food, is being enlarged. The Ko Olina Express, a restored old sugar train, chugging along at 15mph, is proving popular. So is a plantation village demonstrating how the cane-field workers lived in the last century. Kapolei and Ko Olina may never rival Honolulu and Waikiki, but they will certainly be different.</p>

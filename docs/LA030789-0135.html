			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> RARE COVERAGE FOR RAISA GORBACHEV  </P> <P> The Soviet media gave Raisa Gorbachev some rare coverage today, carrying a  report on the Kremlin first lady's comments on her husband's reforms and how  the world's women have improved prospects for peace.  </P> <P> "If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we know that much  of the credit goes to women actively working on all continents for friendship,  cooperation and profound mutual understanding of nations," Raisa Gorbachev said  at a reception she gave Monday in honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet  holiday that will be celebrated Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although she is shown frequently on Soviet state-run television and has been  interviewed by Western reporters, her views are rarely reported in Soviet media  or heard by her fellow citizens.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg -- On the occasion of the 45th meeting of  the Sudeten Germans, German and Austrian politicians have called  on the Czech government to recognize the expulsion of the  Germans after World War II as an injustice. When awarded the  European Charlemagne Prize in Nuremberg today, Austrian Foreign  Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's Party) described the  expulsion as one of the "great unjust deeds" of this century.    Addressing about 200 participants, Mock rejected all efforts  to "justify the resettlement of the Sudeten Germans with  previous Nazi crimes." Also, its cannot be explained with the  argument of the "collective guilt" of the Germans, Mock  stressed. He stated that it is "quite understandable" that the  Sudeten Germans want to open a "new chapter" in the relationship  with their old home. The minister added: "I do not believe  that one should discard the sincere attempt to restore dialogue  as a 'provocation'." Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus used  this term when reacting to the invitation of the Sudeten Germans  to attend their meeting.    Theo Waigel, leader of the Christian Social Union and  finance  minister, stated: "The future between Germany and the Czech  Republic can only be shaped by the awareness of historical  truths." Prior to an entry into the European Union, the Czech  Republic must be willing to "accept the European house rules."  Reconciliation is not possible without the integration of the  Sudeten Germans.    The opening of the Whitsun meeting of the Sudeten Germans,  which will continue on Sunday, was disrupted by three German  women who described themselves as trade union activists. They  carried banners with the slogans "No to the Munich agreement"  and "Cheb must remain Czech." After some tussling, the women  were pushed out of the hall by ushers and are now facing charges  of illegally entering the hall. They pointed out that their  action was intended as a protest against the demands of the  Sudeten Germans.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NOTEBOOK: MUSICIAN SEGUES FROM ROCK TO RAYMOND CHANDLER  </P> <P> He's played music with a Go-Go and a Rolling Stone, but Jesse Sublett is making  his reputation in the land of literature.  </P> <P> His second mystery novel, "Tough Baby," published by Viking, hit bookstores in  October, following last year's critically acclaimed debut effort, "Rock Critic  Murders." Each spotlights Martin Fender, a musician, who, like Sublett, mixes  careers. Fender also works for a collection agency. He reminds Sublett of the  bizarre characters he encounters in his frequent trips as a bass player on the  road.  </P> <P> "Musicians are very similar to crime detectives," said Sublett, 36, of North  Hollywood. "These are people who are too weird to do anything else."  </P> <P> Sublett puts himself in that category. After years of playing music in Texas --  he formed the Skunks rock group -- he moved to Los Angeles in 1987 because  "that's where Raymond Chandler lived." He joined a group led by Go-Go Kathy  Valentine and wrote songs. And he soon discovered that his passion for writing,  always secondary to his musical pursuits, could be more than a hobby.  </P> <P> "Since I was a kid, I loved writing," he said, "and I soon realized it was a  viable thing."  </P> <P> "Rock Critic Murders" was nominated for the Private Eye Writers of America's  Shamus Award, and Viking printed 12,000 copies of "Tough Baby." He is busy  working on a third mystery novel, "Boiled in Concrete," due in August. He has  written two screenplays -- one has been optioned -- and hopes to write  mysteries that don't relate to the music industry.  </P> <P> Still, Sublett hasn't abandoned his musical career. Later this month, Demon  Records is scheduled to release a live album by the Carla Olson/Mick Taylor  Band recorded at the Roxy in March. Taylor used to be a Rolling Stone.  </P> <P> Sublett plays bass on the record. His song, "Who Put the Sting on the Honey  Bee," appears on the album and in "Tough Baby."  </P> <P> The careers sometimes mix in strange ways. "I was talking to Mick Taylor and he  told me he thinks Chandler is the best too. I almost passed out."  </P> <P> Sasch in Studio City has introduced a new weekly special on Sunday nights --  Alternative Music Night. Instead of the standard fare of rock-and-roll and Top  40 presented all week, the club, according to manager Mark Yandle, was looking  for a night to showcase New Wave/alternative performers.  </P> <P> "For months, we've known we wanted to be more than a rock-and-roll club,"  Yandle said. "And the response to our first night was incredible. People loved  hearing the original music."  </P> <P> When the concept debuted Oct. 21, a disc jockey played alternative records. In  the future, Yandle said, the club will present live performers offering all  kinds of music, including reggae and original dance material. All shows begin  at 9 p.m.; the club's cover charge is $7.  </P> <P> The Barn Dance will have a tribute Tuesday to Gram Parsons at the Palomino in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Parsons, who died of a drug overdose in 1973, would have been 44 next week.  Ronnie Mack, Barn Dance's host, credits Parsons with being a pioneer in country  rock. Parsons sang and played guitar, and his songs include "Sin City" and  "Devil in Disguise." Among the performers scheduled are Rosie Flores, James  Intveld, Dale Watson and Lucinda Williams. Barn Dance held a similar tribute  for Parsons last year.  </P></p>

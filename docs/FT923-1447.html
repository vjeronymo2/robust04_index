			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Egyptian reactor deal for Argentina THE Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority has awarded a contract to build the country's first nuclear reactor in more than 30 years to the Argentinian company Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP). Egypt's only existing nuclear plant, built by the Soviet Union in 1961 at Inshas (55km north-east of Cairo), is to be dismantled. INVAP won the tender for the 22MW research plant over rival bids from General Atomics, the US group, Atomic Energy of Canada, and a Franco-German consortium of Siemens and Framaton. Mr Maher Abaza, Egypt's minister of power and electricity, said the five-year project will cost Dollars 44.47m (Pounds 25.1m), plus Dollars 16.6m for sub-contracted construction and locally-manufactured components. Work on the first phase will begin before the end of the year.</p>

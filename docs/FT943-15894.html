			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Blair argues case for stronger EU links Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the Labour leadership, yesterday cast himself in the role of the discriminating pro-European by calling for a different but positive vision of the European Union's future. In his first detailed statement on an issue likely to dominate politics in the approach to the next general election, Mr Blair said the economic and political case for enhanced European co-operation had become stronger, not weaker. His comments came as the shadow cabinet decided not to oppose or seek to amend legislation due next week to provide for the entry into the EU of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. Party officials said there was no question of the party joining with Tory Euro-sceptics in any attempt to wreck the bill. In a speech to the Foreign Press Association Mr Blair rejected the 'false choice between a sort of bureaucratic federalism and a retreat into isolation'. Accusing the government of a 'minority mentality' which had left Britain participating in Europe without influence, he said the country needed a new self-confidence about its role. The alternative to isolationism was not a headlong rush into a pan-European state but 'a movement towards greater European co-operation, measured by what is practically sensible and publicly acceptable but where public opinion is led as well as followed'.</p>

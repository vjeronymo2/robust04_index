			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / EC seeks liability code for environmental damage THE European Commission yesterday started a new drive to establish an enforceable code of civil liability for damage to the environment. It adopted a green paper which highlights mechanisms which would ensure environmental damage is repaired, even in cases where precise legal blame for pollution is difficult to establish. The Commission is inviting written submissions on its 'communication' to the Council of Ministers (of the 12) by October, after which it will hold public hearings before framing any legislation. The Commission aim is to reinforce the principle that the 'polluter pays' - with the prospect of substantial financial damages acting as a disincentive to pollute - yet ensure that the costs will be manageable for industry. The paper underlines that the most prevalent system of 'fault-based liability' - requiring proven negligence of a liable party - is far from adequate. A causal link is difficult to establish; redress may be unfairly sought against the richest target under the most advantageous national legal system. The plethora of differing legal approaches among EC member states, moreover, threatens to fracture the single market; greater or lesser risk of liability for pollution under different regimes could come to constitute a distorting comparative advantage. The Commission would like to complement fault-based liability with so-called 'strict' liability, where no fault need be established. Officials say they now want to remedy a situation where much environmental risk will be impossible to insure against, and also avoid the pitfalls of the US Superfund for environmental damage, which they say has encouraged a litigation industry. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, would not be drawn on whether he would seek eventually to legislate at EC level, or create a framework for roughly analogous liability norms. 'We want a comparable set of instruments in all member states,' he said, but 'at this moment the Commission is not looking at anything; it is opening a debate.'</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (13): Easier on the gas - Aluminium cars are coming A UK Royal Commission report on environmental pollution, expressing concern at worsening air quality in urban areas, in October called for the fuel efficiency of the typical family car to be increased by 40 per cent over the next 11 years. It provided no concrete suggestions as to how this might be achieved. Motor industry chiefs immediately rejected the call as 'technically impossible'. What they really meant was that over that period cars could be made very much more frugal with fuel than they are now. But to come anywhere near the Commission's target would not only mean using all the technology and new materials now becoming available but would require cars to be made much more austere than even the greenest-minded driver could accept. There is a motor industry rule of thumb that if a car can be made 10 per cent lighter, it will go 6-7 per cent further per unit of fuel consumed. If electric windows, central locking, sunroofs, audio systems, air-conditioning and other non-essentials were to be tossed out - along with the mass of motor, servos, actuators and other hardware needed to operate them - a weight saving of around 25 per cent should be achievable. (The first Volkswagen Golf of 1974 weighed 250kg less than the 1,000kg of the current version.) The saving would be considerably higher yet if anti-lock brakes, airbag systems, side anti-intrusion bars and other recent safety innovations were abandoned. Without all this heavy equipment, fuel consumption would be further cut by being able to use a smaller engine and lightersuspension and wheels. Clearly, only the most militant environmentalist would advocate such a radical approach (particularly since some of the extra weight comprises catalytic converters for exhaust emissions). In energy efficiency terms, therefore, the new car of the year 2005 is much more likely to be a compromise. While all this heavy equipment will stay on board, fuel savings will come partly from further improvements in internal combustion engines, both petrol and diesel. Today's petrol engine, with multi-valves, fuel injection and electronic management already uses about one-third less fuel than a simpler, similarly-sized and carburettor-fed unit in a similar sized vehicle of the 1970s. But weight is the central factor - and the car of a decade hence seems set to shed lots of it thanks to a fierce 'battle for the bodyshell' being fought out between the steel and aluminium industries. Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary and Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) say that the revolutionary aluminium spaceframe body of Audi's recently-launched A8 luxury car is 40 per cent lighter than it would have been if made of steel. They also maintain that such lightweight bodies can be introduced cost-effectively in high-volume production cars within a decade. Steel makers from around the world have struck back by launching a collaborative project aimed at designing the lightest possible bodyshell using the latest, high-strength steels. They claim that a 20 per cent weight saving is possible by optimising current designs using current manufacturing systems, and that 35 per cent is achievable with all-new designs using the most advanced technology. Two weeks ago, Ford, the world's second biggest vehicle maker, and Aluminium Company of Canada (Alcan) reconfirmed their determination to ensure viable production of aluminium cars early in the next century. Initially, just like Audi's A8, Ford expects aluminium cars to make their appearance at the top of Ford's product range and only gradually filter down into cheaper, higher-volume cars, according to Mr Bill Stueff, manager of Ford's vehicle systems engineering. But an indication of the potential is provided by the AIV (aluminium-intensive vehicle) which the two companies are using as the showcase for their aluminium technology. It is 318kg (700lb) lighter than Ford's steel bodied Taurus/Mercury Sable model on which it is based and with which it shares almost identical equipment. The bodyshell is 182kg, a full 47 per cent lighter than the steel equivalent; the additional 126kg difference represents the 'knock-on' savings from smaller, lighter brakes and other components. Crucially, in Ford's view, the AIV and the processes developed by Alcan, Ford and a third partner, Ciba Polymers, allow it to be made mainly by conventional motor industry manufacturing methods, thereby avoiding the need for largescale investment in new plant and equipment. Alcan's 'AVT' (Aluminium Vehicle Technology) process uses a mixture of spot welding and bonding with a Ciba-developed epoxy adhesive to join sheet aluminium pressings. By welding and bonding, lighter gauges of aluminium can be used than would be the case with spot welding alone. That the partners are serious is in no doubt: to date Alcan alone has spent Dollars 100m on research with current annual spending running at Dollars 10m; Ford has invested Dollars 35m and a fleet of 40 AIVs are undergoing field trials. They are said to have exceeded 50,000 miles of rough usage and will be durability tested well beyond 100,000 miles. Many problems remain, such as the need to optimise vehicle design while remaining compatible with the plant and machinery that will still turn out steel cars for a very long time. Even Alcan admits that there will be a cost premium for such cars, although not too big to deter consumers. The aluminium producers acknowledge that they use much more more primary energy than the steel makers. But they maintain that the overall balance is tipped back in their favour by aluminium's easier recyclability and the on-road fuel savings. For example, with the 20 per cent fuel saving arising from a 25 per cent overall weight reduction, a mid-sized aluminium family car would use 600 gallons less fuel over 100,000 miles. It is not quite that simple, however. An aluminium car would actually contain several alloys, which would have to be separated before being successfully recycled. As Mr Don MacMillan, vice president and general manager of Alcan's automotive division, acknowledges, it is not practical to expect scrapyard workers to take three days to take apart every scrapped car with spanners.</p>

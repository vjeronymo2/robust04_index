			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] has ordered its  representative office in Indonesia to help protect the safety of  Taiwan businessmen there in the wake of a labor riot in the  northern Sumatran city of Medan, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs  spokesman had said. Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the  Ministry's Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, said  the ROC has expressed its concern about the Medan labor rioting  to the Indonesian government and has ordered the ROC  representative office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for  Taiwan businessmen there.    According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest  at  a Medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last  Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the  economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops, and cars in  Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one  person was reportedly killed.    Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office  in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and  life there has begun to return to normal.</p>

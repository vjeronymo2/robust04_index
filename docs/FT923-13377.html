			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (4): A rapid transformation - Industries in eastern Europe come in from the cold THE AUTOMOTIVE and components industries of eastern Europe, long neglected by central planners, have been transformed with extraordinary rapidity in the past two years by heavy western investment. The biggest change has occurred in Hungary, which did not even have a car industry in 1990. Comecon, the old Soviet-dominated trading bloc, had decided 20 years ago that Hungary should specialise in producing buses for the bloc, as well as related components such as heavy duty axles. For Hungarian consumers, this left them with a choice between Fiat-Ladas from the Soviet Union and Poland or Trabants from the former East Germany. But in March, the first Opel Astra rolled off the new assembly lines at Szentgotthard, near the Austrian border; and in August the first Suzuki Swift will roll off equally new production lines at Esztergom less than 50km away. Initially, both the 15,000-a-year Astra plant and the 60,000-a-year Swift factory will be 'screwdriver' plants, assembling parts and components imported customs-free from GM's plants in Europe and Suzuki plants in Japan. But this is expected to change fast, as both plants push to maximise local content and take advantage of labour costs estimated to be only 10 per cent of comparable German rates. From the outset, however, the most important aspect of the Dollars 300m investment by GM and the Hungarian government at Szentgotthard was not car assembly but the much larger engine plant due to come on stream this month. The new plant will have the capacity to produce up to 200,000 highly fuel-efficient 1300cc and 1600cc engines for export to other GM plants throughout Europe. Suzuki, which intends to export most of its cars from the new Hungarian plant, has started by importing engines and other parts worth almost 60 per cent of total value from Japan. But the plant's eventual profitability depends largely on its ability to raise the local content to 60 per cent by 1995. Together, the two plants should provide a powerful incentive for component-makers to build new factories in Hungary. Some have already done so. Ford has just started production of fuel pumps, ignition coils and other components at a new Dollars 60m plant at Szekesfehervar, near Budapest. United Technologies, also of the US, has established a Dollars 10m plant at Godollo to build electrical systems for cars, and plans to expand the plant as output from new sites in Hungary and its neighbours rises. It is a similar story in Czechoslovakia, where Volkswagen paid around Dollars 600m for an eventual 70 per cent stake in Skoda and also built an Audi assembly line in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Over the next five years, VW plans investment worth another Dollars 6bn at Skoda, to raise production and introduce new models. Investment on this scale is proving a powerful incentive to VW's traditional suppliers to take similar advantage of Czechoslovakia's cheap, skilled labour. Robert Bosch of Germany has taken a 76 per cent stake in the newly privatised Motor Jikov components company of Ceske Budejovice. It plans to build new production facilities and quintuple the 200-strong workforce by 1995. The plant produces carburettors and engines for small agricultural machines, but the product range will be expanded to satisfy the more sophisticated demand from VW-Skoda. T and N, the UK motor components and engineering group, has also made two strategic investments in the region, which it intends to make the springboard of a fast-growing presence. In January T and N bought Gleitlagerwerk Osterwieck, a small east German ball-bearing company which used to supply bearings and other components to the former Trabant plant at Mosel, near Zwickau, now transformed by Volkswagen into a Golf assembly plant. In May, it completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Osinek, the sole Czechoslovak producer of friction and braking materials. The UK company plans substantial investment to raise output of brake linings and other automotive and industrial components. Rising output from the new VW controlled plants in Czechoslovakia and former East Germany has also induced Sklo Union, the Czech flat-glass company now 70 per cent controlled by Glaverbel of Belgium, to raise output of automobile glass from its plant at Teplice near the German border. The Czech-Belgian joint venture expects to double its current deliveries to VW of 200,000 automobile glass sets a year by 1994. Its low-cost, high-quality production has also enabled Sklo Union to elbow aside St Gobain of France and export auto glass sets to Fiat plants in Italy. Fiat is also investing heavily in eastern Europe. It has retarded plans to build a new car plant at Yelabuga, 850km east of Moscow, but recently agreed to pay a total of Dollars 2bn for control of FSO, Poland's small car producer. More than Dollars 1.2bn of the total will be spent raising production and introducing a new model to flank the existing Cinquecento model. Fiat's move is expected to be followed by an influx of Italian and other component companies. Farther east, Cummins Motor, the world's largest independent engine maker has agreed a joint venture with Kamaz, the largest Soviet truck maker, to build Cummins truck engines at Kamaz, in Nabarezhnye Chelny, 900km east of Moscow. When complete, the new facility will have the capacity to turn out 50,000 engines a year. Some will be incorporated in Kamaz trucks built for export to western markets, and others will be exported from the low-cost Russian plant to Cummins' customers around the world. After decades in the cold, eastern Europe is rapidly becoming a significant player in the auto components business.</p>

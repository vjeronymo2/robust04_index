			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: YOUNGSTERS WILL RUN MINI-MARATHON  </P> <P> Standout marathon runners of the future might be on display at 9:30 a.m. Sunday  at Pacific Square in Gardena when a local real estate company sponsors a  half-kilometer fun run for children 4-12.  </P> <P> World champion-caliber marathoners didn't start training by immediately running  the 26 miles, 385 yards. The half-kilometer distance is realistic for young  people wanting to get the feel of this type of road race. For those not yet  familiar with the metric system, and who is except for math teachers, a  half-kilometer is approximately a third of a mile. The children's race will be  run on Denker Avenue south of Pacific Square.  </P> <P> The stakes will be higher and the race longer for the older runners. A  five-kilometer race with $2,000 in prize money divided among the first 10 male  and first 10 female finishers will start at 8 a.m. Prize money includes $200  bonuses to the first man to run the course in under 13:46 and an equal amount  to the first woman to finish under 16:00. Awards will also go to the first five  finishers in each age division on a course described by the sponsoring Ken  Nakaoka Realty Co. as "the fastest road 5-K in L.A. and Orange counties."  </P> <P> Cost of entrance for the kids' half-kilometer and the adult five kilometer is  $10. Information: (213) 323-0163.  </P> <P> Dodgers "Egging Us On?" -- Two of the newest Dodgers and a veteran coach will  conduct a clinic, sponsored by the California Egg Commission, for youngsters at  Wilson Park in Torrance on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Stan Javier, acquired by the Dodgers from the World Series champion Oakland  Athletics earlier this season, will be joined by left-handed relief pitcher Pat  Perry and bullpen coach Mark Cresse, who will offer baseball advice and sign  autographs.  </P> <P> Javier, regarded as a premier defensive outfielder, has impressed the Dodgers  with his hitting prowess. He is hitting .345 since getting a chance to become a  regular in the lineup. He learned to play the game early in life, as he is the  son of former St. Louis Cardinal Julian Javier, an infield standout in the  1960s. The Dodgers probably won't allow Perry to throw too much at the clinic,  since he is on the team's disabled list, still recovering from the effects of  off-season rotator cuff surgery.  </P> <P> Dirty Driving? -- If you get down, you might get dirty at Ascot Park in Gardena  on Saturday night at 8. That's when Ascot plays host to the Valvoline Off-Road  Mud Bog Nationals for four-wheel drive vehicles. Unlike the sprint-car races  the park normally features, this one is made a bit shorter but tougher, as a  200-foot trench full of mud is placed over part of the race course. Drivers  race against the clock through the trench.  </P> <P> If you've ever tried driving on Pacific Coast Highway heading toward Malibu  after a heavy rainstorm, you might have an idea what awaits the event's  drivers. Expect the cars to spin and swerve quite a bit more than they would at  Indianapolis. Some might not make it out of the mud without towing assistance.  If you sit in the grandstands for a close view, you could take part of the  course home with you on your clothes and in your hair. Off-road race fans find  this type of event exciting, so it's worth checking out.  </P></p>

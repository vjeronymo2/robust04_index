			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Talks aim to clarify Egit fund's commitments The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday held negotiations with the East German Investment Trust (Egit) in an attempt to clarify the extent of the London-based fund's investment commitments in companies it bought from the agency in 1992. Egit, which pledged to invest more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 909,000) over the next three years in companies whose workforces total 7,000, is apparently having second thoughts about acquiring a stake in Forun, the eastern German refrigerator company. Forun was one of the first to manufacture a product free of CFC gases, which have been criticised on environmental grounds. Mr Eberhard Gunther, manager of Forun, said Egit had signed a contract in November 1992 to acquire 47 per cent of the company. 'But Egit has not invested one DM in the company,' said Mr Gunther, adding that Forun was in desperate need of capital in order to face growing competition. According to Forun, under the terms of the contract with the Treuhand, Egit had agreed to invest DM11.5m in the company over a four-year period, as well as guarantee 800 jobs. Forun had a turnover of DM120m last year, and is carrying losses of DM12m. Mr Olav zu Ermgassen, a board member of Egit, this week denied that the fund had signed a contract for Forun, and instead sharply criticised the Treuhand. 'It is the Treuhand's fault,' said Mr Ermgassen. 'We had the option to acquire a 47 per cent stake in Forun. We have been negotiating the terms of this contract with the agency since November 1992. But we have been passed from one negotiating team to the next. The Treuhand did not stick to the original terms.' When it was set up in 1992, Egit's board of directors included Mr Colin Black, chairman of Scottish Widows' Fund, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National.</p>

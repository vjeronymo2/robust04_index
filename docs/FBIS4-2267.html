			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] Forty-four students drowned in a recent boat outing  accident in Zhejiang's Jinyun County. According to a report  filed by our reporter from Hangzhou, on 5 April the Wuzhen  Primary School in Jinyun County, Lishui Prefecture, Zhejiang  Province, organized over 140 fourth and fifth grade students for  a spring outing. Three fourth grade classes were assembled for  a boat outing on Yanmenxiang Reservoir, which was about 10 li  from the town. After arriving at the assembly location around  1030 [0230 GMT], more than 80 students boarded the boats at  designated locations. After 10 minutes, the first boat  capsized, while the second boat also capsized 45 minutes later.    According to the local public security department, the two  boats were made of cement, and it was initially concluded that  the accident was caused by dangerous overloading. After the  accident occurred, the teachers who were at the scene and those  people who rushed to the scene after hearing of the accident  made serious efforts to rescue the students. The rescue  operation ended at 0400 [2000 GMT] on 6 April, and it was  confirmed that 44 students of about 10 years of age drowned,  while the rest were saved.    After the accident occurred, Zhejiang Deputy Provincial  Governor Xu Zhichun, and other officials of the Lishui  Prefecture, rushed to the scene to direct the rescue effort and  to deal with the problems arising from the accident. On the  same day after the accident occurred, the principal leader of  the Zhejiang provincial party committee called on the provincial  education commission to immediately notify all middle and  primary schools throughout the province of the accident, adding  that the commission should urge them to draw a lesson from this  accident, to ensure safety in spring outings for students, and  to cancel long-distance outings if safety conditions are found  to be inadequate.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Warning sends Kuala Lumpur down 5.6% Profit-taking by financial institutions and corporations eroded most of the morning's gains, but the Nikkei average still closed moderately higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index, which had gained 1.8 per cent on Monday, added 41.81 at 18,485.25. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 0.45 at 1,500.84, its first decline in nine trading days. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.34 at 1,246.50. The Nikkei rose to a high of 18,671.67 in early trading on continued buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs. However, corporate investors realised gains on holdings to improve profits at the March year-end book closing. The index dipped to a low of 18,373.04 in the early afternoon. Traders said selling pressure around the mid-18,000 level remained heavy, while a fall in the futures market also triggered index-linked selling. But foreign buying, especially in public works related stocks, helped to counter the falls. Volume totalled 446m shares, against Monday's 470m. Rises led declines by 621 to 417, with 135 issues unchanged. Some banks fell on selling by corporate investors of long term holdings. Industrial Bank of Japan shed Y40 to Y2,870 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,800. However, hopes of a reduction in the securities transaction tax supported brokers. Nomura Securities rose Y20 to Y2,010 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y1,190. Electric cable and wire companies declined, with Fujikura losing Y3 to Y872. However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y802,000. Reports that car makers may start restructuring operations by sharing parts encouraged investors: Isuzu Motors advanced Y26 to Y423 and Suzuki Motor Y50 to Y1,170. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 106.47 to 20,384.75 in volume of 55.7m shares. Nintendo rose Y310 to Y7,490. Roundup Some of the region's markets fell back sharply after recent gains, but Karachi and Bangkok went higher. KUALA LUMPUR plunged nearly 5.6 per cent after Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and leading political figure, commented that the market had risen too steeply in recent weeks. The composite index fell 67.20 to 1,139.55 in volume of 566m shares. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London noted that Mr Zainuddin's remarks were to the point as there had been far too much speculation recently, particularly in the few days between Christmas and the new year. He expected the market to consolidate around the 1,000 level. In SINGAPORE, where Malaysian OTC shares account for more than 60 per cent of trade, the market slid 3.1 per cent as it paid heed to Mr Zainuddin's warning. Investors also responded to a rise in interest rates. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 76.16 to 2,348.20. HONG KONG dropped sharply but ended above lows as rumours of banks adopting an even tighter mortgage lending policy sparked profit-taking. The Hang Seng index fell 211.13 or 1.9 per cent, to 11,155.81, having hit a day's low of 11,072.28. Turnover was HKDollars 7.7bn. HSBC Holdings, which fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 108, was the most actively traded stock. Hongkong Land lost 60 cents to HKDollars 26.40, in spite of an early jump on the launch of a Dollars 300m convertible bond issue and a nearly 50 per cent revaluation of its assets at the end of 1993. TAIWAN shed 1.6 per cent on profit-taking after its bull run and the recent tightening of liquidity in the money market, which has sent short-term interest rates soaring. The weighted index opened higher and peaked at 6,392 before turning down to finish 103.44 lower at 6,240.39. Turnover was heavy at TDollars 119.29bn. SEOUL traded higher in a day of low volume on the back of renewed strong interest in expensive blue chip manufacturings and an absence of selling by the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund. The composite stock index added 7.98 to 881.02. MANILA retreated as investors continued to take profits. The composite index lost 70.17 or 2.2 per cent to 3,089.39. Turnover was 2.2bn pesos. AUSTRALIA was firmer but a turnaround in the futures market took the local bourse off its post-1987 crash high set earlier in the day. The All Ordinaries index added 8.1 to 2,206.7, but down from an intra-day high of 2,216.5. Turnover was ADollars 541.3m. BANGKOK reversed the losses of Monday and put on nearly 4 per cent. The SET index gained 59.78 to 1,605.06 in turnover down to some Bt20bn, after last week's levels of around Bt40bn. KARACHI set a record high on the last day of the account. The KSE index rose 33.14 to 2,348.46 with financial and energy stocks seeing sharp gains on heavy buying by institutions. BOMBAY turned cautious as market makers worried that they could be pressured into complying with the regulator's order banning forward trade. The BSE 30-share index closed 41.46 down at 3,780.10.</p>

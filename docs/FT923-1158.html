			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Nickolls incurs Pounds 0.22m loss Clarke Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property company, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 218,000 in the first half of 1992. The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 72,000 in the same period last year and a loss of Pounds 727,000 for the whole of 1991. Gross rental income fell from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.05m, income from serviced office facilities was down from Pounds 599,000 to Pounds 458,000 while income from sales of properties dived from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 160,000. Mr Eric Lyall, chairman, said that business confidence had ebbed further during the half year. The group is heavily borrowed but as most of the interest is capped any rate reduction would help the group. There is no interim dividend (0.33p).</p>

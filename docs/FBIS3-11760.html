The "vital" measures are aimed at "reaffirming our  sovereignty and presence" on the San Juan River, a Nicaraguan  waterway that marks the boundary with Costa Rica, the Nicaraguan  foreign minister added. "We have had our backs to the river for  decades," the Nicaraguan foreign minister said.    In mid-March Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus  questioned the Nicaraguan authorities about the charging of a  toll in the village of La Trinidad, where the Sarapiqui River  meets the San Juan River.    Leal said the Nicaraguan authorities will continue to charge  citizens of third countries, who sail on the San Juan River,  five dollars per tourist card as in the case of tourists who are  transported on motorboats operated by Costa Rican agencies.  Ernesto Leal added that Costa Ricans who identify themselves as  such will not be charged for sailing on the river in compliance  with the border treaty signed between both countries on 15 April  1858. The treaty gave Nicaragua the exclusive right to exercise  full control over the waters of the San Juan River from its head  waters at Lake Nicaragua to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean,  Leal said. "This means Nicaragua exercises full sovereignty and  jurisdiction over the river from source to mouth, Leal said.    In addition, the border treaty grants Costa Rica the right  in  perpetuity to free navigation on the river for trade purposes  from its mouth on the Atlantic up to a point 3 miles below  Castillo Viejo. "Nicaragua respects Costa Rica's rights and  will continue to respect them," according to Leal, but he noted  that the treaty explicitly excludes tourism and "that is why  these types of services (rendered by Costa Rica) are not covered  by the treaty."    The minister said that the new police stations will be  installed in El Papaturro, El Castillo, El Delta, and Sarapiqui,  and that there will also be new immigration offices in the  aforementioned locations as well as in San Juan del Norte. The  office at the mouth of the Sarapiqui River will be reinforced.  The project's initial phase includes a tourist information  program throughout the entire San Juan River area in addition to  fishing and hunting controls to preserve the region's natural  resources along that waterway.    Leal added that a bill is being drafted prohibiting  foreigners from purchasing lands in the border regions, which  will soon be submitted to the Nicaraguan National Assembly. "We  are also going to have a substantial presence in the area with  health and education programs at the border," according to Leal,  who also said a border landmark plan will be implemented between  boundary markers 13 and 14 along the border with Costa Rica.</p>

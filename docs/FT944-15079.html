			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Abbey chief urges flexible savings policies The savings policies and loans offered by high street banks and building societies must become more flexible in order to reflect social changes, Lord Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, said yesterday. Highlighting the extent to which recent profit improvements had been the result of lower provisions for bad debts rather than sharply higher earnings, he suggested that future growth could be more difficult to find in traditional markets and products. He said the shrinking of the younger age groups and the rise in the number of older people would mean a drop in first-time buyers entering the housing market, with a growth in demand for savings. This could mean 'a new challenge to keep both sides of the balance sheet matched and growing'. Job insecurity and a greater emphasis on the need for women to be financially independent - arising partly from a higher level of divorce - were features which financial services organisations would have to take into account. Against this background, he said that lenders should design mortgages which gave borrowers more flexible commitments - including the repayment terms - and should develop more accessible savings products which reflected consumers' reluctance to undertake regular repayments. This could mean mortgages where customers could vary repayments for part of the loan within certain limits, or could choose a loan with an interest rate changeable within certain limits. It could also lead to changes in the endowment policies linked to mortgages which might take more account of the prospect that they might not be maintained for the full-term. Other changes he identified were that people would regard their homes more as a source of capital, and that they would become more aware of the benefits of hedging their risks. Delivering the Gilbart lecture, Lord Tugendhat also restated his view that mutual financial organisations - such as building societies - lacked sufficient accountability to their members. Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, was a building society until it converted to plc status.</p>

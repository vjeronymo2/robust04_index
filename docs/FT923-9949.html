			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / King's Cross plan advances THE LONG planning battle over a Pounds 3bn scheme to redevelop land beside London's King's Cross Station has moved a step nearer resolution after a decision by planning officials to give conditional approval. Next Thursday, Camden Council is expected to confirm the decision taken by its planning committee three days ago. Mr Phil Turner, joint deputy leader of the council, said the move was 'good for Camden and the people of this borough because it is a further step along the road to bringing this huge area into use'.</p>

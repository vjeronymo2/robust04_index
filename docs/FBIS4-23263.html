			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Niger workers of the public sector this morning  embarked on their first general, indefinite strike at the  request of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN].  Parastatals will not follow the indefinite strike, but they  will experience disruptions in labor through periodic strikes.  The USTN is demanding, among other things, the abrogation of a  decree regulating strikes in the civil service and a 30- to  50-percent increase in salary. Several people in Niamey and in  the provinces have condemned this indefinite strike, which they  say will be suicidal for educational institutions in Niger.  These institutions run the risk of experiencing three invalid  academic years within four.    In a communique issued yesterday evening, the government  spokesman condemned the intransigence of the labor union and  threatened to enforce the existing laws on any worker who will  not report for work. However, the government confirmed its  readiness to create the conditions for a sincere partnership.  Here is the minister of communications, Massaoudou Hassoumi:    [Begin Hassoumi recording] [passage omitted] Out of the  seven-point demands there was total agreement on five, a partial  agreement on one point, and a disagreement on one point. The  calm which prevailed throughout the negotiations, and the  impression created that both sides admit to important results  having been achieved, did not hint that the labor union was  going to maintain its indefinite strike order. The government  reiterates its readiness to create conditions for a sincere  partnership. However, in the face of the labor union's  intransigence to maintain its strike order, the government  reaffirms its firm determination to strictly enforce provisions  regulating strikes. It calls on workers who care for the future  for the future of our country to report for work. Thank you.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLADE RUNNERS;  </P> <P> DRESSED UP WITH NEON ACCENTS, A NEW STYLE OF SKATE SPEEDS ALONG THE CUTTING  EDGE OF FASHIONABLE FITNESS  </P> <P> These days, roller-skating not only has a new look but a new name. "We don't  roller-skate anymore," says one denizen of the Venice bike path, where skaters  and cyclists vie for space. "We roller-blade."  </P> <P> He is referring, of course, to Rollerblade, the in-line skate that has  revolutionized California skating. Unlike conventional skates, it aligns its  wheels along a single blade, similar to an ice skate, for a faster, smoother  ride. In the past few years, it has made outdoor skating, which was as dead as  disco, respectable again.  </P> <P> The new skate was introduced in Minneapolis in 1980 and was marketed as an  off-season training tool for National Hockey League players and cross-country  skiers. But California's year-round skating season presented the company with a  golden opportunity. Since 1986, when Rollerblade began aggressively courting  the general fitness market, the new style of skate has gone from a novelty item  to one responsible for about $30 million retail sales in 1989. Roughly 20% of  these sales were made in California.  </P> <P> Rollerblade, which has captured about three-quarters of the market, understood  the importance of California. As the company became more tuned-in to the  California scene, says Mary Horwath, public relations director for Rollerblade,  it took its cue from the surf-wear industry and upgraded the skate's look.  </P> <P> In the beginning, the skates had all the charm of clunky, unadorned ski boots.  Over the past several seasons, however, Rollerblade has dressed the skate up  with neon accents and accessories.  </P> <P> For instance, the five-wheel racing model, which will be available May 1 for a  record list price of $330, features a medium-cut gray boot with grape and  apple-green accents. The Macroblade skate, which lists for about $250 at  outlets like Sports Chalet and skate shops such as Rip City in Santa Monica, is  aimed at advance skaters; its black boot is set off with fluorescent yellow  strap buckles. The most popular model, the Lightning, comes in a white or black  boot and can be individualized with a wide choice of laces, wheels and foot  liners.  </P> <P> Some attendant safety gear is shaping up style-wise, too. Plastic orbs on elbow  and knee pads are now available in grape or fluorescent yellow, not just white.  Safety gloves, with their padded leather palms, feature bold grape/mint or  turquoise/yellow striped fronts. And, in response to the growth of open-road  and ramp skating, Rollerblade has introduced a handsome, hand-laminated  fiberglass helmet, with a boldly emblazoned logo across the top.  </P> <P> When it comes to apparel, however, skate wear remains surprisingly traditional.  Because the sport attracts an eclectic mix of athletes and because it places no  fundamentally unique demands on the clothes, there is no real need for skating  outfits.  </P> <P> "The sport does a great job developing the lower body," says Chris Morris, a  sales representative for Rollerblade. "Once you've got the musculature, you are  going to wear whatever shows that off best."  </P></p>

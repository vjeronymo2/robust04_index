			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Evergon is a Canadian photographer who goes by a single name and conceives of  his work as "homo-baroque" in style. Mockingly theatrical, his large-format  Polaroids poke into various corners of art history.  </P> <P> "Jacob Wrestling With the Angel" borrows from Caravaggio's sharply lit,  teasingly homo-erotic figures who are pushed smack up against the  picture-plane. The "angel," a guy in a white headband trimmed with baby's  breath, pokes his head over the torso of nude Jacob -- who writhes as if caught  up in a particularly steamy dream -- and contrives to hold his hand. One  translucent wing brushes Jacob's thigh, slyly in keeping with the biblical  image in which the angel "touched the hollow of (Jacob's) thigh."  </P> <P> Two small, gauze-wrapped boys with crumpled tinfoil at their feet pose in  "Cupid," a diptych. One child holds a big album, the other balances a globe.  This set piece seems evocative of the sentimental sort of Victorian photography  that predated the Photo-Secessionists.  </P> <P> On the whole, Evergon's figurative work seems cleverer than his still lifes.  The most subtly insidious of these is probably "Squash," a close-up view of the  cut-open fruit resting on a white tablecloth, contains a fleeting memory of the  17th-Century still life masters as well as a voluptuous delight in the fruit's  interior tangle of seeds and membranes. Dangling dried chilis on the wall add a  lascivious, quirkily South-of-the-border touch. (Glenn/Dash Gallery, 962 N. La  Brea Ave., to Aug. 26.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Vodusek: "Shifts in the `Pentagon'"] </F>   [Text] The most radical changes were suffered by  Moris; consequences of the Smolnikar scandal in VOMO [Defense  Ministry Security Service]; the army's support depends on the  governing policy.    Ljubljana, 23 May--At this morning's meeting the Defense  Committee, among other things, discussed a report from Minister  Jelko Kacin on personnel changes in the Slovene "Pentagon."  There are no longer many individuals in the ministry's  leadership from the inner circle of former Defense Minister  Janez Jansa and the coordinating group that prepared and  conducted the country's defense within the army.    If we can judge by Jelko Kacin's statements, the expected  shifts will stop with the chief of the Republic Headquarters of  Territorial Defense [TO], Albin Gutman. Specifically, approval  from President Milan Kucan is required for replacements in the  leadership of the General Staff.    Colonel-General Albin Gutman was the commander of the  provincial TO headquarters for Carniola, which is headed by Rade  Klisaric. Along with some of Jansa's associates involved in the  maneuvers structure of national defense, he is on the notorious  list from Dossier 13. With the replacements of the provincial TO  headquarters commanders--the last one was at the provincial TO  headquarters for the southern coastal region--the list of  expected replacements has probably been exhausted.    Two politicians, however, think that the situation in the  army is "extremely problematic." Janez Jansa is convinced that a  political purge is being conducted at the Defense Ministry,  while the former chairman of the Defense Committee, Zmago  Jelincic, is of the opinion that Minister Kacin has no other  choice but to clean up after his predecessor. "If he does not  succeed, it is best to disband the army and rely on the police,"  Jelincic concluded in the latest SOBOTNA PRILOGA.    Jansa criticized State Secretary Boris Znidaric, who came to  the Defense Ministry after 23 years of service in the police  leadership, of running the army like the police. Znidaric, in  addition to two other state secretaries, is responsible for  training, organization, and personnel in the Defense Ministry.    The most radical changes, after Jansa's removal, were  suffered primarily by the Moris First Special Brigade. After the  replacement of Brigadier Anton Krkovic, the defense minister was  not satisfied with its effectiveness. If we can judge by the  experiences of foreign countries, one should not expect it to be  disbanded, although even outwardly Moris is to be made  equivalent to other Slovene army units.    The disputes between the army's special brigade and the  police have a political background, if we can reach a conclusion  from the dramaturgy of the Smolnikar scandal, and they also  originate from the conflicts and old grudges among individual  participants in that operation. In fact, the agents in the spy  scandal were employed by the First Special Brigade.    The above conflict was most evident in the Defense  Ministry's  Security Service. Three heads of VOMO have been replaced in a  six-month period. The departure of Andrej Lovsin at the peak of  the war among the intelligence officers several months before  the replacement of Janez Jansa allows different explanations.  Dusan Mikus, who was replaced by Marjan Miklavcic, had to leave  his job as director because of the Smolnikar scandal. A  conversation lasting several hours between Jelko Kacin and Dusan  Mikus about the top secret Bizjak report did not bear any  significant fruit.    Among the directors of the individual administrations, the  only one to be dismissed was Janez J. Svajncer, who left as  managing editor of the magazine SLOVENSKI VOJAK. The director of  the Second Administration, Joze Zagozen, after talking to the  parliamentary commission on the arms scandal, reportedly told  the defense minister that after taking leave, he intends to  resign from his position.    The statistics, according to which the new defense minister,  Jelko Kacin, appointed 15 new people in two months, while  approximately as many people left the ministry, do not say much,  since those figures apply to the structure of the Defense  Ministry. More important is the political decision on how many  soldiers and what kind of army the state needs, and there will  undoubtedly be parliamentary discussions of this.    The Assembly's decision on the defense tolar, i.e.,  investments in fundamental development programs over the next 10  years, which, after the personnel changes, will undoubtedly be  the most important topic of polemics regarding the Defense  Ministry, is only halfway toward building our own army.    The dilemmas concerning Slovenia without an army, which  several politicians recorded in the so-called "Declaration for  Peace" in 1991, have not yet been surmounted, at least judging  by the views of parliamentarians, in spite of the war and the  fundamentally changed circumstances in our vicinity. For the  time being, support for the army depends upon the control and  influence of the ruling policy.</p>

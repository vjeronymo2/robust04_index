			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After the Targeted Telecommunications Project  (PFTLC) the CNR [National Research Council] is examining the  possibility of launching the Targeted Project for Personalized  Communications (PFCP). The prefeasibility study, which bears the  date 14 May 1993, traces a map of the demand and supply of  personalized goods and services corresponding to specific needs.    In the sector of telecommunications services, the trend  toward personalization is seen primarily in certain areas, such  as the possibility of choosing from a multitude of terminals  with ever increasing multimedia features for example.    Among these, the possibility of accessing a wide variety of  network services: associating a number with a person (personal  number), meaning that the user can maintain his own  communication address whatever the terminal; mobility, meaning  the possibility of communicating with people in movement; the  possibility of performing activities (work, education, medical  checkups etc.) even in a location that is far from the  headquarters where the activities are based, even in one's own  residence; personalized diffusion services (for example  personalized television).    The PFCP is part of this framework and, even though it is  directed toward developments in the area of telecommunications,  calls for an interdisciplinary committment in all the sectors of  computer science and engineering, including computer,  electronic, and electromagnetic technologies.    The development of the project calls for synergies with  other  future targeted projects such as those on Materials and Devices  for Solid State Electronics [MADESS II], Photonics, and  Electromagnetic Compatibility.    The areas included in the new finalized project are  multimedia treatment; human factors, software architecture for  services, methods for the creation of services, the safety and  protection of communications, circuit and electromagnetic  technologies, radio access, propagation in certain frequency  bands, environmental impact, and interconnecting networks.    Within this framework the prefeasibility study provides for  both basic and applied research leading to six possible  subprojects: fixed and mobile terminals, network  infrastructures, wireless access networks, wireless local  networks, management and planning methods, and field tesing.    This project will therefore be characterized by its specific  research objectives, both because of the scientific implications  and because of the prospects for industrial applications in the  medium to long term.    The project is organized to make provision for wide-ranging  interdisciplinary research topics. This will permit a wider  group of research know-how from the CNR institutes, university  departments, and industrial reseach laboratories to be involved.    A fact to be emphasized is the all the industrial and  nonindustrial bodies interested in developing the PFCP are also  the potential users of the results. As for the sharing out of  human resources from public and private bodies, the  prefeasibility study also provides for the quotas to be 40 and  60 percent respectively. The PFCP project is expected to last  five years.    On the basis of these evaluations, the project should call  for an investment of 120 billion lire by the CNR, a figure that  could vary depending on the possibile costs and the quota to be  covered by the participating organizations.    As for the possible industrial spin-offs, the PFCP can  provide all national industries in the entire information sector  (telecommunications, computers, and microelectronics) with a  decisive and important opporutnity to make their products  competitive in the future. Moreover, it could become eligible  for subsidies from the EC within the framework of European  research projects that will be the subject of the Fourth  Framework Program in the field of information and communications  technologies. This would give our research world more chances  of acquiring an important role in future projects funded by the  European Community.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rockefeller denies reports of mortgage default on centre Rockefeller Group, which owns the Rockefeller Centre office complex in Manhattan, yesterday denied reports that it could soon default on its mortgage payments on the centre. Rockefeller Group is 80 per cent controlled by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan while the other 20 per cent of Rockefeller Group is in the hands of the Rockefeller family. In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the holder of the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the complex - the real estate investment trust Rockefeller Centre Properties (RCP) - warned there was 'substantial concern' about the ability of Rockefeller Group to meet its mortgage payments. Due to the depressed state of the New York commercial property market, Rockefeller Centre's rental income has not been able to cover its mortgage payments for years. Yesterday the Rockefeller Group said the next monthly Dollars 46.5m interest payment on the mortgage had been paid, and it remained committed to 'maintaining the Rockefeller Centre as the premier commercial property in the world'. Although Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family have made up the Dollars 300m annual cash shortfall on the Rockefeller Centre's books for the past five years, the SEC filing raised doubts about Mitsubishi's willingness to continue covering the large losses. If Mitsubishi pulled out of its commitment to cover the losses and the property defaulted, ownership of the centre would revert to RCP as the mortgage holder. Although property analysts have long doubted whether Mitsubishi would cut its losses because of the damage such a move would inflict on its reputation, the SEC filing indicated that RCP believed the Japanese group may be close to changing its mind. When Mitsubishi bought majority control of the landmark art-deco complex for Dollars 1.4bn in 1989, it was one of the most high-profile Japanese investments in the US. Soon after that deal the New York property market collapsed and the 19-building complex is estimated to be worth less than Dollars 1bn.</p>

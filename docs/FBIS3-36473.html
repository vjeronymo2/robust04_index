			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 04, BNS -- More than ten thousand  retired Russian military who live in Estonia constitute a threat  to the country's security, a member of the Estonian delegation  for talks with Russia said in a press conference.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation, said data  provided by Russia shows the number of former Russian Military  in Estonia at 10,570. A total 850 of them have been discharged  and are part of Russia's military reserve. The rest are retired  personnel. The Russian Military born before 1930, numbering  4,345 in Estonia, are eligible to apply for a permanent  residence permit. The rest of the former military are younger  than 63.    "I contest the claims that a reserve officer of 50-60 years  of age doesn't constitute any threat to Estonia," Tiiman said.    He said Russia with the topic of retired military was  attempting to create an artificial obstacle on the way of  negotiations.    The Russian side at the last round of negotiations, which  ended Wednesday [2 February], refused to turn over to Estonia a  timetabe for the withdrawal of troops, accusing Estonia of  unwillingness to sign a social guarantees agreement for the  former Russian Military living in the country.    Tiiman said Russia was unable to understand Estonia's  worries  about the topic of the retired military.    "When I told Russian generals that also Estonia was having  its national interests, they opened their eyes wide and asked  what sort of a thing was that," Tiiman added.    He said Russia's conditions concerning the social welfare  guarantees to retired military included a demand to make changes  in the Estonian legislation. At the same time Russia doesn't  agree to a scheme of determining the size of pensions for the  military by indexation.    Tiiman said the Russian Army pensioners in Estonia were  getting big pensions, as Russia still continues payment of the  money under the 1992 exchange rate of 10 roubles to the Estonian  kroon. The current rate is more than 110 roubles to the kroon.    If Russia starts payment under the current exchange rate,  the  size of pensions would drop below the subsistence minimum in  Estonia and the Baltic country would have to pay an additional  allowance to the former Russian Military.</p>

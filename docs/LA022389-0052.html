			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: CHEVRON REFINERY LEAK SOILS CARS;  </P> <P> LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF  </P> <P> An estimated 200 people may have found the finish on their cars marred by  cleaning solvent that spewed into the air after a mechanical failure at  Chevron's El Segundo refinery, a company spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rod Spackman said a tube in a heat exchanger ruptured Monday, causing steam to  mix with the solvent. The mixture dissipated into the air, and a "light mist"  fell over a seven-square-block area, primarily in Manhattan Beach, he said. The  incident lasted no more than 10 minutes, he said.  </P> <P> Chevron distributed leaflets about the incident, Spackman said. People were  told to contact refinery officials to have their cars cleaned.  </P> <P> The company isn't sure but thinks an ordinary wash and wax will remove the gunk  from vehicles.  </P></p>

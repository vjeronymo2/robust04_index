			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Tietmeyer rejects calls for interest rate cuts THE Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, yesterday rejected calls from Germany's independent research institutes to accelerate the pace of cuts in short-term interest rates . Mr Tietmeyer said that for the time being there was no scope for another cut in rates, rebutting the institutes' argument - contained in their autumn report published early this week - that further reductions would help the country emerge from recession. 'The Bundesbank rejects all calls to stimulate the economy with forced interest cuts,' Mr Tietmeyer said at a conference in Frankfurt. 'Unlike the institutes, we see no narrow link between short-term interest rate cuts and growth and employment.' He said the rate cuts last week were justified by the more moderate development of money supply growth and inflation in recent months. Last Thursday the central bank reduced both the Lombard and the discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6.25 and 5.75 per cent respectively. The repo rate, which provides liquidity to the banking system, was cut more modestly, from 6.67 to 6.4 per cent. Voicing the Bundesbank's conviction that long-term rates are more important for German industry than short-term ones, he argued that the institutes had underestimated the risks of a rise in long-term rates if the Bundesbank delivered further, substantial cuts in the discount and Lombard rates. He said that neither the absolute level of current interest rates, nor the 'inverted' structure of the interest rate curve (whereby short-term rates are higher than long-term ones) acted as a brake on investment in German industry. On the contrary, those who wanted to invest could borrow money at long-term interest rates which were almost 'incomparably favourable' in international terms. Mr Tietmeyer said there was no doubt that the central bank would hold to its course of gradual rate reductions, but not at the price of creating new uncertainties for the financial markets as regards German monetary policy. Later in his speech Mr Tietmeyer repeated a statement he has made several times since he succeeded Mr Helmut Schlesinger as Bundesbank president at the beginning of October: that the Bundesbank would not act as 'the central bank for Europe' in the run-up to European monetary union. Its paramount objective will remain domestic: to squeeze inflation out of Germany and thereby preserve the value of the D-Mark.</p>

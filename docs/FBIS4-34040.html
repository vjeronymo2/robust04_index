			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, Jun 14 (AFP) -- This Tuesday,  Jean-Claude Martineau, spokesman of exiled President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, condemned the 12 June state of emergency  proclamation by provisional President Emile Jonassaint (the  international does not recognize him), describing it as a  "Duvalierist diatribe and a threat veiled in demagoguery."    In a communique forwarded to the AFP office in  Port-au-Prince, Martineau says "the country is, in fact, living  amid a state of emergency, and all the people's rights have been  suspended since 30 September 1991" (date of the coup d'etat.)  "If you want to find those who threaten the country's  independence, you will not find them abroad because they are in  our country," he added.</p>

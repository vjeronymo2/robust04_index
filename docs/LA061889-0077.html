			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAMESE GIRL'S ESSAY ON CONTRASTS  </P> <P> I am writing in response to the essay written by 11-year-old Tuyet Tran (June  11). I thank The Times for publishing her letter unedited, allowing her message  to come to the readers directly from the heart.  </P> <P> Tuyet's poignantly composed essay contrasting the horrors of Communistic  Vietnam and the beauty of America and its people touched me deeply. It does  sadden me, however, to think about the many "beautiful people" Tuyet refers to  who do not always welcome her with open arms and minds.  </P> <P> As a teacher, I see on a daily basis the insights children have about ideas  such as freedom, tyranny, and simple acceptance of others. I am also convinced  it is the children who can make a difference and change the world for the  better.  </P> <P> Hopefully, Tuyet's simple, moving essay was able to remind we Americans how  fortunate we are to live in a democracy blessed with freedom, void of tyranny  and rich in cultural diversity.  </P> <P> I send my heartfelt respect to Tuyet, her family and teachers who have  obviously had a positive impact on her life.  </P> <P> TINA CHASE  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

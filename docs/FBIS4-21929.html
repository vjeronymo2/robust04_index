			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Excerpts] A Fatah member from Khan Yunus was killed this  evening as he was assembling a bomb in the Khan Yunus refugee  camp. The victim is Khalid Halabi, who spent eight years in an  Israeli prison because of his Fatah membership. His body was  snatched away from the hospital.    Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar adds that shots were fired  this evening at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] lookout position  in al-Shaykh Radwan. Nobody was hurt. The Fatah Hawks claimed  responsibility for this attempted terrorist attack.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 2 April  adds: [passage omitted] "A firebomb was thrown this evening at  an Israeli car in the 'Aqabat Jabr refugee camp on the outskirts  of Jericho. Nobody was hurt and no damage was caused. The  driver reported the incident and drove away. An IDF unit  arrived on the scene and found the firebomb's remnants as well  as empty cartridges. Shortly afterward, an Arab suffering  serious wounds arrived in a hospital in the area. The security  forces are checking whether the man was the one who threw the  firebomb and was wounded by shots fired by passengers aboard the  Israeli car."]</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAWYER BROWN GIVES IN TO WORST IMPULSES AT CRAZY HORSE  </P> <P> There are a lot of words you could associate with Sawyer Brown, but subtlety is  not one of them. And it's the "Star Search"-winning band's tendency towards  excess that ultimately did the group in at the Crazy Horse in Santa Ana on  Monday night.  </P> <P> From the moment the six-man aggregation hit the stage, its members served up  heavy-handed arrangements that pummeled many of their hits into shapelessness.  Certainly "Everybody Loves to Hear A Country Boy Sing," their set opener,  suffered from the heavy back-beat and accelerated tempo.  </P> <P> Other hits, like the rollicking "Leona," the power-shuffle "My Baby's Gone" as  well as a lifeless reworking of the Eagles' hit "Take It Easy," ended up  sounding very similar because there's so little to differentiate the approach.  Sawyer Brown wants to rock -- and that's where the trouble starts.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the problem wasn't limited to the upbeat material. "Used to  Blue," one of the Orlando-based band's early hits, was transformed from an  achingly pretty ballad to a maudlin production number, complete with a brassy  synthesizer part. If this is how they approach sensitive material, it's no  wonder their focus comes across as blurred.  </P> <P> Lead singer Mark Miller has always been one to pump a lot of energy into his  stage moves. But there's something to be said for reaching beyond the standard  Rock 101 moves that he used to tantalize the crowd. Mick Jagger he's not -- and  at most moments, Miller's rocking posture had all the charm of a Raggedy Andy  doll fresh from electroshock therapy.  </P> <P> In fact, most of Miller's shtick was grossly self-serving. After stopping  "Missing You Heart of Mine" after a few bars, Miller addressed the audience  with a barely cloaked admonishment of "I don't know if you know this, but this  was one of the biggest country songs last year . . . " and was rewarded by a  larger round of applause during the song's second start.  </P> <P> Mark Miller may well be one of country music's cutest faces. But a little of  that goes a long way. And it's particularly frustrating to see a band that  knows how to work a crowd, that has a lead singer who has a legitimately  emotive baritone and that has a substantial following consistently be satisfied  with your basic high-tech Holiday Inn performance.  </P> <P> "Leave Me My Guitar (I'll Have an Axe to Grind)" was one of the evening's more  satisfying numbers because Sawyer Brown stripped things down and let the song  do the work. The same could be said for a spare rendition of "Heart Don't Fall  Now," which centered around Greg (Hobie) Hubbard's shimmering piano work and  Miller's voice.  </P> <P> On that promising note, the band once again gave in to its worst inclinations.  A 1-2-3 punch of "Step That Step," "Betty's Bein' Bad" and "Shakin' " went for  crowd appeal and found Miller trotting out all his low-rent Chippendale's  moves. The band got loud, though it never played anything worthy of the volume.  </P> <P> The witty "Superman's Daughter" was a tongue-in-cheek take on the man of steel,  which showed a sense of fun and humor that compliments the light-handed image  Sawyer Brown works so hard to project. But again, band members managed to stem  their momentum with a leaden cover of Z.Z. Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" that  proved that soul is something you just can't fake.  </P></p>

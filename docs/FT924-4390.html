			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK tries to break banana deadlock THE UK has tried to break the deadlock over reform of the European Community's banana import regime with tariff-based proposals that would involve a radical departure from Britain's long-standing support for banana quotas. The move will dismay Caribbean exporters, who have lobbied the UK hard to protect the current quota system that protects their fragile and banana-dependent economies. But a tariff-based import regime would remove the prospect of the EC coming into direct conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which under the Uruguay Round of world trade reforms is calling for tariffs to replace quotas in all farm trade. An unofficial UK document described as a 'non-paper' and entitled 'Reflections on Alternative Ways Forward', leaked to the Financial Times, invites views on two options: A flat-rate tariff on 'dollar bananas' imported from cheaper, high-volume exporters from Latin America; A two-tier tariff system, with a lower tariff (10-14 per cent has been talked of) on dollar bananas up to a certain quota level and a higher tariff (perhaps 70 per cent) above that quota level. The 'non-paper' emphasises that 'any final arrangements would have to be capable of meeting the Community's Lome obligations, and its equivalent obligations to its own producers, while taking account of the position in relations to Gatt.' The EC is hopelessly divided on the issue of banana trade reform. Change has been forced by creation of the single market from January 1 next year. After this date, the cheaper dollar bananas at present imported by Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries cannot legally be barred from any other European market. This threatens the collapse of quota regimes agreed under the Lome Convention, which give former British and French colonies, and territories like the Canary Islands, privileged access to the EC market. Community officials are now certain that no agreement is possible by January 1. There is no sign so far that the British 'non-paper' can break the blocking minorities on either side of the debate - Germany, the Benelux and Denmark firmly against a quota system, and France, Spain, Portugal firmly against tariffs. Plans are now being made for interim arrangements to come into force in January to police the EC market, preventing a flood of dollar bananas into France, the UK, Spain and Portugal until agreement on reform is found. One observer said the interim danger was less from big dollar banana exporters like Dole or Chiquita of the US, than from small truckers who might try to reap a windfall gain from price differences across the community of up to 25 per cent between dollar bananas and those from the Caribbean.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER RAMONA'S GROUND WATER RUNS AS DEEP AS SOME OF ITS WELLS  </P> <P> Ahhh, country living. Clean air. Clean water.  </P> <P> So when Luke Greeson moved to Ramona from the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate  about 20 years ago, he didn't hesitate to drill a well 100 feet into the  ground, tapping into a ready, steady and cheap supply of water to keep his lawn  green, his clothes clean and his thirst quenched.  </P> <P> But Luke Greeson is drinking bottled water these days because of concern that  the ground water beneath his house may no longer be fit for human consumption.  </P> <P> Yet his next-door neighbor, Julene Gyde, has no hesitancy about drinking that  same water. In fact, she is so satisfied by the water from her well that she  and her husband disconnected themselves from the community's piped water supply  and now rely solely on the water 100 feet beneath their horse ranch on the  south side of town.  </P> <P> And so it goes in Ramona these days, with a brewing and technical debate over  the quality of Ramona's underground water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Highest Concentration of Drinking Wells  </P> <P> Though most of Ramona's households are served by the Ramona Municipal Water  District, some estimates put at 1,000 the number of homes in and around Ramona  that rely on their own wells, either out of preference or because of the cost  to tie in to the municipal water lines. County water officials say Ramona has  the highest concentration of drinking-water wells in the county.  </P> <P> For these residents, the issue is over the presence of nitrates in the ground  water and what harm -- if any -- is caused to the human body by them.  </P> <P> Nitrates result from decomposing plants, animals and microbes, from the liquid  and solid waste of humans and animals and in runoff from nitrate-based  fertilizers. According to the federal Environmental  </P> <P> Protection Agency, the presence of more than 10 milligrams of nitrates (as  nitrogen) in a liter of water is dangerous to infants up to 6 months old  because it converts in the body to nitrite and can cause methemoglobinemia in  those who have difficulty assimilating nitrites. The disease, also known as  "blue baby disease," essentially transforms hemoglobin -- the blood's  oxygen-carrying component -- to another form, which cannot transport oxygen.  </P> <P> Researchers say the disease is very rare and may be brought on because of other  complications. Adults are not considered at risk by drinking nitrate-high water  because they normally consume far more nitrates in their food than they would  get from water itself.  </P> <P> A San Diego State University student working on her master's degree in public  health studied the nitrate problem in Ramona's ground water and found that,  based on her sampling of wells, several of Ramona's various underground water  aquifers are tainted by levels of nitrates exceeding the safety limits  established by the EPA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turkey Farms and Dairies  </P> <P> The high levels may be of little surprise, given the groves and orchards in the  Ramona area that are fertilized with nitrate-rich chemicals, and given the  region's history as home to dairies and turkey and chicken farms -- and the  mounds of nitrate-generating manure they produced.  </P> <P> But the EPA nitrate limits apply only to public water supplies -- such as the  water provided through the Ramona Municipal Water District, which, because it  blends local well water with imported water, has nitrate levels well within the  federal standards.  </P> <P> Private homeowners using their own wells, however, are not governed by the EPA,  and, unless they test their wells on their own for chemical analysis, they may  not even know if or to what degree they have the tasteless nitrates in their  water.  </P> <P> San Diego County's Department of Health Services approves private wells at the  time they are dug, checking them both for construction quality and to make sure  the water has not been contaminated by surface bacteria during the boring. But  the county is not required to check for the presence of nitrates in private  water wells.  </P> <P> Enter Carol Close, a Ramona housewife-turned-activist on the matter of water  quality, who has campaigned for public awareness about the presence of nitrates  and for more government monitoring of private wells in Ramona.  </P> <P> Close, the mother of three young children, says she is not convinced that  Ramonans understand the danger of nitrates. It was through her persistence that  the county hired Marijke Lynne Bekken, the SDSU graduate student, to study the  nitrate problem in Ramona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Triple the EPA Standard  </P> <P> In one particular sampling of 24 wells, Bekken found that 15 exceeded the EPA  limit for nitrates in water, with one well measuring 34.5 milligrams per liter,  or more than triple the EPA standard. Bekken then solicited well users from  throughout Ramona to bring her samples of water, and, out of 98, 41 tested over  the standard.  </P> <P> Though no one is criticizing Bekken's raw findings, there is debate over how  large a red flag to wave.  </P> <P> Close wants the county to notify all well users in Ramona that their water may  be dangerous to drink, to conduct a comprehensive study of Ramona's ground  water that would go beyond Bekken's master's thesis and to make land-use  decisions that eventually will reduce the number of dairies and other nitrate  sources in the region.  </P> <P> "When I had my well tested, they gave me a certificate telling me my water was  OK. I believed them," Close said, noting that the test was for bacteria but not  for nitrates. "But it's not safe."  </P> <P> Some of Close's frustration is directed at the state Regional Water Quality  Control Board, which in 1987 approved the expansion of a Ramona dairy herd from  675 to 1,200 cows.  </P> <P> That decision was appealed by Close and others to the State Water Resources  Board in Sacramento, which voted unanimously last October to block the  expansion because it would have had a "significant adverse effect" on Ramona's  ground-water supply.  </P> <P> Close acknowledges that there can be no quick solution to the nitrate problem.  Experts say that if every nitrate source were immediately removed, it would  still take years for the ground water to cleanse itself.  </P> <P> Despite several stories in Ramona's community newspaper about the nitrate  problem, many people say they are not concerned.  </P> <P> Some, like Mary Turner, who has been drinking Ramona well water for 13 years,  say that, since there are no infants at home, "it doesn't concern me."  </P> <P> Julene Gyde, a director on the Ramona-Julian Resource Conservation District and  a resident who lives directly across the street from the dairy that received  Close's wrath, remarked, "I'm more concerned about the pollution in the air and  the problems with the greenhouse effect than I am about nitrates in the water."  </P> <P> But Gyde's neighbor, 67-year-old Luke Greeson, said he doesn't want to take any  chances. "I stopped drinking my well water three or four years ago when I had  it tested. It was high in nitrates. I'm a cautious man, and I'm not sure it  might not harm older people. You never know."  </P> <P> Jim Kast, who moved from Poway to Ramona 10 years ago, said he's concerned  enough by the news to have his well checked regularly. His nitrates are now  half the EPA limit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proud of the Purity  </P> <P> Patrick Kelly relies on a combination of bottled and well water, and boasts, "I  had my water tested, and they said it was cleaner than the city's."  </P> <P> Ruth Meyer, a director of the Ramona Planning Group, said she thinks the  nitrate issue "has been blown out of proportion by special-interest groups who  seem to oppose the dairies."  </P> <P> Still, she concedes: "There is definitely a lot of nitrates in the water. When  we first drilled our well 17 years ago, it was beautiful. But, four or five  years ago, we had our water retested and came to find it had excessive nitrates  and sodium." Today, she drinks bottled water, partly out of uncertainty of the  effect nitrates might have on her elderly parents, who live with her.  </P> <P> Day Hodges, who lives on the north side of Ramona, says he has ground-water  concerns other than the presence of nitrates. "We live next door to the county  dump up here," he noted. He is worried about toxins leaching into the ground  water he draws from.  </P> <P> For their part, county officials acknowledge the problem but say it's not their  business to meddle -- especially once the private well is dug.  </P> <P> But starting last August, county health officials began requiring that anyone  building a home in the Ramona basin first have their domestic water wells  tested not only for bacteria, but for nitrates as well.  </P> <P> Mike Devine, chief of the health department's environmental health services  division, said that if a new well shows the presence of nitrates-as-nitrogen in  levels exceeding the EPA limit of 10 milligrams per liter, his department will  refuse to authorize a building permit for that house.  </P> <P> He said he did not know of any instances since August of new home construction  being denied because of high nitrate levels. That fact, he said, may indicate  not that the nitrates have disappeared, but that well diggers are boring deeper  to penetrate beyond the upper levels of the ground water and tap cleaner water.  </P> <P> Devine said the concern about nitrates serves as a good lesson to people  relying on their own water wells. "People check their cars to the nth degree to  make sure they're in good shape. They should have that same concern about the  water they drink by checking their wells, too. That's the key. People are  taking their well water for granted."  </P> <P> Jack Conway, the associate director of the School of Public Health at SDSU and  Bekken's adviser for her thesis, said he welcomes the public discussion over  the debate.  </P> <P> "There's not cause for hysteria," he said, "but discussion is the better part  of valor."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> WHAT NOW, FOR WORLD COMMERCE, AFTER GATT?  </P> <P> With the breakdown of world trade negotiations last week, hopes for a more open  world economy have faded, at least for now. The Uruguay round of talks on the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was supposed to complete an agreement to  break down trade barriers in farming, services, textiles and other goods, with  benefits to flow to developed and less-developed nations alike.  </P> <P>  But talks broke down in part because of the European Community's refusal to  significantly lower farm subsidies. Now there is a question as to whether GATT  itself can survive.  </P> <P>  For views on the future of world trade amid the collapse of the GATT talks,  Sharon Bernstein interviewed Sebastian Edwards, professor of business economics  at UCLA's Anderson School of Management and a specialist in South American and  Latin American economies, and Bill Lewis, a principal in the McKinsey &amp; Co.  management consulting firm.  </P> <P> Assuming that there will be no world trade agreement like that sought in the  GATT talks, what will international commerce look like in the coming years?  </P> <P> Lewis: At first, the new direction would be towards curtailing the growth rate  of world trade and, if things deteriorate enough, we will actually have a  contraction in trade as we had back in the 1930s.  </P> <P> The world's economies had been heading towards liberalization. If that  direction changes, the impact would be different among different economies,  with unfortunately the strongest impact on countries potentially in a period of  very rapid economic development -- such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile.  </P> <P> Then, secondly, it will impact both Europe and Japan, which depend on trade  more heavily than the United States and also don't have as large or as  homogenous or as integrated a market as the United States. The United States  would also be affected, because to the extent that barriers are put up against  the export of our skills -- or to the extent we retaliate and prevent the  import of products or skills into the U.S. economy -- then U.S. consumers and  U.S. corporations will suffer.  </P> <P> Edwards: The poor countries will be reluctant to protect intellectual property  and open their economic systems to us. At the same time the developing  countries will find that they can't compete in terms of agricultural goods.  </P> <P> Are there any major trading blocs on the horizon?  </P> <P> Lewis: The obvious trading bloc that everybody thinks about is Europe itself.  There is also potential for an Americas trading bloc, if world trade  deteriorates to the point where Europe and Japan and the United States end up  setting up barriers. An Asian bloc is harder to see, in part because of  fragmentation and also for political, historical and cultural differences  across the region.  </P> <P> Do regional trading blocs present potential problems?  </P> <P> Lewis: There's nothing wrong with blocs, they're just clearly a sub-optimum  solution to open trade worldwide. The volume of trade among the potential blocs  is about the same as the volume of trade within the blocs. What that implies is  that trade among the blocs is very, very important, and to the extent that it  is constrained, worldwide efficiency is diminished. There is, however, the  concern that . . . the economic blocs could evolve into political blocs, with  political disputes arising.  </P> <P> What role is likely for developing countries?  </P> <P> Lewis: The breakdown of the GATT talks will make it more difficult for them to  generate the export performance they need to pay off their existing foreign  debt and demonstrate their credit-worthiness for additional debt. It could also  spill over into the political sphere, because it could make it more difficult  for democratic forces that are aligning their destinies with market economies.  </P> <P> Edwards: The talks broke down just at a point when many developing countries,  especially those that have been hit very hard by the debt crisis, have decided  to open up their international trade and abandon protectionism and move toward  freer trade. In particular, it may hurt Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Brazil.  </P> <P> I don't think they will reverse their policies. But what we will see is that  the much needed recovery in South America and Latin America is going to be  delayed and it's not going to be as vigorous or as strong as it would have been  in a more open trade climate. It means we will see some social unrest in these  countries, and we may see some political problems.  </P> <P> What is the future for agricultural trade?  </P> <P> Lewis: It just means that European housewives and taxpayers are going to  continue to pay extraordinarily high prices for food, and especially developing  countries are going to be able to export less in agriculture.  </P> <P> Edwards: The European countries are going to continue to protect their own  agriculture. At a very high cost for their own consumers, it's also going to  hurt North Africa, the United States, New Zealand, Australia and South America.  </P> <P> What is the likely future for international trade in services, such as banking  and insurance?  </P> <P> Edwards: Instead of having an automatic and broad-based agreement, we will have  to rely on bilateral negotiations, which are more cumbersome, costly and much  more complicated. We have been successful in these kinds of negotiations with  Korea, but it has been a very, very long and costly negotiating process.  </P> <P> There will continue to be a fragmentation between the industrial countries,  where banking and insurance is pretty much integrated, and the less developed  countries, where there are a number of barriers for the international banks and  insurance companies.  </P> <P> The United States would not be able to come in and do business in these other  countries as much as we would like to. We will be able to participate less  actively in the world trade of those areas where we have efficiency, such as  banking and insurance. That means that the trade deficit will probably be  larger and the economy as a whole is going to grow more slowly.  </P> <P> What should the United States do to improve its role in international trade?  </P> <P> Lewis: The biggest problem of other countries being protectionist is that it  engenders retaliation on our part, which penalizes us because it denies access  of our consumers to the best skills in the world. On the other hand, that  retaliation is what it takes to get liberalized trading policies and the  lowering of barriers. . . . It just may be that we're in a stage where it's  going to take retaliation for us to get the message across.  </P> <P> Edwards: I think that there are a number of areas -- textiles, for example --  where we should revise our quotas and allow more goods to come in. There is  also the issue of manufactured goods from Korea and Japan that one way or  another we try to keep out. We should open up and by so doing encourage  efficiency.  </P></p>

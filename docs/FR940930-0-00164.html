			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this rulemaking, EPA did not propose to set a sales or production volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit for manufacturers wishing to certify according to the Small Volume Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification Program (the ``volume limit''), nor did EPA receive any comments in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking suggesting that such a volume limit should be used. In this circumstance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it should not finalize a volume limit without first providing the public an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to comment on such a limit. Therefore, the portion of today's rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits the use of the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification program to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifiers with an annual sales or production volume of 10,000 or fewer converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, shall be effective on November 29, 1994, unless the information collection requirements contained in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, EPA will publish a timely document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  delaying the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. If, on or before October 31, 1994. EPA does not receive notification that someone wishes to file an adverse or negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the volume limit portion of the rule, then the volume limit portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will become final and effective without further EPA action. On the other hand, if,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on or before October 31, 1994, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives notification that someone wishes to file adverse or negative comment on the volume limit portion of the rule, EPA will withdraw the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume limit portion of the rule. EPA will then repropose the volume limit and go  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through full notice-and-comment procedures before adopting the volume limit. If EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were to withdraw this portion of the rule, all certifiers would be able to certify according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program until and unless EPA issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a final rule that established a different requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small-volume manufacturers certification program_durability testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Small-Volume Manufacturer's Certification Program, a certifier will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to demonstrate durability unless the certifier is specifically authorized to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another certifier's durability data and deterioration factors. If deterioration factors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not available, certifiers will be required to use assigned deterioration factors from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small-Volume Manufacturer's Certification Program. Current regulations require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned deterioration factors be determined based on the seventieth percentile of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry-wide gasoline-fueled vehicle deterioration factors. Since the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration characteristics of vehicles operating on other fuels may be different, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may in the future consider through rulemaking the use of deterioration factors based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on data from vehicles using different fuels when developing deterioration factors for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Small-Volume Manufacturers Program requires manufacturers to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full low mileage emission data which show compliance with new vehicle emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, but requires complete durability testing only for vehicles with unproven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. Certification through use of the small-volume certification program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the burden of durability testing for small volume manufacturers while providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable assurance of emission compliance. Public comment was received that to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further reduce the burden on small volume manufacturers, EPA should accept as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven technology under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Program any aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion technology that has been durability tested and certified under CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bench testing rules <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  or has been durability tested using on-road mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 2030 and 2031 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As specified in 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;2, EPA will accept bench or road test data that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been demonstrated to be equal or more severe than certification mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation requirements to satisfy the requirements for proven technology under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small-Volume Manufacturers Program. Thus, durability test data collected to satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB's bench testing rules or by on-road mileage accumulation could be submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA for review under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Program. EPA reserves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to evaluate the adequacy of such data, and acceptance by CARB will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute automatic acceptance by EPA. It should be noted that EPA requires in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to demonstrate that bench and on-road durability testing is equal or more severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than certification mileage accumulation requirements. For example, actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature trace data collected during vehicle operation must be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the temperature experienced during bench aging testing is at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as severe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should also be noted that EPA will only permit the use of provisions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small-Volume Certification Program to demonstrate the durability of technology that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently used in automotive applications. For technology that has not previously been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in automotive applications in certified vehicles the full mileage accumulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability requirements will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also establishing other requirements with which certifiers must comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For vehicles converted under today's regulations, the certifier must list each installer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which produces CFV conversions on the certification application for that CFV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion. A revised list must be submitted as new installers are authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce the conversion configuration. Because the certifier will be treated as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer for purposes of sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, EPA anticipates that certifiers will enter into legally binding agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with installers to ensure that installers are exercising due care in performing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation and meeting other obligations under today's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

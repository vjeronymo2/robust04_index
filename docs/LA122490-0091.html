			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> PLAY AREA APPROVED FOR JEFFREY-LYNNE  </P> <P> Children living in Anaheim's Jeffrey-Lynne area behind Disneyland will soon  have a new place to play, ending years of hazardous street recreation in the  tiny, crowded neighborhood.  </P> <P> Just this month, a child playing in the streets was hit by a car, and although  he was not harmed, the accident renewed pleas from the community for a safer  play area.  </P> <P> "It's real close to home for a lot of parents -- the need for a park," said  Anita Castro-Zvoda, director of the neighborhood's community center.  </P> <P> Earlier last week, city officials approved a long-delayed plan to close off one  of the neighborhood streets to traffic and convert it into a play area.  </P> <P> Audre Drive, between Jeffrey and Hampstead streets, will be limited to  pedestrian traffic. Play equipment and shrubbery will replace asphalt.  </P> <P> Construction, scheduled to begin in February, will take less than a month,  officials said.  </P> <P> Residents who attended a neighborhood meeting last week voiced concerns about  the safety of the park in the neighborhood, which was once a haven for drug  dealers and gang members.  </P> <P> Residents said they were also concerned about losing parking spaces on Audre  Drive, once it becomes a park. Many families renting apartments in the densely  populated neighborhood said their landlords charge them rent to park in the  apartment garages, and rather than pay the additional fees, they park in the  streets.  </P> <P> "The reality is we're going to lose some parking places, and there's going to  be some obvious parking problems," said Castro-Zvoda. She said she hopes to  work with the landlords to make the garages more affordable for the residents.  </P> <P> The play area on Audre Drive has been a dream since residents first organized  and began lobbying the city to help take better care of their neighborhood a  few years ago.  </P> <P> The park will not be grassy when first constructed but will include potted  trees and play equipment such as swings. It may also include a temporary  community center.  </P> <P> If the first, one-year phase of the park is successful, without problems due to  parking or a return of gang or drug activity, the city will close the street,  plant grass and build a permanent community center.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF AMERICA EVER RUNS OUT OF IDEAS, IT'LL RUN OUT OF ENERGY;  </P> <P> TIME TO PUT NUCLEAR POWER IN PERSPECTIVE AND DEVELOP OTHER OPTIONS  </P> <P> The United States will not soon break petroleum's stranglehold on its way of  life because it has nothing to take the place of oil. Why? In large part  because political and industrial leaders have refused to level with American  voters. Instead, they led Americans to think they can avoid hard energy  choices, on nuclear power or any other energy source. Instead, they led them  into an energy trap.  </P> <P> Disposing of nuclear waste is just one example. For nearly two decades, the  nuclear industry preached that getting rid of nuclear waste was more a matter  of political will than technical skill. If politicians would stop pandering to  public concerns about where to bury nuclear waste, the message went, safe  hiding places would be found in short order.  </P> <P> You don't hear that sermon anymore. Not since Nevada's Yucca Mountain, the sole  survivor of a long list of possible waste sites, began sending geological  signals that it may not be the perfect place that scientists once said it was.  </P> <P> Not that the bureaucrats were wrong about Washington's lack of backbone.  </P> <P> Congress seized upon the general sentiment among Americans that nuclear power  is a good thing -- as long as it is being generated far from their  neighborhoods. Thus, members wanted to keep government geologists from poking  around granite masses in their own Atlantic states or salt domes in states  along the Gulf of Mexico. So they effectively put every place but Yucca  Mountain off limits.  </P> <P> The Yucca site, northwest of Las Vegas, no longer seems the perfect place,  because there is some evidence that ancient earthquakes have let deep ground  water force its way to the surface through cracks in the rock. If so, it could  happen again. And if canisters of radioactive fuel rods were buried in the  mountain, some future earthquake could send water into the Yucca nuclear waste  burial site. If the ground water bathed canisters that were still hot, the  encounter could cause a steam explosion that would scatter radioactivity around  the West. Some scientists say this notion is far-fetched, but it could leach  radioactive waste into Nevada's water table and perhaps into California's.  </P> <P> Further study may show that Yucca is as safe as any place, or a better site may  turn up. But that could take 20 years.  </P> <P> The 1982 law that narrowed the search to Yucca Mountain also requires  scientists to certify that any disposal site the government chooses will stay  bone dry for 10,000 years. Science can deliver no such guarantee, the National  Academy of Sciences said in July, only the best possible research.  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had that figured out before the academy  report was issued; his team was told to stop trying to find evidence to support  Congress' choice of Yucca Mountain and was ordered to prepare a study based  solely on science.  </P> <P> What happened at Yucca is a classic example of energy decisions without energy  policy. First, Congress picked a desert site so remote from most Americans that  few members would get complaints from home. Technicians then tried to prove  that burying nuclear waste was simple when politics did not interfere.  </P> <P> Watkins' energy report may be Washington's last chance to level with Americans  about their energy future. It must start a free-swinging debate over the real  energy choices. It must force the nation to decide whether it can live with  only a promise from science that it will do its best to bury nuclear waste  safely. If not, does nuclear power have a real future? How much should be spent  on alternative energy resources? And what should they be?  </P> <P> Setting energy policy by following the line of least resistance is leading  toward a buildup of 400,000 or more American troops in the Middle East, the  world's largest treasure of oil. Guarding that treasure may be America's only  choice, but the desperate fact is that nobody knows for sure -- because nobody  asked the hard questions on energy policy. Time is up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GROWING POWER  </P> <P> Nuclear's share of U.S. electricity output.  </P> <P> 1980  </P> <P> Oil: 10.8%  </P> <P> Nuclear: 11.0%  </P> <P> Hydro and other: 12.3%  </P> <P> Natural gas: 15.1%  </P> <P> Coal: 50.8%  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989*  </P> <P> Oil: 5.5%  </P> <P> Natural gas: 9.3%  </P> <P> Hydro and other: 10.3%  </P> <P> Nuclear: 19.0%  </P> <P> Coal: 55.9%  </P> <P> * Projected based on nine-month figures  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Council for Energy Awareness.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the rule affects pollutants which ``cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare'' (Section 202(a)(1)). Hydrocarbons, as ozone precursors, have long been an essential object of emission control strategies (both vehicles and non-vehicles). Ambient ozone is an irritant that adversely affects pulmonary membranes, lung tissues, and lung functions, and is also associated with adverse ecological effects. Refueling emissions also contain benzene, a Group A human carcinogen. The gasoline vapors themselves also adversely affect public health and welfare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, and perhaps most compelling, is the large amount of refueling emissions which arise from these LDTs. In 1990, trucks represented about 33 percent of the gasoline used by highway motor vehicles. Using American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) figures, retail truck sales have increased at a compound annual rate of 4&hyph;5 percent over the past ten years, and this growth is projected to continue well into the next century. This increase in sales and market fraction has led to an increase in the gasoline used by trucks. The fraction of gasoline used by LDTs is projected to increase to 37 percent by 2000 and continue at that level or higher in the future. Thus, the percentage of the refueling emissions inventory attributable to LDTs is large and is expected to increase in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another way to look at the magnitude of the emissions from LDTs is the equivalent gram per mile (g/mi) emission rate attributable to their uncontrolled refueling emissions. As shown in the RIA, taking into account Phase II RVP control and the RVP effects of reformulated gasoline, the nationwide uncontrolled refueling emission rate during the ozone season for LDTs is about 0.22 g/mi. These are large emission rates in contrast to those controlled by other strategies being implemented under the 1990 CAAA and being considered by the states in their State Implementation Plans. A good example is the Clean-Fuel Fleet requirements under section 246 of the CAA and the Low Emission Vehicle program being implemented in California and perhaps in other states. In these cases the equivalent emission reductions are in the range of 0.12 to 0.18 g/mile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, EPA believes that ORVR controls are technologically feasible for LDTs. Reports and other materials submitted to the docket over the past several years as well as comments by the regulated industry indicate that prototype ORVR systems have been installed on a number of passenger cars and light trucks (IV&hyph;A&hyph;06, IV&hyph;D&hyph;682, 680, 682, 685, 688, 864, 701, 712, 718, 719, 720, 721, IV&hyph;E&hyph;50, 73). As is now the case with evaporative control systems, we anticipate that the control technology used for LDT ORVR systems will be very similar to that applied to LDVs. Although there are some differences between LDV and LDT fuel systems (e.g., tank size in some larger LDTs), the general fuel system concepts, designs, and configurations are very similar. In addition, vehicles in both classes must meet the recently promulgated enhanced evaporative emission control requirements beginning in the 1996 model year. As with LDVs, EPA anticipates that the same evaporative emission control technology can be applied to control refueling emissions in LDTs. To ensure that the enhanced evaporative control system canister and purge system can be applied to ORVR controls, EPA is applying the same refueling emission test procedure approach to LDTs as is being applied to LDVs. The only significant design difference will be the need for some form of a fillneck seal. However, with the anticipated liquid seal approach this requires at most a minor fillneck modification and does not involve new hardware.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While there are vehicle-to-vehicle differences in fuel system designs, these affect both the evaporative and refueling emission rates for a given vehicle/fuel system design. To EPA's knowledge there is nothing unique about the design or function of LDT fuel systems relative to LDVs which would suggest that the test procedure approach being applied to LDVs would not be equally effective for LDTs in accomplishing the goal of allowing the widespread use of integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling emission control systems. Although uncertainty has been expressed, no commenter provided data or even a substantiated argument to support the view that the test procedure modifications would not be equally effective in facilitating LDT use of integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling control systems. In fact, testing conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC&hyph;APRAC Project VE&hyph;6) (IV&hyph;D&hyph;565) and EPA (II&hyph;A&hyph;06) indicate no significant difference between LDV and LDT uncontrolled refueling emission rates. As is the case for LDVs, the refueling test procedure approach described above should allow the widespread use of integrated refueling/evaporative control systems for LDTs. Thus, since there is no problem with applying enhanced evaporative control systems to LDTs, there should be no problem with integrated evaporative/ refueling control systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

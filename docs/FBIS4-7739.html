			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Pal Eotvos </F> and Peter Vajda; place and date not given: "The Liberal Efforts  Are Slightly Unrealistic"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Mr. Boross,  if we look beyond the coming elections and try to think without  considering the election results, in your opinion, what dangers  should Hungary take into consideration?    [Boross] Naturally, the unfavorable economic situation could  represent a basic danger. In addition, our domestic economy  greatly depends on foreign developments. Irrespective of its  causes, economic decline could have social consequences. In a  deteriorating economic situation, one cannot calm the people by  claiming the inevitability of such a deterioration, and the  demands from the government in power become quite simplified.  Of course, this is so not only in Hungary but all over Europe.  We cannot exclude this danger either: If economic  deterioration leads to strikes and demonstrations, there will be  no inflow of capital. So much for the economy. I see an  internal political danger if conditions for a coalition capable  of forming a lasting government fail to materialize....    [NEPSZABADSAG] Can we count on the creation of a really  stable government?    [Boross] The obligatory pre-election optimism dictates that  such a government could also emerge this time, after we  succeeded in forming one four years ago. On the other hand,  this is not certain, because a coalition made up of too many  parties might also emerge; for example, a coalition made up of  five parties is difficult to handle because its fate could  depend on the smallest participant.    [NEPSZABADSAG] How many parties could form a still workable  coalition? What about a coalition made up of three parties?    [Boross] Our coalition is also made up of three parties.  The greater the number of parties in a coalition, the more  unstable the situation. Government ineptitude can also lead to  danger even in the case of a stable coalition.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you think of external dangers?    [Boross] There is no external danger threatening Hungary at  the moment; at the same time, a certain level of political  instability can be felt in three areas, those with Hungarian  minority populations. There will be elections in Slovakia in  the autumn, and we do not know what the results of these  elections will be. A certain disadvantage is always involved  here regarding steady contacts. Political life in Romania is  also changing, and there is the small Yugoslavia to mention here  too. However, in spite of all this, I do not feel a direct  danger of events in any of these countries, events that could  seriously threaten the situation of Hungarians. [passage  omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] There are various views of Hungary's  international image and the national minority issue, which is  indivisible from relations with our neighbors. According to  some, there is a long-term solution: Animosity will stop with  economic prosperity, which will hopefully take place in the  region at more or less the same time.    [Boross] Every country strives to present a favorable image.  There are countries in the former Eastern bloc which do this  more loudly than us. A certain type of rivalry is therefore  inevitable. However, this does not have too much in common with  our bilateral relations. Stable governments are essential for  these contacts, because people are negotiating with people. It  does not help if the relevant people on the other side keep  changing. When we met in Prague, Meciar told me that we could  solve all the problems in two hours if the two of us got  together. And now, when we negotiate, we have to get together  with someone else. Given that the issues also include a  long-term solution of national minority contacts, I must mention  that two neighboring countries received suggestions from the  Council of Europe on membership. These suggestions are  generally verified. [passage omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] Mr. Boross, speaking of various government  scenarios, one can hear of the possibility of a grand coalition  government of experts.    [Boross] I cannot evaluate a government of experts. My  government has outstanding experts, and I do not know who could  be better than us. Why would a former departmental head at the  planning office be a better expert?    [NEPSZABADSAG] What about a grand coalition? Does it stand  a chance?    [Boross] I do not see any chance or will for such a  coalition. Even if the oft-mentioned elite were ready for  something like this, they would not be able to do it because the  party behind them would disappear. The political reality is  that the members would not forgive the party for such an  alliance. Therefore, this does not depend on five relatively  wise people getting together and saying that, although they hate  one another and make contradictory promises, they should form an  alliance because there is trouble now. Such things only happen  in fairy tales.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Finland is such an example....    [Boross] That is true. But such a possibility only emerges  after two decades of democracy, after many things have been  tested, and a political concept and view has emerged that has  different priorities. In Hungary, the priority to win still  prevails. [passage omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] Although there is publicity in Hungary, we  also notice that it is not functioning. For example, Finance  Minister Ivan Szabo announces one morning that 20 billion  forints has disappeared from the banks. It was interesting and  bitter to notice the lack of any public outcry and also that the  apparatus ignored the issue. I could also mention privatization  matters that were not dug out or stressed by the press.... Do  you think that there is both political and moral apathy in  Hungary?    [Boross] We are now following a lengthy dictatorship, and  every country in this region is complaining about low morality.  One should not be surprised at this, given the precedents. On  the other hand, distorted information has played a major role in  the emergence of concrete affairs. As interior minister, I  submitted an internal report to the government on banking  affairs investigated by the police: A lot of things, from  embezzling to stupidity, can be the reason for the disappearance  of that 20 billion forints. Ivan Szabo did not participate in  one part of the government session and issued a statement the  next day, and this led to the "affair." I do not know how the  population reacted to it, but the press reacted very strongly;  however, the various commentaries failed to mention that this  amount only made up 1 percent of the outstanding balance of some  2 trillion forints. [passage omitted]    [NEPSZABADSAG] We have heard that you are ready to  participate in a televised debate. NEPSZABADSAG would gladly  participate in such a debate. Are there any plans for a  television debate?    [Boross] As far as I know, a televised debate with the  participation of Orban, Peto, Horn, and Surjan will be aired on  2 May.</p>

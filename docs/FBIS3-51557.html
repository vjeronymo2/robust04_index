			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gilberto Rodriguez Rugama] </F>   [Excerpt] Esteli -- Urgent. Sporadic clashes between the  Sandinist People's Army [EPS] and remnant groups of the  dismantled 3-80 Northern Front [NF 3-80] continue in the  mountains Region 1. There have been seven encounters that left  21 casualties, including dead and wounded, during the first 20  days of 1994.    Major Maximo Zeledon, commander of the EPS 1st Command, has  reported that the recent confrontations took place in El  Zungano, El Chipole, Jabalines in Quilali, San Jeronimo in  Jicaro, and other areas in the mountains of Murra and San Juan  del Rio Coco. He added that nine recontras had been killed and  the same number wounded during those actions. Likewise, the  military commander regretted that two EPS members had been  killed in combat and one had been wounded. The latter is  currently out of danger and improving satisfactorily, he added.    Zeledon revealed that there had only been casualties in the  clashes at San Jeronimo, Jicaro, and Chipote, Quilali. He said  no rebel or EPS casualties resulted from the other clashes.  <H5>  Criminal Activities </H5>   The military commander reported that there are currently  approximately 150 rebels scattered in small groups. He added  that the rebels are mainly engaged in criminal activities and  that their actions negatively affect the civilians who live or  travel in the rural areas, especially in the San Juan del Rio  Coco, Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, and Ciudad Antigua regions.    He pointed out that the chieftains of the remnant NF 3-80  groups are El Vengador, Magnum, Martin Negro, Franklin, Flecha,  Carlos 19, Otoniel, Coyote, and others. Zeledon said those  rebels are continuing their criminal activities and are causing  uncertainty and instability in the rural areas. Thus, the EPS  will continue to fight them until their criminal actions cease,  Major Maximo Zeledon added.    Due to the military presence in the area and the  dismantlement of the rebel groups, five recontras have deserted  in January and surrendered their weapons to the EPS. The  soldiers have given them security, respected their lives, and  turned them over to Catholic Church and Human Rights Commission  representatives and to their respective relatives.  <H5>  The Surrender of Two Recontras </H5>   Bishop Juan Abelardo Malta reported receiving former rebels  Pablo Tercero Sanchez (a) "El Grifo," who is 27 years old and  originally from Panali in Quilali, and Miguel Angel Rivera  Rodriguez (a) "Solin," who is 18 years old and originally from  Caulatu, from the EPS at its 1st Command headquarters in Esteli  on 19 January. Bishop Malta said the former rebels had taken an  important, positive step. He added that the rest of the rebels  should also reenter regular civilian life and continue to fight  for their country through civic means and not with weapons which  only bring pain and death to Nicaraguan society.

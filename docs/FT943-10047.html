			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Power review poised to please City but irk users Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is likely to face severe criticism on Thursday when he announces price controls which could cut household bills from next April by more than 3 per cent. His review, which will determine the profits of the 12 English and Welsh power distribution companies for the next five years, is widely expected to be tougher than last month's price limits for water companies. But the market remains optimistic, and electricity shares have risen sharply recently. Consumer groups and opposition political parties are expected to condemn the price cuts as inadequate in light of the growth in profits of regional electricity companies. Analysts expect Prof Littlechild to cut the average base distribution price  -which accounts for about a quarter of final bills but 80 per cent of profits - by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in April 1995. He is then expected to limit price increases between 1996 and the year 2000 to 2 percentage points below inflation. The average range is wide largely because few people have any clear idea of the methodology being employed by Prof Littlechild in making his decisions. It seems almost certain, however, that the rate of annual increase from 1996 will be common across the sector while the initial cut in distribution prices next April will vary from company to company. Mr Nigel Hawkins of stockbroker Hoare Govett expects the range for the base reduction to be tight, with cuts of between 12 per cent and 18 per cent for individual companies. Most analysts expect Eastern and Southern Electricity to be well placed in this regard, while the regulator is likely to take a tougher approach to South Western and Swalec. Brokers SG Warburg, in a note published today, expect an average reduction of 10 per cent in distribution prices next year and an annual real increase of RPI minus 3 percentage points afterwards. This is not expected to be too painful for shareholders, however. Warburg is confident the sector can return 7 per cent real dividend growth between 1995 and 2000 assuming companies are prepared to reduce cover to two times. 'Even under the most draconian prospects, real dividend growth of at least 4 per cent is sustainable,' it says. The real risk for shareholders was whether electricity companies would decide to exercise their right to appeal against the regulator's decision to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. One analyst said after talks with most of the 12 companies that he did not expect referrals to the commission. 'They are in a jubilant mood,' he said. He was now forecasting a base reduction of 14 per cent and annual increases of 2 percentage points below inflation, which would allow real dividend growth of 6 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron] </F>   [Text] The Liberal Party hierarchy met today with President  Carlos Roberto Reina and his main advisers to discuss issues  related to the country's political situation. President Carlos  Roberto Reina stated the following:    [Begin Reina recording] The entire ministers cabinet met  with  the members of the Central Executive Council. The meeting took  place in an extremely frank and open manner. It is no surprise  to anyone that every new administration must confront situations  that may tarnish the normal manner in which governments are  conformed. There are commitments by party leaders which must be  met. Someone who participated in the meeting said that it is a  very difficult task for a politician who has promised certain  things during the campaign to visit the ministers and high  government officials because they always find some problems to  solve at that exact moment. That is something normal because on  the one hand the ministers and officials are organizing and  tremendous expectations are created during the election  campaign. In addition, there is little time to solve every  expectation in detail, and most of all in such a short period of  time.    I have already announced that next Monday I will address the  nation where I will talk about two fundamental issues: first the  current state of the nation as well as how we received it, and  secondly, a detailed government program for the next four years.  The purpose of this meeting was to create fluid communications  so that the high government officials who do not have sufficient  time due to valid reasons, may proceed to honor campaign  promises through responsible persons appointed in each of the  ministries to undertake such a task. There are political  commitments that were made during the campaign and we plan to  honor them. In addition, we have also scheduled a meeting with  the Liberal Party bloc to prevent any misunderstandings. I was  extremely satisfied when Mr. Jaime Rosenthal Oliva, a very  important Liberal Party leader, expressed his genuine  acknowledgement of our efforts. [end recording]    With respect to the numerous demands by Liberal party  activists who want a position within the government, President  Carlos Roberto Reina stated as follows.    [Begin recording] [Reina] We covered the issue, but it is  not  easy to find openings to the nearly 1 million votes we obtained  during the elections. That is impossible. But what we do seek  to do is implement some mechanism whereby a head of a department  or even a deputy will have access to the ministers of the  autonomous institutions to find selection mechanism that are  just and fair.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Reina] I would say a sort of modus operandi as they say in  international vernacular. [end recording]    One month after taking office, President Reina pointed out  that he had already made some important decisions, but that he  has stepped aside and delegated responsibilities to some of his  ministers.    [Begin Reina recording] Previously, a president was someone  who would sit at his desk simply signing agreements affecting  the lowest janitor and the highest government official. I have  passed on some responsibilities to the appropriate ministers,  and reserved some duties for myself. A president who simply  sits and signs documents is a president who cannot work and does  not make the political decisions he must constantly make. I  have already made some political decisions. For example, I have  delimited the border with the Republic of El Salvador. That is  a national objective which we plan to carry out and explain  shortly. Tomorrow I have a meeting planned at the Foreign  Ministry to discuss the issue, and we cannot procrastinate any  longer on this issue which is so crucial to Honduras. [end  recording]    With respect to this issue, President Reina indicated that  during the first 15 days of March he plans to visit the  territories recovered from El Salvador especially (Nawaterique)  and Dolores. The objective of the visit is to speak to residents  of the region as well as to confirm the effectiveness of the  border demarcation.</p>

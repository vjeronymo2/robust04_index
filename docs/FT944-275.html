			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Populist who struck it lucky in Brazil: President Franco is set to hand over peacefully In the film Being There, Peter Sellers played a nobody whose simple philosophies enchanted the public and nearly propelled him to the White House. In Brazil, where real life often seems stranger than Hollywood, the story came true. Mr Itamar Franco, a small-town politician almost unknown outside his home state of Minas Gerais, was picked as running mate for Mr Fernando Collor, who at first appeared to have little chance of winning 1989's presidential election. After Mr Collor won, then resigned two years ago, Mr Franco was swept into the presidency and has appeared startled by the television lights ever since. After a disastrous beginning, Mr Franco has won over many Brazilians. In July, his government launched a new currency, the Real, which brought inflation tumbling down and greatly helped the poor. Instead of being booed during walkabouts, as happened earlier this year, he is now applauded. When he leaves office on January 1, he will hand over to a successor he helped elect. Explaining these successes is as complicated as Mr Franco's unpredictable character. Brazil's economic and political outlook improved under his leadership, but historians may decide this was due to luck rather than presidential judgment. A populist who took office with a poor understanding of economics and few political allies, and prone to lose his temper, Mr Franco, 64, often appeared to have little appetite for the job. After probably his most embarrassing moment, when he was photographed flirting with a knickerless actress at this year's carnival, he compounded the error by telephoning her the next day. The actress, who was trying to revive her career rather than pick up the president, let the press listen in on the conversation. Despite such setbacks, Mr Franco's two-year presidency will be remembered as a time of opening for the protected economy, and for the Real, which looks to be the country's best chance yet to kick its inflationary habit. Sadly for Mr Franco, his predecessor Mr Collor will probably gain the credit for the first of these achievements, while his successor Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso will be praised for the second. It was Mr Collor who cut average tariffs from more than 50 per cent to 14 per cent and told industry to improve productivity. Mr Collor also agreed with President Carlos Menem of Argentina that the Mercosur customs union linking the two countries with Paraguay and Uruguay should be accelerated and come into effect on January 1 1995 rather than five years later. The opening of the economy, as well as disastrous shock measures from 1990 designed to combat inflation, sent Brazil into deep recession. When it started to recover in 1993, helped by a more competitive private sector and rising commodity prices, Mr Collor was out of office and Mr Franco was in place to take the credit. Although he was criticised for appearing to have no overall economic policy, and for losing three finance ministers in seven months, Mr Franco's first full year in office saw gross domestic product grow by about 5 per cent, compared to zero or negative growth since 1990. This year, helped by the Real's success, growth should be about 4 per cent. Mr Cardoso's appointment in May last year as Mr Franco's fourth finance minister was the real turning point for the government's fortunes. Mr Cardoso, a former academic and skilled politician, assembled a team of economists to launch a new currency specifically designed to stop inflation and elect him as the next president. Mr Franco also agreed, for the first time since becoming president, that he would cede control over the economy to the finance ministry. 'Other than personal friends, the president only fully trusted Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was also the only man alert enough to (Mr Franco's) sensitivities,' according to an outgoing government member. After the Real's introduction in July, popularity ratings for Mr Franco and his government rose as quickly as inflation fell. Mr Cardoso's votes also mounted, and he comfortably won October's election. In Brazil's turbulent politics, Mr Franco is one of the few presidents to have handed power peacefully to his chosen successor. Mr Franco said recently that a big regret was his failure to increase the minimum wage, because of a lack of funds. Critics are harsher, pointing out that his prickly character and style of management often left the government leaderless, with different ministries unaware of each others' actions. His refusal to back much needed constitutional reforms earlier this year ensured their failure. His occasional outbursts, such as a threat to ignore an unfavourable Supreme Court ruling, reinforced international perceptions of the fragility of Brazil's institutions. Yet, as at the end of Being There, Mr Franco's supporters are already musing about his chances of running for the presidency in 1998.</p>

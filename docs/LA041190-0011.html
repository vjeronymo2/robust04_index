			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SEEK WEST'S TECHNOLOGY TO SPEED FREE-MARKET REFORM  </P> <P> The Soviet Union made a strong pitch Tuesday for Western help in its  free-market reform by asking for talks to ease restrictions on the sale of high  technology.  </P> <P> Stepan Sitaryan, chairman of the State Foreign Economic Commission, said such  Western limits "should no longer remain a sacred cow."  </P> <P> Sitaryan also hailed an international accord, reached Monday in Bonn, that  commits the Soviets to backing free-market economic reform. He said the pact  conforms to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program, known as  perestroika.  </P> <P> "Many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the Bonn document . . .  have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the Soviet Union," Sitaryan  said in a speech to the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. The conference ends today.  </P> <P> Sitaryan said the West's so-called COCOM restrictions on high-technology sales  to Eastern Europe present "certain complications" to restructuring the Soviet  economy. COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls.  </P> <P> "We propose that East-West consultations begin on rules to govern the transfer  of dual-purpose technology," Sitaryan told reporters after his speech,  referring to products and equipment that can be used for civilian or military  purposes.  </P> <P> He said the Soviet Union is willing to agree to inspection procedures so the  West can verify that high-technology equipment is not being used for military  purposes.  </P> <P> The COCOM nations are already working on proposals for loosening restrictions  on technology sales to reforming East Bloc countries. However, the United  States has indicated it will take a tougher stand toward the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In Monday's pact, the 35 nations at the conference -- the United States, Canada  and all European countries except Albania -- informally endorsed a document  committing them to support private property, free enterprise and multi-party  democracy.  </P></p>

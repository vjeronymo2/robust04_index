			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Italy to issue DM4bn Eurobonds: Government takes steps to supplement depleted foreign currency reserves THE ITALIAN government, absent from international capital markets for two years, is expected to test its credibility among foreign investors this week as it launches one of the largest Eurobonds issued in D-Marks. The planned issue, expected to raise about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to supplement depleted foreign currency reserves, would be the first since last year's political crisis and the currency turmoil which led to the suspension of the lira from the European exchange rate mechanism. Deutsche Bank has been asked to arrange the country's first-ever Eurobond offering in D-Marks which could be launched as early as today. Italy's credit standing has deteriorated over the past two years, forcing it to abandon the international financial markets and rely instead on domestic savers to finance its large budget deficit. Italy, which until the early 1990s enjoyed the top triple-A rating allowing it to borrow at the cheapest rates, suffered an unusual two-notch cut in its rating by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, in the midst of last summer's political and economic turmoil. This blow to Italy's credit standing has been one factor encouraging the government to tackle its budget deficit. The government of Mr Giuliano Amato has pushed through a tough austerity package for 1993. The new issue will be be one of the largest D-Mark Eurobond issues seen so far and compares with the DM5.5bn issue launched in October by the British government, one of a succession of European countries which queued up to borrow the German currency after last year's European currency crisis depleted their foreign currency reserves. Some central banks had an obligation to repay the Bundesbank in D-Marks for the support it gave to their currencies. The pricing of the bonds is expected to be cautious to reflect the importance of the issue's success. A meeting of banks will be held in Frankfurt today, and pricing is likely to take place tomorrow. They are expected to have a maturity of five years and offer a yield spread of 50-55 basis points (0.5 to 0.55 percentage points) over the yield of five-year German government bonds. This compares with a spread of around 10 basis points for the UK issue in October, although spreads for all borrowers have widened since then. The issue will also be the first test of the country's worldwide standing since international banks suffered problems last year with Efim, the Italian state holding company which was put into voluntary liquidation last July. Italian borrowers were also effectively shut out of the international syndicated loans market while bankers lobbied the Italian authorities for a commitment to repay Efim's debts in full. Although the authorities eventually agreed, bankers have still not received their money. International capital markets, Pages 15-16</p>

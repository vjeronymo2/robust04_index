			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (8): The new constitution The main item on the constituent assembly's agenda is the removal of the 1853 constitution's ban on successive presidential terms to allow President Carlos Menem to stand for re-election next year. If all goes according to plan, the new constitution will allow re-election of the president to a second, four-year term. At present, the president serves for a single six-year term. If Mr Menem wins the 1995 presidential elections, he will govern Argentina up to the end of 1999, when he will be 69. He would not be allowed to run for a third term. As well as this, a number of other items are up for debate. The indirect electoral college election system will be abandoned and replaced with a two-round direct election. If the winner gets more than 45 per cent of votes there need be no second round election. Equally, if the winning candidate gets 40 per cent of the vote but leads the second candidate by 10 percentage points, there need be no second round. These elaborate rules were drafted bearing in mind the Peronist party's traditional 40-45 per cent share of the vote. A cabinet chief, a sort of prime minister, will become responsible for 'general administration of the country' exercising powers 'delegated by the president'. The cabinet chief can be removed by both houses of Congress with a simple majority vote. The opposition Radicals hope this will reduce the president's powers, but Mr Menem has already said he will not cede full presidential powers. The 48-member Senate will be increased by half. The extra 24 seats will be allocated to the opposition parties in each of the 23 provinces and the federal district of Buenos Aires. The executive's legislative powers, principally the right to issue emergency decrees, will be restricted. The president will be forbidden from decreeing on tax, criminal law or electoral issues. However, the role of Congress in ratifying or rejecting presidential decrees is not clear. A council of jurists will select judges and oversee management of the judiciary. At present, judges are selected by the executive and approved by the Senate. The Supreme Court is responsible for the management of the judiciary. This amendment is meant to strengthen the independence of the courts, since judges are often appointed for political reasons. However, the rules governing the council will be written by the Peronist-dominated Congress. The head of the National Audit Bureau will be nominated by the opposition and be subordinated to Congress. At present the toothless Audit Bureau is part of the executive. The mayor of Buenos Aires will be elected. At present the president appoints the mayor. The federal district of Buenos Aires is a traditional Radical stronghold, and this was intended to benefit the Radicals. However, they have lost the last two elections in the city and would do so again if the elections were held today. The share of financial resources between the federal and provincial governments is to be made more equitable. The tax shareout at present is subject to a number of complex rules that gives the provinces 56 per cent of certain federal taxes, such as value added tax, but not customs revenues. The provincial governors demand that they be given half of all taxes raised by the federal government. In addition to these points, there are other clauses introducing referenda, granting independence to federal prosecutors (currently controlled by the government), protecting the environment and entrenching competition policy and consumer rights in the constitution.</p>

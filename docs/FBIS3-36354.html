Kehris commented on the results of the Baltic conference in  London and the World Economic Forum in Davos.    Latvia should reduce the state influence on economy and  increase the role of private structures in the process of  transfer to a market economy, Thatcher told Kehris.    Thatcher pledged to help Latvia to join international  finance  institutions what could also foster the economic development.  She also accepted an invitation to visit Latvia, Kehris said.    In addition, Kehris met with representatives of the Cable  &amp;  Wireless firm, which together with the Telecom Finland won the  right to modernize the Latvian telecommunication system.    Cable &amp; Wireless has made a commitment to make a major  capital investment into the joint venture and help train  qualified marketing specialists in Latvia.    The safety of British investments in Latvia is guaranteed by  the bilateral treaty on the protection and promotion of  investments, signed during the conference, Kehris said.    Speaking on politics, Kehris said that British officials  denounced Russian Defense Minister Andrei Kozyrev's statement  that placed Latvia in the sphere of Russia's vital interests.    Kehris also acquainted reporters with the conclusions of the  World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.    Latvia should look for economic contacts with Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, Ukraine and other eastern countries because  consultations with these countries' envoys to the forum  evidenced of their wish to cooperate with Latvia.    Russian delegates, for example, offered Latvia a market for  farm produce in St. Petersburg, Kehris said. The deal could  ensure a stable market for Latvian farm products through a  couple of years, he said.    Kehris plans to travel to Kazakhstan and Ukraine soon to  discuss economic cooperation.    On the other hand, Latvia needs the Western help to  encourage  export of local goods and "freely enter into the world market,"  said Kehris.    The world leaders fear that the already rampant inflation in  Russia may rise out of control, Kehris said. Hyperinflation in  Russia may provoke unpredictable consequences on the world  economy, he said.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / A shift of mood favours Clinton: America Before his ennoblement, Mr Nigel Lawson, the former British chancellor, once explained the success of Thatcherism by referring to the tides of history. The Conservatives, he implied, had been borne aloft in the 1980s as much by powerful intellectual currents as by their own efforts. As the Democratic National Convention opens in New York, I wonder whether Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore may not benefit similarly from tidal forces of unsuspected power. The rise of Thatcherism coincided with a global shift towards free markets. This movement continues, but, in the US, the Democrats may benefit from a powerful cross-current. Many now believe that market forces must be supplemented by more effective social and environmental policies. The Clinton/Gore ticket neatly mirrors these anxieties: Mr Clinton has expertise in education, welfare policy and health care; Mr Gore is one of the US's leading environmentalists. Together these baby-boomers can speak with authority on the critical issues of the day. After three years of economic stagnation, economics was bound to play a decisive role in this year's election. But fresh signs that the fragile recovery is again flagging have raised the stakes. The candidate with the most convincing plan for restoring prosperity is certain to have a powerful advantage. Mr Clinton - unlike President George Bush or Mr Ross Perot, the likely independent challenger - has a bold and potentially enormously appealing economic message for the American people, if only he can articulate it properly. It goes under the rubric of 'people economics'. A coterie of close advisers has convinced Mr Clinton that efforts to improve the education and skills of the workforce hold the key to American competitiveness in the next century. The argument - long familiar in Britain  -was well put by Mr Robert Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in The Work of Nations (Knopf 1991). Mr Reich, a fellow Rhodes scholar at Oxford with Mr Clinton, argued that capital mobility and global competition rendered traditional Democratic approaches to the economy obsolete. Rather than focusing on measures to aid industry or promote physical investment, the US had to raise the skills and productivity of the American people - the least mobile factor of production - thus raising their wages regardless of the nationality of their employers. Now listen to Mr Clinton outlining his 'putting people first' economic strategy last month. 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile: capital, factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really rooted in a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its people. The ony way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to have the best educated, best trained workforce in the world . . .' In proposing ways of improving workforce skills, Mr Clinton has moved well beyond the usual focus on the failings of high schools. He wants to: make employers invest in the training of all employees (rather than just top executives) by imposing a training levy equivalent to 1.5 per cent of payroll; improve access to university by allowing all qualified students to borrow from the government and repay either through a low tax on subsequent earnings or by serving the community for a limited period - for example as police officers or teachers; offer new hope for the majority of Americans who do not graduate from college by setting up a national apprenticeship programme loosely based on continental European practice. In America, such proposals are little short of revolutionary. The argument that investing in people - all the people - will secure greater economic prosperity has a good chance of resonating with the general public. Opinion polls show that voters are confused and dismayed by the stagnation of wages since the 1970s. Mr Clinton can offer both an explanation of what went wrong and a cure that sounds plausible. By contrast, the other candidates offer shopworn economic recipes. Mr Perot is respected for his own entrepreneurial success. But on economic policy he has advanced a succession of cliches. He talks of eliminating the Dollars 350bn budget deficit 'without breaking a sweat', yet his only concrete proposal is to cut waste, fraud and abuse. He has criticised the free-trade pact being negotiated with Mexico on the grounds that US employers cannot compete with Mexican wages. Yet simply restricting US access to cheap labour will do nothing to improve US productivity. Mr Bush is even less inspiring. Under his stewardship, the economy has grown more slowly than at any time since the 1930s. He has lost the confidence of conservative supply-siders by acquiescing in minor tax increases and by allowing real federal domestic spending to rise at an annual rate of nearly 9 per cent during his presidency. Yet he has developed no strategy for channelling spending into productive investments, such as those proposed by the Democrats. If Mr Clinton can lay to rest doubts about his character and cogently articulate his vision of 'people first' economics, he has every chance of winning in November.</p>

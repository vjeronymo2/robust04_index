			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Just Self-Defensive Measure"] </F>   [Text] The plot of the United States and some quarters of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat to  isolate and crush our Republic has finally entered a stage of  reckless actions [mubunbyolhan silchondangyee].    As it has already been reported, the 10 June IAEA Board of  Governors meeting shamelessly demanded the opening of our  military sites on the pretext of the nuclear issue and adopted  an extremely unreasonable resolution on the suspension of the  agency's assistance to our country.    Regarding this, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a  statement protesting the IAEA Secretariat's unreasonable  resolution, announcing our withdrawal from the IAEA, clearing  that inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have  accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed, and  reaffirming that UN sanctions will be regarded immediately as a  declaration of war.    Our withdrawal from the IAEA is, by all means, a just  measure  to protect the nation's dignity and sovereignty. As everyone  knows, we joined the IAEA to strengthen international  cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities and to further  develop our independent nuclear power industry, not to receive  somebody's pressure or sanctions while be bound by the agency.    However, some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat who kowtows  to  the U.S. policy of crushing the Republic laid from the beginning  obstacles and difficulties in the way of resolving the issue by  creating nonexistent inconsistency [purilchi]. By doing so,  they compelled us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] [urirohayogum haengmugijonpabangjijoyakeso  taltoehagi anumyon andoege mandueosumnida].    Furthermore, they have led the situation to the extent they  will finally impose sanctions, not satisfied with making demands  on allowing inspections not for guaranteeing the continuity of  safeguards in our special status following the temporary  suspension of our withdrawal from the NPT but tantamount to  routine and ad hoc inspections [chongimit pijonggi sachal].    The more we receive inspections from the agency, the more  pressure and difficulties are imposed on us and our Republic's  security and sovereignty are threatened.    All these are clear proofs that the United States and the  agency's Secretariat are attempting to encroach upon our  sovereignty and to crush us by using the leverage of inspection  [sachariranun kongganul]. Under such condition, is there any  reason for us, who regard sovereignty as our life line, to  remain in the agency and receive unreasonable pressure, having  the nation's dignity and sovereignty infringed upon? Likewise,  how can we promote international cooperation in the realm of  nuclear activities and develop our nuclear power industry  independently when the agency arbitrarily tyrannizes  [chonhoeingul pursinugo] over its member nations by standing on  their heads and serves as a maid of the United States, losing  its impartiality and principles of democracy?    Our decision to withdraw from the IAEA is a just  self-defensive measure against the agency which is scheming  outrageously to impose unreasonable sanctions against us and to  penetrate into our military sites. The IAEA Secretariat's  recent adoption of a resolution on us is an unpardonable act  that gravely encroaches upon our Republic's dignity and  sovereignty, and is an intolerable insult to our people.    With the adoption of an unreasonable resolution, the IAEA  Secretariat has failed to perform its mission as an  international organization and openly joined hands with the  imperialist forces who attempt to crush our socialist system.  By doing so, the IAEA Secretariat, as a stooge of the  imperialists, resulted in smearing ink on its face with its own  hands by weakening its credit in international community.    The agency's sanctions against us is, in essence, a prelude  to a UN resolution. We have clearly affirmed that the UN  resolution will be regarded as a declaration of war. No  pressure nor threat will get through on us. Pressure and threat  will in fact strengthen our will and conviction all the more.    Our people will resolutely deal with it in case any  unreasonable sanctions are imposed on us in the wake of the  unreasonable resolution the IAEA Secretariat recently adopted.</p>

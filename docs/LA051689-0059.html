			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEND SURPLUS TO SCHOOLS, SENATOR URGES  </P> <P> The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on Monday proposed that most of the  surprise windfall of $750 million in state revenue be funneled to financially  strapped local government programs and schools.  </P> <P> The recommendation by Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) represented the first  solid legislative proposal to distribute the money since the "excess" money  first surfaced late last month.  </P> <P> Unless the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian reach an agreement on how to  divvy up the windfall, the lion's share, about $564 million, automatically will  flow to public schools on July 1, under terms of the Proposition 98 education  finance ballot initiative enacted in November.  </P> <P> "By insisting on money that legally is due them on July 1, the education  community easily can be viewed as insensitive and unfair, while other  communities -- particularly the poor, the old and the infirm -- lack proper  care," Alquist told the committee. "We cannot afford to let other legitimate  needs of the state starve while the education community receives an unfair  proportion of available resources."  </P> <P> Alquist did not offer his plan in the form of legislation but sketched the  proposal's broad outlines verbally and asked members of the committee to  consider them and return to him with any comments.  </P> <P> Some Democrats indicated qualified support for the plan, but said they needed  more details. Republican Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim, however, said other  major fiscal issues confronting the Legislature remain to be dealt with before  most Republicans would embrace the Alquist proposal.  </P> <P> Alquist proposed that $300 million of the windfall be channeled to kindergarten  through community college education. Another $250 million would be handed over  to counties in no-strings-attached bloc grants.  </P> <P> The remaining $200 million would be placed in the state budget's reserve fund  for expenditure in the new fiscal year starting July 1.  </P> <P> Presumably, the counties, in turn, would be expected to spend the funds on  physical and mental health care programs, trauma centers, the medically  indigent and the homeless.  </P> <P> The unanticipated revenue was generated chiefly by surprisingly high income tax  payments for 1988.  </P></p>

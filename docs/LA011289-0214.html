			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRAZIL PAYMENTS BOOST CHEMICAL BANK PROFITS  </P> <P> The first major U.S. bank reporting fourth-quarter results, Chemical Banking  Corp., said today its 1988 net income was lifted by Brazil's payments on almost  two years' of interest on its loans.  </P> <P> The No. 4 U.S. banking company's fourth-quarter net profit rose to $288.5  million, or $4.66 a share, from $229.6 million, or $3.83 a share, last year.  </P> <P> The Brazilian payments are also likely to boost year-end results for other  major New York banks, which last year suffered their worst year in history as  Brazil halted its interest payments to commercial banks.  </P> <P> Brazil's stepping up of repayments at the end of last year added $161 million,  net of withholding taxes, to Chemical's fourth-quarter results.  </P> <P> For the year as a whole, Chemical earned $753.6 million, or $12.02 a share. In  1987, it lost $853.7 million, or $16.68 a share, due to adding $1.1 billion to  its reserves for Third World loan losses that included Brazil and other  nations.  </P></p>

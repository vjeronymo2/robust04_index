			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Sears up 2.8% in wake of shake-up SEARS, the retail group, is beginning to reap the benefits of its restructuring, Mr Liam Strong, chief executive since February last year, said yesterday. The group, whose retail brands include Selfridges, Wallis, Adams, Olympus and Freemans, recorded a 2.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 83.5m in the year to January 31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 31.5m, down from Pounds 32.5m. However, there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 112m, compared with Pounds 11.2m, and on an FRS 3 basis Sears incurred a Pounds 47.8m loss, against a restated Pounds 22.8m profit. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said the group could see some signs of improvement in trading but that economic recovery was likely to be slow. Mr Strong said the group had largely completed the restructuring phase and had taken encouraging steps towards putting the group's costs on a sensible basis. Now the group had to get the shops and products in tune with what customers wanted. He said the balance sheet had been strengthened, with net debt cut over the year from Pounds 153m to Pounds 47m through disposals and tighter cash management. However, Sears aimed to step up capital expenditure from Pounds 40m last year to Pounds 70m. A property revaluation cut values by Pounds 75m. Sales were unchanged at Pounds 1.98bn, but trading profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 95.9m to Pounds 107.2m. Profits from footwear retailing jumped from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 23.3m as comparable store sales grew 6 per cent, which Mr Strong put down to better product design and sourcing, and costs were cut. The charge largely relates to footwear business restructuring. Speciality retailing profits rose from Pounds 25.6m to Pounds 26.9m, with women's and children's wear strong but the Olympus sports chain incurring a loss. Selfridges, the department store, made Pounds 16.9m, up from Pounds 16.2m. The home shopping side suffered a drop from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 23.2m, although Freemans profits were up. The Dutch business acquired early last year incurred a loss of Pounds 6.7m. Property made Pounds 22.1m, up from Pounds 19.6m. Earnings per share were unchanged at 4.2p, and the final dividend is 2.5p, down from 3.83p, as forecast, to give a total of 3.5p against 5.355p. Lex, Page 20</p>

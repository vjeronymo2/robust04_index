			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Altered role forces an attitude change Mr George Blunden is an unabashed fan of London's discount market. 'This is my third discount house' he says, 'and I know they can make money.' Long-suffering shareholders in Union Discount will be glad to hear it. The son of a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mr Blunden has arrived as chief executive of Union Discount at a critical moment in the company's history - and that of London's discount market. Union faces a tough fight to rebuild its profits in the area it knows best - London's short-term money markets - after being dragged down by a disastrous move into equipment leasing in the 1980s. However, many people in the markets think discount houses such as Union are in danger of going out of fashion. These are not easy times for the City's nine discount houses. They have traditionally played a crucial role in the Bank of England's sterling operations, acting as the valve through which liquidity passes from Threadneedle Street to the commercial banks. But the environment in which they operate has changed. One of the biggest problems has been the small movements in interest rates since Britain joined Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism. In the past, discount houses have tended to make money on interest rate movements. When base rates move downwards, for example, the discount houses make profits because the capital value of the bills that they hold increases. In the past year, however, the Bank has signalled rate cuts infrequently. Mr Blunden believes that, to make money, Union and other discount houses will need to change their attitude to the money markets. Discount houses buy short-dated securities from banks and borrow from the Bank of England. Traditionally, they have held on to these securities for too long in the hope that longer-dated interest rates will be cut, and a profit realised, says Mr Blunden. He wants Union Discount to deal more aggressively. 'You have to adapt your style and your knowledge of how short-term interest rates are moving and change the time scale in which you operate,' he says. That means becoming an active trader across all money market instruments, for instance by using the options and futures markets to take or lay off risks on interest rate movements. That could make the discount market only a small - and increasingly unimportant - part of the activities of Union. Mr Blunden also plans to develop the group's expertise in longer-dated financial instruments, to enable it to arbitrage between short and longer-term interest rates. The company is no longer dealing in trade bills, which provide short-term finance for corporations, but are highly risky because of the chance that the corporation will default. Some fear that the discount house business has no long-term future. The move to European Monetary Union (Emu) will make London's discount house operation obsolete, because the Bank of England's operations are unlike those in other European centres. There are suggestions that the Bank will be forced to operate like the Bundesbank if Emu takes place, dealing directly with the commercial banks rather than through intermediaries. However, Mr Blunden says: 'The experience that we have derived over the centuries will not disappear overnight. If the Bank of England opens up its operations to a wider audience, we should find ourselves dealing with an even larger client base.' The disasters of the past year have wiped Pounds 30m off Union's capital base, which is now just over Pounds 40m. However, that does not mean it is no longer a force in the money markets: the special capital regime for discount houses run by the Bank of England would allow Union to take positions in the markets worth up to Pounds 3.2bn. As one competitor said yesterday: 'That still gives them plenty of scope to make profits - or to make a complete mess of it.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Text] Washington -- The ministers of foreign affairs,  Celso Amorim; finance, Fernando Henrique Cardoso; industry,  commerce, and tourism, Elcio Alvares; and science and  technology, Israel Vargas, will meet in the next 72 hours to  discuss alternatives to avoid U.S. trade retaliation by the end  of the month in the dispute between the two countries over the  Brazilian system of protection of intellectual property rights.    The meeting has become important after the failure of the  fifth round of negotiations between the two countries, which  ended at dawn on 5 February in Washington. It will be the last  chance to prevent a new clash with the United States on a  subject that has been affecting relations between the two  countries for a decade and that made the Americans impose trade  sanctions against Brazil in 1988. Like the first time, the  latest action was spurred by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry,  which claims it is losing millions of dollars from the illegal  copying of their formulas by Brazilian laboratories.    Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de  Lima, who returned to Brazil last week to attend the marriage of  his son Joao Pedro, will arrive in Brasilia today to hold  separate meetings with the ministers involved in the subject and  he also will attend the meeting they will all hold together,  scheduled in principle for 9 February. Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim will personally tell Washington the final Brazilian  answer after Carnival.    The road to a negotiated solution is narrow but not closed,  according to U.S. sources familiar with the negotiations. There  are nearly two dozen points on which the two parties maintain  different positions. Four of them are considered critical for  Washington. Of these, "two must be resolved if the Brazilian  Government wants to avoid retaliation," a source said.    Two of the points refer to the clauses about "local  exploitation" of patents and "parallel importation" of patented  products described in Articles 27 and 28, respectively, of the  text on protection of intellectual property (Tripps) [preceding  word in English; expansion unknown] approved by the Uruguay  Round of GATT talks, which Brazil signed last December in Geneva.    The Americans allege that the draft bill of the new  Industrial Property Code, which already has been approved by the  Chamber of Deputies and has been standing idle for months in the  Senate, contradicts Tripps [preceding word in English] on those  two points. The Brazilian draft bill requires that the patent be  exploited in Brazil in order to be valid in the country. Beside  that, it authorizes the importation of products patented by  third parties and that manufacture them under license of the  patent's owner.    Washington estimated that once the Uruguay Round concluded,  the Brazilian executive branch would immediately act to adapt  Brazilian law to the international treaty it signed in the  Uruguay Round. "Brazil never failed to observe through its laws  the obligations it assumed in international treaties," states an  American source.    But Itamaraty, which commands the negotiations, argued that  Articles 27 and 28 of Tripps [preceding word in English] "are  ambiguous" and has decided there is no incompatibility between  the articles and the draft bill in Congress. There clearly is  concern over the industrial policy in President Franco's  position, which is shared by the Ministries of Science and  Technology and Industry and Commerce but not by the Finance  Ministry. "The demand to locally exploit patents is important to  create jobs in the country," a diplomat who participates in the  negotiations told O ESTADO.    "Brazil is totally isolated in its interpretation of  Tripps,"  American sources say. "If the Brazilian Government does not  comply with what it signed in the GATT, there will be sanctions."</p>

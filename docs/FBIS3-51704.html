The first unit  left from Valledupar.    On orders from the Army Staff, 240 professional soldiers of  the 35th Counterguerrilla Battalion traveled to the Uraba region  this morning. All of the soldiers are young men between 20 and  25 years of age who are experienced in fighting subversives.  For a year the troops have covered the mountains of regions  where the irregulars are most active. For the last six months  the soldiers have fought between the mountains of the Sierra  Nevada de Santa Marta and the Perija Hills against FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and ELN [Army of  National Liberation] guerrillas, who continuously intimidate the  citizens and cattle ranchers of Cesar Department.    [Begin German Guillermo Perico, commander of the 35th  Counterguerrilla Battalion, recording; identified by caption]  We will support military operations in the rural area and do  our part to attain the peace that Colombia needs so much. [end  recording]    The Army's strategy in the Uraba region is to increase the  presence of the public force to exercise greater control in this  conflict area.    Another counterguerrilla battalion could also be sent to  that  banana-producing region over the next few days.    This counterguerrilla mobile unit will fight the dissident  group of the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] and the FARC, who are  responsible for killings in the rural areas of the Uraba region  in Antioquia Department.</p>

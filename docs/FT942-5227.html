			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Avoidance tactics in Manila It does not take long for visitors to Manila to realise they have arrived in one of Asia's most violent societies. Uniformed men brandishing pump-action shotguns stand guard outside high-street banks. Bars and restaurants remind patrons not to carry guns inside. A sign on the door of one bistro in the Philippine capital's main business district says politely: 'Kindly endorse your deadly weapons to the house detective.' The reputation of the Philippines for violence is well-founded. But as in Washington or Bangkok, the victims of shootings or kidnappings are usually local residents, rather than visitors. Nevertheless, foreigners should be cautious when arriving at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Visitors have faced demands for money from corrupt customs officials or been robbed by rogue taxi-drivers. The safest bet is to take a car provided by your hotel (they leave from the 'hotel counter' outside the terminal) or an Avis limousine. Other hazards include sophisticated conmen (and women) who invite you to drink a cup of coffee or Coca-Cola, into which they pour a soporific drug; victims of this method of robbery, also used in Singapore and Bangkok, wake up hours later without their wallets, if they wake up at all. Yet everyday life in the traffic-clogged streets of the townships that make up Metro-Manila is generally peaceful. Makati, the business district, is particularly clean and safe. A penchant for guns is only one aspect of a society that has absorbed much from the US and Spain, its two colonial powers. The 'Jeepney', the ubiquitous, workshop-assembled vehicle, is loosely based on the front end of the US wartime Jeep. Festooned with baubles, bright lights and Catholic slogans, it is used for both private and public transport. A refreshing change from some other parts of Asia is the variety of newspapers. You can usually find something entertaining to read in a traffic jam, while wondering whether you dare roll down the window and give money to the street children tapping on the roof of your taxi.</p>

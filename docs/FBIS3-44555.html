			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "Volume of Natural Gas </F> Reserves Proven in Past Three Years Exceeds Total in Previous 40  Years"]    [Text] The construction of China's largest ever natural  gas field, the Yinggehai Ya-13-1 gas field, has already started.  By 18 December, nearly 50 km of underwater pipe line had been  laid. Meanwhile, a second long-distance natural gas pipe line  running from the North China oil field to supply gas to Beijing  was put into use in late November after just one test operation.  This pipe line's has been raised to 400,000 cubic meters a day.  This evidence vividly reflects a series of major achievements  by China in the development of natural gas prospecting as part  of the oil industry since the start of the "Seven Five-Year  Plan." A boom in China's natural gas reserves is arriving, said  Wang Tao, general manager of China National Petroleum and  Natural Gas Corporation, at an advanced symposium on the oil  industry held in Beijing recently.    Over the past three years, according to the principle of  "developing oil and natural gas alongside," the inland oil  industry sector has been stepping up geological theoretical  study and prospecting related to natural gas. Major prospecting  findings have preliminarily revealed three new, large gas  producing zones in inland China: 1) the northern Shaanxi gas  field, the largest undivided single inland gas field ever  discovered in China, covering a total area of more than 2,340  square km; 2) eastern Sichuan, where a number of industrial gas  fields have been discovered, and central and southwest Sichuan,  where a number of gas wells have been drilled and have proven to  be rich in gas; and 3) the Turpan-Hami Basin, Junggar Basin, and  Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, with preliminarily proven gas reserves  totaling nearly 100 billion cubic meters. In addition, another  area rich in natural gas has been spotted and confirmed in the  eastern Qaidam Basin, Qinghai. With major prospecting projects  being launched in the above areas over the next seven years,  China's proven reserves natural gas reserves proven are expected  to increase by more than double.    China National Offshore Oil Corporation, now with 140  billion  cubic meters of gas reserves in hand, is running prospecting  projects in the Yinggehai-Southeast Hainan region, which has  been identified as the corporation's major natural gas  prospecting operation zone. The corporation has drilled three  test wells on its own this year, and will drill another six next  year. Meanwhile, three oil and gas fields and four oil bearing  structures have been discovered and confirmed in the East China  Sea, and exploratory work has now begun. China National  Offshore Oil Corporation is planning to produce 4 billion cubic  meters of natural gas by 1997, and to obtain proven gas reserves  totaling 400 billion cubic meters and an annual production  capacity of 20 billion cubic meters of gas by the turn of the  century.    Our country's proven natural gas reserves, newly discovered  in the last three years, have surpassed the total amount  discovered and proven over the previous four decades.  Therefore, China is now ready to speed up exploration for  resources.</p>

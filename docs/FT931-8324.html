			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: George Weston income drops SHARPLY lower profits are reported by George Weston, holding company for the Weston family's North American interests. Net income for 1992 fell to CDollars 48m (USDollars 38m) or 85 cents a share from 1991's CDollars 92m or CDollars 1.81 a share. In contrast, sales increased to CDollars 11.6m from CDollars 10.77m. However, the latest figures allow for special provisions of CDollars 25m for plant closings, consolidation in the fresh bread business and financial restructurings. There was a CDollars 10m provision to cover problems with a US subsidiary sold in 1988. The 1991 profit includes a CDollars 30m gain on the issue of shares by a subsidiary. Earlier in the day, Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor which is controlled by the George Weston group, reported fourth-quarter net profits of CDollars 28.8m, down from CDollars 29.5m, on revenues 19 per cent ahead at CDollars 2.4bn. Earnings per share came to 33 cents in both periods. For the year, net profits fell 24 per cent to CDollars 79.8m or 88 cents a share, from CDollars 104.7m or CDollars 1.17. Revenues rose 8 per cent to CDollars 9.6bn. Loblaw said it continued to improve market share and expected reasonable growth this year. Confederation Life, one of Canada's biggest insurers, has been hit by property woes. Net profits for 1992 fell to CDollars 1.9m, after CDollars 161m of special charges, from CDollars 17.3m a year earlier. Revenues slipped by nearly 10 per cent to CDollars 3.9bn. Torstar, publisher of the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest daily newspaper, earned net profits of CDollars 48.8m or CDollars 1.21 a share in 1992, including a CDollars 54m special gain, against losses of CDollars 3.4m or 9 cents a share in 1991. Revenues rose 3 per cent to 921m. Newspaper publishing was hit by lower advertising, but books improved, the group said.</p>

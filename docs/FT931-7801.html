			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton firm on Airbus subsidies PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said he would seek 'tough new discipline' on European subsidies to Airbus, while 'closely monitoring' an agreement made last year by the Bush administration under which the Airbus governments agreed to limit their 'aid' to the consortium. In a speech to Boeing aircraft workers in Seattle, he expressed scepticism about trade agreements. 'I've seen people promise us they'll do this, that or the other thing, and then nothing ever happens.' It was the president's second assault in two days on the hard-won Airbus pact, signed last summer. In California, he complained that for the last several years, the US 'stood by while Europe spent Dollars 26bn (Pounds 18.3bn) to develop Airbus to push Americans out of work'. Boeing's recent announcement that it would 28,000 workers redundant is only partly due to defence cuts, he added. 'Boeing makes a lot of other planes, too,' he said. The president, in company with Vice-President Al Gore, also used the trip to the west coast to announce the administration's technology programme and to underscore his assertion that US trade policy must play an integral part in economic policy. Boeing has been making known its 'continued frustration' with Airbus and its 'competitive practices.' That President Clinton received the message was evident in his statement two weeks ago at a televised 'town meeting'. He set off alarms in Europe when he said he would not 'roll over and play dead' over Airbus subsidies. It was not clear at the time if he knew that the issue had been settled by his predecessor. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, last week said the Airbus deal would be reviewed as part of a larger administration evaluation of trade issues. This exercise may well produce a clear departure from current policies, he said. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said he was prepared to discuss the issue with President Clinton, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'What about subsidies they give their arms industry, among others?' he said at the end of a four-day visit to India.</p>

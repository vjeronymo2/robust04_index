			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Agreement on Three Heavyweight </F> Issues"]    [Text] Brussels -- "This is an agreement that can give us  a yes in the Swedish referendum on EU membership."    So said European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel  confidently  when he made public the agreement he reached yesterday with the  12 EU countries in Brussels.    "The agreement is a very good base for the referendum," Ulf  Dinkelspiel said.    "With a real effort from the yes side and with the  involvement of all those who want Sweden to join the EU, I am  convinced that the result will be a yes."    Three heavyweight issues in the negotiations were settled  during the weekend's and Monday [28 February] morning's marathon  session: the budget, agriculture, and regional policy.    On the budget question, the main stumbling block in the  final  round of negotiations, there was a half victory for Sweden:    "We asked to be let off paying ECU2,000 million for five  years. The result is ECU1,025 million," Finance Minister Anne  Wibble said.    What Sweden was demanding was a reduced EU membership fee  for  the initial years of Swedish EU membership. In the first year  Anne Wibble wanted to give to Brussels as much money as the EU  paid out to Sweden in the form of agricultural and regional  support and so on -- that is, a zero net payment. After that  the sum would gradually increase.    At first the EU rejected the Swedish demand but later  softened its stance step-by-step. However, it did say a blank  no to the principle of reduced membership contributions.  Instead the EU will put money directly into Sweden's state  coffers. But it is unclear what this money will be called, what  it will say on the payment advice to Anne Wibble.    This means that in the first year of EU membership Sweden  will pay a net sum of 450,000 kronor [SKr] to Brussels. After  that net inpayments will increase rapidly.    The EU's first offer on the budget came on Saturday [26  February]. It was improved on Sunday night. When Monday  dawned, ECU125 million divided the Swedish and EU positions.  Then the EU threw in a final ECU60 million, an offer that  Sweden accepted.    The heavyweight agricultural negotiations did not get going  in earnest until Sunday night. But Agriculture Minister Karl  Erik Olsson declared himself to be largely satisfied with the  final result:    "Highest on my list of priorities was preserving the high  quality of Swedish food without an increased risk of disease and  contamination," he said.    "Here we more or less hit the jackpot. The Swedish people  need have no fears about poorer food quality even though imports  of foodstuffs will increase," the agriculture minister said,  referring in part to the agreement on protection against  salmonella that was finalized on Sunday.    The second matter close to Karl Erik Olsson's heart was  support for Norrland's agriculture that today receives almost  SKr1 billion a year in additional state support. The Swedish  negotiators wanted the EU to approve the principle of additional  support for northern agriculture and also agree to share the  financial burden.    The green light was given to the principle itself. The EU  has approved Norrland support for the whole of the Swedish  support region as far south as Dalsland. In actual fact the  support is supposed to be paid north of the 62d parallel, but  Karl Erik Olsson noted contentedly that "the 62d parallel runs a  long way south of the 61st parallel here."    But the Swedish state itself will have to finance Norrland  support. The EU said no to opening its pocketbook.    Nevertheless Norrland's farmers can count on quite a lot of  EU money -- in part in the form of the EU's so-called LFA  support for less-favored areas that could give Sweden a total of  around SKr350 million a year from Brussels. In addition the EU  will also pay Sweden SKr1.5 billion per year from its new  farming environmental program -- money that can be spent on  solving the problems of northern Sweden in particular, the  agriculture minister said.    Karl Erik Olsson was less satisfied with the result of the  negotiations when it comes to the important questions of  production quotas for Swedish agriculture. Both the milk and  sugar quotas were smaller than Sweden had demanded, even though  the EU improved its offer on the last lap of the negotiations.    Sweden will receive SKr2.4 billion per year for five years  in  regional support for the EU's structural funds. Of these, 360  million will go to Objective 6 -- the new support for sparsely  populated regions that the EU created specifically for northern  Scandinavia. The Objective 6 region covers parts of Norrbotten,  Vasterbotten, Jamtland, Vasternorrland, and Kopparberg  provinces, and Torsby local authority in Varmland and Ljusdal  local authority in Gavleborg.    "We have succeeded in the task of creating an understanding  of our country's special character with its sparse population  and long distances," Labor Minister Borje Hornlund said.    The rest of the structural fund money will be shared between  EU's Objective 2, 3, 4, and 5b regions. This means that it will  go to industrial areas in decline, measures to counter youth  unemployment, measures to prevent unemployment, and rural  development.</p>

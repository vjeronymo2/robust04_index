			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Demand for shareholder equality at Siemens - The voting strength of preference shares comes under challenge today TODAY, a professor of business studies from the university of Wurzburg in northern Bavaria takes on the full might of Siemens, the Munich-based electronics and electricals giant. Prof Ekkehard Wenger, who will be attending the company's annual meeting today along with scores of his students and several thousand other shareholders, will be challenging the Siemens colossus on a highly sensitive issue. He has proposed a series of motions calling for the abolition of the special voting rights attached to Siemens' preference shares. These shares are entirely owned by the von Siemens family, descendants of Werner von Siemens, who founded the company in 1847. The challenge will highlight the family's involvement in one of Europe's largest companies - turnover was nearly DM79bn (Dollars 47.4bn) in the year to September 1992 - and focus on the management's attitude to shareholder voting restrictions. It is part of Prof Wenger's long campaign for shareholders' rights and for an end to voting restrictions in many leading German companies. He has turned Germany's usually staid annual meetings into battle-grounds, using tough rhetoric and legal manoeuvring in a colourful campaign against Germany's top managers and the kind of capitalism practised by Germany's big corporations. Prof Wenger, 40, travels to annual meetings with squads of his students, who are encouraged to take to the podium and pose difficult questions to management. He stalks around - as one observer puts it, 'like a lion in a cage' - taking delight in prolonging the meetings, fostering the image of the slightly mad professor. But, for all the appearance of farce, his message is serious. He argues that German managers are part of a 'self-perpetuating clique' screened off from stock market pressures by a network of cross-holdings and takeover prevention devices which encourage complacency and poor business decisions. In attacking Siemens, Prof Wenger draws parallels with the case of RWE, the Ruhr-based industrial group where independent shareholders recently tried - unsuccessfully - to remove a shareholding structure giving local authorities about 60 of the votes although they only own 30 per cent of the shares. Calpers, the big US pension fund, said RWE was being unrealistic in expecting access to international capital markets while maintaining such structures. Wenger argues that an anachronistic share structure at Siemens shields management from stock market pressure. It also disadvantages ordinary shareholders, of whom there are 583,000, including a high proportion of foreign or foreign institutional shareholders with about 43 per cent of the shares. Some 923,634 Siemens preference shares, issued to the family during the second world war, are not listed on any stock exchange. They account for 1.65 per cent of share capital, but can exercise 9.15 per cent of the vote. This, Prof Wenger argues, gives the family a decisive influence on key company decisions and helps management protect itself against takeover. If only 50 per cent of shareholders vote at an annual meeting, the family's preference shares enable it to exercise 20 per cent of the vote - before the family's unquantified, but probably extensive, holdings of ordinary shares are accounted for. Prof Wenger claims the structure is barely-disguised discrimination against foreign investors, which 'severely limits the influence of performance-conscious shareholders' over management'. It also ensures that management is sheltered from the need to manage the business primarily in the interest of shareholders. This, he argues, leads to a gap between the share price and the real net worth of the company. He maintains the true worth of the company is about DM870 per share, compared with a share price which fluctuated between DM650 and DM700 last year. Siemens, which has had to go to the trouble and expense of sending a copy of Wenger's proposals to all its shareholders, says it will not comment in detail on his criticisms until today's meeting. In general terms, Siemens says the special voting rights attached to the preference shares have never been used. It adds that restricted voting structures are found in countries other than in Germany and that Siemens' image with international investors has not suffered because of the preference shares. Yet, on the same day that Wenger will be attacking the family connection, the company's management will be seeking shareholder approval for Mr Peter von Siemens' elevation from the management board to the supervisory board - hardly a public relations triumph for Siemens. A direct descendant of the founder, he is grandson of the Mr Ernst von Siemens, who ran the company from 1939 to 1966. By exposing the links to the past, Prof Wenger is likely to attract support for his view that the Siemens voting structure is out of date. It will also highlight the attitude of the Siemens' management board to 'shareholder value'. In contrast to the board of RWE - which was not averse to getting rid of the voting restrictions - the Siemens management firmly defends the status quo. 'It is not good for the image of Germany that a large international company, such as Siemens, should seek to preserve a shareholder structure which is a barely-disguised takeover defence mechanism,' says one Frankfurt financier. Whether Prof Wenger wins the vote depends on how independent shareholders vote - and the big banks which exercise votes on behalf of shareholders. Deutsche Bank, the biggest German bank, will side with management and against Wenger. Perhaps this, too, follows from family loyalty - the bank was itself founded by a member of the von Siemens family 123 years ago.</p>

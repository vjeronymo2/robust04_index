Addressing the closing session of the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC) this afternoon, Qiao, chairman of the  NPC Standing Committee, said that all kinds of work must also  help free and develop productive forces, increase China's  comprehensive strength and improve people's living standards.    He asked government departments and workers at all levels to  change their style of work, make investigations, solicit  people's views and be concerned about their well-being.    The leader also stressed the need to handle well all matters  relating to people's immediate interests.    He said that it is imperative to oppose bureaucracy and  boasting, and do away with formalism.    He called for a stop to holding meetings or issuing  documents  that will not solve any problems, to indulging in empty talks,  to reporting only the good news, and to telling lies.    Speaking of the NPC session, he said that various  resolutions  and decisions adopted by the deputies reflect the will and  aspiration of the entire Chinese nation.    The session also demonstrates great unity among people of  various nationalities and their confidence in the success of  China's reform program and economic development, he said.    Qiao Shi expressed the belief that the session will play a  significant role in speeding up the establishment of a socialist  market economy, and promoting progress in socialist democracy,  as well as ideological and cultural progress.    He said that it is imperative to seize current favorable  international and domestic opportunities, accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure and  achieve a sustained, rapid and healthy growth of China's economy.    "We must also maintain social stability and promote  all-round  social progress," he said.    All kinds of work in China must comply with and serve the  country's central task for 1994, he said, noting: "We must  correctly handle relations between reform, development and  stability."    "We must strive to push ahead with reform and development  amid stability, and achieve social stability and the country's  long-term stability through reform and development," he said.    He said that 1994 is an important year for China's economic  restructuring, with the implementation of so many new reform  measures.    He stressed the need to further emancipate the mind, do  everything in line with specific conditions, properly resolve  contradictions and problems arising in the course of  implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform  measures.    Qiao Shi also called for efforts to quicken the pace of  economic legislation and use laws to guide, promote and ensure  the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and  the progress of various undertakings.</p>

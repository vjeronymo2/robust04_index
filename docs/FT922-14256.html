			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Bonds: Flurry of dollar activity fails to excite investors THE international bond market sprung to life yesterday. However, the clutch of new issues launched in US, Canadian and Australian dollars met an unenthusiastic response from investors still unsure whether to commit funds. The most ambitious offer of the day came from Export Development Corporation of Canada, which launched a Dollars 400m 10-year deal, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The 7 3/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 27 basis points more than US government bonds, considered slightly aggressive in a market which has seen lacklustre demand for dollar-denominated bonds. The lead manager said US employment statistics released on Friday had improved the tone of both the Eurodollar and US Treasury bond market. It reported steady buying from institutional investors in east Asia and European retail investors. However, while the borrower is a popular and relatively rare visitor to the Euromarket, the deal elicited a mixed response. The lead manager quoted the bonds at a yield spread of 27 basis points during the day. A contrasting dollar issue came from Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, which launched a Dollars 150m five-year deal, also lead-managed by CSFB. The 7 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 90 basis points more than Treasuries, in line with the yield spread available on other recent issues by corporations of single-A credit quality. However, again the pricing was seen by participants as too tight in difficult market conditions. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price until the close of trading. The Province of British Columbia tested demand for Canadian dollars with a CDollars 300m five-year issue, lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation. The 9 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 54 basis points more than the benchmark five-year Canadian government bond. The pricing was seen as generous by syndicate officials, although some commented that - like the EDC deal - the issue was too large to be easily absorbed. While some reported switching by continental European investors out of D-Mark paper and into higher-yielding Canadian dollar bonds, demand is largely restricted to investors re-investing the proceeds of maturing bond issues. Around CDollars 1.5bn in bonds mature this month, and CDollars 2bn in May. From a fixed re-offer price of 99.86, the bonds traded down to 99.75 bid by late afternoon, while Canadian government bonds were little changed. The yield spread widened to around 57 basis points. Canadian National Railways, the state-owned, but not government-guaranteed, rail company, launched a retail-targeted CDollars 150m seven-year deal lead-managed by ScotiaMcleod. The bonds, priced to yield 70 basis points more than the benchmark 9 1/2 per cent Canadian government bond maturing 1998, saw some buying from retail investors but generated little enthusiasm. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price of 99.42 throughout the day. Commonwealth Bank of Australia came with a ADollars 100m offering of 9 3/4 per cent bond maturing 1996 and priced to yield 50 basis points more than Australian government bonds. From an issue price of 101.75, the deal, lead-managed by CBA itself, traded at less 1.62 bid, inside full fees of 1.75 per cent. IBCA, the European credit rating agency, has lowered its ratings for nine Japanese banks previously placed on rating watch, Reuter reports from New York. IBCA blamed the current weakness in the Tokyo stock market for its decision,along with the trend inthe Japanese real estatemarkets and the state of the economy. The ratings changes affect Tokai Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Nippon Credit Bank, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking, Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking, Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Toyo Trust &amp; Banking. IBCA said the weakness in the Tokyo stock market threatened to undermine the recent improvement in the operating profits of Japanese banks.</p>

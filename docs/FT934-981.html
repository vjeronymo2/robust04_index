			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Aboriginal land bill passed by Canberra Senate A native title bill, which sets up a system for deciding land claims by Australia's Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders, was approved by the Senate yesterday. The legislation, passed after a marathon parliamentary debate that began on Friday, will come into effect on January 1. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister who took a personal role in negotiating the bill with Aboriginal leaders, described it as 'a turning point for all Australians'. 'This has been the longest continuing problem that Australia has faced for 200 years, recognising that indigenous people, that native people, had the right to their own soil,' he said. For two centuries Australia's land management system has operated on the principle that the land was uninhabited before European settlement. This concept was overturned in a High Court ruling last year, which said native title could exist where there had been 'close and continuing' association with the land in question. However, the court added that land titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed. The native title bill tries to marry these two rulings. The bill has been highly controversial. Mining companies argue it will mean that exploration becomes more costly and unpredictable. But the government and Aboriginal groups say the number of successful land claims will be small, benefiting perhaps 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population and mainly involving vacant crown land. Over one-seventh of Australia's 1m square miles has already been set aside, in one way or another, for the country's 265,000 aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. The bill, debate over which had threatened to continue over the holiday period, passed the Senate 34-30 just after midnight. The lower House of Representatives, where the government holds a majority, is scheduled to approve the bill this morning.</p>

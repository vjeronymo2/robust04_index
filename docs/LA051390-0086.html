			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: MERYL'S CHOICE: HOME ON WESTSIDE  </P> <P> Actress MERYL STREEP, a native of New Jersey who has been outspoken about  liking to live on the East Coast, and her husband, sculptor DONALD GUMMER, have  bought a house in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We bought here because I got a job here. I never made a movie in Hollywood  before," she said in a telephone interview from the Burbank set of "Defending  Your Life," a romantic comedy co-starring Albert Brooks.  </P> <P> Streep, who won Academy Awards in 1982 as best actress in "Sophie's Choice" and  in 1979 as best supporting actress in "Kramer vs. Kramer," most recently  co-starred with Roseanne Barr in "She-Devil."  </P> <P> "We were renting (in Santa Monica) and found it hard to live among other  people's things, so we decided to get a place of our own," she explained. The  couple have three children.  </P> <P> The Gummers bought a two-story, Spanish-style house on the Westside for  slightly more than $3 million, real estate sources said.  </P> <P> Built in 1972, the 6,469-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths, a  dramatic spiral staircase and electric gates leading into a garden and circular  driveway. The home also has mountain and canyon views.  </P> <P> "We're planning to go home (to Connecticut)," she said, "but we found this  (house) as a place where we can stay whenever we come out and I work here  again.  </P> <P> "We really like Los Angeles."  </P> <P> GRETA GARBO'S "West Coast residence," where the actress, who died April 15,  spent her winters for 25 years, is on the market at $2.7 million.  </P> <P> Garbo owned considerable real estate at one time in the Beverly Hills area but  sold it all, including four commercial buildings on Rodeo Drive, sources said.  </P> <P> The French Regency-style house, on 3 acres in the Beverly Hills Post Office  Area, is owned by Anthony Palermo, Garbo's business manager and confidant for  the last 14 years.  </P> <P> "But for all intents and purposes, it was her house," he said. "She gardened  and had her roses there."  </P> <P> Palermo bought the home for her to use, he said, after nutritionist Gayelord  Hauser, Garbo's longtime friend, died in 1984.  </P> <P> "When he passed away, the property was in the name of the Gayelord Hauser  trust," Palermo recalled. "Miss Garbo said to me, 'Gosh, what am I going to do?  I'm too old to own another house, to have it in my name.' And I said, 'Don't  worry.' I bought it from the trust so she could come there and be undisturbed."  </P> <P> The three-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot home, built in the '30s, has a guest house  and a swimming pool. It has been rented, for short periods, by actor Dudley  Moore and film exec David Putnam.  </P> <P> Palermo put the property on the market for a short time last year when Garbo  was ill. "But now . . . I'm intent on selling it," he said. It's listed with  Joe Coons at Rodeo/Prudential Realty.  </P> <P> CURTIS HENDRIX, the New York entrepreneur who last year relocated to Los  Angeles and bought the former Sanwa Bank Building -- a 13-story office tower on  South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles -- for $135 million, just  purchased, with a partner, 410 acres in Malibu and an 1,849-acre ranch in San  Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Hendrix didn't say how much they paid for the properties but indicated that he  and his partner will develop them each at a cost in the $50-million range.  Hendrix's partner is John Paul Jones Dejoria, founder and owner of Paul  Mitchell Hair Products.  </P> <P> "We're working on something for Malibu that will be helpful in solving some of  the environmental problems and not create traffic," Hendrix said, adding that  he should have more details in a few weeks.  </P> <P> About 2,000 feet of the Malibu property fronts on Pacific Coast Highway, and  the rest is in Tuna Canyon, less than 2 miles north of Sunset Boulevard. It had  been owned for 20 years by a doctor and other investors and is divided into 14  estate sites.  </P> <P> The San Luis Obispo property, known as the Eagle's Nest Ranch, came with zoning  approvals for an 18-hole golf course and 225-room lodge.  </P> <P> "We're also going to create 16 50- to 100-acre ranchettes with rights to use  the hotel and golf course," Hendrix said. "We're in the process of submitting  drawings (to the city)."  </P> <P> While also forming development options for their Malibu property, Dejoria has  begun construction in Malibu on a 15,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style  mansion for himself and his family.  </P> <P> McDonald's fast-food founder RAY KROC'S former 204-acre Santa Ynez Valley ranch  will be open to the public and prospective buyers for the first time Saturday  and next Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Now owned by the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, the ranch was developed  and used by Kroc, who died in 1984, as a country retreat for his family and  business associates.  </P> <P> It's on the market through Coldwell Banker's Montecito and Santa Barbara  offices at $11.5 million, reduced from its $14-million asking price when first  listed last August.  </P> <P> The property includes a 4,700-square-foot owner's residence on a 20-acre  hilltop; a 15-bedroom guest house; theater, conference/library building, two  helicopter pads, twin tennis courts, a volleyball court, stables and two  swimming pools.  </P> <P> The ranch can be reached from the Armour Ranch Road exit of Highway 154 in the  Santa Ynez Valley, after a 22-mile drive over the San Marcos Pass from Santa  Barbara.  </P> <P> Dodger first baseman EDDIE MURRAY has purchased a new Normandy-style,  10,000-square-foot house with a private lake and free-standing,  4,000-square-foot chauffeur's quarters in Sand Canyon at $3.4 million, sources  say.  </P> <P> Sand Canyon is the wealthy residential area of Canyon Country, southwest of the  Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> Murray's purchase is believed to be one of the highest sales in the area.  </P></p>

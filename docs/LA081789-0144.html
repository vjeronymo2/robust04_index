			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: VENICE;  </P> <P> 1,000 SIGN GROWTH PETITION  </P> <P> Venice Town Council members gathered 1,000 signatures Sunday in support of  their proposal to halt commercial development in Venice for a year while an  environmental impact report is prepared.  </P> <P> John Haag, who heads the group's moratorium committee, said petitions were  circulated at the sixth annual Venice Arts and Crafts Festival. The group goal  is to collect 5,000 signatures to demonstrate community support for the ban to  6th District Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.  </P> <P> Galanter has said she opposes the ban as illegal. She said a stiff interim  control ordinance is already controlling commercial development in Venice.  </P></p>

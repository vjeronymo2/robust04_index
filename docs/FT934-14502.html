			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / MAI bids to revive Channel 5 scheme LORD HOLLICK, chairman of MAI, the television, advertising and financial services group, has joined those trying to revive the idea of a national Channel 5. Lord Hollick has sent a formal expression of interest to the Independent Television Commission arguing that the original Channel 5 concept should be re-advertised. Last December the ITC rejected the only bid to operate the channel from a consortium led by Thames Television, mainly on the grounds of inadequate shareholder commitment. Later the commission set out three options for the future of Channel 5: A re-advertisement of the original concept - a channel which could reach about three-quarters of the UK population. Using the frequencies for a more locally based form of city television, an option that would require legislation. Using the Channel 5 frequencies to help plan a transition to digital television. Lord Hollick said yesterday the first option would offer an attractive alternative service at no extra cost to the viewer. One reason why MAI is particularly interested is that most of its Meridian ITV franchise in the south of England would not be able to receive the Channel 5 signal. Thames Television, which like the Financial Times is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pearson, has also submitted a letter of interest in a re- advertised national channel. Thames is still having talks with media company Time Warner and the Atlanta-based newspaper and television group Cox about the possibility of bidding for the franchise.</p>

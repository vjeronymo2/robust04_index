			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japanese brewer gets rid of Chinese froth  -Making a joint venture work / Foreign Investment WHEN Kenzo Yanagi arrived at the Chinese city of Lianyungang to take control of Japanese brewery Suntory's joint venture producing a brew called Flower Fruit Mountain Beer, a brand inspired by a Chinese fairy tale, he recommended an important shift in marketing strategy - change the name. 'It was a bit rural. We needed something that reflected a modern Chinese sensibility,' said Mr Yanagi. The venture was launched in 1984, but began producing profits last year after a decade of reforms to the management structure, the beer recipe and, as Mr Yanagi put it, the 'workers' consciousness'. Hoping to flood the Chinese market with Flower Fruit Mountain Beer and earn foreign currency from exports, the hardened joint venture partners now have clearer goals. Their beer has a 95 per cent share of the market in the area around Lianyungang, a port city in Jiangsu province, and they are cautiously taking aim at Shanghai. The Japanese company has a 50 per cent stake in China Jiangsu Suntory, capitalised at Dollars 13m (Pounds 8.7m), sharing ownership with the Lianyungang Light Industry Bureau, which has 30 per cent. Two state investment bodies, the Jiangsu International Trust and Investment Corporation (Jitic) and the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), each have 10 per cent. Sales last year rose almost 30 per cent, Mr Yanagi said, after the launch of two premium brands, New Century and Prince. In the four years Mr Yanagi worked in Lianyungang, the brew was improved by replacing the barley used by the Chinese partners with imported materials and, later, with Suntory-developed barley from a farming venture in the area. In earlier years, the venture could not get permission to import materials and was stuck with the inferior product. Suntory also experimented with the brewing process and swapped yeast types, but the big adjustment, Mr Yanagi explains, came with 'consciousness'. The company at first adopted a Japanese-style management system, intended to inspire workers with regular gradings, work targets, and peer pressure. Mr Yanagi says the 400 workers found positive motivation from a different source - money: 'We discovered that these Japanese-style gradings did not have such a good effect. But money is a very good incentive in China. A bonus system was developed so that about 60 per cent of earnings are now base salary and 40 per cent are in bonuses.' Having dealt with the workforce, Suntory needed to replace the Chinese senior manager who was a barrier to innovation. After the foreign partner's customary threats to withdraw from the venture, local Chinese officials found a spirits distillery manager who made useful suggestions instead of finding reasons why changes could not be made. The eager new manager, working with Mr Yanagi, who returned to Tokyo last year, suggested the use of a 2-litre beer container, which has been a success. They also agreed to lift the bottle price of the two new beers from Yn1 (12 pence) to Yn1.50 for Prince and Yn1.80 for New Century, the prestige brew aimed at more affluent drinkers. To encourage sales, the company produced a television advertisement showing fashionable young Chinese with Jiangsu Suntory on the table. An incentive scheme was devised for distributors, who are entitled to a free trip to Tokyo or Hong Kong if they meet sales targets. But Mr Yanagi said competition was tough in China's beer market, and would get tougher with the expansion of other foreign joint ventures. Having refined the product, he is gradually expanding the target area: 'We do very well in our area, but to the north (Shandong), you have Tsingtao beer, which is dominant. Beijing is a very difficult market - the city has 13 breweries.' Shanghai is more promising, prompting Jiangsu Suntory to sell through two hotels in the city, though the deals were a result of local guanxi (connections), and not drinkers discovering a superior brew. Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu, has also been targeted, but there, as elsewhere, retail networks are greased by kick-backs and an honest operator can find doors difficult to open. As for exports, there were trial shipments to the US, Singapore, Italy and Malaysia, but the quantities were small and the cost of marketing far greater than the returns. 'In contracts, the Chinese partner likes to put in a specific figure for exports. In our contract, we said that we would try to export as much as possible, but we did not make a specific obligation. We did not accept a target.' The depreciation of the yuan has created disagreement among the partners on valuations. The Chinese side insists on valuing the imported machinery in local currency, while the Japanese company wants it converted to foreign currency, believing that the worth is understated. But the disputes are fewer than when Mr Yanagi arrived in Lianyungang: 'It is very difficult to be clear about what will happen in China, but the beer market is not so bad. We are now making profits. I think we should extend the venture (expiring in 1999) for another 10 years.'</p>

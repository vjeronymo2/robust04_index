			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By commentator Naohiro Amaya, director of the Dentsu </F> Research Institute; from the "Reading the Times" column:  "Security in the Post-Cold War Era"]    [Text] If we look back at the Cold War era, we would never  refer to it as the good times. But compared with the present,  things were simple and clear-cut back then. Values could be  classified into two categories: communist or noncommunist. Most  countries belonged to either the communist or noncommunist bloc.  Only a handful of countries remained nonaligned and neutral, and  these were of little geopolitical significance.    Regardless of whether it be the U.S. or Soviet bloc, there  was a strong stranglehold from the center against outlying  areas. For example, under the former Soviet structure, it was  inconceivable for the DPRK (North Korea) to engage in such acts  as developing nuclear weapons on its own. The two blocs armed  themselves with nuclear weapons and contested their destructive  power. By expanding their "mutual assured destruction"  capabilities in the form of simple, clear-cut figures, and by  acknowledging a balance based on a sense of fear which existed  between them, the two blocs were able to maintain a chilly state  of peace on a global scale.    With the end of the Cold War, the structure of conflict  between the United States and the Soviet Union collapsed, and  the threat of nuclear war faded. However, the forces that moved  the world became dispersed, creating a complicated structure and  making it difficult to grasp the situation in terms of figures.    In Bosnia, tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as  distrust and hatred have accumulated over hundreds of years and  have now risen to nearly uncontrollable levels. Bosnia is just  one example; there exists many similar situations throughout the  world.    Looking at the situation in Bosnia, it can be acknowledged  that the people there are hardly capable of restoring order.  Therefore, the United Nations and regional organizations such  as NATO have been asked to deploy military forces.    However, as exemplified in Somalia and Bosnia, the  "superhero" capabilities of the United Nations and other  organizations are very limited. In these cases, nuclear weapons  are worthless; it may be like trying to use oversized spears in  a confined fighting space.    To restore order in bogged down regional conflicts, it would  be necessary to deploy massive conventional forces and  policemen. However, there is hardly any country that can get its  people's consent to bear such risks and costs.    Although this situation must be rectified, enormous effort  and considerable time will be required to carry it out. It must  be acknowledged that, for the time being, the international  community lacks effective means of dealing with Bosnia-type  conflicts. In that case, what will follow an era of "chilly  peace" is probably an era of "dubious peace." In such an era,  what can be considered vitally important as security measures  will be: first, to try to detect sparks of war well in advance,  and second, to do all that can be done to prevent conflicts from  spreading to surrounding areas.    Looking at the regions surrounding Japan, it goes without  saying that the most dubious area is the Korean peninsula. The  following possibilities can be considered in regards to the  danger on the Korean peninsula: 1) use of nuclear weapons by  North Korea; 2) North Korea's invasion of the ROK via  conventional forces; and 3) abrupt internal collapse in North  Korea. As for the first two possibilities, it would be an act  of suicide for North Korea as long as the United States is  firmly determined to retaliate. In this regard, it is hoped the  United States would give a clear signal to North Korea, with no  room for any misunderstanding.    There exist hardly any common terms other than "carrot and  stick" between North Korea and normal countries. Therefore,  countries such as the United States, the ROK, and Japan should  hold a strong stick while hanging tasty carrots before North  Korea, and corner it into making a choice. If North Korea  should keep on playing with fire, these countries should try to  convince it to stop doing so by showing that continuing to do so  would only do it more harm than good.    It is also necessary to exercise adequate caution regarding  the danger of provoking internal collapse in North Korea should  the stick policy turn out to be too strong. It should not be  forgotten, also, that even if the stick were not used, the  danger of internal collapse continues to exist. In case of  internal collapse, military threats may diminish for the time  being, but there would arise increased danger of the development  of a situation on the Korean peninsula similar to the Bosnian  situation, and it may continue for a long time.    In short, the crisis on the Korean peninsula is similar to  Bosnia in that it cannot be resolved easily. To deal with this  situation, we must stop employing the simple binary-style way of  thinking [nishin-ho-teki hasso] as was done in the Cold War era.  We have now entered an era where it is necessary to "learn  about the foe, as well as about oneself" in order to carry out a  highly intellectual diplomacy which combines hardness with  softness, flexibility with firmness.</p>

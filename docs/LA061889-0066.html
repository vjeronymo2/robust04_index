			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: RICHARD THE SECOND  </P> <P> Richard Strauss was a target almost from the start of his career in the 1880s,  with the Brahmsians reviling him as Richard the Second, i.e., Wagner, his idol.  </P> <P> After the turn of the century, the Establishment took up the cudgels in  response to the screechings and eroticism of his operas "Salome" and "Elektra."  Whereupon he was lambasted by the modernists for turning his back on dissonance  in favor of Johann Strauss as well as the Classical era in his "Der  Rosenkavalier," whose success, another clique contended, he vainly tried to  repeat in subsequent, sound-alike operas.  </P> <P> But whatever insults Strauss had to suffer, he kept being performed. His  orchestral works have never been in disfavor among conductors or audiences for  they are, above all, fabulous, voluptuous showpieces.  </P> <P> It is doubtful that the 16-year-old's String Quartet in A raised many hackles.  Strauss wrote a string quartet? Well, it could be said that he didn't, that it  was actually a collaborative effort by Beethoven, Schubert and Mendelssohn.  Should prove a boggler at guess-the-composer sessions.  </P> <P> The piece surfaces via London's Delme Quartet, which knocks it off with  ruder-than-necessary vigor; ditto their treatment of the considerably superior  (and likewise sole) String Quartet by Verdi (Hyperion 66317).  </P> <P> Schumann's ghost inhabits the Sonata in E-flat for Violin and Piano, dating  from 1887, when Strauss was 23. But there is Straussian melos as well in this  overheated beauty, with its foretastes of "Don Juan" and "Heldenleben," even  the closing pages of "Ariadne auf Naxos."  </P> <P> The elegant, restrained performance (on Philips 420 944) is by Pinchas Zukerman  and Marc Neikrug, who actually bolster Strauss' cause with a sizable cut in the  overlong finale. In the accompanying Sonata in D of Prokofiev, however, the  duo's slow tempos and air of detachment rob the score of its inherent vitality.  </P> <P> The tone poems "Don Juan," "Till Eulenspiegel" and "Death and Transfiguration"  are presented with becoming swagger and virtuosity by the Cleveland Orchestra  under Lorin Maazel on a mid-priced CBS reissue (44904). But the subtleties and  lyric effusions of "Don Quixote," arguably the finest of the tone poems, are  shortchanged in the sluggish reading by Neeme Jarvi with the Scottish National  Orchestra (Chandos 86310). Under the circumstances, the sensitive solo cello of  Raphael Wallfisch counts for little.  </P> <P> The disc also offers a pretty, Schumannesque bit of Strauss juvenilia, the 1883  Romanze for cello. In addition, there are two songs: the noble, hugely  impressive "Song of the Priestesses of Apollo" (1896), originally with  orchestra, foreshadowing the final scene of "Salome," and the familiar "Ruhe  meine Seele" of 1894 for which the composer provided the ill-fitting  orchestration heard here a half-century later. Both require a heftier voice  than Felicity Lott's bright soprano, but her expressive delivery carries the  day in the "Song of the Priestesses."  </P> <P> Another curiosity -- because of the music's familiarity -- is "Ein Heldenleben"  (1898) in its perversely well-mannered, small-scale treatment by Andre Previn,  who conducts the Vienna Philharmonic (Telarc 80180). Never has Strauss' lusty  alter-ego/hero seemed so self-effacing, even insipid.  </P> <P> More troublesome still is the accompanying work, the octogenarian composer's  Four Last Songs, where Previn's underemphatic baton fails to provide a context  in which soprano Arleen Auger can float Strauss' glorious fancies.  </P> <P> Another prized work from the composer's last days is the "Metamorphosen" for  strings, in which he looks back with equal affection to Schoenberg's "Verklarte  Nacht" and his own "Rosenkavalier." It is logically coupled (on Nimbus 5151)  with Schoenberg's moonstruck piece, both being handsomely executed by the  English String Orchestra under William Boughton's unobtrusively firm, loving  guidance.  </P> <P> Good news, too, from the little British ASV label which couples (on CD 809) the  splendid "Bourgeois Gentilhomme" Suite and the charming, if somewhat dated (in  its tinkly neo-Baroqueries) Dance Suite after Couperin, both delivered with  terrific snap, precision and warmth by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under  Erich Leinsdorf, a conductor shamefully underemployed by the recording  companies these days.  </P></p>

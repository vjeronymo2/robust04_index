The Interior Ministry will most probably be divided in  several parts called "operative main departments" which will be  entrusted with fighting the most serious types of crime. The  departments will comprise criminal police.    Policemen who ensure public order may be united into  municipal police.    Firemen and investigators will become "independent"  departments, as well as the department which deals with prisons  and labour camps.    The reform scheme is currently being drafted by the interior  ministry itself, according to the sources.    Experts are split in assessing the planned reform of the  Interior Ministry. Some of them told TASS they are against  splitting the anti-crime forces while others believe the reform  of the ministry is necessary to meet the demands of the time.</p>

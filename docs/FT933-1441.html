			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Ukraine nuclear assurance UKRAINE'S President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday early elections could help to overcome obstacles to the removal of remaining nuclear weapons from its territory. In the meantime, he said, Ukraine was dismantling part of the arsenal. He told Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, he hoped for rapid agreement on staging parliamentary elections following Mr Leonid Kuchma's resignation as prime minister on Tuesday after a no-confidence vote. Ukraine is to transfer nuclear arms to Russia in exchange for nuclear fuel for power stations, under an agreement three weeks ago. But prospects for doing so remain blocked by difficulties over parliamentary ratification. Mr Kravchuk told Mr Rifkind Ukraine had already removed the warheads - 60 in all - from 10 of its older SS-19 strategic missiles and had rendered them virtually impossible to use. Ten more would be dismantled, starting later this month. Ukraine holds 130 SS-19s, including those it says it has dismantled, as well as 46 SS-24s with 10 warheads each, and about 30 nuclear bombers.</p>

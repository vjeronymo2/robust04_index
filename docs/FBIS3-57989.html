			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "Three Choices in Referendum on </F> EU in the Offing; Ballot Also Offers Option of Abstaining"]    [Text] Finns will have three choices in the national  referendum on membership in the European Union (EU) to be held  next year.    There will be two choices on the ballot for Finland's  membership in the EU: either yes or no. In  addition, they plan to include a provision on the ballot in  which it will be stated that the voter may abstain if neither of  the two choices is acceptable to him.    The committee that is studying the referendum has decided to  support an abstention option on the ballot since the law  governing the organization of a referendum enjoins [the state]  to protect the voter's right not to support any of the choices  offered.    The committee appointed by Justice Minister Hannele Pokka  (Center Party) did not venture an opinion as to when the  referendum would be organized. Headed by office chief Lauri  Tarasti, the committee is just now putting the finishing touches  to its proposal for organizing the referendum and intends to  submit it in early January.    Another special law will be enacted for the organization of  the advisory referendum. When the law is to be enacted will  depend on how far advanced the EU negotiations are. The law will  be enacted at the point when the negotiations are brought to a  conclusion.  <H5>  Whole Country Is Election District </H5>   The Tarasti Committee has also looked into the organization  of EU parliamentary elections in Finland. Last week the  committee listened to party representatives on the organization  of elections. The committee will submit its proposal in April.    If Finland becomes a member country of the EU, 16  representatives to the European Parliament will be elected from  Finland.    According to the plans, all of Finland will constitute a  single election district in European Parliament elections.    A proposal was discussed in the committee, according to  which  the country would be divided into several election districts as  for Eduskunta elections. This plan was abandoned since it would  have meant that Finland's seats in the European Parliament would  be concentrated among the three biggest parties.  <H3>  No Long  Ballots </H3>   The committee members think that it is in Finland's interest  to have many parties represented in its parliamentary  delegations. The European Parliament operates through the  parties' parliamentary delegations.    When a country is a single election district, it is up to  the  parties to take care of local representation, that is, to see to  it that representatives to the European Parliament are elected  from all over Finland.    In some parties they are planning on a so-called long ballot  system. In a long ballot system the members of the parties would  vote in the primaries for regular parliamentary election  candidates in order of precedence. Those who did best in the  primaries would be chosen from the head of the ballot for the  European Parliament.    The committee does not recommend a long ballot system. They  consider it to be poorly suited to the Finnish system.  <H5>  Finland Will Not Be Participating in Next European Elections </H5>   They are striving for local representation by dividing the  whole country into election districts, but they are not yet sure  that the model will work.    The next European Parliament elections are to be held next  spring. Finland will not yet be able to participate in them.  <H5>  Eduskunta Picks First Representatives </H5>   If Finland becomes a member of the EU, the Finnish Eduskunta  will have to nominate its first representatives to the European  Parliament. We will not be able to participate in regular  elections until the next round at the end of the decade.    The Tarasti Committee has considered a so-called dual  mandate, or whether a member of the European Parliament can also  be a member of his national parliament. In the committee's  opinion, the duties of a member of the Eduskunta and a member of  the European Parliament cannot be performed simultaneously.</p>

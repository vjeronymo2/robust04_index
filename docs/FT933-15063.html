			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued after volatile price swings Wall Street US STOCK markets ended a week of volatile prices swings on a subdued note yesterday, with stocks ending little changed in light trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up only 6.64 at 3,521.06. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.53 lower at 448.11, while the Amex composite finished up 1.82 at 434.37, and the Nasdaq composite up 3.05 at 705.76. Trading volume on the NYSE was 235m shares. On Tuesday, prices fell sharply on concerns about the economy, corporate earnings and rising commodities prices. Over the following two days, however, the markets staged an impressive rally, aided by a downturn in commodities prices and some rare good economic news. By yesterday, it was clear that investors and dealers had exhausted their interest in equities, at least temporarily. Trading throughout the day was light, and stocks barely moved from their opening values. Although commodities prices picked up again, prompting a brief sell-off in bonds, the equity markets payed little attention. A late recovery in bond prices, however, did help ensure stocks mostly remained in positive territory. Airlines were once again in the firing line, with worries about the impact on earnings of the latest round of price competition, and disappointing June air travel figures, inflicting the damage. USAir fell falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 in early trading, before rallying to end down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 14 3/4 . Also lower were AMR, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 61 1/2 and UAL, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 123 1/2 . Car stocks were higher as a group, as investor confidence in the outlook for car sales and corporate profits continued to build. Chrysler put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 47 5/8 , General Motors added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 47 3/8 , and Ford climbed Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 52 1/8 . Baxter International dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 in heavy trading after the company said it expected second quarter operating income to come in below the Dollars 252m earned a year ago. Bristol-Myers Squibb initially rose more than Dollars 1 on reports that the company has had some success in fighting lung and colon cancer, in animals with a combination of its cancer drug and monoclonal antibodies, but later fell back to end unchanged at Dollars 58 1/8 . Compaq firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 after SG Warburg raised its investment rating on the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. Canada TORONTO prices posted a small gain in moderate trading, after yesterday's sharp decline. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was up 6.57 points, or 0.17 per cent, to close at 3,927.43, for a loss on the week of about 70 points. Mining and consumer products posted small gains, financial services was flat and the gold group lost 1.07 per cent.</p>

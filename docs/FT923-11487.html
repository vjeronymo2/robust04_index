			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Shearson to take Dollars 84m charge SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and securities subsidiary of American Express, is planning to write down a substantial portion of a three-year-old bridge loan to Prime Computer. It will record an Dollars 84m second-quarter extraordinary debit as a result. The after-tax Dollars 84m charge stems from a decision by Shearson to take a Dollars 137m pre-tax write-down on a Dollars 500m bridge loan extended to Prime in 1989. The bridge loan, like many others at the time, was to have been converted into junk bonds, but this proved impossible when the junk market collapsed. The write-down is something of an embarrassment for Shearson, which only a few months ago said it considered the loan as 'money good'. In 1989, the bridge was originally part of a Dollars 1.3bn leveraged buy-out of the Massachusetts computer company, which was acquired by Whitney &amp; Company, a New York venture capital firm backed by Shearson Lehman. At the time of the loan, Shearson and its parent, American Express, jointly invested Dollars 66m in buying an equity stake in DR Holdings, the vehicle used by Whitney to acquire Prime. Last autumn, Shearson wrote down the value of its Dollars 66m equity stake to Dollars 10m In 1991, after the plan to refinance the bridge loan by converting it into junk bonds failed, Shearson converted it from a cash repayment obligation into a payment-in-kind security, meaning that accrued interest of about Dollars 70m was added to the original loan. The Shearson decision to write down the value of the loan comes a few weeks after Prime, advised by Lehman Brothers, revised the terms of a share offer aimed at raising Dollars 300m by the sale of nearly 16m shares at a price between Dollars 18 and Dollars 20 per share. The revised offer will be for 20m shares at a price of between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16.</p>

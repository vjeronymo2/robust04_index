			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Debate over arrest of paradoxical Spaniard: Can the austere Mariano Rubio really be a fraudster? A scapegoat or the most prominent fraudster in the country? Thursday's dawn arrest of Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain and now an inmate of Madrid's sprawling Carabanchel prison, has unleashed a heated national debate. The arrest, the first in connection with the spate of scandals that has engulfed the Spanish government, took place hours before Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez dismissed calls for his resignation and promised in a press conference to root out corruption. The arguments reflect the contradictions that surround the haughty and academic Mr Rubio. Not least among the paradoxes is the fact that the 63-year-old, who is formally accused of tax evasion and falsifying public documents, is already familiar with the ritual of checking into Carabanchel. He went through the routine of strip body search, head shot photographs, finger printing, removal of trouser belt and shoe laces in 1956, when he was he was linked to a clandestine socialist group at Madrid University's economics faculty and sentenced to two years' jail by the Franco dictatorship. The security police who arrested him nearly 40 years ago, and severely beat him up, were commanded by his own father, who was an army colonel. It was just as ironic that, although an atheist as well as a left-winger, he was subsequently released when General Franco marked the accession of Pope John XXIII with a partial amnesty. But the main contradiction about the disgraced Mr Rubio is that he was a role model for those committed to professionalism, austerity, decency and democracy. Mr Juan Tomas de Salas, who faced similar reprisals under Francoism and went on to become a campaigning newspaper editor, recalls that Mr Rubio even refused to take up soft mortgage loans offered by the Bank of Spain when he started work in the institution's research department. It is alleged that at the very time Mr Rubio consolidated his reputation as an outstanding public servant he was allegedly keeping from the taxman a Pta130m (Pounds 644,000) share portfolio that was managed by his lifelong friend and broker Mr Manuel de la Concha. A one-time chairman of Madrid's stock exchange, Mr de la Concha was arrested along with Mr Rubio and the two now share a cell. As deputy governor of the Bank of Spain between 1977 and 1984 and then governor until 1992, Mr Rubio steered the financial system though a banking crisis, subtly encouraged banking mergers and consolidated a renewed financial sector by demanding strict solvency ratios and ordering regular inspections. A paragon of economic orthodoxy, he regularly chastised the government for its spending and successfully lobbied for the peseta's 1989 entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, to force budgetary discipline on his political masters. 'Whatever his private dealings were, Rubio was one of the greatest governors the Bank of Spain has ever had,' says Mr Jorge Hay, a senior executive at Banco Central Hispano and a student colleague of the former governor. In an interview published by ABC newspaper yesterday Mr Rubio insisted he was unaware of having evaded taxes. His lawyers, petitioning for his release, say he is the victim of discrimination because the tax he is alleged to have evaded - Pta6.1m - is well below a revised Pta15m level which the authorities plan to establish as the threshold for pressing criminal charges.</p>

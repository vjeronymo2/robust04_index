			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> SECESSIONISTS PRESENT PLANS  </P> <P> Two resident groups seeking to withdraw from the Pasadena Unified School  District presented their requests to the 11-member county Committee on School  District Organization Wednesday.  </P> <P> One of the groups, representing residents along Rose Villa Street in an  unincorporated county area between Pasadena and San Marino, wants the area  annexed and children transferred to the San Marino school district. Residents  say they identify more with San Marino than Pasadena.  </P> <P> The second group -- representing Sierra Madre residents -- seeks to join the  Arcadia Unified School District, saying they fear gangs and violence in the  Pasadena schools.  </P> <P> The committee will schedule public hearings in the district within the next two  months and send a recommendation to the State Board of Education, said Mark  Forgy, the committee's staff secretary.  </P> <P> About four months later, the state board will hold hearings and decide whether  to allow residents in the districts involved to vote on the matter, Forgy said.  He estimated that the matter could come to a vote in November, 1990.  </P></p>

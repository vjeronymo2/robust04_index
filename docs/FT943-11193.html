			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Architecture: Demolition and Art Deco / Assessing the case for saving the Smith Kline Beecham HQ What happens when an international company wants to demolish its headquarters and finds itself at the centre of a row about the value and importance of listed buildings ? When that building is a prominent London landmark on the chief route into the city from the airport you can expect at least a debate. The leading pharmaceutical company Smith Kline Beecham earlier this year launched their campaign to win consent to demolish their Art Deco tower alongside the M4 viaduct as part of a Pounds 150m redevelopment scheme to create 1m sq ft of new offices. Their proposals were launched with hype as 'a new gateway for London' and Smith Kline Beecham with their development consultant British Land engaged the fashionable late-modernist architect Sir Richard Rogers. The launch was a flashback to the 1980s. There was a newsletter called 'Great West Revival', photographs of a model of Rogers's proposals alongside a traffic free motorway. There was no mention of the fact that the main existing building on the site 'SB House' is an 11-storey Art Deco tower that is listed Grade II - the charms of which have been diminished by its proximity to the elevated section of Westway. There were computer generated views of the Rogers' scheme showing that the 'new gateway' is a precipitous gantry across the traffic from the series of new glass office towers that he has designed for the site. The Art Deco tower is worth examination. Designed in 1937-1942 by the firm of Wallis Gilbert and Partners for the firm Simmons Aeroaccessories, it cleverly incorporated an earlier tower by GA Warren. Wallis Gilbert were pioneers of the Art Deco factory and office building, bringing the style from America and employing it commercially. They designed the Firestone Building, also on the Great West Road, which was wickedly demolished on a Bank Holiday in 1980 just as the climate changed in favour of its preservation. Wallis Gilbert's most famous building in England is the Hoover Factory at Perivale, a stunning example of neo-Egyptian Art-Deco. The Hoover factory has been gloriously restored and partly adapted as a new Tesco Superstore. It is a perfect example of the way a listed building can add value to a development. The Great West Road was once known as the Golden Mile - with its fine factories behind rolling lawns with streets of pleasing semis in large gardens (surely the conservation areas of tomorrow) surrounding them. No-one is pretending that the old traffic free world can be re-created. but the Smith Kline scheme does boast that, as well as providing 1m sq ft of offices (of which the company will occupy a quarter), a new park will be created which will, 'establish a continuity of open space and the creation of continuous green routes to the River Thames.' Richard Rogers is always creating these mythical 'routes' which only exist in drawings. The so-called park will be largely in permanent shadow and always be noisy and polluted. What are the qualities of the listed building? It is a very good example of stream-lined Art Deco with plenty of detail and all its railings and gates. Seen from the south carriageway of the A4 it is a fine example of a 'Golden Mile' building and even seen from the motorway it does have landmark qualities. Art Deco was an important parallel to the Modern Movement and is under represented in England. The building is in good structural condition and could be refurbished for Pounds 4m. There is a clear case for the retention of the listed building as an anchor building with a business park around it. Positive value could be generated by a better mixture of uses on the site. The retention of the listed building makes this more, rather than less, possible. The use of a famous architect and all the promotional words about new gateways should not fool anyone. In the official Planning Policy Guidance issued by the Department of the Environment, it would be wise for Smith Kline and their advisors to remember that 'the Secretaries of State take the view that subjective claims for the architectural merit of proposed replacement buildings should not in themselves be held to justify the demolition of listed buildings.' There is always a presumption in favour of the preservation of a listed building and this application for an outline planning consent using Richard Rogers (who may not be retained for the detailed planning consent) should clearly be rejected with the support of English Heritage. Mr Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, only has to point to the success of Bracken House in the City where Michael Hopkins added to the listed building in an inspired way. Mr Stevens should encourage Richard Rogers to be more imaginative and to keep the listed building at the heart of his scheme. There are plenty of boring glass towers around. A refurbished Deco tower will have real cachet. This kite flying operation to get a quick consent should not be allowed to go any further without serious consideration of a less intensive mixed development with the Wallis Gilbert Tower at its heart.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Barclays records Pounds 242m loss and halves dividend: Bank announces first pre-tax deficit and makes Pounds 2.5bn provision against bad debts BARCLAYS BANK, the UK's largest high street bank, yesterday announced its first pre-tax loss - a deficit of Pounds 242m. It halved its final dividend and posted the largest provision against bad debts yet allocated by a British bank. About Pounds 1.96bn of the Pounds 2.5bn provision was on specific loans in the UK. Loans to property and construction companies, many made before the property slump at the end of the 1980s, accounted for 40 per cent of the UK provisions. Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, said his salary was at least 10 per cent lower than that of Sir John Quinton, his predecessor. 'The rate for the job has fallen significantly,' he said. Mr Buxton, who was managing director of the bank under Sir John during the late 1980s when many lending decisions were made, declined to say when he would split the two roles as he has promised to do after criticism from shareholders. The bank's shares fell by 10.5 per cent to 392p on the day's trading after the surprise announcement of the cut in the final dividend. Most brokers had been anticipating lower losses of up to Pounds 100m and the dividend to be maintained. Mr Buxton said the 'very disappointing' result and the uncertain outlook for the coming year meant the bank felt it might not be able to re-build its ratio of capital to assets sufficiently without cutting the dividend. He said the bank was changing the way it handles large corporate loans to ensure that managers who make such loans take individual responsibility. The careers of some managers involved in poor lending in the past 'had suffered'. The decision by Barclays to cut its dividend was only the second time a British bank has been forced to take such action. Midland Bank, which was last year acquired by HSBC Holdings, cut its dividend two years ago. Barclays was the last of the four traditional high street banks to report 1992 profits. Its loss is one of the biggest incurred by a British clearing bank, although Lloyds made a loss of Pounds 715m in 1989 because of Third World debt provisions. Mr Buxton said the executive directors had recommended a halving of the final dividend to 6p per share because they were uncertain how far back into profit the bank would rebound this year. Of the Pounds 1.96bn provision against possible bad loans in the domestic bank, Pounds 600m related to 27 single loans of more than Pounds 5m each. They included a Pounds 240m provision on Barclays' lending to the Imry property development company. The bank made its loss despite a substantial increase in its operating profitability. Its profit before provisions rose 18 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn, as its UK business widened margins on loans and increased commission and fees. The Pounds 98m saved by the dividend cut let Barclays maintain a ratio of its core capital to assets of 5.5 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent at the end of 1991. Some analysts believe the lowest ratio of which the Bank of England is thought to approve is 5 per cent. The bank, which disclosed that it cut staff numbers by 6,400 last year and closed 189 branches, was criticised by unions. The Bifu financial services union said the loss was from 'monumental incompetence over a long period'.

He said that is a reason why many parties are being  attracted to the Congress-I.    Regarding India-Pakistan ties, the prime minister reiterated  that India is persuading Pakistan to give up its support to  terrorists. Pakistan is not responding so far, but we will  continue with our efforts.    Replying to a question, Mr. Rao said that his government is  committed to build a temple and the mosque at Ayodhya.</p>

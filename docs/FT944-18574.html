			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Saint-Louis climbs sharply Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, lifted first-half profits to FFr401m (Dollars 76m), compared with FFr252m in the same period of 1993, on a 2 per cent rise in turnover to FFr17.75bn. The sharp profit increase was partly accounted for by restructuring costs in early 1993 for the group's Euralim food subsidiary and its Arjo Wiggins Appleton paper subsidiary that did not reoccur this year. However, the profit contribution of the group's paper business rose to FFr229m compared to FFr156m in the first half of last year. In Europe, Arjo Wiggins Appleton significantly improved profitability which in the US was maintained at a high level, the group said.</p>

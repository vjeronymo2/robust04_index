			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vistec shares fall Shares in Vistec fell 6p to 13 1/2 p yesterday after the USM-quoted computer systems, software and services company reported lower interim pre-tax profits and warned that the full-year result would be 'substantially less than last year'. Despite a 44 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 17.6m) pre-tax profits for the half year to October 31 fell from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 745,000. Mr Arthur Morton, chairman, said the year had started well but that during the second quarter trading profits had declined. He cited three reasons: the ending at Sphinx Level V of the supply agreement by Informix; the performance of recently acquired ISO Communications and Data Logic Communication Services; and margin reductions in desktop computer markets because of competition. Earnings per share slipped to 0.41p (0.62p) but the interim dividend is held at 0.125p.</p>

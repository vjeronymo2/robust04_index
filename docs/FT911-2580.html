			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Tory pledge on BR sale safeguards MR Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said yesterday that privatisation of British Rail would not proceed without safeguards to protect unprofitable lines. The government has yet to say which of various options it will choose for the break-up of BR's monopoly, but Mr Rifkind said he was considering opening up use of the existing rail networks to new operators. 'Certainly what we hope to see is either the whole of British Rail or a very substantial proportion of British Rail in the private sector during the course of the next parliament,' he said on BBC Television's On the Record programme. 'We accept that when the railways are privatised it will be necessary for the government to continue giving financial support to ensure that all railway services that are socially necessary are able to continue providing that service,' said Mr Rifkind. He said operators who wanted to run services on unprofitable routes would be asked for their assessment of the minimum subsidy they needed. If BR could provide the service with a subsidy, it would be awarded the contract, but anyone providing the same service at less cost to the taxpayer would also be considered, Mr Rifkind said. He could see no reason, so long as safety standards were met, for other operators not to be granted access to all BR's track if they wanted to provide freight or passenger services. Privatisation of BR, which would be included in the Conservative party manifesto, will probably happen in the mid 1990s, Mr Rifkind said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- The transition to market  economies in East and Central Europe remains "painfully slow"  but some of these countries may have made more headway toward  economic recovery than official data suggest, the OECD said  Thursday [30 June].    Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) showed that "recorded GDP" could be expected  to show positive growth by 1995 in most transition countries  outside the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former USSR.    Poland was likely to grow by 4.0 percent this year for the  second year running and should achieve at least a 3.0 percent  rate in 1995, when the Czech Republic could be growing by 5.0  percent after a positive 1994 rate of 2.0 percent.    Hungary was expected to grow by a modest 1.0 percent this  year, rising to 2.0 percent in 1995, while "zero growth" rather  than continued contraction was expected for 1994 in the Slovak  Republic, Bulgaria and Romania.    In the latter two countries, however, stagnation could  continue in 1995, the OECD said in its semi-annual Economic  Outlook.    However, it said, in addition to Poland, with 1993 GDP  growth  of 4.0 percent, Hungary and the Czech Republic could in reality  have reached the "turning point" last year, when output also  rose in Estonia and Latvia.    This assessment was based on the view that private sector  activity, "likely to be growing fast" in most countries, was  "under-recorded" throughout the area, it said.    A "probably substantial portion of this activity is not  recorded in the national accounts," it said. According to some  studies, private sector activity may now generate over 50  percent of GDP in the region.    If this had been fully reflected in the accounts, the Czech  Republic and Hungary would "probably" have shown positive growth  last year, it said.    "Unrecorded activity creates more serious problems than  statistical quirks" because "it cannot easily be taxed," the  OECD said, adding that tax avoidance or evasion was "a principal  reason for its growth."    In its review of developments in the region, the OECD said  inflation was now generally declining in East and Central  European countries, alhough it remained high by Western  standards.    The Czech Republic had the lowest inflation level, projected  at around 11 percent this year and 10 percent in 1995, while  Romania, at the upper end, was expected to record rates of 170  and 80 percent respectively.    The Czech Republic also had the healthiest public finances,  with its budget in balance, while most of the countries were  still struggling with the budgetary consequences of the  transition from direct state control.    Their budget deficits remain high, ranging from 8.0 percent  of GDP in Bulgaria and Hungary to 4.0 percent in Poland and  Romania, and are likely to remain undder "pressure" for several  years.    These problems are also reflected in the financial sector,  marked almost everywhere by "under-capitalized banks, bad debts,  inter-enterprise arrears and difficulties in providing finance  for new private enterprise," the report said.    The OECD said exports were expected to remain "an important  engine of growth" in the transition countries despite non-tariff  obstacles in Western markets.    Their combined current account deficit is likely to widen  this year to 9.2 billion dollars from 8.4 bn in 1993, and might  improve slightly to last year's level in 1995.</p>

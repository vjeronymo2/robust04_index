			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyong-kun] </F>   [Text] The domestic development and commercialization of  the CDMA (code division multiple access) digital mobile  communication system is expected to move into high gear as  Pohang Iron and Steel Company [Posco] (the leading stockholder  of the second mobile communication service) and Korea Mobile  Telecom (the existing first mobile communication service) are  both planning to actively participate in the development of the  CDMA system which will be used by the operator of the second  mobile service.    According to the Ministry of Communications and business  sources, on 9 March, with the selection process for the operator  of the second mobile telephone service nearing the completion  stage, Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, Posco's subsidiary, is planning  to participate in the domestic development of the CDMA system  through the transfer of technical know-how from the American  firm Qualcomm, with which it has a technical cooperation  agreement and which is the advocate of the CDMA system.    Korea Mobile Telecom, which has been taken over by Sunkyong,  also has a plan to gradually introduce the CDMA system and has  decided to participate in the development process from the stage  of on-site testing of CDMA trial products, scheduled to begin  this June, to the stage of commercialization. All this will  accelerate an early acquisition of the technical expertise  necessary for the domestic development and commercialization of  the CDMA system.    In particular, the Electronics Telecommunications Research  Institute [ETRI], the main promoter of the CDMA system  development, recently signed a $5 million-dollar contract with  Qualcomm for the three-stage joint development of low-level  detailed designs of the CDMA system.    Pak Hang-ku, head of the mobile communication technology  research group, has said: "The three-stage contract calls for  designing and developing equipment used in cell sites and the  base system, developing mobile terminal equipment, and on-site  testing of trial products by this November. These stages  constitute the core of the CDMA system development." During this  period, he added, companies to build the network equipment will  be chosen.    Concerning the CDMA system development plan, Sin Yong-sop,  chief of the radio wave technology section of the Communications  Ministry, said: "As soon as the operator of the second mobile  communication service is selected, it will be made to  participate in the CDMA development plan so that it may secure  CDMA operating technology and promote procurement of the  home-made CDMA system and thus achieve the commercialization of  the system as scheduled."    He added that the second carrier will, as Korea Mobile  Telecom did, share the CDMA system research and development cost  and participate in the system development process from the stage  of on-site testing of trial products to that of their  commercialization.    The development program for the CDMA system, which will have  a decisive impact on the second carrier's schedule to open its  service and its business success, was launched in 1989. But it  has been marred by some hitches, such as those in the trial  production of equipment to be used in base and control stations,  caused by a delay in signing technology-related contracts  between Qualcomm and the ROK participants in the joint  development program.    Despite the success in the theory on the CDMA system, no  country in the world has ever applied it to commercial use. For  this reason, it is undeniable that there has been skepticism  about attempting to commercialize this frontier technology in  our country.    The Ministry of Communications adopted the CDMA mode as the  domestic standard last June ahead of any other country in the  world. Prompted by this decision, our major communication  equipment makers, such as Samsung, Goldstar, and Hyundai, led by  ETRI, embarked upon the development of the CDMA system and its  terminal equipment under a technology contract with Qualcomm.  However, in their opinion it would be difficult to achieve the  commercialization of the system by the end of 1995 because no  testing of a trial product has been conducted yet.    A concerned source said that judging from the pace of  development in the past, the commercialization of the CDMA  system by the use of domestically available technology is not  likely to be realized until 1997. He fears that the second  carrier will have to either delay the opening of the service or  spend hundreds of billions of yen to buy the whole system and  terminal equipment from abroad.    The Ministry of Communications, however, says that with the  development project proceeding smoothly, there will be no  trouble in commercializing the technology used in the CDMA  system, which has a capacity 10 to 20 times greater than the  analog system, the only problem being the level of the service  that will be offered.    The Ministry of Communications is optimistic about the tempo  of the CDMA system development program, which the government and  business are pushing with a total investment of 81.1 billion  won. According to the ministry, the development of trial  commercial products and their test runs will be completed by  this September as scheduled; and beginning next March the  production of the commercial system will begin, and the  commercial service will open in the fourth quarter after going  through an on-site testing procedure in the third and fourth  quarter.    Judging from the development process until now, overall the  local development and commercialization of the CDMA system has  no problem, except that there are delays in some particular  parts of the development program.</p>

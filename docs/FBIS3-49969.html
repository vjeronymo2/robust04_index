			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Jan 21 (TANJUG) -- The signed declaration  on the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia is conducive to peace and the  resolution of disputes by political means, but, at the same  time, it does not prejudice a political solution for the Serb  Krajina, whose future can be decided solely by the Serbian  people there, F.R.Y. Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic has  stated.    Jovanovic said in an interview published in the Belgrade  daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Friday [21 January] that the  declaration was the cornerstone of the beginning of a process of  the normalization of relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia,  since he said disagreements which emerge at the peace conference  on the former Yugoslavia would be resolved only later on in that  process.    The Serb Krajina is one of the open issues, and the F.R.Y.  can only help resolve the issue by political means and not  force, since the future of the Serb Krajina is strictly the  affair of the Krajina people, itself.    The joint declaration only strengthens the state of peace  and  it does not affect any of the centuries-old rights of the  Serbian people in the Serb Krajina, Jovanovic said.    Asked about the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and  Zagreb, which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has publicly  interpreted as a diplomatic recognition of Croatia by the  F.R.Y., Jovanovic said the liaison offices were a transitional  solution on the way of establishing full diplomatic relations,  on condition the disputed issues of interest to both countries  were first resolved.    It has been agreed that the liaison offices start working on  February 15. Serbs in Croatia will be able to seek aid from the  F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and to present possible complaints  against the actions of Croatian authorities.    Jovanovic underscored the importance of the normalization of  relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia for the Geneva peace  talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that Yugoslavia and  Croatia had decided to strengthen peace and, thereby, also the  positions of the Serb and Croat sides in the resolution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    The decision of Yugoslavia and Croatia to resolve problems  by  peaceful means has unmasked the Muslim side, which has anyway  identified itself as a side committed strictly to a war option  in the peace talks held so far, the Yugoslav foreign minister  said in the interview to the Belgrade daily.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source in the Defense Ministry has  stated the following: A dangerous development in the miltiary  incidents being directed by the ruling family in Sanaa has  occurred. A number of Republican Guard, Central Security Force,  tank, and armored vehicle units have taken up positions around  the 1st Artilley Brigade in Yarim. The brigade's position  became dangerous around 1200 today, when crowds [as heard]  successively bore down on them. The Defense Ministry has briefed  local, Arab, and international public opinion on the acts being  carried out by the military command in Sanaa, and it places full  responsibility on these rulers, whose appetite has been whetted  by in-fighting among the sons of the homeland, the waste of  their blood, and the resulting grave consequences. These events  place the country on the brink of a devastating civil war that  will destroy everything.</p>

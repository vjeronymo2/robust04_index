			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria's L1,058bn rights issue wins shareholder approval FONDIARIA, Italy's third-biggest private-sector insurance group, which suffered a L578bn loss last year, yesterday won shareholder approval for a L1,058bn (Dollars 658.4m) rights issue. However, Gaic, the listed holding company which controls Fondiaria, surprised shareholders by announcing it would partly subscribe to the issue. As a result, the stake held by Gaic, which is jointly controlled by the heavily-indebted Ferruzzi group and the heirs of Mr Camillo De Benedetti, will fall to about 34 per cent from 51 per cent. Minority shareholders in both Fondiaria and Gaic have complained that the rights issue, announced soon after the scale of Ferruzzi's financial problems became apparent, would have meant that control of Fondiaria would have passed to Ferruzzi's five main creditor banks. Under the terms of the offer, the banks, led by Mediobanca, are fully underwriting the rights issue. In an attempt to diffuse minority shareholders' wrath and potential conflicts with Milan magistrates monitoring the Ferruzzi rescue, Gaic has decided to sell the rights to about half the new shares to which it is entitled, using the proceeds to finance the purchase of the remainder. The underwriting banks have indicated to Gaic that the rights will be worth a maximum L16,000 a share Fondiaria's proposed rights issue, approved by shareholders in Florence yesterday, involves issuing two new shares at L6,500 each for every share currently held. Fondiaria shares were trading at almost L27,000 before the issue was announced. The decision could mean Gaic will remain the biggest single shareholder in Fondiaria: had it not subscribed to any new shares, its stake in Fondiaria would have dropped to about 17 per cent. However, the precise ranking of shareholders will depend partly on how many minority shareholders take up their rights. At present, Mediobanca has about 15 per cent of Fondiaria, while Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, with which it is closely associated, has about 7 per cent. Fondiaria will use the proceeds to recapitalise its La Fondiaria, Milano and La Previdente subsidiaries. Some of the money will also go to cutting group debts of L2,368bn at the end of June. Fondiaria's financial difficulties stem from its heavy spending to buy into Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second-biggest insurer, as well as ambitious European expansion plans with AMB and Royal Insurance of the UK. Fondiaria also embarked on an expensive and unsuccessful diversifications in its domestic market, financing largely through debt.</p>

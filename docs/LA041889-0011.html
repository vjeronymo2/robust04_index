			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A drug commonly prescribed for sedation and relief of cold symptoms is linked  to sudden infant death syndrome and should not be sold without a prescription,  a public interest research group said. Public Citizen Health Research Group  urged the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its decision allowing  over-the-counter sales of the drug known by the trade name Phenergan. The group  filed a petition with the FDA four months ago to block over-the-counter sales.  FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the group's petition is under review. The  drug is manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Company spokeswoman Audrey  Ashby said that "in their 35 years of marketing, these syrups have been  remarkably problem-free."  </P></p>

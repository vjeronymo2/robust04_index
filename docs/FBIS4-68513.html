			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Zakharov: "Results of the Competition </F> Have Provoked Dissatisfaction on the Part of `Tomskneft':  Scandal in Tomsk Oblast"]    [Text] Leonid Filimonov,  general director of Tomskneft Joint Stock Company, held a press  conference yesterday on the results of the international  competition for the right to explore and develop oil and gas  deposits in the Pudinsko-Parabelskiy District of Tomsk Oblast.  Mr. Filimonov believes that "the competition was conducted to  the detriment of Russian oil men" and that the Swiss IMEG  Management S.A. consortium was announced as the winner of the  competition on the basis of unwarranted advantageous rules.  According to Mr. Filimonov, he found out about this competition  only a month before the results were announced and, therefore,  Tomskneft was not able to participate in it. Representatives of  the Geointertek Joint Enterprise, the company that conducted the  competition, told correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that the  rules governing the competition did indeed change somewhat over  a period of two years, but that the Joint Enterprise did not  hide this fact. According to Geointertek representatives, this  competition was, on the whole, not very attractive to investors,  because the development of disputed deposits would probably be  unprofitable.  <H5>  The Strange History of the Competition </H5>   The first international tender for the barely-explored  Pudinsko-Parabelskiy deposits was presented in the city of  Denver (USA) back in the summer of 1992. At the time, packets  with geological information for tender applications were  purchased by seven foreign companies, and the first results were  to have been received in January 1993. Several companies,  however, in anticipation of preferential tax rates from the  Russian government, asked that the tenders be delayed until July  1, 1993. Preferential rates were not received by that time, and  the tenders--due to unprofitability of the project for foreign  investors--were not offered.    In March 1994, however, after Boris Yeltsin's decree of  December 24, 1993 ("On Issues of Agreements Regarding  Allocations of Production in Using Mineral Resources"), which  changed the tax policy in the oblast, this competition again  became attractive to investors. For this reason, in March of  this year the Tomsk Oblast administration announced an  "extension" of the competition with all the former rules still  in effect.    These rules were rather strict. The entire competitive  territory was divided into 20 parcels--"blocks"--and  applications for "a territory less than one block in size" were  not accepted, but the amount of the bonus was calculated on the  basis of each square kilometer of a block. It was also assumed  that bonus payments would be made immediately after the results  of the competition have been made known, but in the event a  contract was not signed with the winner, the Russian side had  the right to keep 20 percent of the bonus as a security payment.    Nevertheless, as a result of the competition, the  winner--the  IMEG Corporation--received only parts of the 9th, 10th, and 17th  competitive blocks, the territory of which has known oilfields  amounting to 23 million tonnes. According to data from experts,  these are the most convenient "pieces" for which other  companies--that had intended to participate in tenders back in  1992--could have fully competed.    Requests to clarify what the bonus consists of were not  fulfilled either; for example, that a part of the sum was  definitely a security payment. According to the results of the  competition, the consortium is obligated to pay $2.5 million out  of its bonus only "when an agreement has been signed and  implemented between the Russian and foreign parties," and  another $6 million of the bonus to be paid to "the Tomsk Oblast  fund for social support when a certain level of extraction of  hydrocarbons has been achieved, which will constitute a subject  for negotiations." According to experts, thanks to the  afore-mentioned "negotiations," the payment of most of the bonus  can be simply delayed for an indeterminate period of time.    [Boxed item]    The Pudinsko-Parabelskiy part of Tomsk Oblast is in the  south  and center of the oblast. It is divided into 20 sections--blocks  that range from 2,000 to 6,000 sq meters each. Approximately 20  deposits of oil and gas are found here. Oil reserves that can be  extracted from them range from 0.4 to 4.0 million tonnes and  more. It has been admitted that development of these oilfields  is not profitable for the Tomsk Oblast oil refineries, but  profits could be made if modern Western technology were to be  used. The total amount of reserve oil that can be extracted for  industrial purposes in the Pudinsko-Parabelskiy area is 28.6  million tonnes; average reserves of oil in the oilfields is 1.6  million tonnes; extractable reserves of gas condensates total  13.1 million tonnes; and extractable reserves of gas total  72,346 billion cubic meters. From a geological perspective, only  30 percent of this section has been studied.]  <H5>  The Oblast Administration Is Happy With the Results of the </H5> Competition    Only two companies participated in the last competition. The  second one, the Russian Konventsiya Joint Stock Company  together, with its co-investor, the Norwegian firm Skaninvest  (Scandinavian International &amp; Investment), did not provide  information about its financial and technological capabilities.  In addition, Konventsiya proposed $2.2 million in bonus payments  and $10 million for conducting geological exploration work  during 1994-95 in an area of 7,400 square kilometers.    Meanwhile, the IMEG consortium pledged to pay a bonus of  $8.5  million, as well as to spend a minimum of $46 million only on  exploration of deposits in an area of 2,870 sq kms during the  first five years. According to the IMEG proposal, the Russian  share of the project's profits would be 64-66 percent.    According to Vladimir Ponomarenko, first deputy chief of the  Tomsk Oblast Administration, IMEG's victory in the  competition--one condition of which was participation in  developing new deposits for the Tomskneft Joint Stock Company  and the Tomskneftegazgeologiya State Enterprise--will result in  creating new employment, saving the geological service, and  implementing a program for supplying the oblast with gas. In  addition, the Russian side is counting on receiving 25 percent  of the extracted raw material and, moreover, around two thirds  of all payments tied to exploration and development of deposits  will remain in the oblast. The oblast administration estimates  that capital expenditures alone by foreign investors to  implement this project will amount to $300-400 million. A  significant portion of this money will "settle" in the oblast.  <H5>  Tomskneft Is Not Happy With the Results of the Competition </H5>   Leonid Filimonov, general director of Tomskneft, announced  at  a press conference, that the day before he had had a "tough  talk" about the results of the competition with Viktor Kress,  head of the Tomsk Oblast Administration, who had signed off on  the results of the competition. Mr. Filimonov declared that he  found out about the competition only one month before the  results were announced. So, even if Tomskneft had participated  in the competition, it could not have prepared itself well  enough to compete with the foreigners. More than anything else  with regard to the results of the competition, Mr. Filimonov was  indignant about the fact that a foreign concern became the owner  of a license to develop the territory. Mr. Filimonov believes  that the administration should have given "a priority to local  forces, to the union of oil men, oil technicians, and  geologists, and then we could have invited foreigners...".    The head of Tomskneft declared that he "thinks that the  consortium will not invite me to work, but will invite its own  foreign workers." In his words, Tomskneft "is the enterprise  that we are establishing to supply the oblast with gas, and it  should receive a priority license for exploring deposits."    [Boxed item]    Over the last two years this is already the second scandal  revolving around Russian tenders, organized by the Geointertek  Joint Enterprise.    On November 20, 1992, KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote that a certain  Commission for Financial and Legal Control and Struggle Against  Corruption, under the then Premier Yegor Gaydar, had been  checking the results of oil tenders in the Republic of Komi,  organized by Geointertek. The competition was won by the  American Occidental Oil Company, which pledged to pay a bonus of  $10.5 million. A check was written for the first $2.02 million.  However, as the Commission found out, in 1992 this money did not  go to Russia. Edvard Gendelman, deputy chairman of the  Geointertek board, deposited the entire amount of the bonus--in  two parts--in the account of the Central Bank in Denver. Then,  according to information from the Commission, "notwithstanding  the demands of the Central Bank to transfer the given amount to  Russia," it was transferred to the account of the Nafta/UK/LTD  Company in the Indosuez Bank in London. But after five days, the  entire sum was transferred to the account of  Ukhtaneftegazgeologiya in Komi.    Members of the above Commission declared that this occurred  thanks to their efforts and pressure on the directors of  Geointertek. The results of the Commission's investigation were  handed over to the prosecutor and the Directorate of Internal  Affairs of Tomsk Oblast, but nothing came of the verification  that took place there.    Meanwhile, the directors of the Joint Venture itself do not  see anything illegal in any of these maneuvers with the $10.5  million. According to Mr. Teplitskiy's explanation, the bonus  was not supposed to be transferred to Russia prior to the  signing of the documents testifying to the results of the  competition. With regard to "throwing" the money to London,  well, this was done so that the money could be sent directly  from there to a bank in Komi. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, the  Joint Venture has statements from banks in Denver and London to  the effect that the money could not have been used in any way by  Gendelman. Mr. Teplitskiy believes that the efforts of Gaydar's  commission did not at all facilitate the transfer of the money  to Russia: "It would have come without all that." Incidentally,  by decision of the Komi Council of Ministers, for organizing  this competition the Geointertek Joint Venture received about $2  million that came out of the bonus payments.]  <H5>  Organizers of the Competition Are Happy With Everything </H5>   Vladimir Teplitskiy, acting head of the Geointertek Joint  Enterprise, which conducted the competition, told the  correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that "the scandal surrounding  the results of the competition was caused by political motives  and attempts by certain forces to compromise Governor Viktor  Kress."    Mr. Teplitskiy insisted that the rules of the competition  were not violated, but simply changed over these past two years  and were related, in part, to conditions for paying out bonuses.  According to him, even under these new conditions Geointertek  had great difficulty in attracting the attention of foreign  firms towards this competition because the Ministry of Economics  had concluded that the development of these territories was  unprofitable. In any case, Mr. Teplitskiy admitted that studies  of this area were very weak and that it might be possible to  find large oilfields at deeper and older strata, which--for all  practical purposes--have not been studied here at all. Huge  investments are needed for this. For this reason, Mr. Teplitskiy  considers the results of the competition as a great victory, all  the more because the IMEG project will provide work to the  poverty-stricken Tomsk oil geologists.    Be that as it may, in addition to the term "a block of  territory," the rules of the competition also had the term "a  single block"--an area of 100 sq kms from which large blocks  were formed. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, it was not allowed to  subdivide precisely these single blocks, but any of the large 20  blocks could be subdivided. At any rate, he admitted that it was  possible to have a "double meaning" from reading this text.    In Mr. Teplitskiy's words, the announcement about renewing  the competition was published well in advance in the bulletin of  the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Russian Geology  Committee, so anyone who was interested had time to participate  in the competition. It is true, he admitted, that nothing was  said about changes in the rules or conditions for the  competition in this announcement.</p>

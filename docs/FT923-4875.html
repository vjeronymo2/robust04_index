			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / GM strikers see progress in talks A SPOKESMAN for United Auto Workers (UAW) yesterday said progress was being made in the trade union's talks with General Motors (GM) over the Ohio strike, which has affected more than 30,000 GM workers. Mr Reg McGhee, the UAW official, said a settlement was not yet in sight, but the union was cautiously optimistic the talks were moving forward. The talks have been underway since August 28, when some 2,300 workers went on strike over job security and related issues at a crucial metal-stamping plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Separately, an agreement was yesterday reached between GM and the UAW over health and safety issues at a Lordstown car assembly plant. Although this accord will not affect the strike at the metal-stamping plant - the source of the broader shutdown - the UAW official called it 'a positive step that indicates the two sides are willing to negotiate an end to the situation.' The strike at the metal-stamping plant resulted in GM's decision to shut down production at a series of car assembly plants around the US, which were suffering shortages of components. A total of 32,500 workers  - of GM's total US hourly workforce of 300,000 - have been affected so far. Over the past week the following plants have been shut down because of the Ohio strike: The Tennessee plant that employs 6,000 workers assembles GM's low-priced Saturn model; The Lordstown, Ohio plant that employs 7,000 workers and assembles Chevrolet and Pontiac models; A Baltimore van plant with 2,900 employees; A Michigan plant with 4,200 workers that assembles Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles; A Buick and Pontiac plant with 4,200 workers in Wentzville, Missouri; A Buick plant in Flint, Michigan with 4,200 workers An Oklahoma Buick and Oldsmobile plant with 4,000 employees.</p>

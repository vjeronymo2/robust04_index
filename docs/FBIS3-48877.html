As for changes in the State Law and  Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) policy on human rights, the  government has judged that "because gradual improvements have  been observed in the country's situation concerning human  rights, this opportunity should be taken to seek a policy of  dialogue" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source).    Specifically, it is expected that a small-scale aid program  in which 3 million-5 million yen will be extended in each  instance to purchase medical equipment and drugs for hospitals  will be implemented by the end of the current fiscal year. This  is to be done through such nongovernment organizations (NGO) as  the Burmese Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders. Ever since a  military coup took place in Burma in 1988, Japan has as a rule  suspended all new aid programs to that country, except for  emergency humanitarian aid.    Starting in April 1992, when General Than Shwe became  chairman of the SLORC, the Burmese military dictatorship has  released political prisoners, ceased attacks against ethnic  minorities, and lifted martial law. It has also permitted  meetings between opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (a Nobel  Prize winner), who has been under house arrest, and her family.  Such changes have thus been noted in the government's clampdown  policy.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Keating takes tightrope walk to Indonesia: The Australian prime minister's first official overseas trip MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, arrives in Jakarta today on his first official overseas trip, hoping to promote trade links and cement relations with Australia's increasingly prosperous northern neighbour. To do so, he will have to walk a tightrope between two cultures - showing sufficient concern about human rights to satisfy voluble domestic critics, while avoiding an embarrassing rupture with President Suharto, his sometimes volatile host. Evidence of the inherent difficulties appeared at the weekend in the shape of wooden crosses planted outside Indonesia's Canberra embassy, in memory of 124 East Timorese allegedly killed by Indonesian troops in November. The crosses are deeply embarrassing to the Australian government, which obtained a court order to end a similar demonstration in January, and later changed the law to try to prevent a repetition. But the demonstration reflects continued public concern about Indonesia's treatment of minorities, especially in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed in 1976, and Irian Jaya, formerly Dutch New Guinea. To Mr Keating's discomfort, it also highlights a contrast between Australia's tradition of robust public debate and the government's desire not to irritate President Suharto, who came to power in 1967. Indonesia is notoriously touchy about foreign criticism of its internal affairs, especially from Australia. In 1986, for example, bilateral relations were frozen after the Sydney Morning Herald suggested the president's family was involved in corrupt business dealings. However, the relationship has improved significantly in the last five years, partly because of a close personal friendship between Senator Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, and Ali Alatas, his Indonesian counterpart. The two countries worked together closely in the development of Australian proposals which formed the basis of the United Nations peace plan being implemented in Cambodia. Indonesia also helped overcome regional suspicion, notably in Malaysia, of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process launched by Mr Bob Hawke, the former Australian prime minister. Possibly the most important breakthrough came last year, when the two countries signed an agreement allowing oil exploration and production in disputed areas of the Timor Sea. Several Australian states have also developed contacts with Indonesian provinces, and Mrs Carmen Lawrence, premier of Western Australia, will be in Surabaya on Thursday when Mr Keating opens a state government office there. Much of the increased interest in Indonesia is being driven by Canberra's attempts to carve out an Asian future for Australia, in deference to geographic realities and the waning of traditional links with Europe. Australians are also waking up to the material progress being made by Indonesia, which achieved annual economic growth of more than 6 per cent through most of the 1980s, and now boasts GDP of USDollars 100bn (Pounds 56.4bn), which is more than a third of the Australian level. So far Australian exports have been largely restricted to commodities such as oil, wheat and cotton, while Indonesia sells petroleum products, textiles and oil to Australia. But bilateral trade surged by 27 per cent to USDollars 2.3bn last year, making Indonesia Australia's ninth largest trading partner. Aggregate Australian investment in Indonesia totals about ADollars 1bn, but most is focused on a handful of mining projects. Mr Philip Flood, the Australian ambassador to Jakarta, admits that Indonesia's potential is not sufficiently well known in Australia. Mr Keating will try to redress that problem by stressing the progress which has been made in negotiations on putative agreements on double taxation, fisheries co-operation and investment regulations. But his main concern will be to try to build on evidence that Indonesia's political culture is maturing sufficiently to allow its relationship with Canberra to withstand the shock of events such as the massacre in East Timor. Jakarta has responded with noticeable restraint to Australian criticism of the shootings, and the Indonesian military reacted cautiously last month to attempts by a 'peace boat', carrying demonstrators, media and politicians, to sail from Darwin to East Timor without permission. Australia has sought to play down the massacre by focusing on Indonesia's 'credible' establishment of a government inquiry which concluded that 50 people had died, rather than 19, as the army claimed. Canberra's view is that the report shows the massacre did not happen as a result of government policy - a formula which will allow Mr Keating to deprecate the killings without being forced to endorse domestic criticism of the Indonesian government. Mr Keating has made clear, for example, that he will resist pressure from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid to seek Indonesian pledges on human rights in return for Australian aid, which last year totalled ADollars 114m. Officials say the prime minister has taken to heart advice from Mr Richard Woolcott, the recently retired head of the foreign affairs department, to avoid annoying the Indonesians with 'excessive self-righteous moralising'. Mr Woolcott, one of the architects of Australia's Asian policy, warned recently that nothing annoys Asian leaders more than interference in their domestic affairs by Australia, which many regard as 'uncouth, lazy, self-satisfied and unwilling to make the effort to understand them and their societies'. Mr Keating's difficult task will be helped by President Suharto's pleasure in his choice of Jakarta for his first foreign trip, rather than the more traditional destinations of London or Washington - a decision which also underlines the changing priorities of Australia. Nevertheless, he will have to perform a delicate balancing act if he is to leave Indonesia on Thursday with both the bilateral relationship and his domestic reputation intact.</p>

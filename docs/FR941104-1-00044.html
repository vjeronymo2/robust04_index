			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AHA indicated that new export markets have caused narwhal ivory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices to increase in Canada following a price decline in the mid-1980's,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has returned ivory prices to about the same prices as existed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early 1980's. This increase in the price of narwhal ivory prices has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that ivory rather than maktag and meat has become the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modern hunting in eastern Canada. AHA noted that take quotas have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed by Greenland, and that there are no controls on trade in ivory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as previously mentioned, since 1985 a no detriment finding is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the issuance of CITES export permits by Greenland and for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import permit by Denmark.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defenders also asserted that the prime motivation for the take of narwhal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in recent years has been the ivory, stimulated by new export markets and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resurgence in the price of ivory since the mid-1980's, which has biased take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the adult males. They feel that this could jeopardize narwhal population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure by the removal of a larger number of males. They contended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current CITES listing of the narwhal in Appendix II does not provide adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring of take because there is not a substantial domestic market for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narwhal tusks in Canada, and yet export permits were issued for fewer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> half the tusks obtained in Canadian narwhal hunts between 1975 and 1990. From  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this, Defenders concluded that a large number of tusks must have been exported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without CITES permits, but presented no evidence for this conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, due to the uncertainty and concern surrounding the catch levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narwhals for the ivory market, Defenders supported an Appendix I listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIA submitted comments that supported their original proposal that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the narwhal be included in Appendix I. They provided an estimate of 28,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narwhal in the combined Canada-Greenland High Arctic population. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed the utilization of maktag and meat, the demand for narwhal ivory in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada, and the export of Greenland ivory to Denmark and on into the EU. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline in ivory prices of the early 1980's has, according to EIA, now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to about those same levels. EIA pointed out the absence of quotas on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take of narwhal in Greenland, suggested that the application of quotas in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada is inadequate, and that the number of narwhal taken does not reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual take numbers because of the loss of wounded or killed animals before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are landed. They also pointed out the difficulty of assessing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the market demand for ivory and hunting intensity. EIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that additional information on life history, distribution, abundance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hunting loss rates was needed to assess the stocks and the impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade in the various parts derived from narwhal in order to properly manage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Greenland Home Rule Government and the Fisheries Agency of Japan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAJ) objected to transferring the narwhal to Appendix I. Greenland did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree that narwhals should be placed in Appendix I due to unsustainable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hunting pressures caused by the international trade in narwhal ivory. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that recent population estimates did not adequately take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submerged whales, which would give corrected estimates sufficient to sustain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hunting pressures greater than current harvest levels. They also maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that low levels of ivory export reported for Greenland before 1985 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially an artifact of the change in their political designation at that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, prior to which the shipment of ivory to Denmark was not considered as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export. They noted that, even though there are no catch quotas for Greenland,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are strict regulations on catch reporting, vessel sizes, etc., and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are two reserve areas in Greenland waters where narwhal are protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the FAJ felt that a listing in Appendix I should be based only on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific evidence that there is a threat to extinction and that trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control is necessary for the protection of the species. Furthermore, the FAJ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that the narwhal is already in Appendix II, providing some control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade and a mechanism for collecting trade data, and that in the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new information indicating a deterioration in the status of the species there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no need for consideration of a change to Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government of Canada also does not agree with an Appendix I proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the narwhal. They feel that recent estimates of the Canadian High Arctic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stocks are low by as much as 50 percent due to an underestimation of the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narwhals spend under water (as indicated in the 1992 Report of the Sub-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee on Small Cetaceans of the International Whaling Commission), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this larger population size can sustain current catch levels. They also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feel that their catch quotas are adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) does not support an Appendix I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing for the narwhal at this time, but noted that Canada and Greenland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be encouraged to obtain additional and better information on the status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and trends of narwhal stocks, and on harvest levels (particularly regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals that are struck and lost during hunting).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

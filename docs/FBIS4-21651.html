			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Proposal"] </F>   [Text] The United States, it appears, has stepped up its  efforts to get Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme. As an  incentive it is now willing to allow Pakistan to take delivery  of the 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for but which it  cannot have owing to the Pressler Amendment. This is the  exchange that is apparently proposed in U.S. non-papers to the  Pakistan government. Thse is no doubt that the acquisition of  the advanced aircraft will go a long way in redressing the  military imbalance between India and Pakistan, but the price  being demanded has to be carefully assessed. Pakistan should not  in the process of narrowing the gap in conventional weapon  capability between the two countries end up bartering away  whatever it has by way of maintaining a nuclear deterrent  vis-a-vis India. It is significant that while Pakistan is being  made such an offer nothing similar is being proposed to India in  order to get it to cap its nuclear programme.    A number of things have to be considered here. To put it  bluntly Pakistan no longer has the room for manoeuvre that it  enjoyed during the years when US foreign policy placed a high  premium on getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan. In a world  that has changed in more ways than one since then we will have  to proceed carefully in order to meet the requirements of our  security on the one hand and to avoid getting totally isolated  on the other. While the Kashmir issue remains unsettled and a  hostile India increases its defence budget by 20 per cent we  cannot afford any laxity with regard to our security concerns.  Equally, however, as the experience of the erstwhile Soviet  Union falling apart has clearly demonstrated, nuclear capability  alone is no guarantee of national strength. Pakistan may  continue to insist on linking whatever steps it takes in the  direction of nuclear non-proliferation with India's actions in  this context. At the same time, however, it should also avoid  the pitfall of getting into a debilitating nuclear arms race  with India that will impose relatively far greater costs on it.  To that extent it is for Pakistan to determine first what it  considers as the necessary minimum in terms of its nuclear  capability and then examine the US proposals. According to one  report the US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel,  currently visiting India, has said that the sale of F-16s to  Pakistan is linked to a major non- proliferation step on the  part of Pakistan. Just what kind of a step we can take in this  direction should be a matter of careful deliberation of all  aspects relating to our security. What she has said on the  subject could well be taken to mean that Pakistan's existing  means of nuclear deterrence would not be affected by the US  proposal of stopping the production of nuclear material for  weapons and verification of this step. If so, this could have  significant implications for the choices Pakistan has. In any  case the visit of the US Deputy Secretary of State to New Delhi  and Islamabad early next month as well as that of Pakistan's  Chief of Army Staff at about the same time to Washington will be  important in terms of ascertaining the details of the proposal.  Before making any definite response or counter-proposals the  government would do well to take the opposition into confidence  and the latter should refrain from using an issue of such  crucial significance in terms of our security for the purpose of  gaining political mileage.</p>

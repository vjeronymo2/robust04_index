			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (CNS)--Overseas listing of shares  issued by China's enterprises should be based on the development  of domestic securities market, the Deputy Director of the State  Debts Management Department of the Ministry of Finance Mr Gao  Jian said in the opening ceremony of a senior training class for  the overseas listing of China's enterprise shares.    Such listing, according to Mr Gao, is a matter of fund  raising as well as development of the securities market. So  long as the securities market at home develops to a certain  extent in which various kinds of markets operate quite sound and  are under proper supervision while enterprises see greater  capability for self renovation and for further development,  enterprises are then qualified for the listing of their shares  abroad and an expected success is therefore possible.    Mr Gao pointed out that China's securities market started in  1988 with establishment of the circulation market for national  bonds. He added that the national bond market was considered  the centre of the entire securities market. Proper handling of  relationship between the national bond market and the securities  market is key to healthy development of the securities market in  China. [as received]    The national bond market has in recent years proceeded at a  fast pace with business entities undertaking transaction of  national bonds situated at various cities across the country. A  layout for securities trading basically took shape with the  Shanghai Securities Exchange, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange  and the Wuhan Securities Centre as its core and featuring a  national automated securities quotation system as well as a  large number of trading venues outside the exchange centres.  The trading pattern covers spot transaction, national bond  futures and repurchase transaction. A new system for the  trading of national bonds which was set up last year will see  further improvement this year while the system for issuance and  circulation of the no-voucher national bonds tended to be much  more sound.</p>

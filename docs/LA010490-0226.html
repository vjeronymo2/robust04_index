			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANKEY GAME PLAN: STOP TAYLOR;  </P> <P> PLAYOFFS: IF THE RAMS' OFFENSIVE TACKLE DOES HIS JOB WELL, HE WON'T GET MUCH  TELEVISION TIME, BUT HE WILL BE PIVOTAL AS L.A. TAKES ON THE GIANTS.  </P> <P> Irv Pankey has the kind of dirty but thankless job that generally goes  unnoticed.  </P> <P> He wants to keep it that way Sunday.  </P> <P> Pankey, the Rams' offensive left tackle, knows he will hardly be mentioned if  he does a good job in the playoff game against the Giants.  </P> <P> But if he lets New York linebacker Lawrence Taylor get a couple of sacks,  Pankey figures to be prominently featured on national television.  </P> <P> "That's the way it always works at offensive tackle. You let him get a sack and  John Madden will be drawing a diagram and they'll run it back in slow motion,"  said Pankey, the man primarily charged with the responsible for keeping Taylor  out of Ram quarterback Jim Everett's face.  </P> <P> The Pankey-Taylor match-up is considered one of the keys in the NFC semifinal  playoff game, based on the fact that the usually dominant linebacker wasn't  much of a factor in the last two meetings between the teams.  </P> <P> The Rams beat the Giants 45-31 in September, 1988, at the Meadowlands, then  handed them a 31-10 loss last November at Anaheim.  </P> <P> New York's defense had a total of two sacks in those games, and, in the recent  meeting, Pankey helped limit Taylor to just two tackles and no sacks.  </P> <P> However, Pankey, a 6-foot-5, 280-pounder in his 10th NFL season, knows he'll  have a battle on his hands in the rematch.  </P> <P> "You can't look back at the past because every game is different, even if  you're playing the same guy," he said.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he (Taylor) will be ready to play. They're going to be on their home  turf, and they're going to be well-rested."  </P> <P> Pankey said he will try to take Taylor "out of his rhythm" but added that he's  making no special preparations to play against him.  </P> <P> "You can't prepare for any particular player; you might not prepare well for a  guy that doesn't have the name of Lawrence Taylor, and that guy might push you  around," Pankey said.  </P> <P> "I prepare myself for every game like I'm going against Lawrence Taylor.  </P> <P> "I think more about what I'm doing; if I can take care of what I'm supposed to,  everything will work out."  </P> <P> Although the Rams and Giants both have been diplomatic to a fault as their  playoff contest approaches, with no war of words before this game, Pankey did  take issue with one quote attributed to Taylor.  </P> <P> Told that Taylor has said that he, Taylor, has slowed a step, Pankey at first  said, "Well, he's been in the league for nine years and he's been in on an  awful lot of tackles. . . . Heck, I'm slower than I was."  </P> <P> But Pankey then added, "I don't think he's a step slower; maybe the younger  guys coming in now are just a little bit faster."  </P></p>

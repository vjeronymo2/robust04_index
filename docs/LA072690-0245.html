			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BY THE TWILIGHT'S LAST SCREAMING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: ROSEANNE BARR SPIT ON THE GROUND AFTER FANS BOOED HER SHRILL  RENDITION OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr made an obscene gesture and spit on the ground after she was  booed at a San Diego Padres game for a shrill rendition of the national anthem  in front of 30,000 baseball fans.  </P> <P> The comedienne and star of ABC's "Roseanne" appeared to struggle Wednesday  night with an echo from the sound system as she sang between games of a  doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds, said Ron Seaver, the Padres' promotions  director.  </P> <P> Barr plugged her ears with her fingers at the start of the song, then sang in a  shrill voice. After the boos began, Barr reached toward her crotch and spit on  the ground.  </P> <P> Barr's husband, Tom Arnold, later made a ceremonial pitch with no reaction, but  Barr got more boos as she waved to the crowd and left with him.  </P> <P> "The Padres understand that many people were concerned about Roseanne Barr's  rendition of the national anthem," Seaver said. "She was doing the best she  could under the circumstances of the audio delay and she certainly meant no  disrespect to the national anthem."  </P> <P> Barr said she was pleased with her performance.  </P> <P> "I think I did great and people wanted more," she told a reporter for KFMB-TV  before leaving the field. Asked about the boos, she said, "Yeah, well, just  because they weren't up front."  </P> <P> At least two Padres players were upset by her singing, spitting and gesturing.  </P> <P> "I was embarrassed as a person and I was embarrassed for them (the Padres),"  said Padres pitcher Eric Show, who was on the field. "I can't believe it  happened. It's an insult. There are people who died for that song."  </P> <P> Said Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn: "I thought it was a disgrace. When they said  she was going to sing the national anthem I thought something like this was  going to happen."  </P> <P> The Associated Press called Barr's publicist in Los Angeles on Wednesday and  left a message requesting comment. The call was not immediately returned.  </P></p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Mexican president calls for new pay and prices pact Attempting to calm fears about an inflationary spiral, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo claimed in a nationwide address on Thursday that any devaluation-inspired economic problems would be 'transitory'. To get through this period, the president said a new accord would be reached between business and labour to prevent wages and prices from getting out of hand. Attention has now turned towards intense negotiations to revise the Pacto, Mexico's basic economic covenant among the leaders of government, business and labour. If the new Pacto can work, Mexico could yet emerge from the present crisis on stronger footing. If it fails, the problems deriving from devaluation will be much more lasting. A senior government official said that the fight against inflation would depend on heading off demands for higher wages and that President Zedillo was working hard to convince labour unions to accept a short-term sacrifice in real wages as the price for keeping the inflationary bubble small. 'The president is spending a lot of political capital on the Pacto,' said the official. The Pacto began as a stop-gap measure in November 1987 when inflation hit 157 per cent and the Mexican economy was threatening to unravel. The government mobilised its considerable political might, brought unions and business leaders to the table and hammered out an agreement that was critical in reducing inflation considerably and wages even more. The Pacto was criticised by market-oriented economists for preventing the establishment of market rates for labour and thereby increasing unemployment. Nonetheless, under the administration of Mr Carlos Salinas, the former president, the Pacto became the cornerstone of economic decision-making, with every change in economic policy - wage and price increases, changes in exchange rate policy, government economic projections  -announced as part of a revised Pacto. It was Mexico's corporate political system working at its finest, with new Pactos announced, on the average, every nine months. Mexico is different now, both politically and economically. The Pactos under Mr Salinas brought inflation down using a tightly controlled exchange rate policy as its main hinge. That basic component is no longer an option. With a floating exchange rate, controlling inflation is largely going to be a function of lowering aggregate demand via a suppression of wages. If wages rise too rapidly, the boost to competitiveness that should come from a devaluation will be lost. 'More important than prices, the government is going to have to find a way to hold the line on wages,' says Mr Felix Boni, director of economic research at Interacciones, a Mexican brokerage house. 'It is going to have to be a throwback to the old corporatist days.' But at a time when Mexico's corporatist structure is under threat from continued political instability, controlling the unions may prove difficult. Getting the leaders to sign should not be much of a problem - they are used to being told what to do. But the fact that real wages only began to recover in Mexico in 1993 after a 10-year fall may mean that keeping the unions' rank-and-file from getting restless will be much tougher than in the past. Mr Santiago Onate, labour secretary, said wages would rise no higher than the 7 per cent already granted for 1995. But other officials said a larger figure than this might have to be conceded. Mexico's government and Maya Indian guerrillas appear headed for fresh talks aimed at ending the year-old peasant rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas, Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. Although there has been no direct contact between Zapatista chiefs and the President Zedillo's government, both sides have made concessions aimed at clearing the way for a new round of peace negotiations.</p>

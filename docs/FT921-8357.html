			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (3): A morale booster - Wearside MAKE IT WEARSIDE, urge the slogans emblazoned on hundreds of commercial vehicles owned by Sunderland borough council and local private companies. Make it Wearside, entreat the advertisements designed to promote the borough as 'the advanced manufacturing centre of the North'. Sunderland, one of Britain's largest towns, has long felt aggrieved at playing second fiddle - in outsiders' eyes, at least - to Newcastle. Wearsiders, known locally as Makems, do not take kindly to being mistaken for Geordies. Winning Nissan's investment and watching it flourish and attract component suppliers has been a big morale booster for those local people who feel they or their children have a chance of working for the new automotive employers. Others, meanwhile, have cheered themselves a little with the spectacle of Newcastle United trailing behind their Roker rivals on the football pitch. But the real boost for Sunderland now would be to see significant job creation on the riverside sites which once provided the thousands of shipbuilding, coal mining and heavy engineering jobs on which the town so heavily relied. These traditional industries bore the brunt of Wearside's job cuts in the 1980s. Within a decade, their workforce was cut by a half, the town lost its last shipyards - ending a 600-year-old industry - and the total number of employees in work dropped by 5,300 to 90,800, a fall due almost entirely to a reduction in male employment. Even so, when the government decided in 1988 to close the last shipyards with the loss of 2,400 jobs, some members of the local business community, which includes substantial employers such as Nissan, Rolls Royce, Vaux and Grove-Coles, not surprisingly took exception to the 'dead town' image portrayed in sections of the media. But outcry over the shipyards' closure helped secure a 150 acre enterprise zone as part of the goverment's Pounds 45m 'rescue package'. It also triggered the creation of The Wearside Opportunity (TWO), a local private sector initiative, in partnership with the local authority and development agencies, to regenerate the borough's economy and pep up its morale by building on its manufacturing traditions with new, forward-looking industry. In fighting for inward investment, Sunderland now has a number of advantages. They include Nissan's proximity and the enterprise zone, in force until the year 2,000. Zone status is the factor which squares the circle, making speculative building financially attractive, says Mr Norman Bachelor, a director of Washington Developments, a London and Edinburgh Trust subsidiary. In Tyne and Wear generally, rental levels are still a deterrent to private sector developers, he says. His company is now developing the first 57,000 sq ft phase of 500,000 sq ft of business space on the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation's Hylton Riverside site. Nearby in the zone, beside car dealer Reg Vardy's new showroom, the flagship for the new Nissan Motor GB distribution network, Scottish Provident have just developed eight high specification industrial-warehouse units, called Sunrise Enterprise Park. At the third section of the zone, Doxford Business Park, Akeler Developments Plc are about to start work on the first phase of more than one million square feet of space, plus a hotel. Eleven English Estates units, in three eye-catching pavilions, were the first new units in the zone; seven have so far been let at around Pounds 7 per sq ft. The zone's prime purpose is to attract companies new to the area. But relocations from nearby are being welcomed too provided they increase their workforce. Another important element in the campaign to foster advanced manufacturing is Sunderland Polytechnic. Led by Dr Anne Wright, the only female polytechnic rector outside London, it has developed a number of facilities for industry. These range from its electromagnetic compatibility testing tank, for businesses trying to attain new European standards, to its advanced manufacturing systems centre, which advises on integration of computers and robotics into manufacturing processes. The 1989 census of employment showed 25.2 per cent of Wearside's employees then worked in manufacturing, 2 per cent above the national average. Despite the emphasis placed by TWO and its partners on training and flexibility, many of those who have lost their jobs in recent years are worried there is no place for them in 'high-tech' industry. Low aspiration, says one senior local figure, is Wearsiders' biggest problem. However, there is general recognition that high-tech manufacturing is only one aspect of Wearside's future. And for many local people, recent arrivals such as Press Offshore, which has moved onto the former South Docks site, and Christmas decorations manufacturer Ti-Well, a relocation from Bedfordshire to a former shipyard workshop where ships funnels were once made, seem more immediately relevant to their employment needs. Nissan's presence has drawn in some significant new employers such as switch and engine valve makers TRW, and Sommer Allibert, who make dashboards. In the year to April 1991, the Commission for the New Towns saw a 150 per cent increase over any previous year in its industrial development land sales in Washington, thanks partly to incoming Nissan suppliers. Delighted though it is at Nissan's success, the borough council does not overstate its importance; it does not want outsiders to imagine Nissan dominates the entire local labour market. As Janet Snaith, the council's employment manager, says: 'We still have 17,000 unemployed and a long way to go.'</p>

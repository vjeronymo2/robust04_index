			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Time to shine as an individual - The 'unbundling' of the electricity shares OVER THE next two weeks, Pounds 1.4bn worth of shares in the 12 regional electricity companies will be under review as institutional investors consider how best to 'unbundle' their package of shares, which ceases to trade on the Stock Exchange on September 4. The move will mark a shake-up in the market for electricity shares as the institutions, which up to now have not had to focus on individual performances to a great degree, are forced to consider the fundamentals of the different Recs and decide which stocks they wish to be in. The package was the government's method of allowing institutions to invest in the electricity flotation in December 1990, through holding just one stock, while also giving the sector an initial boost of liquidity. Only retail investors were allowed to buy individual Rec shares at the flotation. Each package consists of 1,000 shares, drawn from the 12 Recs and weighted in terms of each of the companies' market capitalisation on the day of flotation. Institutions liked the package - 44 per cent of shares were apportioned this way - because it gave them a spread of investments in an homogenous industry where detailed financial information was limited and while holding just one unit. Unbundling of the package had gathered pace over the last 6 months as the deadline has approached and fund managers have begun to gather more information about individual Recs. However, with over 16 per cent of Rec shares still contained in package form, the next fortnight will see active trading in the sector. Institutions have two alternatives. The first, and most popular, is to sell the packages to brokers operating a buy-back scheme. They then break up the package and sell the institutions an equivalent value of shares in individual Recs. This has the commercial advantage that the investor will receive a slightly better price from selling the package as a whole than from selling the shares of the individual Recs separately. The other route for package holders is that after the September 4 cut-off date, the certificate ceases to trade and 11 days later becomes worthless. The registrar will then forward individual certificates for the 12 companies' shares to the holder. Few institutions are likely to follow this route, simply because their funds are based on monitoring a limited number of investments. The performance of individual Rec shares against the package price over the last 6 months gives some indication of which companies the institutions are favouring. Norweb appears to have benefited most from the package unbundling. This appears to have not so much to do with the financial performances of the company than the perceived positive view among institutions over its management and strategy. Partly because of the institutional interest, the company has the lowest historic yield - 5.4 per cent against the package's 5.8 per cent - among the Recs. 'The amount of attention paid to financial detail by fund managers is surprisingly small,' says Mr Chris Rowland at BZW. 'So other issues, like management style and strategy, are becoming important.' For the same reasons, unbundling has not favoured Manweb, Eastern and London, where worries about diversification into generation and retailing among others have made fund managers nervous. However, different companies are attracting different types of funds. For example, unit trust funds wanting short-term income are migrating towards high yielding stocks such as Northern and East Midland. Other fund managers are worried about liquidity and will only consider the more liquid, ie larger stocks, such as Eastern, London and Yorkshire. Mr Rowland believes that the biggest single investment issue facing fund managers is how individual companies will fare from the 1994 regulatory review which will be the first of significance since privatisation. It will set new values for 'x', which is an important component of the Recs' pricing structures. 'Companies with a high rate of return could be penalised with a tighter x factor. It will also mean that they will need high dividend cover.' He is advising clients to look at companies with lower returns and good cover such as London, Seeboard and South West. However, Mr Tim Anker at Smith New Court rates Southern, Midland and Norweb, arguing that the quality of management together with their positions in relation to regulation mark them out as potential outperformers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's opposition Liberal Party has opted for a  younger image, installing the up-and-coming treasury spokesman,  Alexander Downer, to lead the party. Australian affairs  correspondent Linda Mottram reports Liberal Party MP's in  Canberra today voted to oust Dr. John Hewson from the leadership  by 43 votes to 36:    [Begin Mottram recording] The result finally ends the  troubled leadership of John Hewson, installing instead the  42-year-old former Oxford scholar Alexander Downer, a third  generation politician and the first ever leader of the Liberal  Party to come from the state of South Australia. Accepting the  so-called youth ticket, Liberal MP's also voted for a change of  deputy leader, replacing Dr. Michael Wooldridge with the  45-year-old finance spokesman, Peter Costello.    Liberal leader Downer has promised a broad policy statement  in the near future, and he wants to trim the size of Dr.  Hewson's bloated shadow ministry. Mr. Downer had been touting  his leadership as a chance for a fresh start for a party out of  government for more than a decade.    John Hewson's future in politics remains to be clarified.

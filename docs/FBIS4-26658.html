			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China is striving to  capture a foothold in the high-tech domain of high-definition  (HD) TV sets.    Ye Peida, head of the country's HD TV research team, said,  "otherwise, China will lose a tremendous TV market and a golden  opportunity to bolster its overall national strength with new  technology."    Ye is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  (CAS).    Chinese and foreign experts have predicted that a global  market worth several billion U.S. dollars for HD TV sets and  related products will take shape by the end of this century.    They expect a Chinese market of some 800,000 sets valued at  2.4 billion U.S. dollars a year by that time.    Ye said that China has mapped out its strategic development  goal for HD TVs, which stipulates that by around the year 2000  it will have set up an experimental telecasting station able to  make some programs. By then China will also have grasped the  technology necessary for HD TV systems and be able to develop  and produce, although in small numbers, HD TV receivers.    To achieve that goal, Ye said, China has drawn up detailed  plans for two development stages: From now to 1996 China will  pool efforts to tackle key technical problems and set up an  experimental system for HD TV models. The following five years  will see China go all out to develop HD TVs in an all-round way.    He said that China is in a favorable position to develop HD  TVs, as a digital telecommunications network characterized by  optic cables, satellites and microwaves has been formed  nationwide.    According to him, the ministry of the electronics industry  has established an HD TV research center, which conducts  research on HD TV model receivers and satellite digital-data  receiving systems in co-operation with the country's  eight-largest TV enterprises, including the Changhong, Peony and  Panda TV plants.    The study of HD TVs has undergone great changes since Japan  developed the world's first HD TV system in the 1970s. In 1991  the United States surprised the world with an all-digital HD TV  system.    Experts predict that hd tvs will become widespread by the  year 2005.    He Zuoxiu, a leading CAS physicist, said that the  development  of picture tubes and the manufacturing of macro-integrated  circuits are the biggest difficulties in developing HD TV  systems.    "Once the technical problems are solved, HD TVs will have an  immeasurable impact on a wide range of sectors, particularly on  national defense, telecommunications, scientific research,  medical science and the electronic printing industry," he noted.</p>

The area of land whose ownership was transferred from  agricultural collectives to households or individuals accounted  for only close to 14 per cent of the plan.    The transfer of land ownership (mainly land for agricultural  production) was carried [out] in more than 1,330,000 communes in  the 47 cities and provinces in accordance with the government's  new land law aimed at encouraging agricultural production.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'TRUE SOLDIER OF RUSSIAN ART' PICKS UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF;  </P> <P> MUSIC: ROSTROPOVICH LEADS THE NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN THE 'PATHETIQUE,'  THE LAST SYMPHONY HE CONDUCTED BEFORE HIS EXILE. THE MESSAGE: THAT HE HAD KEPT  THE FAITH OVER 16 YEARS AWAY FROM HOME.  </P> <P> The last symphony that Mstislav Rostropovich conducted in Moscow before leaving  on what turned into 16 years of exile was Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the  "Pathetique." On Tuesday, the "Pathetique" was the first symphony he conducted  at the start of the National Symphony Orchestra's appearances in Moscow and  Leningrad.  </P> <P> The symmetry was Rostropovich's way of saying that he had kept faith, cultural  as well as political, during those long years abroad and that he was anxious to  pick up, as best he could, where he had left off.  </P> <P> "These past 16 years that we were in the West . . . we have been true soldiers  of our Russian art, Russian music," he said on his return this week. "We have  familiarized a lot of people with the Russian orchestral repertoire and Russian  operas."  </P> <P> The welcome that Rostropovich, the music director of the National Symphony  Orchestra in Washington since 1977, received Tuesday evening at the Great Hall  of the Moscow Conservatory -- the same place where he had last conducted in  Moscow -- was enthusiastic and emotional.  </P> <P> Shouts of "Bravo, Slava, bravo!" erupted as the last notes of the "Pathetique"  died. "Well done!" one of Rostropovich's old colleagues at the Conservatory  called out. The rhythmic applause brought Rostropovich back for five bows.  </P> <P> "He is one of our greatest musicians, and we were deprived of him for these  many years," the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko said. "The joy of our people at  Slava's return can barely be explained and probably not understood by a  foreigner. He is Russian, and he is ours. He makes us proud.  </P> <P> "Understand, he took a stand for artistic integrity and for the basic truths of  life, and he did not compromise. His return tells us that a new era has begun,  and it will be a time of a great cultural renaissance as well as of political  and economic reforms -- a national rebirth."  </P> <P> The performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 brought a 12-minute  standing ovation and forced Rostropovich into a series of encores for an  audience that wanted more and more.  </P> <P> But tears were flowing in the audience of government ministers, members of  parliament and leading figures in Soviet culture even as Rostropovich took the  podium amid cheers of "Slava, Slava, Slava."  </P> <P> "So many years in the West but so Russian, so very Russian," the music  commentator Svyatoslav Belza remarked. "The mannerisms, the attitudes, the  tolerance of chaos, the desire for the spiritual -- the whole feel is Russian.  That's why people love him so much. . . ."  </P> <P> The hall was packed well beyond its capacity of 2,000. There were chairs in the  aisles, people standing at the back and the stairwells were filled. Outside,  hundreds stood in the snow behind police barricades, vainly hoping for a spare  ticket.  </P> <P> Among those in the audience was Raisa Gorbachev, wife of President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, who was accompanied by Queen Sophia of Spain. The French minister of  culture, Jack Lang, had also flown in for the performance.  </P> <P> Even the orchestra's two-hour morning rehearsal was filled with students and  professors from the Conservatory and other music lovers, who were rewarded with  Rostropovich's playing of Dvorak's Cello Concerto as well as a look at him  fine-tuning the orchestra for the evening performances.  </P> <P> Rostropovich had chosen not only the Tchaikovsky symphony but also  Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 to show how well his American orchestra has come  to play Russian music, traditional and modern. Today, it will perform Serge  Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5, another Rostropovich favorite.  </P> <P> He also brought two American works, Stephen Albert's "Rivering Waters," drawn  from his symphony "River Run," and Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, which he  wanted to introduce to Soviet audiences.  </P> <P> In addition, Rostropovich will play the Dvorak concerto in Moscow today and in  Leningrad later this week.  </P> <P> The concert Tuesday night was recorded for broadcast across the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The performances here are part of the Soviet-American cultural exchange  program, and also have extensive corporate support. The Dvorak concerto and the  "Pathetique" are being recorded live by Sony for its classical records series,  and a documentary is being made.  </P></p>

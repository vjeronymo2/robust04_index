			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Winners and losers from Berlusconi partnership: Northern League Northern League leaders put a brave face yesterday on evidence that more moderate supporters had deserted to their ally, Forza Italia, insisting they would not abandon their federalist principles, writes John Simkins in Milan. Although Mr Umberto Bossi's League approximately doubled its tally of senators and lower house deputies from the 79 elected in 1992, its success in the first-past-the-post seats owes much to Forza Italia support. Their pact favoured the League in the division of seats, allowing it, as the more established party, to nominate 70 per cent of candidates. Respective support showed itself in the 25 per cent of lower house seats reserved for proportional representation, where parties stood under their individual banners. In these the League took 11 seats compared with Forza Italia's 16 in northern seats. Mr Massimo Scaglione, one of 12 League senators elected in Piedmont compared with one for Forza Italia, said he was 'very satisfied' with his party's performance. He backed Mr Bossi in his campaign attacks on Forza Italia which, according to the League leader, emerged out of the old political system that the League was trying to dismantle. 'It is much better to speak as he does. Bread is bread and wine is wine and this is the frank style of the League,' he said. However, Mr Marco Formentini, the League mayor of Milan, accepted that the 'soft' face of Forza Italia had attracted League moderates. 'The League has a rigorous programme which it is difficult to accept because it means changing the state and switching from a central system to a federal one,' he said. Forza Italia would accept change was necessary once it had to confront the country's problems in government.</p>

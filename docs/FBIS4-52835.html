			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] decided on 11 May to abolish the "three export-related  laws," including the Export Inspection Law, which were enacted  during Japan's period of rapid economic growth to promote  exports.    Japanese products have already attained a high quality  level,  and Japan is now being asked to expand imports because of its  huge trade surplus. The three laws are thought to have outlived  their usefulness. This measure is also considered part of the  government's deregulation efforts.    Of the three laws, the Export Inspection Law and Export  Products Design Law will be abrogated in 1997, while the law on  standardized labeling for export products of small businesses is  expected to be abolished before the end of 1994.    The Export Inspection Law requires quality inspection for  certain products specified under the law. Products failing to  pass this inspection cannot be exported. In the 1960's, the  inspection list included as many as 500 items, although at  present, the list has been shortened to 50 commodities, such as  eyeglasses and silk products.    The Export Products Design Law is aimed at preventing  imitation of designs to promote the export of high quality  products. Only seven items, including fountain pens and  furniture, come under the jurisdiction of this law.</p>

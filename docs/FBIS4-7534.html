			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr </F> Vondra by Jiri Hrasek and Andrea Behounkova; place and date not  given: "The Regime at the Czech-German Border Is Regulated by  Treaties"]    [Text] Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra  and Dieter Kastrup, state secretary at the FRG Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, met in Prague at the beginning of last week  [22-23 March] to discuss the Czech-German border regime. We  asked Alexandr Vondra for details.    [CESKY DENIK] Deputy Minister, have there been any  agreements signed yet to regulate the local borderland traffic  [maly pohranicni styk] and the state-border problems?    [Vondra] Not so far. Both agreements were discussed at the  expert level. In the instance of the so-called large-scale  border treaty, the Czech Government already expressed its  approval of the text, and all that is left to do is to decide by  whom, where, and when the agreement will be signed. The  agreement on the local borderland traffic that deals, above all,  with the problem of tourist zones and paths crossing the common  border is almost finished, and only some technical details must  still be approved.    [CESKY DENIK] How will the joint clearance at the border be  expedited?    [Vondra] The treaty on the simplification of the border  clearance in railroad, highway, and water transport between the  Czech Republic and the FRG is almost finished. The treaty  assumes the establishment of joint clearance facilities for the  customs and passport control on either side of the border. A  gradual increase in the number of border crossings also  contributes to expediting the border clearance between the two  countries.    [CESKY DENIK] Will the regime be altered at the state border  in connection with complaints from the German side concerning  criminal activities, for instance, by Czech citizens on the  German side?    [Vondra] The regime at our common border will be defined in  detail by the aforementioned treaty regulations. The treaty on  cooperation in the struggle against organized crime, which was  signed already in 1991, deals with the eradication of crime  transgressing the border. The effectiveness of the detection  and punishment of crime is improved also, for instance, by the  possibility of direct contact between the Bavarian and the Czech  police. An intergovernment agreement on cooperation of police  bodies is also in the works.    [CESKY DENIK] Has there been any discussion regarding the  use of names of communities in two languages?    [Vondra] After the latest talks with Dieter Kastrup, state  secretary at the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it seems that  a solution to this controversial problem was found that is  acceptable to both sides. I expect that, following the  appropriate internal talks on both sides, the problem of using  local names in joint documents will be definitively solved. At  this time, I do not wish to discuss the details of the solution.</p>

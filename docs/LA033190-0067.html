			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGUA COMING TO TERMS WITH PAST, FUTURE;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: AN EARTHQUAKE AND AN INSURRECTION FORCED CHANGES ON THE CAPITAL.  </P> <P> Ask anyone in Managua for directions to "the little tree" and they will point  confidently to a downtown intersection with a service station, Roco's Bar and  the ruins of a two-story house, but no tree.  </P> <P> Never mind that the tree has been gone for 17 years, that when city workers dug  it up to pave the streets after the earthquake it was no longer a little tree  but a great big tree, an Indian laurel.  </P> <P> "It's a point of reference," said Rene Cano, 66, who has run the service  station for 30 years. "For everyone, this corner is the little tree."  </P> <P> The invisible tree is the key to many Managua addresses, including Cano's --  "five blocks down from the little tree and one block to the lake." But Cano  cannot fathom a stranger's interest in the tree and, furthermore, he considers  it one more example of how little foreigners understand his country.  </P> <P> Another example, he says, is the fact that multitudes of observers on hand for  last month's presidential election failed to foresee the sweeping opposition  victory.  </P> <P> "You have to know the idiosyncrasies of the Nicaraguan people," Cano said.  </P> <P> Right. Except that this is like trying to understand Managua, which is hurtling  through change at lightning speed while holding onto its past by means of  landmarks that ceased to exist long ago.  </P> <P> The earthquake of Dec. 22, 1972, leveled Managua. Seven years later, the  Sandinista guerrillas led a popular insurrection that brought down the  dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, and this was followed by the Contra civil  war.  </P> <P> After a decade of revolution and civil war, Nicaraguans booted the Sandinistas  out of office in an election that was one of the Sandinistas' greatest  achievements -- the first free and competitive election in the country's  history.  </P> <P> All those changes notwithstanding, younger generations still refer to Cano's  corner as "where the tree used to be." They say it's down the street from Las  Delicias del Volga, a cantina that is also gone.  </P> <P> For 10 years, the Sandinistas' battle cry was "Free Fatherland or Death," and  that is what they taught in Managua schools. Sandinista Youth spent their  summers in the countryside picking coffee and teaching adults to read.  </P> <P> Now, under the new government of the National Opposition Union (UNO), children  are to learn that free enterprise is the law of the land.  </P> <P> "The law of supply and demand is like the law of gravity," UNO leader Carlos  Hurtado said in the flush of victory. "It is inexorable."  </P> <P> But even gravity is sometimes different in Managua, where the four points of  the compass are "up, down, to the lake and to the mountains." On any given  block, up may be downhill, and the lake may be nowhere in sight.  </P> <P> How is an outsider to understand this?  </P> <P> Easy, says Maria Elena Castro, a resident of the neighborhood known as July  19th: "Down is where the sun sets, and up is where it rises."  </P> <P> After their triumph, the Sandinistas renamed many of Managua's streets and  neighborhoods to honor the heroes, martyrs and battles of their uprising. July  19th, for example, is the day they celebrate their rise to power. Under the  Somozas, the July 19th neighborhood was called "The Redeemer."  </P> <P> Those who oppose the Sandinistas have steadfastly refused to accept the new  names, so that many places have two names. Castro calls the square in front of  the crumbling Metropolitan Cathedral the Plaza of the Revolution, but her  anti-Sandinista husband calls it the Plaza of the Republic.  </P> <P> They both know what they are talking about. And by means of these labels, any  Nicaraguan can identify which side of the political landscape they occupy.  </P> <P> Castro wonders whether the new government will try to erase the Sandinista  names.  </P> <P> "I think they should stay the same," she said, "because this was a historic  process. These people spilled their blood, and that cannot be in vain."  </P> <P> Her husband said, "I think they should go back to the way it was before the  revolution."  </P> <P> Before the revolution, Managua had the Anastasio Somoza Garcia National  Baseball Stadium, named for Somoza's father. The Sandinistas renamed the  stadium after Rigoberto Lopez Perez, a tailor and poet who assassinated Somoza  Garcia and was killed in the process.  </P> <P> Names, according to the opposition's premier poet, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, are  not all that important, but monuments are. The government of President-elect  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro plans to build two monuments, Cuadra said, one to  Gen. Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought off a U.S. Marine occupation of  Nicaragua in the 1920s and 1930s, and another to poet Ruben Dario. They are  Nicaragua's political and cultural heroes.  </P> <P> Although they take their name from Sandino, the Sandinistas never put up a  statue of him, Cuadra noted. Instead, they erected a towering statue of a  muscular worker raising an AK-47 rifle overhead. The opposition refers to it  disparagingly as "the hulk." Even Sandinistas privately malign the oeuvre that  they feel obliged to defend in public.  </P> <P> "That statue should remain as a monument to July 19th," Cuadra said. "The less  a civilization tears down its statues, the more it advances. If people always  took down their monuments, you'd never have a Paris or a Salamanca."  </P> <P> Cuadra does not pretend to compare Managua to Paris, calling Managua "the  ugliest city in the world . . . a volcano with a black hole in the middle."  </P> <P> Definitely, the city is diffuse, divided by blocks of overgrown lots and the  rubble of buildings that crumbled in the earthquake. Every lamppost and wall is  a chaos of political graffiti and campaign banners. Thin palm trees bend and  whip in the wind.  </P> <P> The new government, Cuadra says, must call an urgent meeting of builders, urban  planners and seismologists to construct a post-earthquake, post-revolutionary  Managua.  </P> <P> "You cannot govern from a disperse city that is without syntax," he said, with  distaste. "You end up with disperse, dehumanizing politics. It leads to mental  disorganization."  </P> <P> Indeed, there is a maddening quality to Managua. Streets that are paved are  potholed; the rest are dirt. Water is scarce and electric power is erratic, as  is the telephone system. But the inconveniences are tempered by the character  of the Nicaraguans.  </P> <P> Most Managuans are poor. Men push carts, and horses pull them. As in any Latin  American city, a gaggle of little boys surrounds any car stopped at a traffic  light. They reach in with long and grubby arms, not to steal a purse but for  the thrill of sounding the horn.  </P> <P> In neighborhood after neighborhood, Managuans gather at the end of the day in  the living rooms and on the front porches of their one-story houses. In  high-back rockers called "little grandmothers" they debate television soap  operas and national politics with equal fervor.  </P> <P> Nicaraguans do not always tell outsiders exactly what they think -- as in whom  they think they will vote for. But the language they use can serve as a guide  to their politics.  </P> <P> Sandinistas frequently use the word companero -- companion -- an affectionate  term for anyone from a lover to an army buddy to a waiter in a restaurant.  </P> <P> The opposition, on the other hand, is enamored of the word fanatic, by which  they mean Sandinista, and for which they have created a verb, to fanaticize,  which is what they insist the Sandinistas have done to Nicaragua's youth.  </P> <P> Sandinistas call the opposition burgueses -- bourgeoisie. They prefer army  fatigues and tropical guayabera shirts, but Chamorro's American-educated  preppie crowd is expected to bring back the suit and tie. Already, upper-class  women are chattering about the floor-length dresses they will wear to the  inauguration.  </P> <P> Few Nicaraguans are willing to predict what other changes the new government  will bring. Businessman Pablo Vijil hopes to lure a pizza chain to Managua. The  elimination of a U.S. trade embargo lifts an economic cloud from Managua, but  Vijil is not expecting a flood of new investment.  </P> <P> "Expectations will not necessarily coincide with reality," he said. "There are  many unknowns."  </P></p>

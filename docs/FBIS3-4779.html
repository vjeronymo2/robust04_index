			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Ramos during the Symposium on </F> Philippines' Accession to Intellectual Property Rights  Protection and the First Anniversary Celebration of the  Presidential Inter-Agency Committee on Intellectual Property  Rights at Malacanang Palace in Manila on 28 February; monitored  in progress -- recorded]    [Excerpts] A year ago we established the Inter-Agency  Committee on Intellectual Property Rights [IACIPR] under  Executive Order No. 60, which is your Bible, and this is our  instrument for improving and enforcing existing laws for the  protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. We did this  to strengthen collaboration among various government agencies  and the private sector [words indistinct] infringements, piracy,  and counterfeiting, and since then, the 13 government agencies  and the two NGO's [nongovernment organization] who compose the  IACIPR, had mounted a concerted and aggressive effort in  pursuing the committee's mandate and functions. [passage  omitted]    From the perspective of local investors, authors, trademark  owners, and producers, IPR protection is indispensable for the  development of domestic industries that do more than copy  foreign models, but show the creativity and the ingenuity of the  Filipino. Provided with adequate protection and incentives, the  Filipino inventor can develop the critical technology needed for  the rapid development of our industrial and agricultural  sectors. [passage omitted]    Under the 1992 Inventor and Invention Incentives Act, R.A.  [Republic Act] 7459, inventors enjoy income tax exemptions for  the first 10 years from the date of the first sale of the  invention and they are exempted from business license fees,  among others. Through your IACIPR, you will strengthen the  protection of their inventions against piracy and counterfeiting  so that they will earn rightful profits for their inventions and  recover their investment.    We plan to do the same thing for our artists, writers,  performers, composers, and musicians whose talents have not only  enriched our lives but have gained worldwide recognition for the  Philippines as well. That, this administration has given  priority to the development of culture and the arts. [sentence  as heard] We have adopted the national development plan for  culture and the arts to promote a renaissance in Filipino  culture.    Institutions critical to the plan are now in place, part of  which is the national endowment fund for cultural and artistic  programs. The government is also taking steps to develop the  local movie, television, and music industries into export  industries, and we hope to turn Metro Manila and Subic and many  other places later on into the Hollywood of the Philippines and  of the Asia-Pacific region.    To promote cultural renewal it is important that the  intellectual creations of Filipino artists and musicians be  recognized and protected. In the state of our composers, for  example, we should give value to their intellectual creations  and their works by paying them adequate royalties every time  their music is performed for profit and it is only just and fair  that all establishments using their musical compositions should  start thinking about paying the royalties due our composers and  musicians. [applause]    I am pleased to announce that upon my instructions the  Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has submitted a study on  how to effectively enforce nationwide the music copyrights of  composers and authors.    From the perspective of foreign investments, especially  those  that hasten the phase of technology transfer, our interest is to  build up the confidence of investors in the country's capability  to protect their intellectual property rights the minute they  bring their own technology and products into the Philippines.  We must also contend with international development that  impacts on foreign trade and investments. For example, major  markets for our export products such as garments, furniture, and  sugar, require that we protect their IPR or otherwise face trade  sanctions. This can adversely affect the achievements of our  export and investment targets. IPR, therefore, is clearly  indispensable if we are to achieve the goals of Philippines 2000.    Towards making the Philippine business environment more  attractive and competitive in the race to attract foreign  investments, the Philippine Government remains committed to  evaluating its present flaws of IPR in consonance with our  multilateral and bilateral commitments. As you well know, last  15 February 1993 [year as heard], the Philippines, together with  117 other countries accepted the conclusions of the Uruguay  Round [UR] of the multilateral trade negotiations under the  auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, or GATT,  because it will bring about substantive benefits to our economy.  The recently concluded UR negotiations have further  strengthened the multilateral trading system by bringing in  agriculture and services into the GATT, achieving lower tariffs,  removing nontariff barriers, improving GATT rules and  discipline, including dispute settlement and ensuring a more  adequate protection of IPR's.    In the area of IPR's, the benefits we can derive from the  UR are the greatly reduced risk of unilateral trade action such  as the Section 301 actions of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Law and  strengthen dispute settlement procedures. But availing  ourselves of this benefit is not without cost. In the area of  IPR we have to accede to tighter rules for protection and accept  the possibility of cross-retaliation which means that continued  violation of commitments in the services of IPR areas, for  example, can bring about a retaliation in the goods area if  authorized by the new world trade organization.    The UR provisions of the trade [-related] aspects of  intellectual property or TRIP's have set terms and standards on  IPR that all the members of the GATT will have to adopt in their  respective laws. Most of these norms and standards, however,  are already found in Philippine laws. In Asia, we have one of  the most comprehensive legal systems dealing with intellectual  property. As early as 1947, the Philippines legislated a patent  of trademark system based on American law. In 1972, P.D.  [Presidential Decree] 49, a decree on intellectual property was  issued containing almost all the modern principles of  copyrights, including the grant of copyrights to computer  software. Likewise, the rights of performers, recording  companies, and broadcasting companies known as property rights,  were recognized and protected. But unlike other developing  countries, especially in Asia, our acceptance of the TRIP's  agreement does not involve a basic change in our existing  intellectual property protection system. It would merely  introduce changes to update our laws in line with the rapidly  modernizing world.    In considering the many benefits and advantages the  Philippines would gain in accepting the UR agreement, I am  clearly in favor of Philippine accession to the substantive  provisions of the 1971 Berne Convention. Early today, I signed  our country's instrument of accession, thereto, an endorsement  letter to the Senate requesting it to ratify the same as soon as  possible. [applause] I would like to assure you that we will  also take decisive action to amend our laws to adopt to TRIP's  standards. These bills are now being rushed and the DTI will  ensure their filing with Congress shortly.    While intellectual property rights laws in the Philippines  are comprehensive enough, much more is to be done to improve  their enforcement and we would like to thank Stanford Research  Institute or SRI International for undertaking an in-depth study  on the problems of the adjudication process of IPR cases. I  have taken note of and I am very much alarmed by the serious  delays and inefficiencies which the existing adjudication  procedures inflict on IPR holders whenever they seek redress for  their grievances. I assure you that we will give serious  considerations to measures that you have proposed to clear the  procedural bottlenecks that you have identified.    We now see a convergence between government plans and those  of SRI in certain proposed measures to solve the problems in the  adjudication process. We have already considered the need to  set up special courts to hear exclusively IPR cases. I do not  have any objection to this proposal. In fact, I would like to  take this opportunity to direct your IACIPR Chairman Secretary  Navarro to coordinate with the executive secretary, Teofisto  Guingona, of the referral of this proposal to Chief Justice  Andres Narvasa of the Supreme Court. We will request him to act  on this favorably. Please take note also that the  administration-sponsored measure revising the jurisdiction of  the courts was approved last week by the Senate-House bicameral  conference committee.    The threshold of the amounts involved for the regional trial  court, or RTC, to acquire jurisdiction with respect to civil  actions involving real property, maritime, [word indistinct]  cases, and etcetera has been increased substantially. This will  unload the dockets of the RTC's and enable then to dispose of  their backlog expeditiously.    We also hope to raise the penalties of infringement of IPR  and simplify the procedures for the prosecution of IPR violators  through legislation. Finally, allow me to commend the IACIPR  for its impressive performance during its first year of  operations in battling piracy and counterfeiting [applause]  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Croatia presses on with bridge plan CROATIA yesterday pressed ahead with plans to rebuild a strategic bridge to link the main coastal motorway with central Croatia, and the nearby Zemunik airport. Serb forces from the self-styled state of Krajina, which cuts Croatia in half, warned they would bombard the bridge and yesterday they resumed bombardments of Karlovac, a garrison town 30 miles southwest of Zagreb. It was the first attack on Karlovac since the 1991 war in Croatia and raised fears that the Serbo-Croat war could re-ignite. Mr Cedric Thornberry, the deputy chief of the UN mission in former Yugoslavia, repeated warnings of renewed violence in Croatia. 'Both sides are completely ready for an extremely bloody and destructive war,' he told UN radio. Ignoring warnings from the UN and the Serbs, Croat authorities have decided to re-build the Maslenica bridge, joining central Croatia with the southern Dalmatian coast. Serb rebels have constantly delayed the reopening of the only overland route to southern Dalmatia which is not under Serbian control. Three out of five barges set sail from Trogir, the Croatian port city, carrying materials for the 279-metre pontoon bridge planned to replace the destroyed bridge, reported Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency. Mr Dusan Starcevic, a Krajina official, yesterday lambasted Zagreb authorities for their 'unilateral' action, dismissing it as the 'continuation of Croatian aggression since January 22.' Fighting continued in Mostar, the southwestern city on the River Neretva, where Moslem and Croat forces fought hand-to-hand battles. Croatian radio said the Moslem-led Bosnian army had launched an all-out attack on Mostar. Bosnian radio also reported heavy clashes and said the Croatian army (HV) and its Bosnian sister Croatian Defence Units (HVO) had launched a joint attack on the town. Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in Sarajevo, confirmed the Moslem-Croat clashes in Mostar. UN peacekeepers earlier this month withdrew from Mostar after warnings from local HVO commanders. Cmdr Frewer yesterday confirmed Moslem allegations that regular Croatian army units were crossing into Bosnia to support the HVO. Croatia has repeatedly denied that its army has been despatched to Bosnia. 'We have seen signs of HV members supporting the HVO. I have no numbers and I cannot confirm whether the Croatians are advisers or combat troops,' he told reporters in Sarajevo.</p>

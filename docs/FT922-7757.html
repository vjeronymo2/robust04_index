			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent sees weakness in property, banks CONTINENTAL reaction to the O &amp; Y crisis was more specific than general, with weakness in property and financial shares, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell 1.1 per cent at the start, following losses in Tokyo and overnight on Wall Street, but ended higher thanks to a rebound in stocks which had fallen on Thursday. The CAC-40 fell as low as 1,995.22 in the morning before ending 6.95 higher at 2,023.95, down 1.9 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.5bn. News that O &amp; Y was seeking court protection from its creditors put pressure on Credit Lyonnais, which has the biggest exposure of the French banks. The stock dropped FFr23 to FFr602. Elf, which had dropped on its poor first results on Thursday, steadied yesterday, losing 90 centimes to FFr378.3, while LVMH, which had lost 5.5 per cent on news of a sell note from a US broker on Thursday, rebounded FFr69 to FFr4,099. Total dropped FFr6 to FFr260. After the close, the government said it was offering four Total oil certificates for three shares, reducing its stake in the oil refiner to 15 per cent from 34 per cent. FRANKFURT was helped down by overnight weakness in the US and Japan, but a worsening trend over the course of the morning was reflected in a 3.88 fall to 700.17 for the FAZ index at midsession extending to one of 18.19 to 1,724.07 for the FAZ at the close. Similarly, falls on the week were 0.9 and 1.4 per cent respectively. Cars and engineers were hit by worries over the possible metalworkers' strike and the banking sector by concern over loans to O &amp; Y. Lufthansa extended Thursday's DM3.20 fall on a passed 1991 dividend - and the prospect of similar treatment for shareholders in 1992 - with a drop of DM9.50 to DM138. Asko, the retailer, rose DM6 to DM826 after the news that Dr Helmut Wagner, designer of its somewhat erratic corporate strategy, had resigned as chairman of the supervisory board. MILAN continued to fall on the final day of the May trading account. The Comit index fell 4.78 to 472.72, a new low for the year and down 4.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at L115bn after Thursday's L102bn. Fiat lost more than 2 per cent in anticipation of a sharp drop in 1991 group net profit and a cut in the dividend, due later in the day. The stock fell L131 to L4,810 but recovered to L4,845 after hours. In the afternoon, it was quoted around L4,900-L4,980 on London's Seaq after publication of the results, which were in line with expectations. Olivetti added L2 to L2,900 on renewed speculation in an Italian daily that it was in alliance talks with Digital of the US. Mediobanca rose L70 to L12,460 on short-covering. ZURICH saw profit-taking in some industrials and O &amp; Y-linked selling of banks as the SMI fell 23.7 to 1,921, 1 per cent lower on the week. Volume was estimated at a moderate SFr800m. CS Holding bearers, SFr50 lower at SFr1,980 and SBC bearers by SFr6 to SFr276. Both banks are mortgage lenders to O &amp; Y. Chemicals were under pressure from profit-taking, with Roche certificates down SFr20 to SFr3,320 and Ciba-Geigy registered SFr50 lower at SFr3,590. AMSTERDAM eased, the CBS Tendency index closing 0.7 lower at 128.1 and 1.5 per cent down on the week. Rodamco, the property investment company, fell Fl 1.40 to Fl 47. Unilever fell Fl 4.70, or 2.4 per cent to FL 187.30. Brokers said that a 5.3 per cent gain in first quarter profits was below expectations. STOCKHOLM fell broadly in moderate trade, on profit-taking after the market's recent gains and reflecting weaker markets overseas. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 15.90 to 985.50, down 2.4 per cent on the week, as turnover dropped to SKr393m from SKr616m. But the building sector index fell by 3.8 per cent and the banking sector by 3.6 per cent. Volvo and Procordia were among the day's biggest losers. Volvo B dropped SKr14 to SKr429 while Procordia B fell SKr6 to SKr185. BRUSSELS was pushed down by declines on other European markets and a weak opening on Wall Street. The Bel-20 index ended down 9.04 at 1,206.08, a fall of 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr1.1bn. Petrofina fell BFr225 or 2 per cent to BFr11,225. Banque Bruxelles Lambert eased BFr15 to BFr3,435 as bid speculation evaporated. HELSINKI, as usual a law unto itself, saw the Hex index up 7.8 to 857.5 on a 1.6 per cent rise in March industrial production figures.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 15                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open      10 am    11 am   12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1170.22   1171.66  1171.76  1171.06  1170.36  1169.53  1169.58  1171.24               Day's High  1171.76    Day's Low  1168.31        May 14       May 13       May 12      May 11        May 8       1179.98      1187.91      1188.40      1191.63     1188.95**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: HK group in Dollars 54m Chicago property deal HARBOUR Centre Development, the hotel investment arm of Hong Kong's Wharf (Holdings) group, has bought the City Place hotel and office tower in Chicago from the First National Bank of Chicago for USDollars 54m (Dollars HK419m). The deal is Harbour Centre's third US hotel investment since December 1991. It has also acquired the Inn on the Park in Houston and the Marriott Hotel in Dallas for a total of Dollars HK668m. Mr Edward Cheng, Harbour Centre managing director, said: 'It is our strategy to acquire key hotels in strategic cities in a depressed market with a view to longer-term asset appreciation.' The company is estimated to have more than HKDollars 250m in net cash, following a rights issue last year, and will fund the acquisition from internal resources. Mr Cheng said the group was interested in further hotel purchases. City Place is managed by Hyatt, but the purchase is conditional on the termination of this contract. The management will then be taken over by Wharf's own Omni hotel management chain. The Wharf group has taken a gamble on the of the US hotel market since the 1988 purchase of the Omni chain from Aer Lingus for USDollars 135m. The market has been depressed and Omni's US network of 40 hotels lost money last year.</p>

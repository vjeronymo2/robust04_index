			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Accounting for the birds, bees and trees - Why economic indicators must reflect degradation of natural resources How much is the air you breathe or the forest you hike in worth? Can a monetary value be put on them, or are they priceless? As pressures for conservation of natural resources mount worldwide, planners and policy-makers are increasingly confronted with such questions. The result is that economic valuation of natural resources and environmental accounting are achieving greater prominence. Much of the theoretical groundwork has been done by scholars such as Robert Repetto of the Washington-based World Resource Institute and David Pearce of University College London. International conservation agencies, among them the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Commission on Environment and Development, have endorsed the objectives of resource valuation and environmental accounting. The economies of many developing countries are especially resource-dependent  -oil-exporting countries, for example - and thus have an interest in determining the value of their inventories, or reserves. Recently the UN Statistical Office published guidelines for environmental accounting; this is likely to help developing countries incorporate the value of resources into national accounts. Conventional accounts can give a misleading picture of a nation's output by failing to show depreciation as resources are depleted or to reflect the contamination of natural resources. Thus, the output of products such as oil are overestimated, as there will come a time when the oil runs out and income will cease. Such natural resources have neither been considered productive capital nor been subject to depreciation. Just as a lumberman loses capacity to produce timber if he cuts trees without reforesting, an economy's productive capacity diminishes with the degradation of biological resources. The World Resources Institute argues that if natural resources, like other assets, are diminishing they should be subject to depreciation. Theodore Panayotou at Harvard's Institute for International Development says that the price of commodities, such as fish and crops, often 'reflects only the opportunity cost of labour and capital used in their production, not the opportunity cost of scarce natural resources used in their production.' The implications of economic indicators that do not reflect such degradation are many. They result in a deceptive measure of economic growth. A country exporting large amounts of timber, for example, may record considerable growth, as reflected in gross domestic product. But if economic figures do not reflect a decrease in the inventory of natural resources - its forests - and a reduction of future productive capacity, such growth is overstated and unsustainable. A study of forestry schemes in Britain, sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature, found that: 'Economic analysis of forestry is, in practice, purely a financial assessment of profitability.' Misleading income measurements create the illusion that growth was created without cost to the environment, says Omar Noman, senior research economist at Oxford University. An indicator of economic growth is needed that is adjusted for environmental costs. Based on the concept of sustainable development, 'net growth' would be based on income generated by economic activities that do not reduce a country's productive capacity in an unsustainable way. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of degradation from gross domestic product. Case studies of resource degradation have shown that the market often fails to reflect the social and economic cost of environmental degradation. For example, although natural stocks of fish worldwide are dwindling, fish prices are not rising enough to inhibit consumption to a sustainable level. A number of methodologies to value natural or biological resources have been proposed. The simplest approach is to assess the market value of commercially harvested products, such as timber or medicinal plants. It calculates the value at current prices while taking into account unconventional uses such as eco-tourism. But this approach does not consider the value of products that do not pass through a market. For an Indian tribe, firewood, game meat and fish are products that are not marketed, so have no market value. Even more elusive is the attempt to assess indirect values of ecosystems. What is the worth of a forest's function in regulating the climate, as a source of water or sequestering carbon emissions? So far such valuation techniques have been applied largely to limited geographical regions or specific resources within an economy. As Repetto says: 'The idea of an all-encompassing inventory of natural assets has generally been discarded.' In Papua New Guinea, the World Bank and the UN Statistical Office conducted case studies to see how data on natural resources could be integrated into the existing system of national accounts. Environmental impacts were assessed in agriculture, forestry, mining and energy sectors. The environmentally adjusted net domestic product (EDP) was calculated in two stages. The economic depletion of natural resources was calculated; then the degradation of environmental quality and of non-marketed environmental services was assessed. Total EDP equalled 90 to 97 per cent of net domestic product. Ultimately, economic valuation of natural resources does not prevent their unsustainable use. However, it identifies and determines the cost of unsustainable economic growth. It is a further step in providing economic indicators that reflect the state of the environment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, JANUARY 6 (TURAN) -- Azerbaijani Cabinet  passed a resolution concerning "Enlistment of foreign  investments to oil industry".    The news centre of the government says that this resolution  will enable to draw the attention to the development of oil and  gas fields, to use foreign investments, labour and technical  reserves more effective.    The resolution includes also the instructions of the SOCAR  [National Petroleum Corporation of Azerbaijan]. SOCAR comes out  for speeding up the talks with foreign companies on joint  development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields and to work out  the draft of the agreement meeting the interests of Azerbaijan.    As the republic needs more natural gas, SOCAR with the  assistance of American company "Pennzoil" intends to speed up  installing of gas compression stations and building of sea  gas-pipe, to start gas transportation from "Guneshli" field  since the first quarter of 1994.    As TURAN agency was told by the sources close to the  government, the draft of the resolution has been prepared by the  President of SOCAR Natig Aliyev and was presented to the  Prime-Minster Guseynov.    Judging by the context of the resolution, a group of experts  led by Manaf Manafov does not intend to conduct talks with the  consortium of oil companies any more.    Earlier SOCAR rejected the draft of the agreement prepared  by  this group as it did not meet the interests of Azerbaijan.  There have been also some statements in press concerning the  attempt of Manafov (the citizen of Slovakia) to get bribe from  the members of the consortium in exchange for favourable  conditions in the contract.    So, a new draft of the agreement will be of more severe  character for foreign party.    The consortium of oil foreign companies was created in  summer  1993. It includes of such companies as AMOCO, BP-Statoil,  Pennzoil, Unical, Turkish Petroleum Corporation.    At first only Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oil-fields have  been  involved into the process of exploration and development with  total 1.5 billion tonnes of oil.    Autumn 1993 Guneshli oil-field was withdrawn from the  project, Russian joint stock company "Lukoil" was included in  the consortium.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Brighter prospects for Bond creditors BOND Corporation, former flagship of Australian entrepreneur Mr Alan Bond, yesterday changed its name to Southern Equities Corp, and gently raised creditors hopes. Mr Ian Ferrier, joint administrator, said he was optimistic that the company could raise sufficient funds to meet a repayment to creditors due before the end of the year, forestalling liquidation. Mr Ferrier, who has been administrator of a scheme of arrangement at the former Bond Corp. since late 1991, nearly a year after Mr Bond was forced to resign as chairman, told the annual meeting in Perth that the company's future depended on its ability to realise assets quickly. The company's main asset is a damages claim against the West Australian government over a failed petrochemical plant. Other assets include property around Perth. Meanwhile, the Federal Court in Sydney has brought down a judgment which could give the trustee of Mr Bond's superannuation fund access to the assets of the fund. It court found in favour of the fund's trustee, Mr Robert Ramsay, who had sought access to the fund, Investors Retirement Fund, on behalf of creditors. Shares in joint venture companies in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG), were heavily sold off on Australian stock exchanges yesterday after weekend news that the PNG government was seeking increased equity in the operation. The mine is owned 30 per cent each by Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields Consolidated and Highlands Gold, but PNG's prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti, has stated he intends to lift the government's equity from 10 to 30 per cent. Shares in all three Australian listed partners hit lows for the year, with Placer shares down 18 cents to ADollars 1.27, Renison off 18 cents to ADollars 2.71 and Highlands losing 16 cents to ADollars 75 cents.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Supermarket group makes accounting policy change WM MORRISON Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, yesterday announced a significant change to its accounting policies by choosing to depreciate its land assets. The company said the change was prompted by the 'interest of prudence' recognising that the alternative use value of its sites might be much less than their food retailing value. The move could increase shareholder pressure on other food retailers to follow suit, threatening a big dilution in their earnings. The share prices of all the leading food retailers were unsettled yesterday. Morrison slipped 5p to 369p, while J. Sainsbury fell 7p to 458p, Tesco shed 6p to 274p and Argyll Group, which runs Safeway, slid 6p to 351p. Mr Tony Shiret, food retailing analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'The fact that Morrison's has acknowledged the argument on alternative value will put the other food retailers under increased institutional pressure to do likewise.' He argued in a recent circular that big food retailers were significantly overvaluing property portfolios by failing to provide for such depreciation. 'In a high-inflation environment this policy was considered appropriate as inflation offset any diminution in the underlying value of the asset. We have now moved to a low inflation environment with many of the more recently acquired assets staring at uncomfortably high valuations,' he argued. Mr Shiret estimated that the effect of adopting 'prudent' depreciation policies would depress Tesco's earnings per share in the year to spring 1993 by 21 per cent. J. Sainsbury would suffer a 15 per cent reduction and Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain, an 11 per cent dilution. Asda is expected to announce a substantial write-down on its property assets when it reports its results this summer. Mr Kenneth Morrison, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the company would depreciate all land, whether in use or not, by 1 per cent a year from the beginning of the financial year. He added it would have had the effect of reducing last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.6m by about Pounds 1m.</p>

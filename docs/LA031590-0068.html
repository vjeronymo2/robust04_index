			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: XEROX RELEASES A PROGRAM WITH FINANCIAL SMARTS  </P> <P> Believe it or not, you can crunch numbers on a computer without spreadsheet  software.  </P> <P> Xerox has just released a new program, Business Wits, that performs complex  financial calculations, ranging from tax planning to revenue forecasting to  buy-lease decisions, that could take hours or days longer to program and run on  a spreadsheet.  </P> <P> Aimed at professionals in business, finance and industry, Business Wits has an  suggested introductory price of $595. Three specialized add-on applications for  advanced finance, banking and investments and advanced statistics and sampling  are also available at $150 each.  </P> <P> Many of the features we think of as part of contemporary personal computing,  such as graphics-oriented screens and using a mouse to control the cursor, grew  out of Xerox-funded research in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> Business Wits may represent another leap into the future because of its use of  artificial intelligence technology and the way users can continually expand the  capabilities of the program by combining its various pieces into new  components. It is a form of "object-oriented programming," which is a new  buzzword in computing these days.  </P> <P> What you will notice right away, however, is that Business Wits doesn't look  very futuristic. There is no fancy graphics screen, no clever icons to  symbolize its functions, no pretty typefaces and no whimsical sounds.  </P> <P> The program, which in its initial version runs only on IBM and compatible  computers using the DOS operating system, doesn't even have pull-down menus,  and what passes for on-screen, context-sensitive help wasn't enough to keep me  out of trouble.  </P> <P> Instead, what you get is a modular-constructed expert system with a very  consistent mode of operation -- meaning that formulas, reports and graphs for  figuring certain problems are already in place.  </P> <P> You start by picking a general area of interest from a list contained in the  "application bank." A number of applications come with the basic program, such  as the "service" application bank that contains a group of financial routines.  You can buy others and more are planned for future release. You can also create  your own.  </P> <P> Within each application are a number of "work sheets" dedicated to specific  tasks. The work sheets have the formulas built in. Your task is to fill in the  needed data and press "C" to calculate the results. An example is a pair of  work sheets in which you can compare the merits of buying or leasing equipment  based on the "net present value" of the money involved.  </P> <P> All of the formulas used in Business Wits are fully disclosed, at your option,  in an on-screen window, and their authorities are cited. A lengthy reference  and bibliography in the manual further documents the methods used. In addition,  all of the formulas have been verified by an accounting firm.  </P> <P> At any time while you are entering data or after running a calculation, you can  instantly display a graph of the results. The graphs are report quality and  suitable for overhead or slide projection. A graph-publishing routine allows  multiple charts to be sized and printed on the same page and provides other  customization.  </P> <P> The basic program includes several features that enhance its ease of use. One  is called "hyper programs," of which there are 118. They contain groups of  formulas to solve problems in 24 different categories from accelerated  depreciation to linear programming to microeconomics to tax planning.  </P> <P> Using a hyper program requires only that you select the one you want from the  lists displayed and then fill in the blanks that it provides.  </P> <P> Another feature is called "auto pilots," which are like macros in other  programs. They cause a series of actions to be taken by the program, often  pausing for the user to strike keys or enter data before proceeding to the next  action.  </P> <P> There are 33 of them in the basic program. One installs new application banks  automatically. Another solves for an unknown input value in a formula if you  know the output result. Still another optimizes for minimum or maximum output  given a range of input values.  </P> <P> If you want to tackle creation of your own programs, the basic building blocks  are known as functions, which are akin to functions in a spreadsheet program.  That is, they are single-purpose formulas. There are more of them than I cared  to count, doing everything from accounting to calculus to compounding to  computing probabilities.  </P> <P> Business Wits complements rather than competes with spreadsheets. In fact, you  can import data from popular spreadsheets, process it and export the result  back.  </P> <P> A spreadsheet is a good program for doing relatively simple computations on  data. But it becomes difficult and time consuming to program a spreadsheet to  make complex computations and even more difficult to keep track of what you've  done.  </P> <P> Business Wits, on the other hand, is meant to do very complex calculations on  relatively small chunks of data. Each of its work sheets, for instance, can  handle only the equivalent of 50 rows by 61 columns of spreadsheet data. You  can string work sheets together if you need more room, however.  </P> <P> The programs are self-auditing. A cross-referenced listing of variables and  formulas can be printed to the screen, a printer or a file.  </P> <P> Another virtue is that Business Wits frees you from the constraint of  identifying your applications with an eight-character DOS file name. Instead,  you give it a multiword descriptive name and let the program worry about which  file it is stored in.  </P> <P> Although Business Wits is designed to be fairly easy to use, it is not a  program for dabblers. Xerox has purposely targeted a highly specialized market  with its first collection of built-in and add-on applications. If you don't  already routinely solve the kinds of problems that Business Wits was designed  for, it's not likely that you'll know what to do with it.  </P> <P> Business Wits was created by Edward Ayoub, who has a Ph.D. in nuclear physics  and who heads his own Toronto company, WS&amp;T World Science &amp; Technology  Corp. He previously worked on implementation of a database analyzing corporate  financial performance while at Northern Telecom and before that adapted  artificial intelligence techniques to robotics at IBM.  </P> <P> Xerox invested in Ayoub's company and set up its own new company, Decisus, to  market Business Wits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUSINESS WITS  </P> <P> Features: Math functions and programs for making analyses including single  case, sensitivity, time series, cross sectional, linear programming, decision  tree, network, goal seeking and optimizing. Accessory applications available  for advanced financial, banking and investment, and statistics and sampling  calculations for $150 each.  </P> <P> Requirements: IBM PC or compatible with MS-DOS 3.1 or later and at least 4  megabytes of available hard-disk storage. A full 640 kilobytes of operating  memory needed for graphing, while the rest of program can run on a 512-kilobyte  machine.  </P> <P> Publisher: Decisus Inc., (Xerox subsidiary), 9938 Via Pasar, Suite A, San  Diego, Calif. 92126.

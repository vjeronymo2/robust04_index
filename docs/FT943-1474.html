			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Markets wait for news 'Wait and see' was the operative theme of the foreign exchange markets yesterday as a dearth of economic data or news left the dollar, D-Mark and pound treading water, writes Motoko Rich. The dollar was relatively undisturbed as continuing trade talks between the US and Japan circumscribed any significant movement. In London, the dollar closed against the D-Mark at DM1.5488 from DM1.5449. Against the yen, it finished slightly higher at 98.0750 from 97.7000. Anticipation of German inflation figures, due this week, prevented the D-Mark from leaping out of its trading ranges against most European currencies, although it was slightly firmer than it has been recently. It pushed up against the lira as the markets frowned at the squabble over pension reform between Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government and Italy's trade unions. Against the lira, the D-Mark finished in London at L1011 from L1007. Sterling turned in a steady performance, consolidating recent gains. Against the dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5762 from Dollars 1.5781. Against the D-Mark, if closed at DM2.4411 from DM2.438. As President Bill Clinton and Japanese foreign minister Mr Yohei Kono opened talks on the status of trade negotiations between the two countries and Mr Clinton renewed the threat of sanctions, the markets left the dollar languishingly in narrow trading ranges. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said he believed the markets were being unrealistic about the 'scope for meaningful compromise' between the two nations. 'I feel the markets are making too much of these talks,' he said. 'They are almost bound to be disappointed.' Remarks made by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, before the US Senate Banking Committee about the condition of the country's banking and thrift industry were shrugged off by investors. The markets are clearly waiting for the upcoming meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, on September 27. Analysts are now largely expecting officials to raise interest rates at that meeting or shortly after it. 'If there is a rate hike that will keep a check on the dollar because rate rises tend to pull the bond markets down and the dollar has been linked to bonds lately,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan. While the dollar's performance is generally thought to track the US bond markets, last week's collapse in US Treasuries on the back of fears of incipient inflation did not prompt an equivalent drop in the dollar against the D-Mark. Mr Hannah said he believed this was because the markets are also uncertain about inflation prospects in Germany, and were therefore reluctant to replace the dollar with D-Marks. The markets were unfazed by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, in which he said inflation was expected to ease in the next few months, but was not yet at a satisfactory level. Mr Hannah said that if inflation figures rise above the 3.0 per cent level, other European currencies will make modest advances against the D-Mark. Against the French franc, the D-Mark closed in London at FFr3.419 from FFr3.418. Against the Swiss franc, it finished at 0.830 from 0.828. The D-Mark was also helped against the lira by unresolved problems with Italy's pension reform programme. Two Italian trade unions have rejected Mr Berlusconi's draft plan, fuelling market uncertainty about the passage of a budget. Analysts downplayed the scale of the lira's movement, however. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, said: 'The pension reform is a key issue in the 1995 budget and the unions' reaction to it has caused some sensitivity in the market. But before we see any significant movement we need to see the budget get through the parliament and see if it represents a tangible tightening of fiscal policy.' The South African financial rand, which is freely traded on the markets, was jolted when the UK credit rating agency IBCA announced it had given the country a 'BB' rating on its senior, unsecured, long-term foreign currency debt. Against the dollar, the financial rand fell as low as R4.44 from an opening of R4.37. The rating, which is equivalent to that given to countries like Argentina, Mexico and Hungary disappointed the government as it had hoped for a higher grade to attract foreign investors. South African ratings from larger firms like Mooody's and Standard and Poor's are expected shortly. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn and provided liquidity of Pounds 469m. It provided late assistance of Pounds 520m. The December short sterling contract traded 43,000 lots to close at 93.18 from 93.07, discounting a three-month interest rate of 6.82.</p>

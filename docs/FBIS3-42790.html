			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Chernyshev under the rubric "The Fate of the </F> Voucher": "Privatization-93: Moscow Review"]    [Text] One of the most prominent features of last year was  privatization, which was broadly launched all over Russia. It  was this process which, despite inflation, political  instability, and legislative mishaps, was to start the formation  of a broad stratum of private property owners as the basis of  the future free market society.    Of course, the conditions, pace, volume, and specific  details  of privatization differed considerably from region to region;  however, the supercities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg,  with their immense volume of potential facilities for  privatization, found themselves in the most difficult situation  in implementing denationalization of state property.    An important factor in speeding up privatization in the  capital was the fact that the Moscow Property Fund, set up in  1991 in accordance with the Law "On Privatization of State and  Municipal Enterprises in the RSFSR," became in 1993 the lead  organization in matters of privatizing facilities of federal and  municipal property on the territory of the capital.    During the time of its operation, the fund's specialists  frequently participated in expert evaluations of draft normative  documents on privatization issues and in the development of  proposals for drafts of state and city privatization programs.    The fund entered a coordination and division of  responsibilities agreement with the Moscow Committee on  Administration of Property, which made it possible to remove  many points of contention between the two agencies and establish  a single privatization procedure for Moscow; the fund's transfer  to the jurisdiction of the capital city government after the  October events gave the fund's activities a new impetus.    Over the past year the fund has considered more than 1,500  letters, petitions, and complaints on matters related to  privatization of state and municipal property, to which replies  and clarifications were issued or necessary petitions to  appropriate bodies of authority prepared.    The fund's management has set up a reception room for  representatives of enterprises, as well as legal and physical  persons undergoing privatization. More than 3,000 of them  received the consultations they needed on organizational, legal,  and methodological matters of privatization.    In 1993 Property Fund specialists participated in more than  300 sessions of arbitration courts, at which more than 120  lawsuits were considered and resolved, in which the fund  participated as an initiator of a suit against the Moscow  Committee on Administration of Property, its territorial  agencies, and various legal entities.    For the purpose of improving the work in various areas of  privatization, a wide network of middlemen has been organized  and is operating under the fund's auspices; they act as  distributors for securities sold by the fund, hold real estate  bids and auctions, conduct market research, and do other  auxiliary work that raises the effectiveness of privatization.  More than 120 middlemen firms work today on a contract basis  with the Property Fund and are accredited with it. These firms  have opened 57 facilities where applications are accepted for  participation in specialized voucher auctions.    In 1993 the fund's specialists handled more than 2,000  privatization cases; this immense volume comprised the main  content of the Property Fund's activities.    Despite a difficult operating environment and great volume  of  work, the fund signed 1,900 sale contracts on privatized  facilities. Among them were 60 contracts that resulted from  commercial bids, which in the end brought more than 13 billion  rubles [R] in proceeds, and 196 contracts to sell securities of  publicly held joint-stock companies created in the process of  privatization of state enterprises.    The fund regularly held open money auctions where stocks of  joint-stock companies that had completed a voucher auction were  sold for rubles.    The fund's specialists also were actively involved in such a  new endeavor as development of a secondary securities market,  using proven information exchange technology on the basis of the  F-Broker information system. In addition, there was an ongoing  information exchange on non-exchange security trading.    The Property Fund paid special attention to information  support and public disclosure in the conduct of privatization.  Twice a month the fund put out an information bulletin in which  it regularly published all the necessary information on state  and municipal enterprises offered for sale; sales of stock of  joint-stock companies; the terms, place, and date of  privatization deals and their results in the capital and other  industrial centers of Russia.    The fund's bulletin was also distributed electronically  through computer information networks, which have more than  100,000 subscribers.    Materials covering various aspects of the fund's activities  were published throughout the year in various publications under  the terms of information distribution agreements the fund has  with leading information agencies.    Overall, one may say the fund has accomplished the tasks set  for 1993. Much remains to be done, however: to complete "small  business" privatization, and in the summer of 1994 to bid  farewell to the voucher.    Work will continue in the area of identifying property  contributions made by state and municipal enterprises to the  charter capital of small business and joint venture enterprises  on the territory of Moscow. Control will be increased over how  privatized enterprises comply with the terms set in sale  contracts. One of the serious tasks for the coming year is to  delve into problems of privatization in the sphere of land  relations.    Work will continue on setting up trust companies and  joint-stock companies, whose development is in the interests of  the population.</p>

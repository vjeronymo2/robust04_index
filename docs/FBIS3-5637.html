Commenting on this, papers here today say this clearly  indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group has no willingness to  resolve the questions of the peace and reunification of the  country and is going to invariably seek confrontation and war  this year, too.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    If the South Korean rulers are willing to solve the pending  issues between the North and the South through dialogue and  negotiation by realizing the exchange of special envoys, they  must not do acts getting on the other's nerve.    Recently, the traitor Kim Yong-sam impudently cried that  they  "could not be optimistic" about North-South relations and "the  United States would not hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S.  talks before the exchange of special envoys." His remarks fully  revealed his sinister intention to balk the DPRK-U.S. talks,  obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula, persistently seek North-South confrontation and thus  slay the fellow countrymen in the North with outside forces.    The Kim Yong-sam group decided to introduce into South Korea  U.S. Patriot missiles which had been used in the Persian Gulf  war and is now welcoming the deployment of two groups of Apache,  a main attack helicopter belonging to the U.S. Army, in South  Korea. And it does not bother to conceal its plan to stage a  large-scale nuclear war exercise with outside forces.    With the Kim Yong-sam group, "civilian" warmaniacs  desperately trying to plunge the nation into a nuclear  holocaust, left alone, is it impossible to solve the questions  of peace and reunification through dialogue and negotiation or  save our fellow countrymen from another war disaster.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that the Kim Yong-sam group is  attempting to frighten the North and ensure the "security of  power" with reckless war gambles, but all in vain.</p>

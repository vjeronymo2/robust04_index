			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD moved ahead on the London bullion market after Comex opened ahead following the US Presidents' Day holiday. New York traders said investor interest had been sparked by early sell-offs in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the dollar, which had been put on the defensive by uncertainty over President Clinton's economic plans. New York raw SUGAR prices were sharply higher at midday, buoyed by heavy commission house and fund buying as well as bullish chart factors. The gains were fuelled by market rumours that Cuba had had to buy 100,000 tonnes of Thai sugar to fulfil its Chinese contracts, and that Kenya was said to be tendering for physical sugar. London COCOA futures were depressed by sterling's advance against the dollar. On the LME BASE METAL trading continued in narrow ranges. Dealers said the lacklustre markets might prevail for some time yet, as overall physical interest and activity was slow and stocks continued to build. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Fox to Air Mandela Film: On the heels of Nelson Mandela's release from prison,  the Fox network will present the HBO film, "Mandela," March 7 at 8 p.m.  Starring Danny Glover as the anti-apartheid leader and Alfre Woodard as his  wife Winnie, the film chronicles Mandela's association with the African  National Congress and his battles against apartheid in South Africa -- up until  his imprisonment in 1962. "Mandela" won four ACE awards, cable's highest  honors, last year, including best acting trophies for Glover and Woodard. This  presentation will mark the film's first time on broadcast TV and also marks the  first time Fox has reached outside the 20th Century Fox library for one of its  network films.

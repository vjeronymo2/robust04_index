			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: CAP reform not good news for EC rural development Sir, Our research in 20 study areas in EC member states, supported by the EC and the Economic and Social Research Council's joint agriculture and environment programme, sheds light on the likely impact of CAP reform on rural development in the EC. First, we have found that the CAP has had little impact on providing farmers or their families with incomes comparable to those elsewhere in the economy. We estimate that half of all those farm family members and hired workers involved in working their farms earn less than 41 per cent of their national comparable incomes. The poorest farm families in Europe are, paradoxically, less dependent on agricultural income than on social security and income from working outside the farm. It was the larger cereal farmers, mainly in northern Europe, who would have suffered most from the proposed reforms under MacSharry 1, just as they had benefited disproportionately under the previous arrangements. However, political expediency has ensured that a good proportion of the agricultural budget will be devoted to compensating these farmers for the price reductions. Neither the new arrangements nor the compensation will improve the situation for the many small and medium sized farms which are well below comparable incomes already. These farms are already partly dependent on outside earnings and social security payments. Whether they remain in rural areas will depend less on agriculture, and more on the development of rural labour markets which, in turn, depends on rural development policy and the development of rural businesses. The Maastricht Treaty (Article 130a) introduces the development of rural areas as a key issue for cohesion in the Community, as indeed it is. Yet, as long as agricultural policy absorbs such a high proportion of the Community budget, the development of new policies in this sphere will remain limited. While there are many reasons to welcome the reform, it is not yet good news for rural development. For the time being the massive inequities which the CAP involves will remain and will act against the Community's efforts at greater cohesion. This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a 'level playing field'. John Bryden, The Arkleton Trust (Research), Nethy Bridge, Inverness-shire PH25 3EA</p>

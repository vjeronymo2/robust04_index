			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Observer: Please excuse the bugs Now that gold bugs, who have had a pretty depressing decade, are apparently dancing to the music of a George Soros investment, who better to turn to for a view of the market than the Costa Rican sisters, Mary Anne and Pamela Aden, that mysterious pair who achieved an extraordinary if eccentric following in the early 1980s. First making their name by calling the bear market in 1980 when gold was right up at Dollars 850 an ounce, the sisters began the Aden Analysis newsletter out of the faintly unlikely location of San Jose. They are now principally remembered for predicting gold at Dollars 4,400 by 1986. Barely a squeak has been heard since. Observer finally tracked down the pair, still in Costa Rica - 'it helps not to be distracted by opinion' - and still publishing. 'Excuse the bugs' says the April 6 issue - but no, that's just the glitches in the new computer system. The Adens, Californian-educated but with a Costa Rican mother, sweetly explain that the gold bug thing is 'just a label that stuck'. It didn't help that their partner, who, among other things, owned a coin company and from whom they have since split, 'really pushed gold a lot', says Mary Anne, who admits to being 'very green' when they started. The sisters profess to have turned bearish of gold in the mid-1980s - 'which made a lot of people very angry'. But they have just recently taken a shine to gold again. Now in their mid-40s, their forecast - 'as long as gold stays above Dollars 340 for a while, it could go to Dollars 380 or more' - sounds a little more staid. Mary Anne says their best record over time has been in foreign exchange. But sadly that seems harder to sell - the newsletter's circulation has shrunk from some 9,000 to 2,000.</p>

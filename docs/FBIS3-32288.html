After saluting the national flag, the Paraguayan leader went  to the Government Palace where he met privately with his  counterpart Alberto Fujimori for one hour and 10 minutes.  Wasmosy made favorable comments about his first meeting with the  chief of state and emphasized the possibility of establishing a  free zone in (Puerto Suarez) to give Peru an outlet to the  Atlantic:    [Wasmosy] "We had an open agenda.

Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived at the  Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] at 1600. He received the  honors befitting his high rank. CCD President Jaime Yoshiyama  greeted Wasmosy and escorted him to the Senate Hemicycle where  the plenum officially welcomed him.

He added  that Peru will receive the same treatment as Bolivia in gaining  access to the Atlantic through Paraguay's largest river basin,  and this in turn will promote greater commercial development in  the region:    [Wasmosy] "We discussed this with the president, that is,  making you the same offer we made Bolivia through (Puerto  Aguirre), (Puerto Suarez), and (Tibush).

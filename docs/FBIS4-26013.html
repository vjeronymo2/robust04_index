			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet, who is in Moscow on a three-day official  visit, remains optimistic about prospects of signing a bilateral  treaty with Russia, though the sides failed to sign it during  Thursday's [18 June] talks.    Commenting on his talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, the Vietnamese premier told reporters: "Talks with  the Russian side are going on productively. The new interstate  treaty has been in general agreed upon and it is very important."    He said the document would be signed after certain  improvements. The signing of the treaty, which was originally  scheduled to take place at mid-day on Thursday, was put off till  the evening.    A sources close to the Russian Government said the sides had  failed to eliminate various disagreements during the talks  between the two premiers.    Sources from the Vietnamese delegation explained that the  disputed issues include prospecting and production of oil and  natural gas by the joint "Vietsovpetro" venture, the problems of  the Vietnamese community in Russia, as well as the Russian naval  base in Cam Ranh.    To explain the delay of the signing of the documents,  Chernomyrdin said that "matters of technical presentation"  requiring specialists' attention cropped up during discussion.  "Essentially, there have been no differences," he noted.    "We are convinced that Russia and Vietnam have every  opportunity and potential to step up traditional cooperation in  the commercial, economic, technological, scientific and other  areas," he said.    However, the Vietnamese premier said the two sides differed  on the following matters: the problem of paying off Vietnam's  debt to Russia inherited from the former Soviet Union, terms of  the operation of Cam Ranh base by the Russian Navy, and issues  about the stay of Vietnamese citizens in Russia.</p>

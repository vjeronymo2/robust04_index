			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>   [Text] The bloodbath in currency markets this week will not  affect Mr and Mrs Average South African immediately, but the  long term effects are potentially devastating.    Higher inflation, higher interest rates and a dearth of  foreign investment are just some of the worries if we don't  bring violence under control.    The precipitous 13 percent collapse of the financial rand  R5.71 [rand] to the US dollar on Monday is a stark warning to  all South Africans that unless violence in the country abates,  we may not have an economy left after the election later this  month.    The freefall in the investment currency was sparked off by a  failed four-leader summit, coming on top of television images of  bodies lying in the streets in central Johannesburg after an  Inkatha Freedom Party protest march.    As such it is a stark indication of just how jaundiced a  view  foreign investors are taking about our flirtation with anarchy.    They've voted with their feet and sold at any cost.    They'll also be hard to entice the second time around.    Although overseas investors may succumb to attractive yields  as the discount between the financial and commercial rands  widens on political uncertainty, it's not speculation we want to  encourage by long-term confidence in the country.    Without foreign investment, massive reconstruction has  little  chance of going ahead.    And the expectations of the electorate of free homes and  education under the ANC's ambitious R39 billion Reconstruction  and Development Programme will likely be dashed.    The finrand is specifically designed to protect and absorb  political shocks and to discourage foreign investors from  removing their money from the country -- and it's arguably the  best barometer of overseas confidence in South Africa.    Unfortunately, bearish sentiment in the finrand market  inevitably spills over onto the commercial rand market, as  happened on Monday when the commercial rand fell to historic  lows of R3.75 to the dollar.    If the devaluation of the rand continues, imported  inflationary pressure will start to hot up, which could  encourage higher domestic inflation.    This in turn could delay the long-awaited cut in interest  rates -- in a worst-case scenario they could even rise.    This could stop credit demand and retail sales picking up --  and consumer spending is a crucial factor in economic recovery.    Although many economists were predicting growth of more than  4 percent for 1994 after more than four years of grinding  recession, many are now predicting a deceleration of growth in  the first quarter of 1994 because of the endemic violence and  political uncertainty in the run-up to the election.    And growth of at least 3 percent is needed simply to offset  burgeoning population growth.</p>

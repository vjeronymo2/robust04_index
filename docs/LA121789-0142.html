			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ROOKIE LICHTI PLAYS LIKE VETERAN  </P> <P> Todd Lichti's adjustment from Stanford superstar to NBA rookie was tougher than  most, mainly because veteran coach Doug Moe of the Denver Nuggets has a  reputation for treating first-year players as nonentities.  </P> <P> Since Moe took over the Nuggets in 1980-81, the club had a penchant for  drafting failures. Among Denver's top choices this decade, only center Blair  Rasmussen, a first-rounder from Oregon in 1985, has made a significant  contribution.  </P> <P> Lichti, a 6-4 guard who was the 15th player selected in the first round, had to  buck tradition and prove he belonged with the big boys. And playing 16.1  minutes per game, Moe is not prejudiced about using Lichti.  </P> <P> "All heard before I came to camp was that coach Moe didn't like rookies," said  Lichti, whose Nuggets play host to the Sacramento Kings Friday night.  "Consequently, I came to camp in real good shape because I wanted to get off on  the right foot.  </P> <P> "Then Doug started yelling at me, and I got down. Then I realized he was  yelling at everyone. It's just something you have to get used to. He's  different than any coach I've ever had."  </P> <P> Lichti, the all-time scoring leader at Stanford, earned his spurs with an  intensity and consistency that produced 20 records with the Cardinal and  All-Pacific 10 Conference selection four consecutive years.  </P> <P> Bringing similar desires to the NBA, he has averaged 7.6 points while shooting  .558 (58 for 104) from the field and .778 (35 for 45) from the line. That  projects to 22 points over 48 minutes.  </P> <P> In only his ninth pro game, against Houston on Nov. 18, he made 7 of 9 shots  and scored a career-high 19 points in 23 minutes. Against Portland on Dec. 2,  he had 15 points, four rebounds and six assists in 21 minutes in his finest  all-around performance.  </P> <P> "I don't look at Todd as a rookie," Moe said, "because he can play. People say  I don't like to play rookies, but over the years I've had a bunch of does. I  think Todd was the player drafted highest since I've been here.  </P> <P> "Todd is the type of player who has an edge over other guys because he can  compete. He's mentally tough. Rookies usually don't have competitiveness and an  understanding of how hard you have to play in this league.  </P> <P> "It just isn't as tough in college," Moe added, "so a lot of rookies come in  soft. But Todd showed from the start that he's very competitive. He plays very  tough defense and is very competitive."  </P> <P> As with most NBA rookies, Lichti has had his ups and downs. The 134-114 loss to  the Warriors on Wednesday was a microcosm of the growing pains endured by a  first-year player.  </P> <P> Lichti played tough defense in containing Mitch Richmond for three quarters,  and he also connected on 4 of 6 shots, but the Nuggets guard paid a stiff  price.  </P> <P> Playing 21 minutes, he had a team-high four turnovers and also missed two free  throws. Unlike Chris Mullin, who played with poise and confidence, Lichti  seemed tentative'and unsure of his ballhandling.  </P> <P> "My biggest adjustment is in decision-making," he said. "It's knowing when to  shoot, go to the hole or pass. It takes time to get that down pat, especially  when you're adjusting to not being the go-to guy every time."  </P> <P> At Stanford, Lichti was a franchise player ever since he jumped from Mt. Diablo  High in Concord, Calif., to the Cardinal starting lineup as a freshman. Over  four years, he averaged 18.8 points. Only Sean Elliott of Arizona scored more  in Pac-10 history.  </P> <P> Those who watched Lichti excel in college predicted even more success for the  tireless athlete in the pros. The wide-open Nuggets offense seems perfect for  his style as compared to the more structured college game.  </P> <P> "I think the NfA is better suited to me," Lichti said. "I like our running game  and getting the ball in the open court. I struggled early, but I feel I'm  improving. It's very tough adjusting to only playing 16 minutes."  </P> <P> It's a matter of perspective. Those accustomed to the Nuggets and Moe contend  that Lichti should be thankful for that many minutes. They don't begrudge him  the playing time but indicate that it's unusual.  </P> <P> "Todd is coming along fast because he's getting the playing time," said Fat  Lever, the shooting guard who plays ahead of Lichti. "He's playing more than  any rookie I've seen around here, but he's earned it by playing hard and well.  </P> <P> "Todd's big plus is his athletic ability. I saw him play on TV a lot in  college, so he really had nothing to prove to me. I knew he could do it,  because he has the mental ability to go with his physical skills."  </P> <P> Veteran forward Alex English is similarly impressed. "Todd hustles, jumps,  shoots and plays defense," English said. "He's just, a real good all-around  player.  </P> <P> "It didn't take him long to show us he can play. I think he's going to be a  real good one in this league. In time, he'll be an exceptional player because  he has the knack to keep going after it."  </P> <P> It's that desire that caught Moe's eye in the preseason workouts. Hardly a  typical kid from the suburbs, Lichti endeared himself to Moe with his reckless  abandon.  </P> <P> "I honestly didn't know how good he'd be," Moe said. "I never saw him play in  college, but our scouts really liked him. We really needed a guard, because I  want to cut down the minutes for Lever and (Michael) Adams.  </P> <P> "Todd reminds me of Dan Majerle (Phoenix), because he's hard-nosed and goes all  out. He has a feel for the game. He can shoot it and take it to the hoop. He  just needs seasoning and maturity."  </P></p>

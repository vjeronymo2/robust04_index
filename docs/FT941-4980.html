			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Cool hand to guide Whitewater raft: Clinton hopes Cutler can see him over political rapids Two Democrats, both lawyers, stand in a league of their own as heavyweight troubleshooters with enormous Washington reputations. One is Mr Robert Strauss, now 75, at various times national party chairman, special trade representative and ambassador to Moscow under President George Bush. The other is Lloyd Norton Cutler, whose clout and access to the upper reaches of government far exceed the governmental positions he has nominally held during nearly 50 years in Washington. Born in New York and a Yale Law School graduate like the president and Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, this urbane, witty and charming man is a fixture on the social circuit and in the political backrooms that used to be smoke-filled. His law firm, Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering, which he helped found in 1962, is a star in the Washington legal firmament, its domestic and foreign clients generally of the blue chip variety, its lawyers always in and out of government. Mr Cutler's personal and political briefs have long been at the cutting edges of US domestic and foreign policy. He was active in the civil rights movement and other liberal causes, a member of the 1968-70 Eisenhower commission on the prevention and causes of violence, the unpaid co-ordinator of President Jimmy Carter's attempts to get the Salt Two treaty ratified and a frequent commentator on constitutional and ethical issues. Earlier this year he was the principal lawyer in the case that successfully overturned the Washington State law imposing term limits on elected representatives. But, to combat political 'gridlock', he has also advocated a constitutional amendment to co-ordinate the congressional and presidential election cycles by giving House members four-year terms, not two, and senators eight, rather than six. But there is an unpredictable streak, too. In 1987 he offended many liberal friends by coming to the defence of Mr Robert Bork, President Ronald Reagan's conservative Supreme Court nominee ultimately rejected by the Senate. In 1992, along with another Democratic eminence grise, Mr Paul Nitze, he gave some advice to Mr Ross Perot prior to his independent presidential candidacy. His appointment as White House counsel is reminiscent of the circumstances of August 1979. The Carter administration was already in trouble even before the Iranian hostage crisis and its White House legal counsel, Mr Robert Lipshutz, under fire for taking too narrow a legal view of his responsibilities. The same criticism is now levelled at the departing Mr Bernard Nussbaum, whose resignation was announced at the weekend, and at the general White House staff with its heavy component of friends of the president. Last summer, when also under attack after a series of mishaps, Mr Clinton reached into the Washington establishment to appoint Mr David Gergen, denizen of Republican White Houses, as a senior adviser. The improvement in presidential fortunes owed not a little to this move, although Mr Gergen is now less visible and is frequently reported to be thinking of moving on. Mr Cutler's second White House term will not be long either. He said yesterday that he had agreed to stay only for 'a period of months'. He is unlikely to last until Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel investigating the Whitewater affair, produces his report next year or the year after. But if he gets the White House show back on the road in the meanwhile, he will have earned his stripes yet again.</p>

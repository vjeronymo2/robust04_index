			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Employment Service threat to bonuses denied: Hunt dismisses union allegations MR DAVID HUNT, employ-ment secretary, yesterday denied claims by Civil Service unions that the Employment Service, a government agency, was threatening to withhold bonuses from staff if they did not meet targets for reducing unemployment totals. Among reasons suggested for the fall in unemployment during the past five months is that the government has fiddled the figures through the service, which runs Jobcentres and Unemployment Benefit Offices. Mr John Hickey, national secretary of the CPSA, one of the two main civil service unions, suggested on Wednesday that new pay arrangements were forcing staff to cut corners to achieve national targets, which include ensuring that 9 per cent of initial claim inquiries should not be pursued as new claims. Mr Ian Taylor, national officer at the NUCPS, the other civil main service union, denied that his members were fiddling the system, but said the new pay system, which includes performance pay, put pressure on staff to achieve what he believed to be 'unrealistic and unnecessary targets'. Mr Hunt said: 'The Employment Service has targets to help people out of unemployment. That means helping them to find jobs, helping them on to training courses or, in some cases, helping them on to a more appropriate benefit. There is nothing wrong in that. 'Like other parts of the Civil Service, the ES rewards its staff for overall performance - everything from good timekeeping to accuracy. It is plain wrong to suggest this means showing unemployed people the door.' The ES said there was no specific linkage between achievement of a specific target and the judgment for overall performance, which included the quality of handling clients and understanding the labour market. The only point at which bonuses were paid was when people hit the top of their pay scale.</p>

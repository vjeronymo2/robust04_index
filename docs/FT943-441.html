			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Two rather momentous events today, one of which may already have passed you by. Chris Evans makes his final appearance on The Big Breakfast this morning. His manic, cartoon-like, personality, as subtle as a Big Mac, may not charm everyone but it lifted Channel 4's breakfast programmes out of the doldrums and gave the nation a new cult figure. Fortunately he is leaving to spend more time with the unmissable Don't Forget Your Toothbrush. Then this evening at 10pm, also on Channel 4, there is the long awaited return of Drop the Dead Donkey. This sitcom set in the offices of Globelink, the satellite TV channel, is a triumph because of its strong characterisation: tough media men, and women, whose egos hide very precarious personalities. The worst bits are the topical jokes that the writers feel they must pop in to make the setting ring true. If the Greeks have a word for it one wonders how they describe Louise, the tough Lancashire girl who left Blackburn to become a holiday rep in Crete. She works Malia, the wildest resort on the island. Inside Story (BBC 1 10.00) is her's.</p>

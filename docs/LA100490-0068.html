			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE RELUCTANT NOVICE;  </P> <P> TRY A TRIANGLE;  </P> <P> ON THE PAGE BEFORE YOU, THE NOTES SWAM LIKE DAZED GUPPIES. THEN CAME YOUR PIECE  AND YOUR MOMENT. . . .  </P> <P> The best part came first. You drove to the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, rolled  right past the main entrance and pulled up in back by the stage door -- your  door. Not general admission for you. On this night you would be a percussionist  with the Ventura County Symphony.  </P> <P> "The cool thing about being a percussionist," said Mark Zimoski a few minutes  later, "is you're sitting back among a bunch of other percussionists, and  there's no problem just leaning back and whispering, 'Where are we?' We do it  all the time. Well, we don't do it all the time . . ."  </P> <P> At least Zimoski doesn't. He is the principal percussionist, having played with  the Ventura County Symphony for nine years. He is also an optimist. While a few  early string players sawed their bows under the harsh stage lights, he spread  some sheets of music on a kettle drum and offered choices. A waltz? A march?  You, a retired garage-band drummer, dithered.  </P> <P> This was only a rehearsal but a full one: 85 professional and semiprofessional  musicians under the direction of a baton-wielding conductor, with just a few  hours together to prepare for a performance five days hence. If a newcomer  succeeded here, whole new opportunities in rhythm could lie ahead. Zimoski got  his start, after all, in circumstances even more modest. There he was, an  undirected youth, pounding out rock 'n' roll drum exercises in a San Fernando  Valley suburb, when two members of the Mothers of Invention moved in next door.  </P> <P> The Mothers of Invention, of course, was an intellectual rock band led by Frank  Zappa and influenced by such far-flung composers as Muddy Waters and Edgard  Varese. Yet when Ian and Ruth Underwood heard Zimoski practicing rock 'n' roll  drums in the next house, they sensed something they liked.  </P> <P> They invited Zimoski to turn pages at a rehearsal -- "it was all I could do to  keep up with the measures, let alone what was in them" -- and made some  introductions. That was two decades ago and now Zimoski, 37 years old, lives in  Van Nuys and makes his living by driving around Southern California and banging  on things.  </P> <P> Maybe that's why he gave you the benefit of the doubt. He believed you when you  said you could read music, took it in stride when you opted for the triangle  part in Johann Strauss Jr.'s "Tales From the Vienna Woods." And he cheerfully  placed before you a gleaming chrome triangle and a pair of metal swizzle  sticks. Triangle beaters.  </P> <P> Now things were happening fast. The straggling players had congealed into an  orchestra. Conductor Frank Salazar had appeared up front and you stood behind a  big black music stand, snare drum at your right elbow, bass drum at your left.  </P> <P> "Tales From the Vienna Woods," your showcase, was in waltz time, with an  introductory section of about 20 measures before the triangle's appearance. You  would beat half a dozen whole notes, followed by a four-measure roll and a few  more whole notes. Then later on, after a few twists, turns, repeats and rests,  a few quarter notes.  </P> <P> You eyed the sheet music, fingered your triangle beaters and the music began.  Brass, woodwinds, violins -- all sounded at the appropriate moments. In the  percussion section, too, it was business as usual.  </P> <P> Zimoski assaulted the timpani. Bill Ricketts, a calm, 27-year-old from  Montebello, boomed at the bass drum. Marie Matson, a 31-year-old Panorama City  resident, stood alertly at the snare drum. And Wade Culbreath, a tall  25-year-old from Sherman Oaks, stood at the end of the line, cymbals in hand.  </P> <P> As the music bounced along, they rolled, rattled and rumbled, occasionally  stealing glances your way and counting aloud for your benefit. On the page  before you, the notes swam like dazed guppies.  </P> <P> Then came your piece and your moment. A sudden, ugly moment it was. Time  expanded and contracted. Immense and indistinct ideas seized your mind.  Onetwothree.... Onthebeat.... AmIsweating? HowdoIread ... andwatchtheconductor?  Onetwothree.... Aretheystaring? HaveIrepliedtothat weddinginvitation ...  fromMichaelandDonna? Onetwothree.... Isthereabreeze? Evenstrokes Wait. . . .  </P> <P> You started early on the half-dozen whole notes.  </P> <P> You came in late on the four-measure roll.  </P> <P> You abandoned entirely the idea of coming back in with whole notes.  </P> <P> And the orchestra played on, like seasoned commuters roaring past a spin-out in  the slow lane. The conductor ignored you.  </P> <P> You assessed the damage. In theory, that roll would have included some 192 16th  notes. No one expected that. But had they bargained for the sound of a  3-year-old child, set free among the wind chimes at The Nature Company?  </P> <P> You were still useless when the next passage arrived. Again you started early,  only this time, in your haste to silence the resounding triangle, you rattled  the music stand. Now you imagined the erect hairs on the back of every neck in  the violin section. On the last pass, when nothing mattered anymore, you  entered and exited properly.  </P> <P> "That's it," whispered calm Bill Ricketts at your side. "Now you're a star."  </P> <P> Optimism, it turns out, is endemic among percussionists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PREMISE  </P> <P> There are plenty of things you have never tried. Fun things, dangerous things,  character building things. The Reluctant Novice tries them for you and reports  the results. After all, the Novice gets paid to do them -- and has no choice in  the matter. If you want to tell the Novice where to go, please call us at  658-5547. If we use your idea, we'll send you a present. This week's Reluctant  Novice is staff writer Christopher Reynolds.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan continues  his three-day working visit to Germany. Following the meeting  with his counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, yesterday, today he met with  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. He also had talks with Hans  Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] group in the Bundestag. Eduard Kukan is now on his way  to Berlin. Shortly before he left, our correspondent Branislav  Zvara asked him to briefly sum up his talks so far:    [Begin recording] [Kukan] After we had talks with Minister  Kinkel, we were pleased to hear of support for Slovakia's  efforts aimed at membership of the European Union and NATO, as  was the case of Portugal, Spain, and other countries. In  geographic terms, Germany is our closest partner, and Germany  knows intimately the process of transformation that is under way  in Slovakia because Germany itself is pursuing a similar process  in one part of its territory. [passage omitted]    [Zvara] Did you discuss the agreement on Slovakia's  association with the European Union? According to Bundestag  Chairwoman Mrs. Rita Suessmuth, this agreement should be  ratified before the summer vacation.    [Kukan] We discussed this issue, which Slovakia considers  very important at this time, because before we submit our  official membership application, all twelve [European Union  countries] will have to complete the ratification process. Two  countries, Denmark and Great Britain, have ratified the  association agreement so far. Minister Kinkel reassured me that  he does not envision ratification problems in the Bundestag and  that it should take place as early as July.    [Zvara] Minister, contacts between the Slovak Republic and  Hungary have recently been very intensive. I would like to know  whether Mr. Kinkel was briefed about these issues and mainly  whether he was briefed about tackling some problem areas that  have played a rather negative role in relations between Hungary  and Slovakia.    [Kukan] Germany is following with great interest the  development of relations between Slovakia and Hungary. We  discussed these issues, and the outcome of our discussion was  that we will facilitate our own rapprochement with Europe if we  can prove that we are sufficiently politically mature and  advanced to address these issues on a bilateral basis.    I assured the minister that this was precisely the way in  which Slovakia approached these issues and that the new  government has succeeded in creating a better and more calm  atmosphere in relations with Hungary and that this atmosphere  will, in effect, lead to solving these issues on a step-by-step  basis, starting with the issues of lesser importance and later  focussing on the big treaty with Hungary. We are confident that  the two of us will be able to resolve these issues. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Don Lyons] </F>   [Text] Mainland developers are "dumping" cheap property on  to the Hong Kong market and many people are pouring their money  into projects that will never get built, warned a top Guangzhou  government official. Liu Xietan, deputy director of the  Guangzhou Land Bureau, said a lot of mainland projects now being  advertised in Hong Kong "could not be sold at such prices".    Local realtors are warning that investors stand to get badly  burnt if they do not do their homework before buying flats on  the mainland. Favoured locations for these property scams  include those which have in the past proved popular for Hong  Kong residents as investment havens. These include Zhuhai,  Dongguan, Zhongshan and Panyu.    Not a day or night goes by that Hong Kong people are not  bombarded with full-page print ads and splashy TV commercials  featuring flats for sale in these locations. According to an  agent at Hong Kong real estate agents Land Power, there can be  as many as 30 property exhibitions on a given-weekend in Hong  Kong. The asking price for many of these flats is ridiculously  low -- $100,000 compared to the current asking price of $3  million for an average flat in Hong Kong. Developers also offer  between $20,000 and $50,000 worth of free household appliances  to the purchaser. Financing terms are also enticing. The  developers advertise no down payment an interest-free mortgage,  no lawyer's fees and no management fees.    Hong Kong agents say they doubt developers can afford to  sell  the flats so cheaply. "It may be possible," said Allan Lee of  Richard Ellis. "But it seems to us unrealistic for them to be  able to earn a profit at these prices." He and other agents  said that, at these prices, buyers could find themselves paying  all sorts of extra fees in water, sewage and management fees.    But the same agents agree that the ads are enticing. "Many  people in Hong Kong have relatives in these areas," said one  agent. "These flats are big by Hong Kong standards (more than  1,000 square feet) and they each have a balcony. "And maybe the  $100,000 price tag has some kind of psychological impact," she  said.    But agents said the most likely reason developers offered  these flats so cheaply was because they were strapped for cash.  "Ordinarily, they must get the money before they actually start  construction," said the Land Power representative. Other agents  said it was conceivable that a developer would sell one project  to raise capital for a project already in financial trouble. To  the consternation of the buyers, it is usually many months down  the road when they find out that the developer has taken the,  money and run.    They said the simple solution, was to find a reputable  developer. But that was not as easy as it sounded. Most of  these unscrupulous developers had received the required  paperwork and licences from government officials giving them the  go-ahead to develop and sell the property. Therefore, getting a  look at their sales permits, pre-sale permits, construction  permits and all the other documentation was usually not the  problem. The documentation was valid, but maybe not the  developer's resolve.    One realtor who asked for anonymity said: "This sort of  problem occurs in the more remote areas. In the city centre,  supervision is much tighter. But, in other areas, as long as  you have good connections with the government officials they  will give you the documentation. In most cases, the site is too  far away for them to go and investigate and find out how much  work is actually going on," he said. They just give the  developer all the documentation he needs." But, in many  instances the authorities never check the site. They just  believed the developer and approved the licence.</p>

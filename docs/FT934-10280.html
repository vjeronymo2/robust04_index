Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be pressing for a cut in capacity at Ilva of 2.1m tonnes as a condition for approving state subsidies of Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 1.9bn). If approved by commissioners at next Wednesday's meeting, the proposal will go to EC industry ministers for unanimous approval at their November 18 council.</p>

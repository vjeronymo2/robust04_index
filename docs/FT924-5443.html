			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selective selling drives equities lower A DISAPPOINTING session in the London stock market saw shares lose ground steadily in spite of further satisfactory news on the progress of the US economy. Although sellers were very selective, trading volume remained high enough to indicate the presence of the big institutions, which have already begun to tidy up their portfolios ahead of the end of the calendar year. The FT-SE Index opened steadily but showed no inclination to respond to the overnight strength of the new York market. The combination of uncertainty over the currency outlook and the progress of the domestic economy soon depressed UK equities. Pressure on the banking and blue chip international stocks drove the FT-SE Index down to a close of 2,709.6, a loss of 17.5 and virtually the low point of the day. As it approached the close of business, London made little attempt to follow Wall Street's early gain of 12 Dow points in response to a significant revision of US third quarter gross domestic product statistics to show a gain of 3.9 per cent. Dealers suggested that the UK market was now losing impetus as the news of higher money growth in Germany and the continued turmoil in currency markets undermined the opportunity for another early cut in Britain's interest rates. Several leading securities houses believe that the UK stock market could be pinned into a range of Footsie 2,650 - 2,740 over the Christmas period. The strategy team at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities house, yesterday repeated its view that current forces in the marketplace were not strong enough to move the Footsie far from the 2,704 area. At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight who has been among the market bulls, believes that the recovery in the UK economy 'next year and in 1994' is being under-estimated by the market. For end-1993, his Footsie target is 3,500, and says further turbulence in the ERM will not rob the UK of the advantages of competitive devaluation. Seaq volume of 522.1m shares yesterday against 578.4m in the previous session indicated lively trading. A large programme trade, begun on Tuesday evening, was completed early yesterday, and the institutions were said to be rounding off portfolios ahead of the calendar year-end, which is effectively mid-December from a stock market trading viewpoint. Retail business on Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.2bn, sustaining the significantly improved business levels seen since mid-September. The London-based securities industry regards Pounds 1bn as the minimum daily turnover level required for profitable trading in equities, and the prolonged run of improved retail volume has lifted some of the gloom. The company news front was quieter, but analysts were looking ahead to the next meeting of the FT-SE Index Constituent Committee at the end of December. Several leading names in the Footsie list are believed to be in danger of relegation, moves which would prompt more re-shuffling of institutional portfolios. However, underlying confidence in the UK stock market appeared to remain firm. The improved data on the US economy disclosed this week has buttressed support for expected moves to re-stimulate economies in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.</p>

Applicants also request amendment of the Prior Orders to waive the CDSC for pre-retirement transfers or rollovers from a Fund to another investment sponsored or distributed by New York Life or its subsidiaries, when both the Fund and the other investment are funding vehicles for a single retirement plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. As amended, the order would permit applicants to waive the CDSC for redemptions: (a) Following the death or disability, as defined in section 72 (m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b) in connection with distributions permitted to be made under the Code from an individual retirement account (``IRA''), or other retirement and tax-deferred plans; (c) of shares purchased by active or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners, and employees of the Funds, by the Distributor or affiliated companies, by members of the immediate families of such persons, and by dealers having a sales agreement with the Distributor, or any trust, pension, or profit sharing plan for the benefit of such persons; (d) by New York Life or an affiliate thereof; (e) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f) by accounts established with an initial purchase order of $1 million or more; (g) effected by separate accounts or advisory accounts managed by New York Life or an affiliated company; (h) by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting from the adoption of any law or regulation pursuant to which continuation of the investment in the Funds would be improper; (i) effected by registered investment companies in connection with the combination of the investment company with a Fund by merger, acquisition of assets or by any other transaction; (j) by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality; department, authority or agency thereof, and by trust companies and bank trust departments that are holding shares in a fiduciary capacity; (k) made for the purpose of funding a loan to a participant in a tax-qualified retirement plan permitted to make such loans; (l) on transfers to (i) other funding vehicles sponsored or distributed by New York Life or an affiliated company, or (ii) guaranteed investment contracts, regardless of sponsor, within a retirement plan; (m) made to meet required distributions by a charitable remainder trust under section 664 of the Code; and (n) by living revocable trusts. Applicants believe that these proposed waivers are appropriate because they involve the redemption of shares sold at little or no selling expense to the Funds or the Distributor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In addition to the CDSC waivers described above, no CDSC will be charged in connection with the exercise of an exchange privilege whereby an investor exchanges shares of a Fund for shares of another Fund subject to a CDSC. In such a case, the Fund will add the period for which the shares of the original Fund were held to the holding period of the shares acquired in the exchange for purposes of determining what, if any, CDSC is applicable in the event that such acquired shares are redeemed following the exchange. In the event of redemptions of shares after exchanges, as investor will be subject to the CDSC of the Fund with the longest CDSC period or highest CDSC schedule which may have been owned by him, whichever results in the greatest payment. All exchanges will be effected in accordance with the provisions of section 11(a) and rule 11a&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants also propose to provide a pro-rata credit for and CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment effected within a set number of days, not to exceed 365, of the redemption. The credit will be paid for by the Distributor, not by the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above would be fair and in the best interests of shareholders of the Funds. Accordingly, applicants believe that the granting of the order requested herein would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Condition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that, as a condition of granting the requested relief, they will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule currently is proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

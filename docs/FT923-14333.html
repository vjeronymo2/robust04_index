			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / OECD sees fall in output for Iceland ICELAND can expect a sharp decline of 2.8 per cent in its output this year with a modest 0.5 per cent improvement in 1993, according to the latest survey of the country's economy published yesterday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report blames the poor short-term outlook for the country's fishing industry which accounts for three quarters of Iceland's exports. The report also blames world aluminium prices that have forced the postponement of a multi-national smelter project. Following optimism last year, the OECD says that as a result of events beyond the country's control there is going to be further stagnation despite the relatively low level of inflation for Iceland of 7 per cent.</p>

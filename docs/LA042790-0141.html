			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOG TURNS ON ITS OWNER, IS SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE  </P> <P> Betty Malberg called it "a classic case of biting the hand" that feeds him.  </P> <P> In this case the offender was Excalibur, the family-pet-turned-vicious-dog, who  was shot and killed by Cypress police when it turned on Malberg for no apparent  reason.  </P> <P> A licensed dog breeder, Malberg was feeding the 9-year-old boxer in her back  yard Wednesday night when the canine attacked her.  </P> <P> "It was very unusual," she said. "He started out playing with me, then he began  nibbling, and then . . . he got carried away. He began chewing on my left arm."  </P> <P> The 80-pound fawn and white boxer, known affectionately by the nickname Cal,  pinned her against a chain-link gate and continued to snap at her left arm. A  neighbor called police, and officers arrived to find Malberg's back up against  the fence, fending off the snarling, attacking boxer.  </P> <P> "They fired one shot in the air and asked me what should they do," Malberg  said. "I said, 'Shoot him!' "  </P> <P> Suddenly the dog charged at the officers, shots were fired, and Malberg turned  to see Excalibur fall to the ground.  </P> <P> Malberg, 59, was treated by paramedics before being taken to La Palma  Intercommunity Hospital where she received several stitches for multiple dog  bites.  </P> <P> She praised the officers' handling of the matter.  </P> <P> "To be very frank, I didn't like that dog,' Malberg said, noting that Cal was  normally handled by her ailing husband, Eddie. "He was rough. He was a man's  dog."  </P></p>

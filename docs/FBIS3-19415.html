Those summoned were the same  people who attended the previous meeting: Narcis Serra, Manuel  Chaves, Joan Lerma, Jose Bono, Joaquin Leguina, Ramon Jauregui,  Jesus Quijano, Joaquin Almunia, and Rosa Conde, although Basque  Socialist Party Secretary General Jauregui, who is on a visit to  Argentina, was absent yesterday afternoon.    Some 10 days from the start of the congress, which will be  held in Madrid 18-20 March, Gonzalez and the renewalist leaders,  who account for 70 percent of the delegates to that meeting,  analyzed in greater detail the contents of the 7,200 amendments  to the framework report. The amendments were reviewed in order  to see which deserve to be incorporated into [congress]  resolutions and which should be watched in order to prevent  approval of proposals that point to alleged discrepancies  between party aims and government policy -- a temptation to  which, in the opinion of those present, the Guerraists could  succumb. To this end, in addition to the opinions the report  writers, Felipe Gonzalez asked Joaquin Almunia, Alejandro  Cercas, and Jose Rodriguez de la Borbolla, among others, to  assess that document, several of those present told LA  VANGUARDIA.    The PSOE secretary general, who still has not met with the  Guerraist leaders although he speaks daily with Organization  Secretary Jose Maria Benegas, took note of the opinions and the  names which the renewalist leaders had suggested to him for  membership of the presiding committee--which will direct the  congress proceedings. [Renewalist leaders aalso suggested]  possible chairmen of the reporting committees, rapporteurs, and  even of people who could be on the future Executive Committee.  Thus the list of candidates for the presiding committee which  Gonzalez will present to the 888 delegates will include  Sevillian Amparo Rubiales for deputy chairman, in addition to  Lerma for chairman. The Socialists' top leader hopes there  will be a consensus for this proposal, and that the election of  the presiding committee -- the first vote of the congress --  will not serve as a pretext for confrontation between the  sectors.

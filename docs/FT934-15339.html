			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sprint takes Dollars 56m charge SPRINT, the US telecommunications company, is to take an after-tax charge of Dollars 56m, or 16 cents a share, to cover the cost of restructuring, tax increases and debt reduction in the third quarter. Most of the provision is associated with the cost of reorganising the company's operations following its merger with Centel, a Chicago-based provider of cellular and local telephone services. Sprint, the third-largest long-distance telephone company in the US, acquired Centel in a Dollars 3.6bn stock-swap deal completed in March. Mr Charles Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said the announcement would have no effect on his third-quarter earnings forecast of 51 cents a share. In the quarter to the end of September 1992, Sprint posted net income of Dollars 115m, or 52 cents a share. The results are not directly comparable to figures for the current quarter because of the issue of new shares as part of the Centel acquisition. The warning by Sprint follows an announcement in August of a plan to eliminate about 1,000 jobs, about 5 per cent of the workforce, at its long-distance division. In addition, two facilities in Indiana and Virginia are to be closed. In the first quarter, Sprint said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs as part of a consolidation of its cellular and local telephone operations. In breaking down the components of the third-quarter charge, Sprint said the cost of restructuring would reduce after-tax earnings in the period by Dollars 28m. Federal tax increases enacted in August would require it to take a one-time charge of Dollars 13m, or 4 cents. A further Dollars 15m charge would cover the cost of refinancing and the early retirement of debt. On Wall Street, Sprint stock fell Dollars 3/4 yesterday to close at Dollars 36 1/4.</p>

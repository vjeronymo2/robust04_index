			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Patten in shade as spotlight moves to Blatch THE CLIMBDOWN over the national curriculum has posed more questions about the political future of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, who is suffering from a stomach illness. It has also moved the spotlight on to Baroness Blatch, the education minister, who took responsibility for reacting to the Dearing review in Mr Patten's absence. Mr Patten has had an unenviable job, balancing the government's ideological commitments against the demands of the teachers whose co-operation is vital. Labour yesterday demanded his resignation, describing the climbdown as 'a severe embarrassment'. But Sir Malcolm Thornton, Conservative chairman of the education select committee, said he did not think yesterday's developments affected Mr Patten's career. Lord Skidelsky, a former government adviser who resigned from the Schools Examination and Assessment Council in May in protest at the way the Dearing review was carried out, expressed strong opposition to the decision not to publish league tables for 14-year-olds, or introduce external marking of tests, and called for 'better leadership'. He suggested that the government should have persisted with publishing externally marked league tables for core subjects. 'Maybe that's not acceptable to the teachers' unions, but it's something we can defend to the public,' he said. 'The government has never had a clear idea of what it is doing and therefore the teachers' unions have got a lot of parental support.' Some observers are beginning to see Lady Blatch as a possible successor to Mr Patten. After being appointed his number two after the 1992 general election, she was one of a handful of ministers tipped to succeed Mr David Mellor as heritage secretary last September. Her name again cropped up in May before Mr John Major's first significant reshuffle resulted in Mr John Redwood's promotion to the cabinet as Welsh secretary. Most recently, her name surfaced as a possible successor to Lord Wakeham as leader of the Lords. A close confidante of Mr Major, Lady Blatch is a member of the so-called East Anglian mafia at the heart of government - the small group of senior party figures who live near the prime minister's Huntingdon constituency and are on close personal terms with him. Other members are Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. But her generally traditionalist views on education have done nothing to offend the right of the party. For example her decision to allow schools to select up to 10 per cent of pupils on the basis of their ability in technology was claimed by leftwing educationalists to be a preparation for a return to selective secondary schools. She is credited with shepherding a long and complex education bill through the Lords. According to one government official, she showed 'amazing stamina' during proceedings that were at times 'tortuous beyond belief' and demonstrated ability to master a brief 'diligently and quickly'. She is a former leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, became a peer in 1987 and was appointed a whip in the Lords in 1990, moving to environment after nine months, then to national heritage. She became a privy counsellor in the new year honours. In a government short of stars, perhaps the main obstacle between her and the cabinet is the traditional sensitivity at Westminster about appointing a peer to a high-profile post. She will stay in charge of the education department for at least another three weeks. Downing Street said Mr Major was delighted that Mr Patten was 'making good progress' in overcoming his illness and was expected to be back at his desk in the week starting August 23.</p>

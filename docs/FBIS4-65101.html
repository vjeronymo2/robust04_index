			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Volker Wolff: "Grand Coalition"] </F>   [Text] Right on, Germany! The governing parties' pithy  campaign slogan of yesteryear has fallen on fertile soil. Also  in the opposition. How nice it is to have a common continuity  when it is a matter of covering up the fiasco of the German tax  policy with phony figures and hollow words and misleading the  citizens.    The decisive elections are approaching, and the chancellor  as  well as his adversary agree that German taxes are not to be  increased. There will be a little redistribution, to be sure,  but, and there too they are agreed, that is not the same as a  tax hike. Both of them are tacitly taking for granted that the  new taxes known as the solidarity tax (CDU [Christian Democratic  Union]) and the supplementary tax (SPD [Social Democratic Party  of Germany]) have already been passed and are thus not new.    The campaign promises of lower taxes will be broken. It is a  sure thing that the next finance minister in Bonn, regardless of  his party affiliation, must implement two directives of the  Constitutional Court justices and, in addition to the  supplementary or solidarity tax, must undertake something which  will equate to higher property taxes, estate taxes, assets  taxes, and/or value-added taxes. All the parties in Bonn know  that and are laughing softly.    The grand coalition against the taxpayers is a done deal.  Both camps have further snatches up their sleeves. The  chancellor would like to raise gasoline prices to save the  railroad system, his opponent cites other methods to achieve the  same purpose and, apart from that, broods on the budgetary  risks. And despite all their bombast, neither gives the  slightest insight into how the maximum-taxation country of  Germany is to become a region in which achievement will once  again pay off.    Regardless who leads the next government, it will skim  generously off the top of their subjects' incomes--including  church tax, roughly 62 percent. A grasp of this magnitude will  not be an isolated occurrence. For single persons, incomes will,  according to the tax tables, be taxed at this rate up to 120,000  German marks [DM]. Regardless who leads the government, it will  continue taking also from its subjects' consumption and capital  assets--most of which were created from taxed incomes.    From the standpoint of its impact on the national economy,  the pincer attack on capital assets and incomes can only be  depicted in gloomy colors: The creation of capital assets is  hampered in threefold fashion with all the negative consequences  for investments, growth, and standard of living. How, under  these circumstances, the collective vigor and entrepreneurial  spirit of these subjects are to bring about a revival of the  economy, and how the urgently needed new jobs are to be created  in the process, will remain the secret of the grand coalition  parties.    Less of a secret is the assumption that the entrepreneurial  spirit of the ripoff victims will discover the higher marginal  utility in the development of countermeasures. The figures  confirm the expectation: The transfer of capital to Luxemburg  and Switzerland continues unabated; the cash money in  circulation increased from early in 1990 to the end of 1993 from  DM65 billion to DM212 billion. Doing unreported work on the side  and tax evasion have what it takes to become trivial offenses  and a mass phenomenon. If they would stop and think a little, it  should occur to all the parties that their uninhibited "right  on" is leading into a cul-de-sac.    Eminent economists, with the Bundesbank in the lead, have  been preaching consolidation and savings for years. No one in  Bonn is listening. Where is the party that will honestly and  bluntly point to the predictable budgetary gaps and, instead of  making nebulous taxation promises, tells the responsible citizen  in clear terms that it will save the missing billions, and where  it will do so?</p>

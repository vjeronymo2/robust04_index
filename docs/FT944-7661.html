			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / BNFL financing reclassified British Nuclear Fuels has been reclassified so its finances fall within the public sector borrowing requirement. It was set up in 1971 as a private company with the government as its only shareholder. That allowed it to borrow money from commercial sources. Treasury ministers said the change should not affect BNFL's commercial operations nor lead to any greater intervention by the government.</p>

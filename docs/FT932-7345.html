			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Ministers consider flotation to fund tunnel rail link THE GOVERNMENT is considering a plan to fund the Pounds 2.5bn rail link between London and the Channel tunnel by inviting the public to buy shares in the project through a stock market flotation. The plan could end the long delay in starting the project by overcoming the government's difficulties in raising the finance necessary for construction. Last week the delay led to diplomatic embarrassment when President Francois Mitterrand of France marked the opening of a high-speed rail link on the French side of the Channel tunnel by deriding the lack of progress on the British side. If the plan goes ahead, the most likely timing of the flotation will be around September 1995 - after the government has obtained the necessary legislation, but before construction work begins. This means private sector investors will run the risk of seeing their returns diminished by unexpected increases in construction costs, so bringing comparisons with Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel concessionaire, which was floated on the stock market in 1987. The government's advisers are likely to claim, however, that lessons have been learned from the cost runs that have hit Eurotunnel, and that the construction risks involved in building a railway are in any case far fewer. The flotation plan emerged yesterday as the Department of Transport opened discussions with the private sector about ways of involving private capital in building the link. The project cannot be funded entirely by the private sector because it is not sufficiently profitable. The department has therefore sent out a consultation paper to banks, construction companies and other institutions looking atthe options for funding the project jointly. One option explored in the paper is that the government could say what contribution it was prepared to make and then let private sector companies compete to take the project over at an early stage of the planning process, towards the end of this year. But an alternative plan explored in the paper is for the public sector to hold on to the project through the design and legislative phases until construction is ready to begin in September 1995, and then float the project on the stock market with a government grant big enough to turn it into profit. A possible vehicle for the flotation would be Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary in charge of the project. More franchises for BR sell-off, Page 13</p>

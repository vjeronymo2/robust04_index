			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Bosnia Serbs pressed over peace plan: Nato and CIS defence ministers issue joint call on Vance-Owen proposals DEFENCE ministers of Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday urged Bosnian Serbs to sign an international peace plan to end the war in Bosnia, and the US said it might send troops to enforce the agreement. While the Croats and Moslems have signed the plan, drawn up by mediators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the Bosnian Serbs have so far refused to do so. 'We call upon the Bosnian Serb leadership to agree to the peace plan,' defence ministers from Nato, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union said after their meeting in Brussels. The Atlantic alliance is planning to send at least 50,000 troops to enforce the agreement, but only when all parties have signed. Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian defence minister, said the figure would probably be around 75,000 but that no country had so far committed forces to take part. Mr William Perry, US deputy secretary of defence, told the meeting that Washington might commit ground forces to help make up the total but did not say how many. 'Nato should play an important role and the US stands ready to make a substantial contribution, possibly including ground forces,' he said. 'Contributions from our eastern partners to an implementation force would be welcome.' Meanwhile, about 2,140 sick and wounded women, children and elderly were yesterday evacuated from Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, by UN relief workers. The Moslem evacuees, crowded into 19 lorries, waited in the northern village of Caparde to cross Serb lines to Tuzla. At least 45 people in the convoy were critically wounded and all the remaining were afflicted with scabies and body lice, said Ms Lyndall Sachs, of the office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Diplomats, who believe Srebrenica is the most vulnerable of the few remaining enclaves in eastern Bosnia, say that despite US air drops the situation there is still 'very grave'. Nonetheless, the Bosnian Serb government yesterday protested to the UNHCR over the use of German military aircraft to drop relief supplies over eastern Bosnia. Germany sent its first cargo aircraft to join the US-led air drop mission on Sunday night. The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency quoted the protest note as saying that this violated an agreement between the Bosnian Serbs, the UN and the US under which Germany would be excluded from the operation 'owing to deep-rooted historical reasons'. Bad weather appeared to favour a ceasefire which came into effect on Sunday. It was agreed between UN and Serb commanders and later endorsed by Moslem and Croat leaders. In Zagreb, the Croatian government resigned, against a background of increasing economic deprivation. Mr Nikica Valentic, head of Ina, Croatia's state-owned oil company, was named as prime minister to succeed Mr Hrvoje Sarinic. The republic's economy has been hard hit by the war and the influx of some 700,000 refugees.</p>

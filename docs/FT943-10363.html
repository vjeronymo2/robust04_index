			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: MMM fall-out Optimists would see the collapse of the Russian investment fund, MMM, as something of a landmark. Russia is now enough of a market economy to have an old-fashioned financial scandal. As the British government's move to wind up similar companies in the UK confirms, get-rich-quick schemes find many takers in the west. In Russia, however, the stakes are a lot higher. Yesterday's raid on the head of MMM was the most aggressive move yet by the Russian authorities against the large investment fund, which has teetered on the brink of bankruptcy for the past 10 days. The Russian prime minister last week stated that there would be no bail-out for MMM's investors in the event of a collapse, but tighter financial sector regulation is being considered. Inexperienced investors everywhere have to learn that prices can go down as well as up. If the Russians who gambled money on the strength of MMM's boastful advertising are not compensated by the government, it will send an important message that people should demand more information about a company's activities before risking their money. Just now, however, this is very hard for an individual Russian to do, without access to informed insiders. Only a small proportion of privatised companies is listed on the official stock exchange and, for most companies, disclosure requirements are very selectively observed. Actually trading shares is made arduous by the fact that shareholder registration generally occurs at the company level, so investors often have to travel to the company headquarters to establish proof of share ownership. It will doubtless take years for reasonably transparent and effective securities markets to develop in Russia. In the meantime, companies, like MMM, that simply sell shares over the counter at proprietary branches might continue to attract investors who cannot otherwise play the system. The threat of an anti-reform backlash in reaction to this and similar scandals means the government could feel forced to impose much stricter legal controls. A vigorous regulatory response would carry two dangers. The first is that the market might become over-regulated, without the fluidity which it needs for domestic and foreign capital to reach the companies that must be restructured. But the second, more likely, outcome is that more laws would be passed which have no chance of being enforced. This would further debase the commodity which is currently scarcest in Russia: the rule of law. The fact that MMM was able to last this long, while violating a number of existing tax and advertising codes, only shows how weak the hold of the authorities has become. The best course for Russia's reformers is to foster the growing constituency which sees the benefits of an orderly market, and not cede to a backlash against disorderly ones.</p>

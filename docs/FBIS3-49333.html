Our correspondent Renata Havranova, editor of the daily  PRACE, sent us this report:    [Begin Havranova recording] While Madeleine Albright talked  to Slovak President Kovac, Gen. Shalikashvili held talks with  Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Both representatives  of the U.S. side later, at a brief news conference, expressed  their great satisfaction with the course of all meetings with  Slovak representatives. In their opinion, it is evident from  these meetings that Slovakia can become the first country of  Central Europe to sign the U.S.-proposed Partnership for Peace  plan. Gen. Shalikashvili added that Slovakia had understood the  U.S. intention to aid the stability and security of Europe by  this plan without creating new dividing lines.    President Kovac replied to a question asking if he presented  his recently published counter proposal to the U.S. guests by  saying that he never had any counter proposal. On the contrary,  he appreciates that the central motive of the Brussels summit  will be a decision to build a qualitatively new relationship  between NATO and other countries of Europe. The U.S. endeavor to  support the security of our continent as a whole is, according  to Kovac, self-evident. The Partnership for Peace plan is a  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and also an instrument for  Slovakia and other countries to draw closer to NATO. It is also  an opportunity to expand the security and stability zone further  east, the president said. Kovac went on to say that the Slovak  Republic wanted to become an active participant in the  Partnership for Peace plan. However, Slovakia expects that the  acceptance of the other side, irrespective of its form, will  also constitute a definitive decision about the geopolitical  incorporation of the Slovak Republic into the NATO sphere of  interests.    According to Kovac, through Partnership for Peace, the  Slovak  Republic has conclusively claimed its allegiance to Western  states. [end recording]</p>

Which grouping would be willing to  support Lech Walesa in next year's presidential elections? The  conflicts with the government (over Rosati) and the National  Council of Radio and Television (over Solorz), in which Lech  Walesa has recently taken part, and the coming presidential  campaign were an occasion for politicians to specify their  attitudes toward the present head of state.    Walesa can no longer count on support from the Solidarity  ["S"] camp, unless we include the Non-Party Bloc in Support of  Reforms [BBWR] in it. Even though he has not yet formally  confirmed that he wants to run in the 1995 elections, he is the  official candidate of the BBWR. The bloc has so far been...  <H5>  Unconditionally Loyal </H5>   ...to the president. Incidentally, the bloc's voters include  the greatest number of people who approve of the way in which  the president is now fulfilling his duties. However, it is  really difficult to say today to what degree Walesa himself  believes in the possibility of transforming the BBWR into a  nationwide movement supporting him.    The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has a fairly positive  attitude  toward the president. In the conflict over Dariusz Rosati, the  PSL is trying not to take an unequivocal stand on the issue.  Even though Prime Minister Pawlak has maintained Rosati's  candidacy, he did that through Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. None of the PSL leaders  officially backed Dariusz Rosati, which gave rise to suspicions  that Pawlak was playing a double game: He was said "not to  discourage" Walesa from rejecting the SLD candidate. The  possibility cannot be ruled out that some PSL leaders think it  would be a good idea to remove the SLD from the government and  to establish a minority PSL government that would be supported  by the president. However, extension of the cooperation between  the PSL and the Belweder to next year's elections seems rather  unlikely. It is difficult to suppose that Waldemar Pawlak will  not want to take advantage of the period of his premiership and  will not run in the presidential elections against Lech Walesa.  It should be added here, however, that the president is very...  <H5>  Popular Among PSL Voters </H5>   In line with the research carried out by the Sopot Public  Opinion Research Institute [PBS], as many as 46 percent of rural  area inhabitants declare support for him.    So far, the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN]  has  not demonstrated its reluctance toward the president. KPN  deputies backed (along with the Democratic Union--UD--and the  BBWR) the presidential bill on the procedures of passing the  Constitution; they also do not conceal the fact that their, just  like Lech Walesa's, greatest enemy is the SLD. They would be  ready to take part in establishing a new government under the  patronage of the president.    UD wants to take a position above the dispute between Walesa  and the SLD. As it often happens in this grouping, one  unequivocal stand has not been specified; it is known, though,  that UD is rather on the side of the SLD, whose finance minister  would probably be inclined to continue the policy of economic  reforms carried out so far.    However, neither UD (rather dissatisfied with recent  decisions made by Walesa) nor the KPN (approving of the  activities of the current president) will decide to support  Walesa in the elections. UD and KPN leaders have presidential  ambitions themselves. Leszek Moczulski even stated officially  that, in 1995, he would run for the Belweder.    Lech Walesa, who frequently refers to traditional values and  calls himself a man of the right wing, cannot count on support  from a party that is so definitely leftist as the Labor Union  [UP]. Even though we may suspect that Ryszard Bugaj's party  would not accept some proposals made by Dariusz Rosati (lowering  taxes, for instance), in the prestige dispute between Aleksander  Kwasniewski and Lech Walesa it would side with the former.  Artur Smolko, one of the UP leaders, even called Walesa "a  president of destabilization." Also, one cannot rule out the  possibility that, in the coming elections, UP will field its own  candidate--for example, Aleksander Malachowski.    An entirely open war is being waged between Lech Walesa and  the SLD; some observers believe that this is...  <H5>  The Initial Stage of the Presidential Campaign </H5>   ...in which the most dangerous counter-candidate of the  present head of state may be Aleksander Kwasniewski. Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic does not intend to be grateful  to Walesa for "strengthening the left pillar" for a long time;  it is more likely to remember his "Solidarity" past and his  fighting against the SLD in the present government.    The extraparliamentary right (which the president called  "screwups") does not intend to back Walesa even in a situation  where his opponents are postcommunists. Both the members of  Jaroslaw Kaczynski's bloc and the members of the alliance in  which Aleksander Hall participates consider Walesa's activities  to be punishable and likely to cause destabilization in the  country. However, according to the PBS, the voters of the  "Fatherland" belong to those who support the way Walesa is  wielding power.    The issue of the future connections between "S" and its  former chairman is also not clear yet. "S" voters often do not  have a clear-cut opinion about the president. The president,  however, has recently been leaning toward "S": Through Lech  Falandysz, he implied that it was especially for his former  union that he had proposed "the civic constitutional  initiative." It is possible that the president, who has  rejected the free-market-oriented Rosati and who may veto the  "continuation budget," wants to regain popularity among radical  union leaders and...  <H5>  Stand at the Lead of the Mass of People </H5>   ...marching toward the seat of the government. No one knows  to what degree the anticommunist "S" will believe in the  sincerity of Lech Walesa, who is announcing file-checking and  decommunization; nonetheless, it is one of the few forces that  might launch a fairly effective campaign supporting the  president in the elections.    Whether or not any of the political groupings will cooperate  with Lech Walesa depends to a considerable degree on reshuffles  in the president's closest entourage. When the election  campaign starts, the Chancellory of the head of the state is  bound to become a clear political center, which may mean that it  will gain a party character. It is no secret that, in order to  win the support of one the parties, such as a large part of the  right wing or UD, the president would have to abandon the  services of some of his aides, such as Minister Mieczyslaw  Wachowski.    The Public Opinion Research Center asked its respondents  about who would make the best president. In line with the data  published in February, 17 percent of the respondents believe  that the best president would be Kwasniewski. Walesa came  fourth, with 9 percent, after Waldemar Pawlak and Krzysztof  Skubiszewski (both 11 percent).    Walesa's supporters are largely young people with elementary  and secondary-school educations, peasants and white-collar and  blue-collar workers, people with low salaries who evaluate their  material situation as average or good. They are believers and  church-goers, not very interested in politics. Asked about their  political views, they say they support the right wing or answer:  "It is hard to tell.</p>

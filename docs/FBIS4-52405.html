			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "What Is the War Commotion </F> Aimed At?"]    [Text] From 9 May, the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique  once again launched another large-scale war exercise for the  first half of this year called the joint strategic exercise  through the puppet's army, navy, and air force.    In an announcement by the puppets, the provocative war  exercise -- which is being held through a three-dimensional  military operation on the ground, air, and sea with an exercise  to prepare for action, a biological and radiological warfare  exercise, the transfer of military forces and equipment, and the  exercise of taking off and landing on an emergency airstrip in  the northern area of Kyonggi Province near the Military  Demarcation Line, in South Kyongsang Province, and on the West  Sea of South Korea -- will continue until 14 May.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is babbling about someone's  nonexistent surprise attack and has once again started to play  with fire. This once again reveals their bellicose nature of  clinging only to the road of confrontation and war.    Someone's surprise attack which the puppets are babbling  about, is a [word indistinct] of threat to invade the South  which has not been carried out before. This is nothing but a  sophistry to justify the criminal character of the war exercise  which they are carrying out.    A very grave situation is being created at this time on the  Korean peninsula because of the reckless war commotion by the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. As everyone  knows, under the groundless excuse of the so-called development  of nuclear weapons, the U.S. imperialists ruptured the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks. They indiscriminately made bellicose  absurd remarks by saying that they will not decline to carry out  a war, and are concentrating aggressive forces into South Korea  and its neighboring area on a large scale .    The offensive helicopter, the Apache, and the new-type  missile, the Patriot, were dragged in by the U.S. imperialists.  They are trying to newly deploy military equipment including  tanks, howitzers, and a vehicle that can fire successive  rockets, into South Korea.    Recently, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea  and held secret talks on war, examined preparations for a war,  and babbled about resuming the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise.  Along with this, the puppet clique made an order to all of the  puppet forces to be on 24 hour alert, and are all the more  kicking up a war frenzy.    As shown by facts, there are only threats of northward  invasion on the Korean peninsula. Despite this, the Kim  Yong-sam clique is now conducting a joint tactical exercise of  the puppet army, navy, and air force. This war exercise is  aimed at making every preparation for assuming an adventurous  offensive position to invade the North and at aggravating  tensions.    The Kim Yong-sam group also pursues the hidden purpose to  overcome the serious power crisis [simgakhan tongchi wigi] by  carrying out this war exercise.    As everyone knows, there are loud voices in South Korea  protesting the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group that is running  toward the road of fascism, nation-selling, confrontation, and  war. In particular, with great indignation with the opening of  the rice and weapon markets to the U.S. masters, South Korean  people, youth, and students hold demonstrations and meetings  every day under the slogan "Down With Kim Yong-sam."    Youth and students are also intensifying the antiwar and  antigovernment struggle with the violent death of student Chang  Tok-su who was forced to join a war exercise as a momentum, and  the puppets have been driven into a corner. Thus, the Kim  Yong-sam group tries to turn people's attention, to overcome the  worsened power crisis, and to justify its confrontation and war  policy by conducting the large-scale war exercise.    This is well proved by the fact that many homeland reserve  troops have been mobilized in this war exercise. The war  commotion, however, is nothing more than a desperate struggle  [majimak parak] by those who have no future.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime that has been abandoned by  the  people as it turned its back on the nation cannot last long.  The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to seek a breakthrough by  stirring up a worthless war commotion. However, the war  commotion will rather face greater protest and opposition from  the South Korean people and will only result in hastening its  ruin.</p>

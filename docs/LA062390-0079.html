			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONGSHOREMEN'S JOB LOTTERY DRAWS LONG LINE OF HOPEFUL WOMEN  </P> <P> About 400 would-be female dockworkers gathered Friday at the longshoremen's  union hall in Wilmington, a place where Lady Luck traditionally has not been  much of a sister to women.  </P> <P> It's a place where the brawniest men will tell you, in whispers, that your best  chance at landing a job is to have a father or brother or uncle already working  the docks.  </P> <P> To try and change all that, and satisfy the settlement terms of a decade-old  sex discrimination lawsuit, a drawing was held for 350 $14-an-hour dockworker  jobs Friday at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union Hall,  Local 13. The one-hour lottery, conducted by the ILWU and Pacific Maritime  Assn., will assure that more women will be working part-time on the docks, as  longshoremen or clerks, by September.  </P> <P> In all, 5,778 women submitted application cards for the jobs, and 700 names  were called, enough to make sure 350 women will be hired. When that happens,  35% of the part-time dockworkers in the nation's busiest harbor will be women.  And they, like other part-timers, will be positioned to become full-time  dockworkers, whose pay now averages $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> Although they did not have to be present for the drawing, several hundred women  showed up.  </P> <P> "I'm a wannabe," said Heather McDonald, 37, a onetime cabbie from Torrance who  came wearing a Teamsters Union jacket. Now working as a welder at the Long  Beach Naval Shipyard, McDonald signed up for the drawing as a hedge against  unemployment.  </P> <P> "I'm making the same money now. But with Bush cutting back on the defense  budget, we've had cuts at the yards. And I want to stay employed," she said.  </P> <P> McDonald, like most of the women at the drawing, did not get called.  </P> <P> But Tanya Heard and Pamela Clark beat the odds. The sisters from Gardena were  among those called. Now, they'll wait to be screened with physicals, strength  and agility tests, and drug and alcohol testing.  </P> <P> "As long as you can write, they say you can pass," said Heard, 27.  </P> <P> While the sisters first considered working on the docks only a few weeks ago,  many women at the drawing have coveted the jobs for a long time.  </P> <P> "I've had my application in for a while," said Dana Rolland, a 23-year-old  hairdresser from Wilmington whose mother, May, has been a dockworker for eight  years.  </P> <P> At 5-foot-3 and 100 pounds, Rolland hardly looks the part of a dockworker. But  it is a job she not only wants but believes she deserves.  </P> <P> "I feel family should get the jobs first," she said. "Everyone should have  equal opportunities, but there should be some sort of seniority for family."  </P> <P> That sentiment has prevailed for decades among many longshoremen and their  families. But in 1982, the courts stepped in with a landmark decision opening  the docks to more women.  </P> <P> During the drawing, catcalls greeted some names as they were called out --  names that some thought were too familiar, too close to those of current  dockworkers, to be a coincidence.  </P> <P> But Carrie Clements, assistant area manager for the maritime association,  bristled after the drawing at the notion that anyone would raise suspicions.  </P> <P> "I don't know what else we could do," Clements said, noting the drawing was  open to the public, conducted by an outside arbitrator and videotaped. "It's  about as fair as you can get," she said.  </P> <P> Fairness aside, the drawing itself irked a few longshoremen, who saw it as  nothing but a handout for women.  </P> <P> "It's ridiculous," said Roberto Diaz, a longshoreman the last 10 years. "Who's  got more rights, men or women?" Diaz asked. "For me, it's men."  </P> <P> Not all longshoremen were upset.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me at all," said Jesse Smith, a bearish 39-year-old who has  worked on the docks for 21 years. "There are some women who are excellent  workers.  </P> <P> "Of course, they don't compare to me," said Smith, 6-foot-3 and 326 pounds.  "But a lot of men can't compare with me either."  </P></p>

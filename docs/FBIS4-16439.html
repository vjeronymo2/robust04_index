			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In the break between budget discussions, the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader decided to tell the  media about his visit to Strasbourg as part of the Russian  parliamentary delegation. In [Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy's words,  it was difficult to work there because the French authorities  limited his itinerary to three points: Charles de Gaulle  airport, Strasbourg airport, and the city of Strasbourg.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] They could have just shown me  the toilet and told me where to piss, and where I should eat,  and where I should sleep. That is all that remained to be  shown. Otherwise, I might use the wrong toilet. [end recording]    Another example of Western inhospitality was the fact that  the French do not speak Russian, which Zhirinovskiy considers  essential even a long way from Russia.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] It is only us Russians that  mostly have to talk to them in their own languages. I spoke  French, but I preferred to talk to them in Russian. All the  more so because you cannot swear in another language. When they  really made me angry, I found it easier to speak Russian,  because you just cannot say it in French -- especially when  those Jews attacked me at the consulate. Well, what can you say  in French? All the words are so soft and nice. [end recording]    Zhirinovskiy said at the news conference that Russia should  under no circumstances join the Council of Europe, which wants  to make war on us using our own money.

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Tip the wink, hats are back - Stella Shamoon meets a hatter who sees brighter times ahead HATS, according to Richard Stephenson, top hatter at James Lock in London's St James's, are back in fashion with the young - well, the younger, at least. 'The average age of our customers has dropped in the last ten years from the middle 50s to 60s to late 40s, and it is still falling,' says Stephenson, who has spent almost 40 years in the family-controlled business. Lock, founded in 1676, has long been renowned as the supplier of essential headgear for riding, hunting, shooting and fishing to the likes of Prince Phillip and the landed gentry. 'We also now have more customers associated with young people: rock star Eric Clapton has been in twice - first for felt hats for himself, then back again with a friend for felt hats to send to the US. Paul McCartney is a fan, so is his wife Linda, and Ringo Starr is also a customer,' says Stephenson 'Fashion in hats is cyclical. The generation whose fathers wore hats were the 1960s rebels who said 'If Dad wears one that's not for me, that's old hat' - if you'll pardon the pun. Now there are few long-haired men around. Young men are conservative with a small c, rather dandyish, and like to dress formally and to wear the right thing  - that's good for business.' Show business, too, is good for Lock's trade. Apart from the ageing Beatles' penchant for rabbit fur felt hats and fine tweeds with which to cover their greying mop-tops, films such as Bugsy, starring Warren Beatty, and other period epics - Brideshead Revisited and Chariots of Fire for example - inspired a cult in hats among younger men. Lock has occupied the same period Grade II freehold site since 1764 and the shop has hardly altered since Lord Nelson drew up there in a carriage to buy the hat he was wearing when felled during the battle of Trafalgar. 'We were upset that our shop was only Grade II until we discovered that Grade I was reserved for buildings such as Buckingham Palace and Blenheim.' Lock's traditional customer base is 95 per cent male and heavily weighted towards the county set and what Stephenson delicately dubs 'the new gentry,' embracing show business personalities and style-conscious foreigners - notably Milanese, New Yorkers and Parisians whose purchases of quintessentially English headgear accounts for 55 per cent of Lock's annual sales. Turnover was Pounds 900,000 last year and Stephenson is targetting Pounds 1m this year. He is keeping profits under his hat, as it were, but makes no secret of the fact that in common with other West End purveyors of luxury goods, Lock's mark-up on cost is 100 per cent. There are ten full time employees at the shop, including himself and the export director. The annual salary bill runs between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000, with advertising of Pounds 16,000 a year on top. The shop is worth up to Pounds 1m, with extra space to requirements rented out at some Pounds 14,000 a year. Meanwhile, the brand's value is inestimable. The business is owned equally by the Stephensons and another family, the Macdonalds. There are two brothers from each family on the board together with the export director, Michael Sydney. So far none has made a fortune from Lock but it affords a decent, gentle living with the promise of riches one day, once the full potential of its brand is unlocked. Stephenson has his eye on the women - and the military. There has been a conscious effort to attract more stylish women into the shop with 'millinery' as opposed to essential headgear. Lock's sales to women are a big growth sector of the business. There is no formal design team. Stephenson and Michael Sydney 'do our bit in putting together new thoughts.' The result is there have been more new styles in Lock's shop in the past five years than in the last 25. Prices run at some Pounds 180 for ready-made felt hats - a custom-made one would hardly cost more at about Pounds 195 - to nearly Pounds 300 for a custom-made riding cap. Hand-made silk top hats are Pounds 225. Virtually all Lock's stock, which is made by trusted specialists to Lock's specification, is hand finished. Meanwhile, there are constant requests for a 'complete overhaul' of existing hats at Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 a time. If menswear is in the vanguard of recession, then hats come top in terms of non-essential purchases in most people's books. But, confides the jovial, cigar-puffing Stephenson: 'Our export side has been doing well, particularly in Europe, even when the pound was stronger. We plan to build on that.' Stephenson's well-kept secret is a pretty young milliner called Rachel Trevor-Morgan who is Lock's tenant and happens to produce delectable, dressy little hand-made hats. Trevor-Morgan's confections are now displayed incongruously among Lock's tweedy sensible styles for women. Trevor-Morgan, who has had her own business for two and a half years after training with Graham Smith and Phillip Somerville, says: 'It is boom time for the hat industry. There are a lot more young designers coming into the business, which was greatly boosted by Princess Diana and the panache with which she wears her hats. Younger women are wearing hats - not just as grand occasion accessories, but for dramatic emphasis to their faces and outfits.' Trevor-Morgan's hottest number this season is the tall crowned riding hat (strictly NOT for riding in) at about Pounds 200. Her crunchy straws, raffia-like in texture, go for Pounds 220.</p>

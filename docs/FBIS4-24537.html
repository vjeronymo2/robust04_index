			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Government Creates Body To Control Land </F> Deals"]    [Text] The government has created a land valuers body to  regulate land prices and deals across the country.    The China Real Estate Appraisers' Association (CREAA) was  set  up yesterday in Beijing to bring together professionals and  control the country's fledgling land and real estate trade.    Government regulations governing the land have been flouted  recently, with many State-owned plots being sold at a discount.    The State has had to bear these costs, complained the State  Land Administration (SLA).    "Such problems cannot be solved completely by the government  only, but have to be settled by relying on the co-ordination of  qualified professionals," said Zou Yuchuan, top SLA official.    CREAA chairman, Wang Xianjin pledged that, with government  support, his association "will evaluate land to be sold on  market independently by using regulated professional methods  that are in line with international practices today."    "Not only will CREAA evaluate urban land on the market  according to the relevant regulations and laws, it will also  introduce fair and practical evaluation methods that have proved  successful in other parts of the world." Evaluation will be  supervised by the SLA, Wang said.    More than 1,000 professional land appraisers from across the  country, including top valuers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao,  have already joined the newly-established association, according  to former SLA director Wang.    The setting up of the CREAA represents a major government  move to control the State-owned urban land market and stamp out  the illegal land deals and speculation, which led to the real  estate profiteering of the last two years.</p>

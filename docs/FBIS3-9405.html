The joint exercises of 120 members of the Chrudim  rapid-deployment battalion of the Czech Republic Army and 32  Dutch marines are based on the closest possible contact and  mutual exchange of information. In addition to shooting  practice, a part of the exercises consists of tactical drills in  the siege of areas occupied by terrorist units. Spikerman von  Weezelenburg, commander of the Dutch marines, is currently on an  inspection visit of the exercises. "It is the first specific  action stemming from the Partnership for Peace plan," Major Ales  Vodehnal, commander of the exercises, told CESKY DENIK. He  added that, despite the Dutch being a professional unit with a  high standard of training, they consider the Czech submachine  guns, for instance, to be of better quality than their own.</p>

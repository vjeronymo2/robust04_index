The visit of the  Vietnamese foreign minister is to prepare for the official visit  by H.E. Vo Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister, planned for next  month at the behest of the two Cambodian prime ministers.    During the one-hour meeting, Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen welcomed and highly appreciated  the talks between Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, minister of  foreign affairs and international cooperation, with H.E. Nguyen  Manh Cam, concerning bilateral cooperation in economics, trade,  science and technology, culture, and tourism. The two sides  agreed on peaceful coexistence and improving cooperation and  good relations as neighboring countries in order to create peace  and stability in the region.    Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen  affirmed the government position on the issue of the border with  Vietnam, saying that this should be resolved peacefully through  mutual understanding and based on legal principles.    Concerning the issue of Vietnamese residents living in  Cambodia and some who have returned to live along the border,  the two Cambodian prime ministers specified that a solution will  be found which is acceptable to national and international  circles.    The two prime ministers stressed the difficulty involved in  Cambodia's immigration law, soon to be promulgated, to ensure  residence in Cambodia by immigrants because this matter is  related to security problems caused by the Khmer Rouge group.  In the past, Vietnamese immigrants had been the target of Khmer  Rouge attacks.    Concerning the Mekong River, the two prime ministers and the  Vietnamese foreign minister will find a common solution to  continue and facilitate navigation through Vietnam and Cambodia  without hindrance. An appeal was made to Laos to cooperate in  ensuring the Mekong's suitability for serving the economic  progress of each country and to avoid harming the environment.    Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen  expressed their joy and told the Vietnamese foreign minister  that the Cambodian Government is happy with the end of U.S.  economic sanctions against Vietnam.</p>

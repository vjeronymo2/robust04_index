			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Stock payout hits Time Warner TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday showed a solid advance in its second-quarter operating earnings, but incurred a Dollars 147m loss after the payment of dividends on preferred stock. The stock was issued at the time of the 1989 merger of Time and Warner. The Dollars 147m after-dividend loss was down from a Dollars 179m deficit a year ago. The loss per share was reduced to Dollars 1.59 from Dollars 3.10 a year ago. Group revenues in the quarter rose 8.6 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars 3.1bn. The board declared a four-for-one common stock split and a quarterly dividend increased by 12 per cent. After the split, the company will have about 370m shares outstanding and the post-split dividend will be 28 cents a share annually or 7 cents per quarter. Time Warner's operating income before depreciation and amortisation was Dollars 612m, against Dollars 551m a year ago. The strongest divisional performers were the cable business, with a record Dollars 244m against Dollars 220m last time, and music, which earned Dollars 126m, against Dollars 116m a year ago. The group's Hollywood studio also turned in a record Dollars 101m operating profit, up from Dollars 85m. This was attributable to heavy box office receipts from films such a Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon III. Advertising and circulation gains at Time and People magazines helped the publishing division to earn Dollars 88m, compared with Dollars 79m a year ago. The Home Box Office cable programming business made Dollars 53m, up slightly from Dollars 51m in the same period of 1991. Time Warner said its net income for the second quarter was Dollars 9m, compared with a Dollars 32m loss in the second quarter of last year. Some analysts, however, say this is a misleading figure because the group's real bottom line is its performance after dividend payments. On Wall Street, the Time Warner share price was down by 1 3/8 at Dollars 116 1/4 . McGraw-Hill, the media group that owns Business Week magazine, disclosed a 10.7 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 38.6m. Earnings per share were 79 cents against 71 cents a year ago. Revenues for the three months to June 30 grew 6 per cent to Dollars 484.3m.</p>

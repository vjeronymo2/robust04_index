			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HEART ATTACK KILLED ROBIN HARRIS  </P> <P> The Cook County Medical Examiner's office has rule that a heart attack killed  comedian-actor Robin Harris, who was found dead in his hotel room after a  performance last month. Autopsy results were inconclusive and officials waited  for the results of toxicology tests before announcing the official cause of  death as natural, said Bill Juneau of the medical examiner's office.  </P> <P> Because of his age, investigators speculated that Harris, 36, a Chicago native  who spent most of his years in Los Angeles, suffered from a previously  undetected congenital heart disease, Juneau said.  </P> <P> The actor suffered the heart attack March 18 at the posh, downtown Four Seasons  Hotel after an evening performance at the New Regal Theater.  </P> <P> He had appeared in the movies "Do the Right Thing," "Harlem Nights," and most  recently, "House Party."  </P></p>

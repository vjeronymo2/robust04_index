			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan anticipates good reports from telecoms ANTICIPATION of upcoming results in Italy, and relief that the Russian political situation did not explode over the weekend took the Eurotrack 100 to a rise of more than 1 per cent, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN moved solidly forward in the second half of the day, led by strong demand for telecommunications issues and expressing the view that some of the recent corporate results had proved to be less painful than expected. The Comit index rose 6.81 to 593.32 as foreigners returned as buyers at the lower levels seen after Friday's decline. Sip, which reports today, added L140 or 4 per cent to L3,577 while Stet (due tomorrow) was L202 or 5 per cent higher at L4,258. Fiat, also due with results today, advanced L188 to L5,836; Rinascente, its retail subsidiary, added L308 to L32,532 and Toro, the insurer, was marked L1,480 higher to L32,532 amid renewed speculation about Fiat asset sales. FRANKFURT virtually recovered Friday's losses, the DAX index rising 26.32 to 1,912.18 as some brokers covered short positions. Turnover rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.9bn. Above average gains came in Commerzbank, sensitive to Russian bad debt risks and up DM6.50 to DM310.80; in Daimler and Volkswagen, up by DM19 to DM751, and DM8.50 to DM367.50; and in Lufthansa, DM6.50 better at DM159. Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers said that he was not bullish of Daimler; but that the company's New York listing was imminent, it had the participation of major brokers, and there had been a flow of positive news items in addition to the losses reported on the US GAAP accounting basis in mid-month. He noted that VW, relative to the German market, had fallen by 15 per cent from its peak this year. Lufthansa rose again on the air pact signed between Germany and the US last week. Investment interest in PARIS began to recede slightly as soon as it became apparent that the authorities were not going to cut the intervention rate as had been hoped by some traders at the close of Friday's trading. The CAC-40 index finished up 16.01 at 2,108.61, but off the day's high of 2,117. There was some early speculative buying of interest rate sensitive stocks such as Eurotunnel, which closed up 80 centimes at FFr43.60 after FFr44.20. Michelin, too, shed morning gains as the shares ended FFr4.10 higher at FFr185.60, down from an intraday high of FFr188.50. Oil sector stocks made ground on the agreement by Opec members to set a ceiling on production levels: Elf Aquitaine rose FFr5.90 to FFr400.50 and Total FFr3.30 to FFr303.40. ZURICH moved swiftly ahead but profit-taking, as the SMI index approached 2,500, left shares below their best levels. The SMI finished 36.5 ahead at 2,482.4 after an intraday high of 2,496.8. Mr Beat Philipp at Bank Vontobel in Zurich said: 'We are seeing the blue chip stocks, which had been underperformers, being rediscovered.' Strong foreign and domestic demand had emerged for pharmaceuticals, food stocks and the banks as investors took the view that they were relatively cheap by international standards, he said. Roche certificiates added SFr60 to SFr5,360 after a day's high of SFr5,470 while registered shares in Ciba-Geigy added SFr10 to SFr688, after peaking at SFr705. Among banks, supported by hopes for lower interest rates, UBS added SFr24 to SFr1,208 and CS Holding was SFr55 higher at SFr2,920. Schindler was again in favour, rising SFr290 to SFr6,300 after last week's advances. AMSTERDAM traded moderately higher and the CBS Tendency index gained 0.5 to 124.3. Hoogovens, the steel group, fell Fl 1.40 to Fl 43.90 after announcing that it was to shed a total of 2,000 employees over the next three years. MADRID seemed to accept the premise that an austere budget would be good for equities, the general index closing 3.62 higher at 284.97. STOCKHOLM was lifted by good six month results from Procordia, the pharmaceuticals group, which put on SKr8 to SKr218 as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 12.30 to 1,291.50. OSLO was pushed higher by news from the Opec ministers meeting and the All Share index closed up 4.12 at 549.21. Norsk Hydro was among active stocks with a gain of NKr2.50 to NKr189.50. COPENHAGEN built on last Friday's cut in domestic interest rates, the KFX index rising by 1.21, or 1.3 per cent to 97.36. Carlsberg B outperformed the market with a gain of DKr6, or 2.4 per cent to DKr256. HELSINKI was firmer on a stable currency and lower bond yields, with the HEX general index closing up 1.1 per cent at 1,390.1. VIENNA remained firm helped by a rise in Steyr, the vehicle manufacturer, of Sch8 or 5 per cent to Sch169. The ATX index ended 13.14 higher at 956.41, although turnover was reported to have been low. ISTANBUL held above to the 15,000 level with active buying of the cement, petroleum and banking sectors. The composite index added 339.3 to 15,386, off the day's high of 15,472.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 27                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      11.30      12.00      13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1286.18    1288.30    1287.37    1289.27 FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1289.35    1290.90    1290.20    1290.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               14.00      15.00      16.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1356.29    1358.44    1358.59    1360.51 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1359.60    1360.66    1360.43    1361.41  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 24    Sep 23    Sep 22    Sep 21    Sep 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1274.95   1273.84   1271.99   1279.55   1278.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1346.86   1347.03   1346.05   1351.37   1351.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1291.29; 200 - 1361.71 Low/day: 100 - 1285.82  200 - 1356.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Kruglikov, first deputy chairman of </F> State Customs Committee, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent;  date and place not given: "Underwater Tariff Reefs"]    [Text] The anticipation of new customs duties at the  beginning of the year led to a buying frenzy in the Russian  market. In spite of the considerable rise in the cost of  imported goods, they did not remain on store shelves for long.  Can we expect more stringent import controls and a new round of  price increases this year? First Deputy Chairman Valeriy  Kruglikov of the State Customs Committee answered the questions  of a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to many domestic and Western  businessmen, the customs tariff system is one of the most  unstable sectors of the Russian economy. What is the reason for  this?    [Kruglikov] Customs tariffs have to be viewed from several  vantage points. Export duties are calculated, for example, with  a view to world prices and the cost of goods in the domestic  market. Whereas world prices are more or less constant, domestic  prices are always rising. The prices of some goods were  compounded dozens of times over the last year. For this reason,  if we were to set permanent export duties, we would be creating  a genuine pitfall that could stop all exports. That is why the  amounts were changed several times last year: New rates were set  twice, and the Customs Committee, the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the Ministry of Economics, and the Ministry  of Finance were authorized to review the rates whenever  necessary. This is only a temporary phenomenon, however. As we  know, there are no export duties in other countries. According  to the Law on Tariffs, we will not have them either after 1  January 1996.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Could higher import duties compensate  for  this reduction of revenue?    [Kruglikov] Imports are a different matter. We have gone  through several stages in our customs policy. At first, there  were no import duties in Russia for half a year. This was done  on the assumption that it would help us fill the Russian market  with foreign goods, but this was an abnormal situation. The  state has to conduct a protectionist policy to defend its own  producers and to regulate the excess income that might result  from differences between domestic and world prices.    Besides this, customs duties are one way of keeping Russia  from becoming an appendage of Europe. After all, goods which  cannot be sold in the developed countries are now being brought  here. Unless we have barriers to block these shipments, our  producers will be unprotected. This was the reason for the  decision to institute a single tariff for all types of goods--5  percent. Later it was raised to 15 percent, and after that we  began setting different rates for different types of goods. Last  year's import tariffs set a specific rate for each type of  commodity. Now we are working on a new draft. We expected it to  be approved by the beginning of the year, but we are still  working on it.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Judging by the draft, import tariffs  will  rise considerably. Is this the result of lobbying by Russian  industrial groups?    [Kruglikov] The tariff has to balance the interests of the  dealer, the producers of goods within the country, and the  state. Importers want to pay less. Producers want higher duties  so that they will not have any competition. The state has to  protect its own producers on the one hand while performing  purely fiscal functions on the other, supplementing its own  budget with customs duties. Some countries have been granted  most-favored-nation status, and the rate on their exports is  only half as high.    How can all of these interests be balanced? We suggested the  creation of a governmental customs tariff council, representing  all of these different parties in discussions of state policy in  this area, but our recommendation has not won any support yet.    Sectorial ministries and departments seem to be paying  closer  attention to the export tariff now. They have sensed its impact  on the state of the economy. Above all, this applies to  agriculture. Foreign competition sometimes precludes the sale of  domestic agricultural products, and this is also something the  Customs Committee has to consider.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] How closely do the tariffs you are  working on now correspond to the common standards of world  trade, and will they evoke objections from our trade partners?    [Kruglikov] As you know, Russia has applied for membership  in  the GATT. That is why we are taking all of the requirements of  that international organization into consideration, but it would  be inappropriate to compare our tariff rates to the present  rates in the European Community. The present situation in Russia  precludes the institution of universal rates that are acceptable  today and will still be acceptable six months from now. Our  tariff policy has to be flexible and has to be adjusted  periodically with a view to the state of the market, the supply  of goods, the interests of producers, and many other factors. If  the rate is to be raised, we will have to warn exporters in  advance, so that we will not upset their plans.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is no secret that the mechanism of  customs import and export declarations is still far from  perfect. What is the State Customs Committee doing to improve it?    [Kruglikov] Several important documents have been approved  or  are being drafted at this time. Much of the procedure for  declaring customs value has been borrowed from world practice.  After all, exporters frequently understate the value of their  goods, and the state incurs substantial losses as a result. We  also plan to institute an extremely compact system of currency  control. It will apply to exports of raw materials at first,  then to all exports, and then to imports as well. The latest  electronic equipment will be used in this process.    We plan to institute stricter declaration controls,  especially for goods subject to excise taxes. This is the most  difficult thing we have had to do thus far. Russia's borders are  still open. Unscrupulous importers are taking advantage of this  to ship goods subject to excise tax through the territory of the  CIS republics without paying any money to the treasury. That is  why we have to change the procedure for the declaration of goods  subject to excise taxes, including the rules of re-exports,  re-imports, and transit shipments.</p>

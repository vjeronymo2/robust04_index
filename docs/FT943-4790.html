			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Eurocurrency 'a realistic option': Lamfalussy offers optimistic assessment of EU economies Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, declared yesterday that EU member states had turned a corner and could realistically consider the prospect of a single European currency. Falling interest rates, low inflation, and close monetary co-ordination among EU central banks had substantially reduced currency instability, Mr Lamfalussy said. In one or two years, there could be some 'pleasant surprises' among countries aspiring to join the planned economic and monetary union. Mr Lamfalussy's upbeat remarks to the European economic and social committee in Brussels came ahead of weekend talks among EU finance ministers. Their meeting in Lindau, near Lake Constance, will discuss politically sensitive procedures for dealing with big national budget deficits, one of the most important tests for Emu membership. Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has signalled it is unhappy with the European Commission recommendation to exclude Ireland from the 'excessive deficits' rules. Luxembourg, the only country which meets Maastricht's deficit criteria, is also excluded. The Commission supports a generous interpretation of the debt rules because Ireland has in recent years held its annual budget deficit within the Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But Germany does not want to create a precedent that will make it easier for countries with bigger debt problems, such as Italy, to become full Emu members. The EU's secretive monetary committee, meeting in Brussels yesterday, was said to have approved Commission proposals for deficit reduction procedures by EU states other than Luxembourg and Ireland. Mr Lamfalussy steered clear of the controversy over proposals to create a 'hard core' of five nations committed to faster integration in the EU. The ruling Christian Democrat party and its CSU coalition partner proposed last week that the hard core should consist of France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. France, Germany and the Benelux are often viewed as the most likely nucleus of the planned monetary union. But Mr Lamfalussy stressed it was too soon to predict which EU members would be ready to form a union by 1997 or 1999, the two dates named in the treaty. Without mentioning Italy, Spain or the UK, the EMI president paid tribute to countries which seemed to have escaped 'the infernal cycle of inflation', even while allowing their currencies to depreciate during the monetary upheaval of 1992-93. This turbulence, which led to the widening of fluctuation bands in the European Monetary System in August 1992, appeared to be over, said Mr Lamfalussy. However, he insisted that the wider EMS bands should be preserved in order to defend currencies against speculative pressures. Tietmeyer warns on EU integration, Page 2</p>

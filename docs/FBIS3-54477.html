			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Normalization"] </F>   [Text] Ever since countries in the region began to talk  about normalizing relations with the Arab countries classified  as Kuwait's opposers due to their known stand toward the wicked  Iraqi aggression, Kuwait's stand began to fluctuate between a  categorical rejection and an ambiguous acceptance of such  normalization. It was finally decided to make normalization  conditional on a commitment to the UN Security Council  resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait. This was  considered an alternative to a public appology that necessarily  meant an admission of being a real participant in the Iraqi  crime of occupation. This was not the exact truth because these  countries only adopted passive roles which the Iraqi regime  utilized in order to serve its claims.    Some may say these countries' roles went beyond being just  passive to taking the form of politcial and media support for  the occupation crime. However, this was only the result of  their being surprised and deceived when they all made a legend  of Saddam Husayn. We all participated in portraying him as such,  and perhaps we were the first to glorify the guardian of the  Arab homeland's Eastern Gate who, in reality, was a monster in  our midst.    Now that talk about normalization has stopped, the  government  has failed to take a tangible step toward those countries that  responded to the Kuwaiti condition and unequivocally announced  they support international resolutions, Kuwait's right to  sovereignty, the return of prisoners, and the payment of  compensations. Here, we mean Yemen and Tunisia, who have  repeatedly recited the prayer of repentance after they started  to see clearly and became aware of the Iraqi monster and the  tragic effects the crime of occupation has had on the Arab  world. What else is needed to overcome estrangement and restore  normal relations?    We believe Kuwait is dutybound to extend its hand toward  Tunisia and Yemen and for us to clear our hearts of feelings of  blame in order to build, on the ruins of the past, a firm  foundation for strong ties that end estrangement and provide an  opportunity for interaction among Arab efforts to tighten the  siege on the rabid monster who is gritting his teeth in hatred.  We ought to admit that we were the first to be decieved and the  first to acclaim the "Arabs' knight". It is now time for us to  wake up from our daze and seek the right way to rebuild what the  wicked invasion had destroyed of the wall of our Arab relations.  The thicker the wall the less the danger of the monster lurking  behind the borders will be.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--The Centre for Development of  Telematics (C-DoT) has achieved a milestone by developing VSAT  (very small aperture terminals), a two-way satellite earth  station for providing connectivity without the encumberance of  telephone wires.    With the release of this technology, India will have an  indigenous capability for supporting transmission systems for  voice and data communications to supplement telecom networks.    The VSAT technology is being released to indigenous  manufacturers who are already producing C-DoT products.    Significantly, the C-DoT's breakthrough has come at a time  when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is about to  forego its monopoly on running VSAT services. The service, so  far called the remote area business messaging network (RABMN),  has aimed at providing data communication facility to  subscribers scattered throughout the country by using satellite  in VSATs provided at the subscribers' premises. In addition to  Hughes Network Systems, three other private sector operators  have been shortlisted. This is expected to bring about a boom in  sale of VSAT dishes.    The C-DoT-developed VSAT operate in the C-band frequency of  satellites for data and voice communication at 64 kilo bit per  second (kbps). The shortlisted private sector operators have  been asked to operate on extended C-band frequency of the  INSAT-2A satellite.    To begin with, the Department of Science and Technology is  going to use VSAT for linking various nodes in their network to  transmit weather data to the central supercomputer installed in  Delhi for inward and outward transmission to various centres.</p>

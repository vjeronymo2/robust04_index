			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar climbs in quiet trade THE dollar recovered some of the ground it lost overnight, as traders moved to cover their short positions in advance of today's employment figures. After opening weaker in London at DM1.5748, compared with a close of DM1.5880, the dollar recovered to close at DM1.5795. That trend was repeated in New York, where the dollar opened at DM1.5768/73, compared with a close of DM1.5803/10. By mid-day, it had firmed to DM1.5791/98. The weaker opening levels were attributed to bearish statements made by Bank of Japan governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, on the US economy. He warned that recovery in the US might be further away than many anticipated and might not even begin in the second half. To compound his statements, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, reiterated the need for tight monetary policy in Germany in a newspaper interview. Mr Schlesinger's comments only highlighted the interest rate differential between the US and Germany, which until this week had appeared to be narrowing. The exceptionally wide range of forecasts for the US employment figures continued to confuse the market, and created a sense of uncertainty as to the immediate prospect for the dollar. Forecasts for the numbers were as diverse as a 100,000 drop in non-farm payrolls and a rise of 140,000. The market median was focused on a rise of about 40,000, said Dr Mark Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank. However, the figures would be distorted by the seasonal adjustments of retail workers laid off after the Christmas period. Since retailers are believed to have taken on fewer workers than normal, the adjustments could seriously distort the figures, economists warned. 'The numbers will need careful dissection before you interpret them,' said Dr Austin. The factory orders figures published yesterday, which showed greater than expected declines for the month of December and the whole of 1991, had a largely neutral effect on the dollar, said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank. Within the exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to hold the lead. Trading was fairly quiet, however, with most attention focused on tomorrow's events in the US. Sterling hovered just above its ERM floor, although few in the market seemed to be as alarmed at the prospect as in the weeks around Christmas. The pound closed in London unchanged on the previous day's DM2.87. Sterling is not expected to draw much attention until next week's round of statistics, covering producer and retail price figures, money supply, bank lending unemployment and average earnings. The Spanish peseta weakened slightly against the German currency, from 62.95 per D-Mark to 62.99.</p>

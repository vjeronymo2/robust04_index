			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Electronics giants reach accord on digital VCR design A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between the world's leading consumer electronics companies. The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital Conference, is expected to avert a standards war of the kind that marred the introduction of analogue video recorders. Sony had led the way with its technically superior Betamax format but eventually - in what was an expensive failure - had to concede defeat to JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers to use its VHS standard. Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the companies, said in Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with compact discs'. Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs can be used to store computer data. The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality and make for cleaner tape copies. Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000. Digital VCRs have been used by professionals for some time, but until recently were too large for domestic use. The new machines will use tapes about two-thirds the size of a conventional VHS cassette with 4.5 hours recording time. Smaller versions will be possible. VCR manufacturers have been encouraged to agree a standard among themselves because the costs and risks of taking the wrong development path are increasing. Manufacturers feel they should be able to develop products safe in the knowledge that they will not be wrong-footed by the success of a competitor's technology. Consumers, equally, should be able to buy the new machines with the confidence that they will not be left with obsolescent products if another technology captures the market. The agreement covers standards for VCRs used with conventional televisions and for Japan's high-definition television system. The conference said standards for a future HDTV system now being developed in the US should be ready by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me in Pounds 38m purchase - French acquisition gives access to advanced technology Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, plans to pay Pounds 38m for a French company with technology which it believes will dominate the world market for self-service photography. KIS, based in Grenoble, has developed a booth which uses digital electronic technology. Customers can view themselves on a video screen and then freeze their favourite pose, receiving colour or black and white prints in a variety of formats. Photo-Me said the new generation of automatic booths offered significantly better picture quality than conventional booths, and more permanent pictures than those provided by Photo-Me's thermal electronic booths. Customers can also have their pictures taken with images of digitally-generated 'partners' such as film stars. A modem in each booth will notify a central computer about stock levels and breakdowns. 'The technology also offers the scope for substantial reductions in the capital costs of individual booths and the cost of consumables,' Photo-Me said. Prototypes of the new booth are currently undergoing field testing in France. Mr Dan David, chairman of Photo-Me, said: 'Whilst the immediate impact of the merger will be to dilute marginally earnings per share in the current financial year, we believe that the benefits of the transaction will begin to be felt in the following financial year.' Mr Serge Crasnianski, founder and chairman of KIS, is already a non-executive director of Photo-Me, and his company is one of the UK's company's biggest shareholders. Photo-Me yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.5m for the six months to October 31 on unchanged sales of Pounds 71.9m. It described the result as encouraging since the previous period's profits had been inflated by a Pounds 1.33m foreign exchange gain. The board saw some signs of recovery from the worldwide recession and believed that, subject to there being no material movement in exchange rates, trading performance in the second half of the current year would be satisfactory. 'Trading in the UK and US, in particular, is starting to edge ahead and the downturns in continental Europe and Japan appear to have reached their low points.' Earnings per share dipped to 10.7p (10.76p), but the interim dividend is lifted by 7.1 per cent to 1.5p (1.4p). COMMENT Photo-Me's shares rose by 5p to 310p as analysts welcomed a deal which appears to make sense. The technology acquired seems to have real potential, although buying a product before it is in mass production must involve some degree of risk. KIS reported only modest pre-tax profits of Pounds 600,000 on sales of Pounds 44m in 1992. However, Photo-Me is confident that - as a private company - profitability was not KIS's main concern, and this return can be improved. The deal certainly adds some interest to Photo-Me, which had seemed rather lacklustre, but it will be some time before the picture on possible rationalisation and operational savings becomes clear.</p>

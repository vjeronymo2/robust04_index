			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["ink"-signed report: "Good Sales Opportunities for German </F> Machine-Building Industry in China"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 6 March -- China [PRC] has developed  into a lucrative market for the German machine-building  industry. According to the German Machine-Building and  Plant-Construction Association, just under 40 percent of all  German exports to the People's Republic consists of machines.  In the first nine months of last year, machines and plant worth  approximately 3.2 billion German marks [DM] were exported to  China. Total German exports involved about DM6.4 billion.  According to the Association's estimates, exports in the  machine-building sector will reach DM3.5 billion for the whole  year.    In the past 15 years, the export of machines to China  increased constantly, with some fluctuations. Whereas the  export volume of German machines and plants to China was still  DM1 billion in 1980, it increased, after a slight fall, to DM2.4  billion in 1985 and to DM3.2 billion in 1986. The reservation  of German exporters was clearly noticeable in the three years  after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989,  when the volume dropped again to below DM2 billion. The  majority -- a quarter -- of German machines exported to this  East Asian country are textile machines, followed by machine  tools (18 percent), and packaging and food-processing machines  (8 percent).    Trade with China has changed fundamentally since the country  opened up. Whereas German exporters had to negotiate the  conditions of their deliveries to China with 10 to 12 foreign  trade offices at the end of the 1970's, when the Chinese  Government adopted the first cautious reform measures, it is now  possible to contact Chinese buyers directly. Step by step,  large and later medium-sized and small enterprises were granted  permission to negotiate directly with foreign partners. In  addition, the country relaxed its foreign exchange regulations  considerably and standardized the exchange rate on 1 January  this year. However, "this is unfavorable for Chinese  enterprises that import goods," stated Ruiquan Cheng, secretary  general of the "Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society," an  association of 4,000 machine-building enterprises and 17,000  engineers. After the standardization of the exchange rate, the  Chinese enterprises no longer enjoy the former privileges for  the exchange of Chinese renminbi against dollars or German  marks. However, the impact on the country's imports is still  unclear.    According to the secretary general, German enterprises are  still too little known and their presence is not sufficient in  the Chinese market. As far as machines and plants are  concerned, Japanese exporters accounted for 35 percent in 1992  (more recent data are not available). The Germans only supplied  17 percent of the Chinese imports in this sector. Still, German  enterprises are doing quite well in this area. Before the  United States, they were the second-largest supplier of machines  to the PRC.</p>

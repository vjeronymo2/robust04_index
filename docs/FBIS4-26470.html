			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Donald Last] </F>   [Text] The greenback is likely to plumb new depths against  the Japanese yen and, having broken through the pyschological  barrier of 100 yen, could fall to 90-95 in the the near future  say analysts and traders. Tuesday's break in the dollar to a  post-war low against the yen of 99.95 cast a chill in Tokyo. "I  thought 100 yen was the mother of all defensive positions" for  the dollar, Chris Calderwood, Barclays de Zoete Wedd's economist  in Tokyo, said. "If you cannot defend that, you cannot defend  anything."    Though global bond markets were steadier yesterday, the bond  and forex markets remain febrile. In the forex, the U.S. dollar  recovered to 100.80 against the yen and just above 1.60 German  marks. In the bond markets, the U.S. Treasury benchmark 30-year  bond firmed slightly and the yield fell from 7.50 per cent to  7.46 percent in Tokyo and European trading.    Markets were hoping for some signs from U.S. Federal Reserve  chairman, Alan Greenspan in his Humphrey Hawkins testimony  before Congress yesterday but he deliberately eschewed any  mention of the ailing dollar. He simply noted that further  increases in pressure on manufacturing capacity risked emerging  inflation. The U.S. factory operating rate is now 83 per cent,  not far from the 85 percent which many economists consider  inflationary.    Apart from the Bank of Japan selling yen against dollars  yesterday, the other central banks, and especially the U.S.  Federal Reserve, were conspicuous by their absence. This is in  strong contrast to early-May when they interevened to buy  dollars en masse. "Having gone to a new post-war low the foreign  exchange markets will now probe the downside to search out  central bank policy on interest rates and the dollar," Ian  McKinnon, Citibank's chief economist in London, said. The  central banks have said that a stronger yen is bad for world  trade because it threatens to prolong the Japanese recession and  "the markets want to see some heavy-duty intervention, some  action to support words", he said.    The dollar's fresh weakness against the yen has sparked  worries that the Federal Reserve may be forced into further rate  hikes which in turn would hit global bond and stockmarkets. "I  believe the Federal Reserve will use the next policymaking Open  Market Committee meeting July 5 to 6 to raise Fed funds another  quarter point and then up them again in August," said Mitsubishi  Finance International's head of research in London, Brendan  Brown, who estimates second quarter U.S. gross domestic product  is running at 4 to 5 percent annualised.    The coming Naples Summit (July 8-9) of the major  industrialised Group of Seven (G7) club would seem to call for  central bank actions to calm markets down, S G Warburg said in a  forex report. "It would be embarrassing to say the least for G7  leaders to welcome a global recovery with the dollar in free  fall and bond/stockmarkets melting." If no interest rate action  is taken by the Fed "the dollar can hardly be expected to  stabilise, let alone change course", Warburgs said.    Pressure will also be on the Bank of Japan to cut rates to  take the pressure off the yen and help preserve Japan's economic  recovery. Market participants believe the Bank of Japan will  have to cut its 1 and 3/4 percent discount rate if the yen hits  95 against the dollar.</p>

Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. This amendment increases the AD's effectivity to include additional&blank;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminates the option for repetitive inspections, and further reduces the cyclic life limits. This amendment is prompted by further investigation into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective January 6, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 6, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Service Manager, Spey engines, Rolls-Royce, plc, East Kilbride, Glasgow G74 4PY, Scotland. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Fisher, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7149, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority of the United Kingdom, notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. The CAA advised that they received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially outward from the bore on a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk installed in a R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14D engine. The crack originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Investigation indicated that failure of the engine due to disk burst was imminent. That condition, if not corrected, could result in a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that airworthiness directive (AD) action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. On October 20, 1988, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, which reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. On January 26, 1989, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which supersedes Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, and currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections of seventh stage HPC disks, further reduce the cyclic life limits, and require removing from service disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following the schedule established in this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter concurs with the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Both sides of car hire in Geneva Geneva's Cointrin airport is truly international. A small escalator tucked on the left just before Swiss passport control can whisk you to the airport's little-known French side. The canny business executive can take advantage of this by hiring a car on the French side for far less than in Switzerland. But, as in all things, there are problems. The theory is simple. Last month, Hertz's Europe on Wheels was offering prices of Pounds 196 for an eight-day hire of a Peugeot 106 on the French side, compared with Pounds 247 for a vehicle of the same class in Switzerland. Renting in France does take a little effort. You have to pass through Swiss immigration, pick up your luggage, nip back past passport control, take the escalator, walk past the French authorities and then down to the car hire desks. Instructions are provided on how to take the short road corridor to France and then back into Switzerland. The whole process takes about 20 minutes. One irritant is that Hertz's French cars do not have Swiss motorway tax disks. I recently got lost on the French side of the border and ended up on a Swiss motorway. I was then promptly forced by a humourless bureaucrat to acquire a SFr30 (Pounds 14.60) disk in order to drive less than 15km. The fact the disk lasted a year was little compensation, given the car would be handed back to Hertz 20 minutes later. Travellers need to check the rates on each side of the airport from month to month. The latest figures offered by Hertz on its Europe on Wheels scheme is Pounds 192 for France and Pounds 210 in Switzerland. But this excludes the Swiss 8 per cent airport tax.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LITERARY QUILT OF FADED COLORS;  </P> <P> KEEP THE CHANGE BY THOMAS MCGUANE (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $17.95; 230 PP.;  0-395-48887-7)  </P> <P> The irrepressible Thomas McGuane strides forth once again, in this his 10th  book and seventh novel, to take on nothing less than the breadth and troubled  essence themselves of native life in end-of-the-century America. In the McGuane  mode, it's a book that seems to set out to do all things -- dazzle, satirize,  embrace, lament, and perhaps at end to salvage the pieces of a lesser world.  The work disappoints, though seeming itself, by the finish, to be less an  antidote to that world than another piece of it.  </P> <P> The literary energies of the indefatigable McGuane can put a reader in mind of  something like a many-colored quilt -- there's the outdoor flavor and manliness  of Hemingway over there, of course (and there, and there), here are some  swatches of the ribald and word-happy picaresques of J. P. Donleavy, others of  the anti-hero comics of Amis and the Angry Young Men; there's the bold and  nervy strain of the American satirists of class and commerce, from Sinclair  Lewis on down; and here's the poetic and telling observer of baffled small  lives in backwater places, the imager of quietly despairing Americana  descending from, say, Sherwood Anderson and the early regionalists.  </P> <P> These are noble antecedents, to a one, and their emergence in the uneven fabric  of McGuane's work -- now here, now there -- can result in moments of brief and  captivating, sometimes hilarious, brilliance. But the whole cloth that's woven  from them, the overall result, the book itself and the inner spirit of it --  these can be another matter. Not quite satire that's held at a level of  sustained effectiveness, not quite a non-satiric novel of felt experience, not  quite a successful blending of the two, "Keep the Change" reads instead, echo  of its own title, like disappointingly half-hearted work, tossed-together  leftovers, a project without the ability or inner conviction to find out what  it really is or what it's really for.  </P> <P> What feels empty and perfunctory at the heart of the book may be a result of  what's empty and perfunctory at the core (intentionally or not is another  question) of McGuane's chosen hero this time around. Born and reared on a  cattle ranch in Montana, Joe Starling Jr. is portrayed from the start as being  unsure whether or not he wants to inherit his birthright of open land. His  heavy-drinking father ranched it, went on to become a banker and then "an  agricultural executive," but nevertheless is presumed still to love the land,  and in the early pages of the book he counsels son Joe, in the sped-up tropes  of comic Western parody, not to "let that old s.o.b. Overstreet get it. He  tried to break me when I came into this country and he darn near got it done.  We get along okay now but his dream is to make his ranch a perfect square and  this is a big bite out of his southeast corner."  </P> <P> That Joe's father soon dies without having properly clarified Joe's title to  the ranch will provide later plot complications, but more centrally at issue is  Joe's attitude toward his would-be inheritance. "Joe loved the place but he  didn't expect or really want to end up on it altogether," we read. And,  considering the probable fact that the land "would one day be his," Joe  concludes this to be "not precisely a soaring thought. He really wondered how  he would put his heritage in play. He found the future eerie and he already  wanted to paint."  </P> <P> All could be well with the book if a reader were actually able to feel the  truth of either side of the double premise -- that Joe "loved the place" on the  one hand, and that he "wanted to paint" on the other. But both ideas, in spite  of McGuane's often desultory efforts to pull them into vitality, stubbornly  remain more like identifying labels on a string-operated figure than like inner  convictions deriving from a genuine psychological life. Given this limitation,  the author gains free license to move his character around at will: to send him  (after a summer of working -- and losing his virginity -- on the ranch) out  East, where he graduates from Yale, strives half successfully (so McGuane says,  but never shows) to become a serious painter, and ends up in Florida, and then  allows the author just as freely to send him fleeing again back to Montana on a  putatively spiritual quest to reclaim his heritage and roots.  </P> <P> It's as though, again and again, Joe were less a real character than a pre-made  and movable device to let McGuane write about whatever he might want to write  about: the jaded and decadent tackiness of Florida; the flamboyantly and yet  conventionally sexy Astrid, whom Joe hooks up with in Florida and stays  half-involved with throughout the book; the worn-out town of McGuane's  Deadrock, near the ranch; the sleazy and boundless opportunism of cheap  entrepreneur Ivan ("Man was meant to consume") Slater, ex-Yale classmate; or  the restaurant of the Yale Club in New York, where there's a hilarious moment  in a scene that is, as it happens, wholly extraneous narratively.  </P> <P> It's unarguably true that a novel could succeed perfectly well in this way --  as a purely linear comedy, aiming first for brightness and maybe not at all for  depth, exploiting a character who's primarily just a narrative convenience; but  McGuane's book struggles uneasily against the limits of just these traits,  leading the author, to telegraph to the reader again and again, as if in  nagging afterthoughts, the thematically deeper sides of what Joe is supposedly  thinking or feeling, as in banal and empty lines such as "Joe was maddened by  joy at being in the country of the West. He felt that he would find a restored  condition for his life here."  </P> <P> McGuane's eye is sharp and his quick aim often perfect, especially in small  things, as when Joe is on the road from Florida to Montana ("A radio preacher  shouted, 'Satan is playing hardball!' "), or when he notices in a tidy  residential part of Deadrock that "On most lawns, a tiny white newspaper lay  like a seed," or in describing the Dickensian figure of Joe's Uncle Smitty, a  shell-shocked alcoholic still living (or so he lets on) in the world of 1945 --  who himself makes a wily grab for the money tied up in the ranch.  </P> <P> But the book as a whole labors both for meaning and material: descends at one  moment to farce, appeals at the next to high melodrama; allows Joe for long  sections to forget important things like his (he thinks) illegitimate daughter,  then suddenly hyperbolizes their urgency and significance; at one moment  romanticizes the land and Joe's desire for it, at the next suggests that there  wasn't much certainty of will there anyhow, concluding with half wistful  toss-aways such as the one suggested when Astrid, who followed him to Montana,  turns away from Joe: "It had been lovely, anyway," he muses. "It was a  provisional life."  </P> <P> It may be, of course, that McGuane is a jump ahead of the reader, intending all  along, against odds, to make something, anything, out of half abandoned, worn,  or leftover material: to write, as part of the message, only a provisional  book. At one point, when they are still in Florida, Astrid asks Joe why it is  that he doesn't paint anymore. His answer is: "Paint what?" It's a question  that seems to speak to the whole of this often skilled yet self-consciously  jaunty and oddly mechanical book that, purposely or otherwise, is about the  absence of things and emptiness.  </P></p>

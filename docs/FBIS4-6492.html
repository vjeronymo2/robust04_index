			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- P.V. Svoik,  co-chairman of the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan, told KCNA that  the concrete wall artificially blocking the travel of fellow  countrymen and bisecting the country must be pulled down at once.    Saying he had seen the West Sea barrage and the concrete  wall  during his visit to Korea, he noted:    "The wonderful West Sea barrage is a peaceful structure  while  the concrete wall built in the area south of the military  demarcation line is a military setup for division. They  represent a sharp contrast.    "The gigantic barrage was built by the Korean people with  their own design, technology and labour. This shows how  powerful the economic potential of Korea is. The successful  completion of this vast nature-harnessing project is a result of  the wise guidance of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of  the Korean people, and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader.    "While seeing the West Sea barrage built under the  far-reaching plan to completely free the people from the fetters  of nature and the concrete wall, a military setup bisecting the  territory and the nation, we could know clearly who truly wants  peace and reunification."</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Microsemi Corp., a Santa Ana semiconductor manufacturer, reported a loss of  $707,000 for its fiscal third quarter ended July 2, its first quarterly loss in  eight years. The loss contrasts with earnings of $548,000 for the corresponding  quarter the year before. The firm put the primary blame for the loss on the  cancellation of a $10-million contract with a San Diego-based unit of General  Instrument Corp. Microsemi had expected the contract to contribute $1.2 million  in sales and $400,000 in gross profit for the latest quarter. David R. Sonksen,  a Microsemi vice president, said the company has filed a lawsuit against  General Instrument, claiming that the New York-based electronics firm breached  the terms of its contract with Microsemi. Microsemi's revenues grew 21% to  $26.4 million for the quarter, up from $21.7 million for the period in the  previous year.  </P></p>

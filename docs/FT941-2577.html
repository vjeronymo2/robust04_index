			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Mummy's boy to businessman - The 25-year-old boss of a leather company with 18 employees People called him boring, a workaholic, a mummy's boy. But they have grown to respect him. For at the age of 25 Ranu Miah is employing 18 people in a successful London business. His company makes leather coats, jackets, trousers and skirts for 10 shops in London, south-east England, Ireland and Manchester. The shops pay on delivery because they know they can quickly sell what he supplies. 'A lot of businesses go down because they give a lot of credit. And I don't want to be a finance company,' he says. Ranu is successful in a trade which for most of the Bangladeshi leather workers around Brick Lane in East London, has offered only a poor living - making jackets as rapidly as possible for wholesalers out of leather which the wholesalers provide. Today, many have lost even this living, because wholesalers buy garments from Pakistan or India. Ranu's success, however, is based on a thorough knowledge of leather manufacture and sharp fashion sense. 'Because I am young,' he says, 'I know what will sell. I read the fashion magazines. On Mondays I get feedback from the shops. 'Other people are now doing the styles we had two years ago. When they copy something, we get rid of it.' Ranu was born in Bangladesh, where leatherwork is not regarded as a good job. But Bangladeshis settling in East London found work with Jewish leather businesses. He was brought to Britain in 1979 by his father, the first Bangladeshi to run a restaurant in Brick Lane. The restaurant became a haven for new Bangladeshi arrivals: 'He was like the Salvation Army,' says Ranu. 'My father wanted me to study,' Ranu recalls, 'and I got a job in a bank. I didn't find it very pleasant. My supervisor said I didn't do the work right. I knew she had more power than I had, so I left.' He had been out of work six months when a relative offered to teach him the leather trade. He learned quickly and started working for another leather business as well. To widen his experience he began working for a company called Gap. Then, aged 19, he used savings to take a room and start his own business, R &amp; S Fashions. His sewing machines came from a partner in a firm that was splitting up, and a novel method of payment was agreed: 'I knew he was looking for a job, so I said: 'I will give you a job in our place and we will slowly pay you what we owe.'' Ranu's old boss at Gap promised to provide him with business, but first he needed an alarm to protect the leather supplies. With advice from the East London Small Business Centre, he received a Home Office grant for Pounds 750, three-quarters of the cost. The centre also made him a Pounds 3,000 loan. A local bank, however, would not let him open an account, even after the accountant handling his VAT recommended him. 'Finally the manager heard me shouting and gave me an account.' The deal with Gap did not last long. 'Their quality was high and we couldn't manage it,' says Ranu. For the first 18 months, Ranu did not pay himself any wages. 'My parents couldn't give me any money for the business but they looked after me.' He found work with other wholesalers but decided it would be better if he handled his own wholesaling. Armed with a reference from a customer, he reached an agreement to buy leather from an Irish merchant. Then he visited the manager of a shop selling clothes provided by a wholesaler who had made them. He told the manager: 'I can supply you at a better price but I can't give you credit.' He realised that quality of service gave him an advantage: Ranu could meet almost any request from customers. A rival wholesaler could have 100 customers, but might not be able to provide the required the sizes and colours instantly. Ranu spent the slack part of the year recruiting customers. There followed two significant steps: he hired larger premises, with an office, from a Bangladeshi millionaire: 'Customers like to talk to you and have a cup of tea,' he says. And he switched his bank account to a branch in Liverpool Street. His old branch 'didn't like the leather business. They thought we were going to go bust. They wouldn't give me an overdraft.' The Liverpool Street branch understood the problems caused if the cheques he wrote to pay for leather supplies were cleared more quickly than those he received from shops. He buys leather on 30-day credit and saves money by paying early. In the year to last August he recorded turnover of Pounds 113,000 with a profit of Pounds 10,000. In the current year he reached Pounds 113,000 turnover in four months. Young Bangladeshis, he says, are no longer going into the leather trade but into higher education. 'They no longer just want money. My younger brother who is 20 isn't talking of working. He's talking of studying. But this is my hobby as well as my work.'

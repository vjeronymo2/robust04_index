			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Harry Connick Jnr - Jazz It is a commonly held belief that pianist/singer Harry Connick Jnr's music is jazz for people who do not like jazz. This is probably correct and it is certainly true that people who like jazz do not usually like the sentimental crooning of Harry Connick Jnr. So what? It is popular music. Moreover, it is pop music - standards, mostly - which involves a number of musicians who can and do play interesting instruments such as the baritone sax, bass trombone and tuba. Like Duke Ellington said, it is pointless to discuss what is or is not jazz: there are only two types of music, good and bad. Harry Connick Jnr is exceedingly good at what he does, which is to croon pleasantly and swing a plausible big band. The singing is sub-Sinatra 1950s brat pack style. The range is limited, but the diction is clear and he wrings ballads such as 'It had to be you' for all they are worth. His piano playing, which is rationed so as not to distract a non-jazz audience, could best be described as 'honky-Monk'. By his own admission he models his technique on the late bebopper's faltering and surging method but cuts his playing with more vaudevillian verve. For lesser performers, these derivations would not be enough to sell seven million records worldwide. But Connick, who at the age of six was good enough to perform at his father's swearing in as DA for New Orleans, employs highly developed showbiz instincts. In the 1960s he would have been said to have 'sex-appeal'. At the Albert Hall for three nights he high-kicks patent shoes, rolls his sleeves up to zap and click directions at the choreographed band, even tap dances, while singing 'toons' full of Big Easy charm. Long and intimate conversations with the audience which discuss girlfriend Jill's sore throat, his first sight of the Queen and George Michael not recognising him had them squealing in the stalls. A half sung tribute to Freddie Mercury was genuinely touching though the Jungle Book's 'Bare Necessities' tested the limits of sentimentality. It is impossible that Connick, who is in his mid-20s, will ever unite disparate audiences in the way Ella Fitzgerald or Louis Armstrong could, he is too good looking and not as massively musical. But he writes a catchy 'toon', employs musicians and cheers people up. Personally, I look forward to seeing Tony Bennett next month. Forever For Now (Columbia 473873) is the new retrospective collection. Harry Connick Jnr and his orchestra play the Royal Albert Hall (tonight); Newcastle City Hall, June 11; Nottingham Royal Centre, June 12; Liverpool Empire, June 13</p>

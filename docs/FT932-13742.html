			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Heseltine urges academic help for small businesses NEW WAYS must be found to harness the 'intellectual horsepower' of universities and colleges to help small and medium-sized businesses to grow and create jobs, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told Manchester Business School. He suggested that, in future, businesses would have access to databases at the government's new one-stop shops to find out who the best experts were to help with technical problems. A wider spread of management training was also essential, Mr Heseltine told a meeting of the school's staff and students, and industrialists who support the school. 'Small and medium-sized firms are the key to increasing competitiveness,' he said. 'In the short term, running courses for large companies offers a great attraction to business schools and academia because of the companies' commitment. Relationships are easy. 'But ways have to be found of reaching many more medium-sized and smaller enterprises to improve managerial skills. The adoption of training by these companies remains relatively low.' Another difficulty was reaching most companies - chambers of commerce, the Confederation of British Industry and other trade or business associations covered less than 50 per cent of the 3m businesses in Britain, he said. Numbers of businesses had grown from 1.8m in 1979 and there were 400,000 start-ups last year, in spite of the recession. Small and medium-sized enterprises would be the main sources of new jobs for the rest of the decade. Mr Heseltine said jobs would not be created by large companies because they wanted to protect hard-won productivity gains. He concluded: 'Jobs will come in small and medium-sized enterprises in an unpredictable way. You cannot plan it in a capitalist society, but they will come. We have to help that process.'</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann down 89% in first half MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, yesterday reported an 89 per cent slump in first-half profits and placed most of the blame on launch costs for its D2 Mobilfunk mobile telephone network. Net earnings dived from DM134m (Dollars 90.50m) to DM15m on sales up 21 per cent to DM12.8bn. However, underlying turnover stagnated and virtually all the increase was due to consolidation of newly purchased vehicle component companies. It saw no possibility of any basic improvement in the second half. Even excluding costs associated with its entry into telecommunications, net profits still shrank 27 per cent to DM165m from DM226m last time. 'High costs, global competition with inadequate prices, wide-ranging declines in our markets and the dollar/D-Mark relationship are putting earnings under pressure,' said Mr Werner Dieter, group chairman. Even so, most Mannesmann divisions were doing better than average, he claimed. The telephone business, formally launched in July, recorded sales of just DM1m in the first half. The network covers some 40 per cent of Germany and 70 per cent of the population at present. The aim is to extend it to within reach of 80 per cent of the population by the end of this year. With an estimated 5,000 customers on-line at the launch, the group now has 10,000 and is counting on reaching 100,000 people by the middle of next year. Tax benefits related to the investment will not start to come through until D2 shows its first profits. Total group orders were up 18 per cent at DM15bn, again thanks mainly to contracts booked with new acquisitions. The plant and machinery divisions, which account for almost 40 per cent of turnover, suffered from flat conditions in export markets and falling sales at home. Order intake, up a nominal 2 per cent, was 3 per cent down on a like-for-like comparison. Sales of steel tubes fell 10 per cent to DM2.35bn in the January to June period under review because of heavy price competition from eastern Europe. About half of the DM3.6bn-worth of new orders for vehicle components stemmed from newly-consolidated subsidiaries VDO and Boge. In spite of difficulties in world motor markets, this sector, which is the second biggest in Mannesmann, showed a profit after losses last time estimated at DM110m. First-half sales were up 96 per cent at DM3.5bn. In spite of the boardroom gloom about short-term prospects, particularly in the domestic market, exports from Germany rose 3 per cent and sales by foreign subsidiaries increased 32 per cent to almost DM4bn. Meanwhile, group investments rose by more than half to DM761m. More than 80 per cent of the total was spent in Germany, mostly on the mobile telephone network and in motor components. Cost-cutting continued, and although acquisitions led to a 16 per cent increase in numbers employed, the underlying figure fell by 4,500 people. At the end of June the group had 141,000 people on its payroll, 101,000 of them in Germany. Lex, Page 16 Markets, Page 29</p>

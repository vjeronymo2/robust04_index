			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "AIDS is Coming, Fast"] </F>   [Text] The estimates vary. The causes are hotly debated.  But one thing is very clear -- Asia is likely to take front  seat in the plunge towards an epidemic of AIDS by the turn of  the century. What is even more chilling to realise is that  Pakistan is sleeping as disaster approaches.    According to the Asian Development Bank, only one of several  institutions to have predicted a grim future in this regard, the  number of AIDS cases in Asia is expected to surpass those in  Africa in the next couple of years. By the year 2000, Asia will  be home to more than half of the people of this world who are  infected with HIV, the virus that inevitably leads to AIDS.  These estimates are based on the current rate of growth of the  incidence of infections in this part of the world, and the  attitudes that prevail in countries towards the disease. For  the most part, governments' reaction in Asia range from complete  apathy and ignorance to hostility towards the disease and its  victims. This is further based on the perception that AIDS is  limited to certain groups of people, those that Asian societies  keep at arms length. Some individuals believe that AIDS is  God's way of dealing with such people, and some think that it is  God's wrath descending on western immorality.    Pakistan for one is reacting very slowly to the AIDS crisis,  its authorities and society perhaps believing that the borders  of the country will keep out the full scale assault that is  currently underway in neighbouring countries. India is  estimated to have about one million HIV infected people today,  though given the fact that most of these people are unaware of  the time bomb within them, they are probably spreading the  disease more rapidly than can be calculated with any certainty.  Suffice to say that the situation is very serious. Belatedly,  Indian authorities are waking up to the realities, and AIDS  awareness campaigns are being pursued with some sense of  urgency. The biggest hurdle in the way is ignorance, which  makes information dissemination difficult is a society where  taboos don't allow candid exposure to such issues. Not  surprisingly, the problem is even greater for Pakistan. Though  we have only a few hundred reported cases, they are growing  rapidly, and most HIV infections are unreported or unknown even  to the infected people.    Much of the world is observing AIDS week currently, to focus  attention on the issue and spread awareness of the danger. In  most of Asia the awareness effort has been limited almost  exclusively to the more affluent and more liberal segments of  society, with walks and high level seminars putting in their  usual token show. The most vlunerable sections of the populace,  the proverbial masses, as always remain untouched by such  publicity stunts. Ironically, they will be the first to be  touched, indeed knocked down, by the virus.    It is not simply a matter of physical health that confronts  us here. For developing countries like Pakistan, it would be  devastating to be burdened by the heavy costs, both human and  financial, that would follow a full scale spread of the disease.  AIDS right now is spreading among all creeds, classes and ages,  and both sexes, simply because those who carry the virus don't  know that they do, and those who catch it from them are unaware  of the precautions that they must take for their own safety. In  its wake, AIDS is leaving a devastating trail of human  suffering, and it is only the fault of ignorance. Unless  Pakistan acts now to curb the unpending assault, the costs later  on will put out of our reach not only physical health, but also  any economic prosperity that may be appearing on the horizon  today.    Our health authorities have so far failed to make any impact  in spreading AIDS awareness to where it is needed most. It is  frightening to know that almost all donated blood in the country  is unscreened for the HIV virus, which means that hospitalised  patients all over the country who may need blood transfusions  are at risk of contracting the virus. This indicates the gross  apathy of the concerned authorities towards the health of the  people. No doubt, the individuals assigned to the task are  fully aware themselves, and genuinely concerned about the  immediate threat, but they have so far failed to initiate even  those safeguards that would minimise the risks for unsuspecting  patients. Why?    We need an action plan, something perhaps on the line of  National Conservation Strategy and the environmental mass  awareness programme, to impart education about AIDS. Perhaps it  can be combined with family planning, since that too is dealing  with some generally taboo subjects. What is important to  understand is that our illiterate masses are not going to be  able to read about the disease, they must be told about it. It  will take a major grass roots and multi-media effort, and it  can't wait.</p>

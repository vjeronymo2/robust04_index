			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Ukrainian side is not to blame" for failure to  sign the final document on the Black Sea Fleet's division at the  Ukrainian-Russian negotiations, the Ukrainian chief negotiator  Boris Tarasyuk, a deputy foreign minister has told journalists  on his return from Moscow.    In his opinion, the Ukrainian delegation "displayed enough  flexibility and readiness to compromise." The Ukrainian side,  he noted, offered five draft accords to choose from.    At the same time, Tarasyuk described the latest round of  talks in Moscow as "very useful." "The shaping-up breakthrough  justifies the delay with signing a document," he said.    In his words, Ukrainian and Russian experts are given ten  days to agree on terms to divide the Black Sea Fleet and to set  aside bases for the Russian Navy in Ukraine.    He reported that the negotiation partners had reaffirmed the  outcome of the previous talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division  and "agreed approaches to the crucial issues" on Russian naval  facilities.    At the same, in his words, "one cannot talk of the complete  absence of differences, which is natural since the interests of  the two states are at stake."</p>

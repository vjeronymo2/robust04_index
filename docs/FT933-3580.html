			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Accounting board shelves rent plan THE Accounting Standards Board has shelved a proposal to force companies to make a provision in their accounts for unrecoverable rent on vacant leasehold property. The proposal, which was put forward by the ASB's Urgent Issues Task Force in June, would have required companies to identify the likely shortfall between their obligations under their lease and the amount they would be likely to recover by reletting the property. It had been expected to have a large impact on some companies in London and the south east. The British Property Federation, which represents landlords, said it had opposed the proposals because it could discourage people from taking out a long lease for fear of having to account for space that was not used at a later date. It had the 'potential to inflict serious damage on the property investment industry,' it said. It also said that the proposal would have made it difficult to compare figures in different companies' accounts because the provision would have depended on assumptions about a large number of variables.</p>

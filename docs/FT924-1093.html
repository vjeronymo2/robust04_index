			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dial 'I' for insurance - A new plan LOCAL insurance brokers are trying to reclaim their dwindling hold on an increasingly competitive market with a new commercial venture. Called 0800 I (for Insurance), the idea is to link customers to their local broker quickly and, for clients, at no cost. By dialling 0800-1235-789 (which form an 'I' on a push button telephone), the caller is connected automatically to his local broker. As policies come up for renewal, customers can use the service to check if they are paying too much for their existing policy or to see if they are getting the cover most suitable for them. 0800 I is launched and managed by Bernard T. Down, a firm of Folkestone-based insurance brokers. Down says the growing breed of direct insurer - where customers settle their policy over the 'phone with an insurance company - is not necessarily the cheapest and excludes many people. 'So tight is their underwriting that, in some cases, the direct companies won't even quote for risks which other underwriters find quite acceptable,' he said. 'By going to an independent professional, it is possible for the public to ensure that they have insurance cover, at each renewal, ideally suited to their requirements. This does not necessarily mean cheaper insurance but better value for money.' Small independent brokers have been losing out to direct insurers and to the large insurance companies. Down says the number of registered insurance brokers has decreased by 70 per cent in the last 10 years. Brokers wanting to join the system are vetted by Down and pay a fee for the administration of the system and for its publicity. There are 450 linked to the service nation-wide out of more than 5,000 brokers in the UK. Down anticipates 30-50 companies entering the 0800 I network every week. 'We want to let people know that there is a first class alternative for them - independent intermediaries,' he said.</p>

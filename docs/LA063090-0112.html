			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ HIS LIPS: HE'S THINKING ANEW  </P> <P> President Bush said Friday that he has a lot in common with Abraham Lincoln --  but there are some important differences, as well.  </P> <P> When asked at a press conference how he could justify having reversed his  pledge of "no new taxes," Bush shot back: "I'm doing like Lincoln did -- 'think  anew.'  </P> <P> "  </P> <P> His reference was to a passage from the Great Emancipator's second annual  message to Congress in 1862: "The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and  we must rise with the occasion," Lincoln said. "As our case is new, so we must  think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save  our country."  </P> <P> Like Lincoln, Bush has been plagued with an ever-growing federal budget  deficit. In the Lincoln era, the government's red ink rose from $25 million in  fiscal 1861 to $964 million in fiscal 1865. During the years that Bush has been  either vice president or President, the deficit has soared -- from $78.9  billion in fiscal 1981 to $152.1 billion in fiscal 1989. And it is climbing  again.  </P> <P> But there are also some differences: Lincoln's mushrooming deficit stemmed from  expenses incurred in fighting the Civil War, while Bush is enjoying  unprecedented peace worldwide.  </P> <P> And "Honest Abe" never pledged that he would not raise taxes.  </P></p>

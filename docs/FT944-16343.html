			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures moved ahead for the fifth day running but trading was at times unsure of direction and the market closed short of its best levels, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract ended the day 12 points higher at 3,114, having touched 3,127 in mid- afternoon. The cash market premium was 13.5 points with the fair value premium standing at around 15 points. Trading was fitful, moving in bursts in both directions. There was a bit less activity than on Tuesday but trading volume ran to 13,702 contracts, down from 14,793. Both locals and market makers were equally active, and traders said there were even occasional flashes of institutional business, although much of this was said to be the unwinding of short positions. The premium to the cash market fluctuated widely, moving out at times to 30 points. Traders said some arbitrage business was undertaken, notably by NatWest Securities. Traded options were also active with volume rising to 48,750 lots from 43,990 in the preceding session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 19,900 lots. HSBC were the busiest individual stock options with 3,824 lots dealt. British Gas traded 3,329 lots. Kingfisher and NatWest Bank were also active.</p>

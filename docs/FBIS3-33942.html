			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lili Galili] </F>   [Text] Addressing a delegation of 57 French  parliamentarians, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin sharply  criticized the policy of the European countries toward Iran and  Iraq and their refusal to support Israel's efforts to get  accepted as a member of the UN's "West European and Others" bloc  at a time when a peace process is under way.    Beilin explained that such membership would enable Israel to  run for selected UN positions and would give all Israelis the  feeling that a new era is dawning as a result of a process which  naturally arouses fear in them. The deputy minister emphasized  that France "played a leading role in formulating the negative  response to Israel's request." The meeting with the  parliamentarians, who represent France's three major parties,  was attended by French Ambassador Jean Louis Lucet. On their  second day in Israel, the French visitors met with President  'Ezer Weizman and toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial.    In a meeting at the Holiday Inn in Jerusalem, Beilin argued  that the Europeans are actually not prepared to take part in the  peace process and that when he approached the European foreign  ministers in the late 1980's, they referred him to the United  States. According to him, these countries still do not show any  willingness to become involved today. Contrary to the United  States, Norway, or Japan, "the Europeans are not prepared to do  much today either, other than travel to Syria and Lebanon and  relay messages."    Referring to the policy toward Iran and Iraq, Beilin  justified the U.S. approach of ostracizing and isolating these  countries. On the other hand, he criticized the approach of the  European countries, which wrongly justify their "embrace" of  Iran by arguing that "sometimes it is better to embrace somebody  than to push him into a corner." According to Beilin, "an  assertive policy" toward Iran on the part of the European  countries could make a real contribution to peace as far as  Israel and its neighboring Arab states are concerned.    The French parliamentarians were slightly embarrassed when  Beilin summed up this part of the meeting by saying that he  finds it hard to understand French foreign policy, which  expresses friendship and fraternity on one hand, but  demonstrates very little genuine response on the other.    Replying to a question on the issue, Beilin said he has no  doubt whatsoever regarding the positive conclusion of the  Gaza-Jericho First phase of the agreement. He added that a  permanent comprehensive peace arrangement with Jordan, Syria,  and Lebanon could materialize in 1994. Some of the  parliamentarians told HA'ARETZ that at this early stage of their  visit, "they have already learned to appreciate Israeli  democracy, where a peace process is taking place amid tough  internal criticism from many sectors of the population."</p>

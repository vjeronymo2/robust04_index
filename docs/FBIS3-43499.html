			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Angola peace talks [words indistinct] back to  life again in Lusaka today, a day late, after a Christmas break  of two weeks. The talks have already been interrupted by UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] claims  that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]  government army had tried to kill Jonas Savimbi and in the past  couple of weeks, they have had more incidents in Angola. Only  yesterday, UNITA prevented American congressmen from visiting  Malanje, where they launched a bombardment of the town.    When the talks began again today, the atmosphere was  apparently less than cordial, but there is also some optimism.  From Lusaka, Joel Mwinga faxed this report:    This morning, the two sides held a plenary session and  discussions opened with a debate on the composition and role of  a future police force. UNITA is demanding that the current  Angolan police force be transformed from what it described as a  partisan military unit into a nonpartisan civic force. UNITA  says it wants it what calls extreme elements of the force to be  disbanded and more UNITA men to be recruited into the police.    The government and the rebel UNITA movement have spent the  past few days blaming each other as the fighting has intensified  in Angola, but both sides have said that they are determined  that the talks which started on 15th November last year produce  a peace settlement. Despite continued fighting in the country,  the two sides have made steady progress and there is agreement  in principle on the terms for a cease-fire as well as the  composition of a future national army. A meeting of military  experts from both sides will take place in Sao Tome next week to  try and conclude details for a military pact.</p>

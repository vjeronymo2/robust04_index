			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME trade continues to grow The London Metal Exchange announced yesterday that its tenure of its old premises ended last week with the recording of yet another monthly volume record. And it is confident that the trend will continue on the bigger trading floor in Fenchurch Street, to which it moved on Monday. The October trading total of 4.458m contracts beat the September figure by 566,000 and took the total for the year so far to 38.62m, already ahead of the 1993 full-year figure of 35.28m. The exchange has forecast volume growth over the coming year at between 20 and 50 per cent. The investment fund participation that has fuelled this year's impressive rise in both trading activity and price levels on the exchange was very much in evidence again this week. All contracts set fresh records for the recent buying spree. Copper, aluminium and lead prices reached the highest levels for four years; nickel touched 2 1/4 -year highs; and tin and zinc scaled two-year peaks. End-week profit-taking trimmed gains yesterday morning but there was renewed buying after lunch and all the markets ended with their uptrends intact. An increasingly prominent feature was the tightening squeeze on copper supplies. The fall in LME warehouse stocks of the metal over the past few months had taken the total to a below-par level equivalent to five and a half weeks consumption, said William Adams, analyst at London broker Rudolf Wolff. And another analyst, Wiktor Bielski of Bain &amp; Company, pointed out that most of this metal was held in Europe, rather than the US, where demand was heaviest. Early last month concern over the stocks decline pushed the copper market into 'backwardation' - where there is a premium for nearby delivery - a reversal of the normal 'contango' position in which the costs of holding physical metal - principally lost interest, warehousing and insurance - are reflected in nearby discounts. As it became apparent this week there some market players were seriously short of metal the cash/three months backwardation widened from last Friday's Dollars 21.50 a tonne to Dollars 55 at one point. Three months copper closed yesterday at Dollars 2,693.50 a tonne, down Dollars 11 on the day but Dollars 35 up on the week. It had earlier dipped to Dollars 2,655, reflecting a smaller-than-expected fall in LME stocks, but the squeeze factor prevented selling pressure from seriously threatening the uptrend. Aluminium stocks dropped below the 2m-tonne mark for the first time since August last year, but the 35,525-tonne fall was in line with expectations and had no discernible market impact. Prices followed the downward trend early on but then recovered. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,884.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on the day and Dollars 57 on the week, but Dollars 23.50 below Thursday's peak. At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures were nervous ahead of the official assessment of Brazil's 1995-96 crop prospects following this year's frost's and drought, which is expected to be released this weekend. Selling was encouraged by a forecast from US banker Morgan Stanley that the crop would be between 20m and 22m bags (60kg each), much higher than the Brazilian authorities' post-frost projection of 13m-15m bags. But buying was attracted at the lows and the January delivery position, after dipping to Dollars 3,315 a tonne on Thursday, recovered to end the week at Dollars 3,405, down Dollars 52 on balance.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium         -32,525  to  1,991,850 Aluminium alloy   +80      to  25,600 Copper            -875     to  332,225 Lead              -200     to  369,575 Nickel            +600     to  150,420 Zinc              +8,175   to  1,218,275 Tin               +60      to  30,325  ----------------------------------------</p>

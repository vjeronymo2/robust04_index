			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Daniel Victoria] </F>   [Text] The Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission  agreed yesterday to send a note to Enrique Iglesias, president  of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), creating a  permanent organization to safeguard the progress of land  communication between the two countries, an official source  reported yesterday.    According to the source, the IDB committed itself to  granting  a nonreimbursable credit for $1.5 million for a study on the  environmental impact of the construction of a highway linking  Colombia and Panama.    During yesterday's meeting, it was agreed to create a  banking  and finance subcommission, and procedures were outlined to  establish border markings. Also, an immigration agreement will  be reached to provide documents for 15,000 Colombian immigrants  who are in Panama illegally.    The Neighborhood Commission met for two days on Contadora  Island for the last talks by Colombian delegates under the  current government.    It was learned that the permanent commission for land  communication, which will be made up of authorities from both  countries, will define reference terms for the environmental  impact study and explore possible sources of financing for the  highway between Panama and Colombia.</p>

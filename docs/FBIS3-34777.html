			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, Feb. 15, IRNA -- Iran's  envoy to the United Nations Monday stressed that in case Serb  forces refused to observe the NATO deadline, the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization must implement its threats against the Serbs.    Following the Serbs shelling of a trade center in Sarajevo  in  late January which claimed the lives of 68 people and over 200  others were wounded, in a 10-day deadline last Wednesday the  NATO urged the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from the  vicinity of Sarajevo. It warned that in case the Serbs  refrained from doing so NATO forces would strike them by air.    Iran's permanent representative at the United Nations Kamal  Kharrazi in his remarks at the open session of the Security  Council said that the recent moves to lift the seige of Sarajevo  fell short of expectations.    He stressed that overall efforts should be made to ensure  that all provisions of the ultimatum are met by the Serbs.    "In the event the ultimatum is violated, either through  further shelling or failure to fully withdraw the Serbian heavy  weaponry by the deadline, the air strikes must be automatically  initiated," he said.    Kharrazi called on Security Council to allow Bosnia and  those  prepared to help the beseiged republic to take action under  Article 51 of the UN Charter in individual and collective  self-defence.    "Under the present circumstances, the least the  international  community can do is to lift the siege of Sarajevo and other  cities and to lift the unjust arms embargo against the republic  of Bosnia and Herzegovina."    He voiced concern over the efforts made by some powers to  press the Bosnian Government to accept a so-called peace saying  that it "will be the beginning of a more tragedy and ethnic  cleansing."    He stressed that imposition of any settlement on the Bosnian  Government would be "militarily unenforceable and morally  unacceptable to the international community."</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOGILNY MAKES WAY INTO NHL AT TENDER AGE OF 20  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny is a pale-faced, 20-year-old manwith acne on his cheek and an  ache in his heart. He is lonely and a long way from home.  </P> <P> He misses his parents. He misses his friends. He wonders what happens to some  of the packages he sends. He wonders if the secret police are listening when he  calls home. He wonders what will happen to his loved ones. He wonders what will  happen to him.  </P> <P> "KGB is everywhere," he said of the Soviet secret police and intelligence  agency.  </P> <P> He is living and traveling in a strange new culture, struggling to speak a  strange new language his awkwardness with which often shames him into silence.  </P> <P> More than anything else in the world, Alexander Mogilny wishes his parents  could see him play. For that, he knows, he may have to wait many years.  </P> <P> For that, he may have to wait forever.  </P> <P> A lot of printers ink has been spilled celebrating the nine Soviet hockey  players who have joined the National Hockey League this season, many of them  superstars from the Soviet national team here to ply their trade in the spirit  of glasnost, and in the spirit of the Soviet government receiving hundreds of  thousands of U.S. dollars in exchange for their services.  </P> <P> They have won Olympic gold medals and world championships and much glory for  Mother Russia. At or past their playing prime, they come to the National Hockey  League as a reward, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's blessing.  </P> <P> Except for one. Except for Alexander Mogilny.  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny is a defector. Six months ago, the Soviets billed him as  their brightest young hockey star, the youngest-ever member of the national  team, the youngest Soviet athlete to be awarded the prized Order of Merit.  Today, they remember him as the first member of the Soviet national hockey team  to defect. Like the others, he was expected to bring glory to Mother Russia.  Instead, he has brought shame.  </P> <P> Like his eight countrymen, like all the Europeans who have flooded the NHL in  recent years, Mogilny comes here to play hockey. Like all of them, he comes  here facing loneliness and culture shock and the chance that he might fail and  wish to go home.  </P> <P> But unlike them, he is very young.  </P> <P> And unlike them, Alexander Mogilny cannot go home.  </P> <P> That, he says, is the hardest thing of all.  </P> <P> Yes, he had seen "Moscow On The Hudson" several times -- in which Robin  Williams' character defects in Bloomingdale's -- but no, that is not where he  got the idea. Life does not imitate art to that extent.  </P> <P> Mogilny defected the first week of May, when he left the Soviet national team  at the world championships in Stockholm, Sweden. Mogilny declines to discuss  specifics, but people who know Mogilny's story say his decision probably  resulted from an an accumulation of things.  </P> <P> Mogilny resented being drafted into the Soviet army just so he could play  hockey for Central Red Army, the best team in the Soviet Union and the team  that supplies the nucleus of the Soviet national team. Central Red Army is  based in Moscow. Mogilny is from Khabrovsk, a city of 600,000 located just  north of Manchuria, along the Pacific coast of Siberia. Given the incredible  land mass of the Soviet Union -- it has 11 time zones and the continental  United States has five -- Khabarovsk is virtually as close to Los Angeles as it  is to Moscow.  </P> <P> Far from home, Mogilny chafed under the Central Red Army regimen -- it plays an  11-month season -- and its dictatorial coach, Viktor Tikhonov, who also coaches  the national team. A private in the Army -- most veteran Soviet stars are  officers -- Mogilny was reportedly ticked off when he was unable to get a nice  apartment in Moscow, an important perk available to many Soviet sports stars.  </P> <P> An astonishing skater with great natural skills and loose regard for the  strictures of team play, Mogilny was generally regarded as a hot dog and a  hothead. When he got into a fight in a game -- most un-Soviet-like -- he was  stripped of his Order of Merit.  </P> <P> Using a pick they had acquired in a trade with former General Manager Phil  Esposito and the New York Rangers, the Buffalo Sabres had made Mogilny their  second choice of the fifth round in the June 1988 draft -- the 89th player  selected overall.  </P> <P> Given Mogilny's stubbornness and independent streak, the Soviets knew that if  they had a potential defector, it was he. When Central Red Army was set to tour  the United States -- with a stop in Buffalo, N.Y., Mogilny was demoted to the  Soviet junior team, which played in the world junior championships in  Anchorage, Alaska. The Soviets did not want Mogilny in Buffalo or on the U.S.  mainland. They did not want him to get any ideas.  </P> <P> Mogilny was miffed. Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan and Don Luce, the  club's director of amateur player development, flew to Anchorage to meet  Mogilny and to tell him they had drafted him. One year later, when the Soviets  were in Stockholm for the world championships, Mogilny's friend, Sergei  Fomichev, called the Sabres and said Mogilny was interested.  </P> <P> Meehan and Luce flew to Stockholm. Mogilny, having ducked out on his teammates,  flew home with them, but not before calling his parents from Sweden to tell  them what he was about to do. His mother cried and begged him to come home.  </P> <P> But Alexander Mogilny did what he felt he had to do.  </P> <P> The FBI interviewed Mogilny when he landed in New York, as it does all  defectors. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, accused the Sabres of  "piracy." As a soldier in the Soviet army, Mogilny was granted political  asylum. On Oct. 4, the eve of the NHL season, he received a visa, so he could  travel freely between the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> "He's very proud of his visa," said Rip Simonick, the Sabres trainer for 20  years. "Once he had it, he showed it to everyone. It meant something to him,  like a birth certificate. A birth certificate to the Free World."  </P> <P> "I want to play here," Mogilny said after the Sabres' Wednesday morning skate  before their game with the Hartford Whalers. "NHL best league in the world.  Make money. Make my life. Russian system, I didn't see a future in my life.  U.S., this is good life. People are very friendly."  </P> <P> It was a hockey move, not a political move. A move that could only have been  made by a fiercely independent, confident guy with a self-assurance well beyond  his years.  </P> <P> How self-assured? When the Sabres took the bus to Toronto -- it is 100 miles  from Buffalo -- for their first road game of the season, Mogilny went to the  wrong hotel and missed the bus. Although he had never driven into Canada on his  own, he got into his beige Jeep Laredo and began the journey. A friend of  Sabres teammate Christian Ruuttu who was going to the game spotted Mogilny's  vehicle on the bridge that connects Buffalo with Canada and drove him the rest  of the way. He was not even late.  </P> <P> "He's a guy that will take care of himself," says Ruuttu, a Finn, Mogilny's  linemate and next-door neighbor. "He will rise to the occasion. Otherwise, he  would never be here today."  </P> <P> But that doesn't make the adjustment any easier. Mogilny rents a townhouse that  he shares, temporarily, with Sergei and Sergei's Swedish-born, Soviet-educated  wife, Lena. They are his confidantes, his "family," but they are here on  visitors' visas. They will be going home soon, leaving Mogilny to fend for  himself.  </P> <P> When it comes to shopping for clothes, he fends pretty well. Thoroughly modern  Mogilny reads Gentleman's Quarterly and loves Armani fashions. In New York, he  bought a $400 shirt. No ill-fitting Soviet issue for him. Strictly chic Western  European clothes.  </P> <P> "I like clothes," he said, "but not American clothes."  </P> <P> This is no rube who just got off the Trans-Siberian Railroad. As a budding  Soviet star, Mogilny had been to Montreal and New York by the time he was 16;  he has been to Los Angeles and Disney World. He was tossing down Pepsi Cola and  pepperoni pizza and watching HBO with the zest of any 1980s capitalist kid.  </P> <P> It is the size and variety of North American supermarkets that overwhelms him.  </P> <P> But when Mogilny puts on the skates, he does the overwhelming.  </P> <P> "He's not even trying and he skates faster than these guys," Simonick said.  </P> <P> First-year Sabres Coach Rick Dudley compares Mogilny's speed and grace to that  of a young Gilbert Perrault, and says of his new wing, "he hasn't even begun to  use the speed he's got. Nobody's seen him turn it on. When he does, it's  awesome."  </P> <P> You could also compare Mogilny's grasp of English to the young Perrault's.  Thanks to a six-week, six-hours-a-day summer school course at the University of  Buffalo, Mogilny's English is probably better than the French-Canadian star's  was when he was breaking in.  </P> <P> "I've seen more confused French-Canadians than Alex Mogilny is," Simonick said.  </P> <P> But Perreault had other French-Canadians to hang out with. And he could still  go home.  </P> <P> "In this team, people don't understand me," Mogilny said. "They don't  understand my play, my style. Central Red Army, offensive. This team,  defensive. I got little problem. I'm nervous."  </P> <P> That did not keep him from scoring 20 seconds into his first NHL game, his and  the Sabres' first shot of the season. That did not keep him from making several  plays in an exhibition game against the Chicago Blackhawks that left Sabres  brass drooling at what is to come.  </P> <P> Sabres fans love him, roaring every time he touches the puck. When he scored  his first goal of the exhibition season, they gave him a standing ovation.  Except for a few isolated shouts of "Dirty Commie" in Detroit, road crowds have  been kind. Only the hardest heart in America would not soften at what Alexander  Mogilny has done, and the adjustment he must make.  </P> <P> Very shy off the ice because of his broken English, he is hardly shy on it.  With his end-to-end dashes and devastating speed and puck-handling, Mogilny is  a born showman.  </P> <P> "They all know who I am," he told the Buffalo Evening News. "They expect much."  </P> <P> Alexander Mogilny intends to give it to them. Bet that he will. For men like  him, men who dare to do what he did, there is no such thing as a half-hearted  effort.  </P></p>

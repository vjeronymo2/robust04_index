			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: The Greece that too few can see / Thrace, where suspicion still rules The corporal outside Greek army headquarters in Alexandroupolis glanced suspiciously at the permit from Athens before disappearing to find an officer. Twenty chilly minutes later, he was back with encouraging news: no military escort would be needed for two foreign journalists visiting the wildlife reserve on the Evros river delta, which marks the Greek-Turkish frontier in Thrace. Visiting Thrace, the north-eastern corner of Greece, raises practical difficulties not usually found in a country that earns more money from tourism than from exports of goods. As Greece's poorest region, it is keen to attract visitors. Tourist brochures extol its unspoilt coast and appeal for environmentalists. There are pictures, too, of minarets rising above red-tiled roofs: Thrace has a sizeable Moslem minority. Yet, a surprisingly large area next to the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey is included in a military zone, closed to both Greek and foreign visitors without special permits. Traditional enmity with Turkey was reinforced by hostility towards Bulgaria, a Warsaw Pact member. The end of communism brought little change in official attitudes, although Bulgaria is among Greece's fastest-growing export markets for everything from ice-cream to insurance services. Successive Greek governments have stalled on Bulgarian requests to open a new border crossing in Thrace and set up a container terminal at Alexandroupolis port. The Evros delta, a half-hour drive from Alexandroupolis, is the region's main tourist attraction: a 190 sq km wilderness of marshes and shallow lagoons used by more than 300 species of birds that nest, migrate or winter in Greece. As a wetland that attracts rare bird species, it is popular with bird-watchers from all over Europe - but they are confined to a small strip at the western edge unless they wait several weeks for a military permit. Stella Kaldara, of the World-Wide Fund for Nature, is allowed to take visitors with permits into the zone. She says: 'We've been trying for several years to set up a management structure for the delta, co-ordinated by the environment ministry. That would mean being able to organise groups of visitors, and more income for people in the villages round here. The plan is approved in principle, but it isn't being implemented.' Spyros Kouvelis, of the WWF, adds: 'Wetlands are still being encroached on, but the Evros region is in better shape than many. The army tries to be co-operative.' If getting to the Evros delta is difficult, only the most persistent traveller can reach the Rodopi mountains, which divide Greece and Bulgaria. This is where one of Europe's last primeval forests survives, inhabited by wolves and brown bears. Their numbers have been swelled in the past two years by bears driven south from the former Yugoslavia because of the war in Bosnia. The rules vary according to who you ask, but the consensus is that you need clearance from the ministries of defence, foreign affairs, interior and public order ministries, as well as the local police. One official said: 'Many applications circulate endlessly. 'I tell people who are desperately keen to see the primeval forest to make friends with the forestry service and ride up in a timber truck - or wait for the next election and follow the campaign trail up there.' No clear reason is given for making Rodopi off-limits to visitors but it appears to be linked with the Pomak minority, Moslems whose ethnic origins are disputed fiercely by Greek and Turkish scholars. The Pomaks, livestock breeders with little education, live on both sides of the Greek-Bulgarian border. Together with ethnic Turks and gypsies, they make up a Moslem minority of around 100,000 in Thrace. Orhan Hadji-ibrahim, a Moslem lawyer, says: 'There aren't any cold war excuses any more about keeping people out of Rodopi. The authorities talk about unmarked minefields but it's really the Pomak issue that's involved. They have a ridiculous theory that if this border is opened, the Pomaks will want to join up with their relations on the Bulgarian side and will start demanding autonomy.' The Moslem minority, like the much smaller Greek minority in Turkey, remains hostage to the two governments' political quarrels. The Greek government has directed more than Dr60bn (Dollars 250m) in EU-financed projects to Thrace in the past five years and provides generous incentives for investment. But the Moslems, mostly cotton and tobacco farmers, complain they are excluded from the government's efforts to develop Thrace. Education is one of the most divisive issues. The Moslems say they fear their children may face discrimination at Greek schools. Rather than go to a local Turkish-language high-school, many Moslem teenagers are sent to Turkey instead to improve their chances of getting a university place there. On graduation, they prefer to find jobs in Turkey rather than return home. Abdulhalim Dedes, an ethnic Turk who runs a radio station in Komotini, says: 'Discrimination here is selective. But, unless education improves, Moslems can't participate properly in society and Thrace will go on being backward.'</p>

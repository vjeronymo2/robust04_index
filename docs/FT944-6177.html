			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The coal executive John Jermine, 50: Chairman of mining company earning six-figure salary, married with two children at private schools. Politics: High Tory. Wanted: Higher capital allowances for companies so greater investment can take place. Did not want any cut in direct taxes or in public spending. Said yesterday: 'It is a boring Budget which has done nothing to create new jobs. It was an hour and 25 minutes of dressing up neutrality. There is some tinkering at the fringes but no initiatives which will have any significant effect on industry. The chancellor should have been much more aggressive and behaved as if we were being successful, rather than 'steady as she goes'. I don't see the merit of the waste disposal tax. The waste is being produced and it just makes it more expensive for local authorities to get rid of it.'</p>

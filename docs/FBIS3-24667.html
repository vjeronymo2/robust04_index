			<p>SUMMARY                                 In an effort to generate international pressure on an apparently  recalcitrant Kazakhstan to agree to the speedy removal of nuclear  weapons from its territory, Russian military officials appear to  have instigated charges that conditions at nuclear weapons sites  in Kazakhstan have deteriorated so sharply that a nuclear  accident is possible.  Although Kazakhstani officials  acknowledged they have suspended the withdrawal of missiles  pending negotiations on the terms of their removal, they have  strongly denied the safety allegations, which were leaked to a  prominent Russian journalist on the eve of Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United States.  The Russian  allegations, similar to those the Russians have made--and  continue to make--about Ukraine-based weapons, suggest that  Moscow is prepared to use the same pressure tactics to assure an  acceptable and timely settlement with Kazakhstan as it used on  Ukraine.                           END SUMMARY      In the first public indication of a serious rift with Kazakhstan  over the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, Izvestiya on 12 February  published a front-page article by its veteran military-affairs  commentator Viktor Litovkin (See Note 1) reporting that "informed  sources at the Russian Ministry of Defense" allege that  Kazakhstan-based nuclear weapons at Zhangiz-Tobe and Derzhavinsk  face "a critical situation" in a number of respects, including  safety and security.  The article charged that:      -- Fire suppression systems and electrical service at warhead  maintenance facilities "are literally on their last legs and  virtually do not work." Some of the divisions' warhead  maintenance buildings lack heat and water and are in danger of  collapse.      -- Security equipment at warhead storage and maintenance  facilities--including electrified fences, "signal rockets," and  mine fields--"have been disconnected" from their power supply,  allowing intruders to violate the perimeter of the complexes  undetected.      -- The security guard force is so undermanned and undertrained  "that you can only be amazed that no one has yet stolen a single  atom bomb."  The morale among officers at the bases "could not be  worse," and several--including four nuclear warhead  "specialists"--have deserted.      (Note 1)  Litovkin is a longtime military-affairs commentator who  often appears to use his articles to provide a platform for the  views of Russian military officials.  In an indication of the  favor in which he is held by military officials, Litovkin was  among the first group of journalists invited to visit and write  about a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine, the world's  largest and Russia's newest class of missile submarines  (Izvestiya, 28 February 1992).      Political Overtones      The allegations appear linked to a slowdown in negotiations  between Russia and Kazakhstan on the removal of the weapons to  Russia.  The article explicitly blamed the problems at the sites  on the absence of an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on  the "status" and "future fate" of the strategic nuclear forces in  Kazakhstan and accused Kazakhstani officials of prohibiting the  removal of the weapons to Russia for maintenance and the delivery  of maintenance-related equipment to the missile bases.  "Repeated  requests" by Russian military authorities to address these  problems have gone unanswered by Kazakhstani of ficials, the  article asserted, concluding that the Russian military "is afraid  that this process might drag on indefinitely."      Kazakhstani Reaction      A Kazakhstani Government official denied the allegations, saying  that they had been fabricated by forces in Russia hoping to  disrupt the talks and complicate Nazarbayev's visit to the United  States.  Kazakhstani State Adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev held a press  conference the day Litovkin's article was published to deny the  statements as "absolutely untrue."  He acknowledged, however,  that Kazakhstan had "suspended" the withdrawal of missiles from  the country because of the "unsettled problem of compensation"  and charged that the Izvestiya report was "instigated by forces"-  -including the "Russian military and industrial complex"--that  want to "introduce additional difficulties" in negotiations to  settle the problem.  Zhukeyev, noting that the allegations  appeared on the eve of Nazarbeyev's visit to the United States,  also claimed the Izvestiya article was timed to generate  "international pressure" on Kazakhstan, but he insisted that  Kazakhstan would not be bullied.  "The problem can be settled  only through civilized negotiations with due account of the  interests of all sides," he said.  Zhukeyev also asserted that  nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan "are completely safe and well-  controlled" and denied that Kazakhstan has ever "hampered the  delivery of spares" or maintenance equipment (ITAR-TASS, 12  February; Kazakhstani radio, 14 February).      Echoes of Ukraine      The allegations in the Russian press that Kazakhstan's nuclear  weapons are unsafe are strikingly reminiscent of similar warnings  in regard to Ukrainian weapons.  For example,  Litovkin touched  off a controversy in early 1993 when he published an article in  Izvestiya--also citing unnamed Russian military officials-  -alleging that nuclear weapons in Ukraine had deteriorated to the  point of threatening "a second Chernobyl" (16 February 1993).  Litovkin's article was followed by public statements by Russian  military officials alleging nuclear weapons hazards in Ukraine.  These charges have continued to surface, even after the 14  January signing by Presidents Clinton, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin of a  trilateral agreement in which Ukraine agreed to dismantle and  remove its nuclear weapons.  For example, in a widely reported 18  January press conference at the Russian Ministry of Defense, Col.  Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin, introduced as the ministry's "chief expert  in the area of nuclear safety," said the physical condition of  the warheads in Ukraine is becoming "intolerable."  Saying that  "nuclear safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse," Maslin  asserted that warhead storage facilities are "packed" beyond  "standard limits," that "background radiation" at the facilities  has increased, and that warranty periods on "most component parts  have expired."  Maslin also said that some military officials in  Ukraine understand the safety hazards of the weapons there "but  wish to retain their positions in the new structures that emerged  there to supervise the nuclear weapons."  He criticized Ukrainian  lawmakers, saying they are too concerned with "playing the  nuclear card" in exchange for economic benefits without  appreciating the danger posed by the weapons (ITAR-TASS, Moscow  radio, 18 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 January; Russian TV,  18, 20 January).      Outlook      Although Russian Ministry of Defense officials have not yet been  observed to comment publicly on the issue of the safety of  nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan, it appears highly probable that  Litovkin is fronting for them in this case just as he appeared to  do earlier on the Ukrainian safety issue.  By raising the spectre  of nuclear accidents in Kazakhstan, Moscow is probably hoping to  generate international as well as domestic Kazakhstani pressure  on the government in Almaty to accede to a timely settlement  acceptable to Russia.  If they follow the same tactics they have  used toward Ukraine, Russian military and government officials  can be expected to raise the safety issue publicly in the coming  months, particularly if Kazakhstan is seen to be holding out for  a settlement unacceptable to Moscow.  With regard to Ukraine, the  resumption of the use of scare tactics by the Russian military-  -even after the signing of the trilateral agreement--suggests  that Moscow wants to keep pressure on Ukraine until the terms of  the trilateral accord are fulfilled.

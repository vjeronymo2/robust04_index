			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marius Schattner] </F>   [Text] Jerusalem, June 14 (AFP) -- The Palestinians are  laying on a state presidential welcome for PLO chairman Yasir  'Arafat's return with 5,000 men assigned to security and  logistics of the visit.    "We will need a minimum of 1,200 policemen and civilians in  Jericho and three times as many in Gaza to protect Yasir 'Arafat  and look after the logistics," one of Palestinian protocol  officers told AFP.    "We are expecting that a quarter of a million Palestinians  will come to Jericho to celebrate the return home of the  president of Palestine," he said. "So many people will be a real  headache for us."    Such an influx into the small Jordan valley town, with only  one road in and out, will make it virtually impossible for  'Arafat to move around.    Jericho, where summer temperatures hover around 40 degrees  Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), has two main streets and a little  square.    "We are faced with a dilemma: if we restrict entry we will  spoil the day, if we let everyone in there will be a terrible  crush," said the official, who asked not to be named.    The risk of an attempt on 'Arafat's life cannot be neglected  either.    "An Israeli settler or even a Palestinian opposed to the  peace process could take advantage of the confusion to try to  kill him," he said, recalling threats from Jewish extremists.    The pro-Syrian Palestinian leader Ahmad Jibril has also  called for 'Arafat to be killed following his signing of the  autonomy agreement last September.    The official said 'Arafat should arrive in Jericho by  helicopter, thereby avoiding the Israeli checkpoint on the  Allenby Bridge from Jordan.    He would also fly to the Gaza Strip because a land journey  would mean an Israeli army escort.    Questions of protocol are greatly exercising the organizers  who plan to invite the nine consul generals and the Vatican's  apostolic delegate in Jerusalem as well as a certain number of  ambassadors based in Tel Aviv.    "All this is new to us," the official admitted. "How do we  bring them to Jericho? How do we seat them? How do we greet  them.?"    None of the countries they represent have recognized 'Arafat  as the head of the State of Palestine.    'Arafat has given a written commitment to Israel not to use  the title of president following the signing of the May 4 accord  which launched self-rule in Jericho and Gaza.    "That does not change anything for the Palestinians," said  Ma'in 'Urayqat, spokesman for Orient House, the Palestinian  headquarters in Jerusalem. "We will roll out the red carpet for  Yasir 'Arafat and receive him as head of State."    "The arrival of the PLO leader will give a strong boost to  the peace process," 'Urayqat said. "It is in the interest of all  the concerned parties that it goes off well. That means the  Israelis must avoid any provocation by settlers or soldiers  which would harm the political climate."    For the last four weeks, the head of 'Arafat's bureau, Ramzi  Khuri, has been here working out the details of the visit.    He has chosen a luxury home and offices for the PLO chairman  in lush green compound on the edge of Jericho.    The Palestinian cabinet of "ministers" will be housed in a  new building which was to have been an old people's home and  individual ministers have been alloted houses throughout Jericho.    In Gaza, the former Egyptian governor's palace, which Israel  used as a border police headquarters, is being restored for  'Arafat. He will also have a private residence at his  disposition in the wealthy Rimal neighbourhood overlooking the  Mediterranean Sea.    "He is not coming as a tourist but to start up the mechanism  of autonomy," a Palestinian official said.    The arrival is scheduled for the end of June or early July.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Forte closer to winning battle for control of Savoy The Forte company's 13-year battle to take control of the Savoy Hotel group appeared closer to success last night with the expected departure over the next few days of Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director and Forte's arch foe. The Savoy board is unlikely, however, to announce a final peace agreement between the two sides when it meets next Tuesday. Instead, it is expected to try to find replacements for Mr Shepard and for Sir Anthony Tuke, the chairman, who wants to retire. The board, under new leadership, would then resume discussions on merging Savoy's hotels - including the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - with Forte's luxury establishments. Mr Shepard's position has been weak for some time because of Savoy's poor financial performance. The group's pre-tax profits last year were only Pounds 725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m. A further deterioration in Mr Shepard's prospects became apparent on Tuesday at a meeting between Sir Anthony, Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, and Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director and the representative of Wontner family trusts which hold a stake in the company. The meeting is believed to have discussed press coverage of the alleged leaking of a report compiled by Mr Shepard, which outlined the case for Savoy's continued independence from Forte. Mr Shepard issued a statement on Sunday which said: 'The board of the Savoy group is dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss confidential papers with the press.' The statement was seen as a reference to Sir Michael Richardson, a Savoy director. On Monday, Mr Shepard admitted that he had made the statement on his own initiative and that the board had taken no position on the matter. Sir Michael denied leaking the report. Sir Anthony accepted Sir Michael's denial and described Mr Shepard's statement as 'extraordinary'. Mr Shepard yesterday declined to comment. Mr Sinclair, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for either Sir Anthony or Mr Shepard, is now regarded as unlikely to be appointed to either position. Supporters of Mr Sinclair's appointment to a senior position in the group point out that he has wide experience of the hotel industry. However, as the trustee responsible for the interests of the Wontner family, hotel industry sources believe he would regard it as inappropriate for him to take either the chairmanship or the managing director's position. Sir Hugh Wontner was president of Savoy until his death in 1992. The Wontner trusts control a crucial block of shares. Allied with Forte, they would give the latter control of Savoy. Talks between Forte and the Wontner trusts are likely to continue after the board meeting.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (F) separate standards for self-propelled, push-pull and multi-unit passenger operations without a dedicated head-end locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In issuing regulations under paragraph (3), the Secretary may exclude from any specific conspicuity requirement and category of trains or rail operations if the Secretary determines that such an exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with rail safety (including grade-crossing safety).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Secretary shall issue final regulations requiring enhanced locomotive conspicuity measures no later than June 30, 1995. The Secretary shall require that all locomotives not excluded from the regulations be equipped with interim conspicuity measures under paragraph (2) or the conspicuity measures mandated by final regulations issued under this paragraph, no later than December 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) As used in this subsection, the term ``locomotive conspicuity'' means the enhancement of day and night visibility of the front-end unit of a train, by means of lighting, reflective materials, or other means, with particular consideration to the visibility and perspective of drivers of motor vehicles at grade crossings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Under IR&hyph;1, ditch lights, crossing lights, strobe lights and oscillating lights were designated as interim locomotive conspicuity measures. Conspicuity measures that comply with IR&hyph;1, IR&hyph;2 or any amendment thereto, are deemed to comply with the final rule for four years after its issuance. As required by the enabling legislation, the final rule requiring enhanced locomotive conspicuity measures must be issued no later than June 30, 1995. All locomotives not excluded from the final regulations must be equipped with either the interim conspicuity lighting arrangements identified in IR&hyph;1 or IR&hyph;2 or the conspicuity arrangements mandated by the final regulations, no later than December 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final rule is issued prior to the deadline, June 30, 1995, the statute's four-year grace period would begin on that earlier date. Likewise, although IR&hyph;1 and IR&hyph;2 do not require that any train be equipped with conspicuity measures, the final rule may require such equipping even prior to December 31, 1997, which is the latest date for requiring such measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research on locomotive conspicuity conducted through the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center was completed on schedule in 1993. FRA will continue to gather and analyze data concerning means of enhancing visibility of trains at highway-rail grade crossings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Public Participation in the Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Higher Transitional Council yesterday  summoned Prime Minister Dr. Kassire Koumakoye to explain how the  government intends to solve the present economic crisis. The  prime minister said the government, formed in November 1994, had  promised to pay salaries in two months, but he admitted that the  payments had not yet been made. This is why a government-labor  unions joint commission was set up to ensure harmonious payment  of salaries throughout the country. Here is Prime Minister  Koumakoye.    [Begin recording] The government and the labor union  movements have set up a joint commission to find out exactly how  many months of salaries have been paid. According to the  reliable information I got from the General Treasury Service, it  is a bit more than 6 billion CFA francs that have been  (?disbursed). But which ministries have been paid? Does the  Treasurey have a right to continue the payments? These are the  questions that need answers. Do not ask a prime minister to be  an accountant. To help the public understand what is going on  in the country, I recently spoke about the poor management of  our human resources. How can one understand the idea that two  civil servants working in the same office have been paid  differently? One received one year's salary arrears, while the  other received five month's arrears. How can this be possible?  How can one explain that, in the same prefecture, two civil  servants from the same service are paid differently? One  received his salary, while the other did not. These are the  questions to answer.    The government and the labor unions are currently examining  the issue so that work as well as Chadians can be rationally  managed. Even if the fruit of Chadians' work is meager, it  should be fairly shared among them--unless there is none. This  is the work we are doing with the labor union movements, and I  think that the staunch advocates of the workers are those who do  not work well. The [word indistinct] are there, and this  Chadian is paid 10 months' salary while that one is paid one  month's. In all, it makes 11 months' salary. What is important  for us is the amount of salaries paid, and this is what we have  noted now. The simplest procedure -- I have already examined  this with the labor unions -- is to issue collective checks,  which is simple, and to assign each minister to manage his  personnel. We are discussing this with the labor unions. We  will solve these problems because we have established a joint  commission to carry out comprehensive work and because we have  come here to find the strategy to avoid what we have already  experienced. It is an issue of common sense. We have come to  find out together how we can help civil servants avoid further  misery and help the Chadians avoid pain. I think this is the  purpose of our meeting. It is in this regard that, on behalf of  the government, the prime minister announced the government's  strategy (?calling for) for positive contributions as others  already did through suggestions [words indistinct]. These are  the observations that I would like to make. We know one another  well. The most important issue today is to agree on the way the  country will be managed and [words indistinct] end up with  democratic and open elections. [end recording]    Concerning the backup measures needed after the devaluation  of the CFA franc, the prime minister added that in addition to  the measures of conservation already taken and to be taken by  the government, taxes will be abolished or reduced. This will  be carried out within the framework of the Customs and Economic  Union of Central Africa [UDEAC]. Let us listen to him again:    [Begin recording] Measures are being examined; namely, the  adjustment of prices and taxes so that they can be proportional  to Chadian's purchasing power and help reactivate economic  activities and, therefore, all of the nation's activities. The  document that relates to this issue is (?here) [words  indistinct], but it should be noted that it is the UDEAC  taxation code that is in force. We cannot unilaterally revise  this code without consulting the central African countries, the  members of the union. Anyway, the government's duty is to take  conservation measures to protect citizens's purchasing power,  and we are currently considering such measures. This means that  we are currently examining the reduction or abolition of some  taxes, as well as the adjustment of a number of prices. We are  working on it. Give me time to meet your needs.

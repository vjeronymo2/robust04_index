UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi said in an  interview with AFP today that he ruled out the military victory  of one side or the other. He called for a global cease-fire.  [passage omitted]    Still about Angola, let us go back to the situation there in  the light of the visit the Angolan head of state, Mr. dos  Santos, made to Paris. We heard today that President dos Santos  received N'zita Henrique Tiago, the leader of the FLEC-FAC  [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave--Armed Forces  of Cabinda] a few days ago, on the occasion of his official  visit in France. The FLEC-FAC is one of the branches fighting  for the independence of Cabinda. It is the first time that the  Angolan president has met the leader of the FLEC-FAC, one of the  two movements on Cabinda territory. Farida Ayari reports:    [Ayari] During a 45-minute meeting with N'zita Henrique  Tiago, President dos Santos suggested a cease-fire to the  FLEC-FAC leader, so that negotiations on the future of Cabinda  could be started. N'zita Tiago welcomed this proposal. He asked  the Angolan head of state to send him an official letter to  confirm his position.    The FLEC-FAC leader reiterated the demands of his movement,  that is, the evacuation of Cabinda territory by the Angolan  political and military forces, the organization of a referendum  on self- determination, and the establishment of Cabindan  institutions.    Jose Eduardo dos Santos pointed out that there were other  FLEC branches and said that it was necessary to take everyone's  opinion into account.    In this respect, N'zita Tiago asked the Angolan president to  withdraw his troops from the north and the center of Cabinda, so  that a conference with all Cabindan political movements could be  organized in the enclave. The aim of the conference would be to  reach a common position, which would then be presented to the  Angolan government.    This meeting at the top is vital because the FLEC-FAC --  and,  to a lesser extent, Jose Tiburcio Luemba's renovated FLEC -- is  the most significant Cabindan movement fighting for  independence. It is also the only one controlling territories  in the Cabinda enclave, which produces 60 percent of Angolan oil.</p>

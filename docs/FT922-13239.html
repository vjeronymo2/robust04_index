			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet table - John Patten: Education secretary MR John Patten's promotion marks the end of a time when he seemed doomed to be the minister most frequently and wrongly tipped for the cabinet. Since 1989, Mr Patten, 46, has been listed among the 'ministers most likely to' at every reshuffle. But while contemporaries such as Mr William Waldegrave and Mr Michael Howard got seats at the top table, he was left to soldier on through criminal justice bills at the Home Office. His qualifications for his appointment are so fitting that it is a fair bet that Mrs Margaret Thatcher would never have trusted him with it. Not only does his seat - Oxford West and Abingdon  - contain Oxford University, but he was a university lecturer from 1969 and a fellow of Hertford College until 1983. His ministerial apprenticeship has been long. In his five years at the Home Office he learnt the need to work with dissatisfied departmental client groups. It should serve him in good stead in his dealings with the teachers and educational establishment, who are desperate for stability after the upheavals of the education reforms. Among his recurring themes, and one he is likely to elaborate in his new post, is that of parental responsibility. At Westminster, he is an effective dispatch box performer. He has a gift for the popular phrase, being credited with giving the nation 'lager louts'. Whatever his rhetoric, his years at the Home Office have not entirely blunted his liberal edge: he has consistently voted against the restoration of capital punishment. His officials talk of his relentless drive for self-publicity, although this also enables him to attract attention to fresh or even not-so-fresh departmental actions. Apparently undaunted by the crime figures rising to record levels, he has insisted on the preventability of much minor property crime and launched initiatives to try to reduce it.</p>

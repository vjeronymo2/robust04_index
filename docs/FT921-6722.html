			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: White paper on health set for delay  -News in Brief PUBLICATION of the planned white paper on preventive health care is to be delayed until after the election, in an embarrassing setback for the government, Alison Smith writes. The emphasis on preventive care was intended to form part of the Tories' counter-attack to Labour's onslaught over the national health service. The Treasury, however, is said to have argued that the implications of the proposals meant that they could not be launched before the Budget. Ministers were then advised that there would not then be enough time to publish them as government policy before running into the election campaign, if - as expected - it begins in mid-March. The green paper on a 10-year plan to make the UK healthier was published last June and the consultation period finished at the end of October. ***** EDUCATION: Labour will abolish England's remaining grammar schools and end all selection at 11 if it wins the election, Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said yesterday. Mr Straw said grammar and secondary modern schools would be integrated into 'full fledged comprehensive schools.' He attacked the government's readiness to increase the number of grammar schools by allowing schools which have opted out of local authority control to change their status. ***** CANDIDATES: Labour yesterday selected candidates to fight Liverpool Broad Green and Coventry South East at the general election in place of MPs Mr Terry Fields and Mr Dave Nellist, expelled in December for alleged links with Militant. Ms Jane Kennedy, a 33-year-old union official, will defend the Liverpool seat where Mr Fields had a 6,047 majority in 1987. Mr Jim Cunningham will defend Mr Nellist's 6,653 majority. The expelled MPs have said they will contest the seats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Emigration a Cause for Concern"] </F>   [Text] A sensational series of special reports produced and  published simultaneously by BARRICADA and LA NACION several days  ago confirms that Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica is a  worrisome social phenomenon, owing both to the extent of the  problem and to its immediate and short-term implications.    This wave of emigration, unlike the one in the 1980's, is  due  neither to political nor ideological factors. Its causes are  entirely socio-economic.    Some 150,000 Nicaraguans have emigrated to our next-door  neighbor, whether legally or by sidestepping border posts,  solely because despair "abounds" and jobs "are scarce" here.    "Why should we come back?" Nicaraguans ask. The backdrop to  this question is significant. It unquestionably suggests that  they see neither a present nor a future in our country. As far  as they are concerned, there are not even remote prospects for  improvement.    This in itself ought to prompt in-depth reflection by the  government and multilateral financial organizations, inasmuch as  it confirms that economic policy over the past three years has  been on the wrong track.    In addition, this emigration shows that political and armed  confrontation is doing irreparable harm to the country and,  therefore, that a national understanding leading to a period of  peace and stability is urgently needed. All political forces and  all segments of society bear some degree of responsibility in  this regard.    Nicaraguan and Costa Rican authorities met last week in  Costa  Rica to hammer out a joint migration policy that would put an  end to the wave of deportees and "rejects." The effort is a  praiseworthy one, inasmuch as abuses are being committed. It  still remains to formalize this joint policy, however.    The Nicaraguan Government has requested an "immigration"  amnesty for the thousands of our citizens who remain in hiding  in Costa Rica, but the authorities there do not "look favorably"  on the request, particularly because Costa Rica is in the home  stretch of a general-election campaign.    Emigration is an issue with major human implications, and  therefore both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican society urgently need  to develop an awareness of it. Otherwise, it would be neither  unusual nor unlikely for xenophobia to begin emerging in Costa  Rica against Nicaraguans. That would be a serious and dangerous  development for our brothers.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Indian reform can go on MR Manmohan Singh should be the toast of his peers at the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meetings this week. In only 14 months, the Indian finance minister has achieved what many would struggle to do in years. With the strong backing of his prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, he has overseen a change of direction in economic policy, and has persisted with it. The government took office when the country was in the depths of a payments crisis and appeared in danger of being torn apart by internal dissent. That dark time already seems long distant. Mr Rao and Mr Singh have put an economy which had been isolated and strangled for decades by socialist bureaucracy on course to openness and the free market, while remaining alert to the needs of India's poor. Much more must be done. But if they manage to maintain the momentum, they will create the base for a dynamic, open, and huge economy in the second half of the 1990s. This is all the more remarkable given that they are operating in one of the world's most feverish democracies. China's reformers do not have to account for themselves to voters, have so far taken 13 years to reform the economy, and still have a long way to go. Doubters, even within the government, have felt in recent months that the early pace was slackening. Some have questioned the government's will, others the pace at which it is feasible to push reform in India. The Bombay stock market scandal forced the resignation of one of the leading reformers, commerce minister Mr P Chidambaram, and occupied much of Mr Singh's time as the scam became the subject of intense parliamentary argument. However, by recent reductions in fertiliser and petroleum subsidies, Mr Singh has demonstrated that he remains determined. Though not by nature a politician, Mr Singh is commendably frank in admitting the political difficulties he faces in taking the next steps of reform. But visible progress must continue to be made if growth in international confidence is to continue. Foreign companies, other than those who had been working for years to get investments through and suddenly found the dam broken, have so far not backed their support with very much hard cash. Without substantial private inflows, the reform programme will falter. Potential investors want to see progress on several fronts. Employers need to know on what basis they can hire and fire. A clear 'exit policy' has yet to be enunciated. Mr Singh has, perhaps sensibly, tackled one industry first and won agreement with labour unions on reorganising textile factories. This alone will involve the loss of 70,000 jobs. He has to tread carefully when new job opportunities are scarce and the safety net precarious or non-existent. On reducing the size of the public sector, Mr Singh feels that he does not have a popular mandate for full-scale privatisation. Measures taken so far have been tentative and insufficient. Big state-owned industries and banks mostly need new management and new capital. New ownership is the best way to achieve this given the bureaucracy with which they mostly remain encumbered. Agriculture urgently needs new investment to restore its growth to respectable levels. The tax structure must be reformed to broaden the tax net, reduce reliance on customs duties and therefore allow further reductions in import tariffs which will help to force Indian industry to become more competitive. Mr Singh will be heartened by recent signs that the economy is responding to fiscal and monetary tightness. This will help him win support for continued reform. Exports to convertible currency areas are showing faster though not spectacular growth. A convincing upturn in industrial production is still awaited. But year-on-year inflation is running just below the 8 per cent target for the financial year, and the fiscal deficit has been sharply reduced. The stability of the rupee since it was made partially convertible this year may well encourage Mr Singh to go for full convertibility within a few months. His approach in all these areas must be steadfast, though not so bold that the whole game is lost. The international community is aware of the political battles he faces. But he has already shown just how much can be achieved, against the political odds, by determined good government. He must press on, and he must be allowed to do so.</p>

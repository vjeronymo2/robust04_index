			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Brazilian inflation rate hits 1,149% BRAZILIAN inflation reached 1,149 per cent last year, according to official figures released yesterday by the Federal Statistics Institute, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. By far the highest rate in Latin America, this is well up on the 475 per cent of the previous year, though lower than 1989 and 1990 when it reached 1,864 and 1,585 per cent respectively. Economists see little reason to hope for a decline soon. The official consumer price index has been rising by more than 20 per cent a month for the last 14 months and Mr Carlos Antonio Luque, president of the Order of Economists of Sao Paulo, predicts inflation of 27 per cent for this month - up on 25.1 per cent for December.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels may set guidelines for steel output THE European Commission is considering a new role as EC steel market supervisor, setting guidelines on future production levels. The plan, aimed at tackling Europe's steel industry crisis, is under review in Brussels. But the Commission will stop short of dictating prices and production levels to individual companies, like the 'crisis cartel' set up by Viscount Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner, during the early 1980s, EC officials stressed yesterday. Under the proposals, Brussels would lay down recommendations on production and delivery levels within the EC for each quarter. EC officials maintained yesterday this would not encourage a cartel. 'We don't have to tell them what to do,' said an EC official, 'and they don't have to phone each other.' Another measure under review is for the steel industry to pool 'crisis funds' for the restructuring of each individual sector. The Commission is anxious to place the burden of decisions about restructuring on Europe's steelmakers, and does not wish to be accused of manipulating the market. But Brussels believes it has a vital role to play as broker between steelmakers and governments. EC officials said yesterday the Commission would make clear it is willing to support an industry-wide restructuring plan only if Europe's steelmakers produce a 'definite' closure programme by the end of September which can be carried out by the end of 1994, according to a senior EC official. A future rescue plan is also heavily dependent on the support of EC member states which would have to bear a portion of the EC funding of up to Ecu900m (Pounds 730m) to cover redundancy costs. The overall cost of restructuring could be more than Ecu6bn, according to a report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's special steel envoy. But the Braun report warns that without a rescue plan involving some rise in prices in the next few weeks or months, some of Europe's largest steelmakers will see their cash flow dry up or turn negative by year-end. The Braun report - delivered to the Commission last week - includes a range of potential cuts in capacity which were put on the table by some 70 managing directors of EC steel companies in the past four months. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has begun canvassing fellow Commissioners' support and will have to present formal proposals next Wednesday. The EC will discuss the steel industry crisis at a special meeting on February 25. The deepening recession forced steelmakers to raise earlier estimates of possible capacity cuts to 25.8m tonnes of crude steel and 17.9m tonnes of rolled products. At least 50,000 jobs are likely to be lost in the plant closures, leading to an estimated Ecu2.5bn in social costs and Ecu3.5bn in industrial costs, according to the Braun report. Certain manufacturers and governments in Spain, for example, are already concerned that they will be forced to cut more capacity than they would like. But Commission officials are adamant that this time the industry will have to agree a closure plan first, before the rescue plan and EC funding can then come fully into force. 'We are not going to launch all sorts of measures and just hope that in the process these people will come up with capacity reductions,' said an EC official.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Knapp warns on public pay limits MR JIMMY KNAPP, leader of the RMT transport union, warned the government yesterday not to risk a 'spring of unrest' by imposing another year of pay restraint on public-sector workers. The TUC general council was called on by the congress to 'take the lead in resisting any further attempts by the government to impose a limit on public-sector employees and to facilitate the co-ordination of action by public-sector unions in this area'.</p>

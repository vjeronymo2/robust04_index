Toguc: If these had been free elections, we would  have supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to  prevent us from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked  the DEP. Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have  been planted in the various parties' headquarters, and  candidates have been intimidated. This is why the DEP has  decided not to take part in the elections, and has requested the  people to abstain. [Toguc ends]    An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned  candidates not to stand in the elections: "Those who do not  obey this order will pay a high price," came the message. The  resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive  which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's [name as received;  presumably Abdallah Ocalan] brother Farhat Ocalan to Moscow.  According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by head of  foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to provide  support and weapons.</p>

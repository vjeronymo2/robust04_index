			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League chairman Umberto </F> Bossi by RAI correspondent Bruno Vespa; place and date not given  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Vespa] Mr. Bossi, is everything settled now? Will  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi be prime minister?    [Bossi] Let us put it this way: we are talking. We imposed  the federalist condition, because this is a special historical  moment. Very soon, within six months, there may be a strong  institutional change in the country. There is also the free  market condition. We need an antitrust law to break up the  duopoly which in the past controlled the country's economy. On  the one hand there were the parties, and on the other hand a few  big families which controlled capital and businesses with the  support of the state.    [Vespa] Let us talk about federalism. Could you renounce  your idea of three large regions and adopt a softer approach?    [Bossi] There is no doubt that federalism must be based on  macroregions. Modern federalism must be based on regions which  are homogenous from a social and economic point of view.  However, the number of these macroregions can be discussed.    [Vespa] What must Berlusconi the businessman get rid of to  become prime minister?    [Bossi] In America such an eventuality is regulated by the  law. Whoever has such a powerful and prestigious post must hand  over all his assets to a company which he or she cannot control.  This should make it easier for the prime minister to make  decisions on issues where there is a conflict of interest  between the private and the public spheres.    [Vespa] So, are you thinking of proposing that in Italy?    [Bossi] Yes.    [Vespa] Would Berlusconi then be allowed to become prime  minister?    [Bossi] Once the condition on federalism is accepted and a  first step in the direction of an antitrust law is made, we  would not be against it.    [Vespa] Do you want a League member to be elected as speaker  in the Chamber of Deputies or of the Senate?    [Bossi] We want the Senate, because we have [Francesco]  Speroni there. The personality and public image of any  candidate for the post of speaker of the Senate must be taken  into account as he would automatically be the deputy president  of the republic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national  telephone conference last evening on the task of turning  enterprise losses into profits, State Council Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua stressed: Leaders at all levels should increase their  understanding of the task and implement positive measures to  earnestly and effectively undertake the job of turning losses  into profits as a major economic task for this year.    Zou Jiahua said: Some results have been obtained in the task  of turning losses into profits nationwide last year. However,  the huge losses of state-owned enterprises is currently still a  prominent economic problem. The situation has not only brought  losses to enterprises but also created great financial  difficulties for the state and localities. In addition, it has  direct and adverse effects on a sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development, as well as affected the smooth process of  enterprise reform. Enterprise losses will lead to lower living  standards and increased difficulties for workers as well as  directly affect social stability. We must understand the  importance, necessity, and urgency of the task of addressing  enterprise losses from a strategic high plain. Thus, Zou Jiahua  asked departments at all levels to effectively tackle the  following tasks: 1) Strengthen leadership, formulate plans, and  establish the responsibility system. Localities and departments  should, in accordance with actual conditions, outline goals and  programs for turning losses into profits as well as implement  the programs with plans. It is necessary to determine persons  responsible for the task as well as mobilize and rely on the  masses for resolving the loss problem. Leading cadres at all  levels must become personally involved in resolving prominent  problems of their localities. 2) Earnestly analyze causes of  enterprise losses and offer systematic guidance aimed at  addressing the causes. 3) Stress the tasks of turning losses  into profits in some key industries and enterprises. We must  undertake the tasks in coal, oil, textile, and light industries,  particularly in localities and state-owned enterprises whose  losses are over 40 percent or 1 billion yuan. 4) Departments at  all levels must assist enterprises to resolve their difficulties  and enterprises must strive to turn around their losses. While  actively promoting reform, enterprises at all levels should, in  accordance with the demand of domestic and foreign markets,  actively readjust product mix, strive to manufacture marketable  products, continue to develop new products, realistically and  strictly strengthen operations control, explore internal  potential, and demand efficiency from management. In addition,  enterprises must implement technological modifications, utilize  new technologies, and seek to upgrade efficiency with  technological applications. Enterprises should also arouse the  people's enthusiasm in increasing production and conserving  spending. Banks should extend circulating fund loans to  enterprises that are capable of turning losses into profits.  Finance departments should release funds due for loss subsidies  as soon as possible.    At the conference, Wang Zhongyu, minister of state economics  and trade commission, outlined specific plans for this year's  tasks of turning losses into profits. He said: Enterprises at  all levels must effectively identify their principal products.  They should modify, limit, or eliminate the production of  low-grade products of small market sales, while increasing the  production of marketable products to conquer the market.  Enterprises at all levels must strive to improve internal  efficiency, formulate operations policies and strategies, reduce  stockpiles, quicken fund turnover, and upgrade efficiency in  fund application. We must do a good job in screening and  evaluating the assets of deficit-ridden enterprises to properly  account for their assets. When there is no hope to rescue an  enterprise whose funds cannot meet its debts, experiments in  bankruptcy should be carried out in accordance with the  "Bankruptcy Law." Wang Zhongyu pointed out: It is necessary to  carry out the task of turning losses into profits by closely  centering on the guidelines for invigorating large and medium  state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to target localities,  industries, and enterprises, identify situations, and offer  systematic guidance to score results in our tasks.</p>

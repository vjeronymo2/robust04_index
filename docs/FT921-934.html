			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Agency set up to run Rover marketing ROVER GROUP announced plans yesterday for a marketing strategy that might spearhead a radical overhaul of the way UK companies use advertising agencies. Almost all Rover's marketing services will be handled by an agency set up to promote the motor manufacturer. The company said its decision to jettison about 30 different marketing and advertising agencies in favour of one agency was driven by the need for an integrated service. It would result in savings of perhaps 10 per cent of Rover's marketing budget, which is about Pounds 100m a year. The move to put Rover's marketing services in the hands of one agency has caused ripples throughout advertising. The BSB agency, part of the Saatchi group, was Rover's main agency and will lose revenue of Pounds 20m a year, keeping only Land Rover UK's advertising for the time being. Mr Kevin Morley, managing director of Rover Marketing and a long-standing group executive, was named yesterday as chairman of the agency - the Kevin Morley Group (KMG). He will retain his non-executive membership of the Rover board. Rover's decision to contract out its marketing and advertising to a former employee follows a move in January this year, when Mr Royden Axe, a leading designer, retired from Rover to start his own design company - Design Research Associates (DRA). Rover is one of DRA's main clients. The first advertisements of a campaign for the Metro range were launched yesterday. KMG - which has a five-year contract with Rover - will soon announce new business apart from Rover. The advertising industry is anxious that, should KMG prove successful with Rover, other large advertisers might follow suit and demand cheaper marketing services.

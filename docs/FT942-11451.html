			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's North Sea operating cost forecast to reach record Oil and gas operating expenditure in the Norwegian North Sea will this year reach a record NKr40bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in current money, according to a report to be published by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultant. But it forecasts that weighted average operating costs will drop 8 per cent to NKr35 a barrel of oil equivalent, well below the 1986-87 peak of NKr54. The figures for expenditure and average cost are both net of royalty payments. WoodMac predicts that weighted costs in real terms will continue to decline in the short-term, reaching a low of NKr34 a barrel in 1995, but then slowly increase to about NKr39 by the turn of the century. 'From the mid- to late-1990s, rising costs of production from mature fields will not be compensated by relatively low cost production from new developments,' it warns. Norway's operating costs are higher than in other sectors of the North Sea following the addition in 1991 of a carbon tax to oil companies' costs burden. This year the carbon tax is expected to account for about 5 per cent of total operating expenditure, which is expected to increase by 19 per cent to NKr48bn a year by 1997. Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly quoted company, this year will replace Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, as the operator with the lowest cost production. Statoil faces a rising operating cost profile as current production is dominated by mature fields while Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, have relatively stable and low operating cost profiles over the medium term. BP Norway faces the largest increase, with weighted operating costs seen rising from NKr43 a barrel in 1994 to NKr73 in 1999 because of the maturity of the Ula and Gyda fields and a high level of oil transport tariffs. Operating costs are expected to fall for Elf Petroleum Norge and Phillips Petroleum Norway. WoodMac foresees the increasing proportion of gas in Norway's production raising unit operating costs, because gas costs are inflated by high transport tariffs.</p>

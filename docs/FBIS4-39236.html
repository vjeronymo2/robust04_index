			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for the Bank of Russia says that the  central bank intends to tighten its control of currency exchange  points because many contraventions of banking legislation are  taking place. Among other things, an upper limit will be imposed  on cash sales of hard currency -- probably this summer.  However, he added that this question must be agreed with the  Government and the customs service.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADONNA GETS THE BOOT AGAIN, THIS TIME FROM REEBOK  </P> <P> Reebok has stopped holding its breath for "Breathless" Madonna.  </P> <P> The rock star, who plays the sensual Breathless Mahoney in the film "Dick  Tracy," was dropped late Tuesday as a spokeswoman for the athletic shoe maker  even before filming a single commercial. Reebok and Madonna, 31, had previously  agreed to -- but not signed -- a contract that would reportedly have paid her  nearly $6 million.  </P> <P> "Madonna's availability and our need to get her weren't a mesh," said  Bernadette Mansur, Reebok's vice president of marketing communications. "We  needed to get some benefits out of it to continue with the deal."  </P> <P> For Madonna, who is currently on a world tour that has received mixed reviews,  the Reebok action must bring feelings of deja vu. Last year, Pepsi signed a  $5-million endorsement contract with Madonna but aired her spot only once  before yanking it from the U.S. market. The commercial was being confused by  some consumers with her "Like a Prayer" music video that featured religious  imagery that some found offensive. Pepsi later pulled out from sponsoring  Madonna's planned U.S. tour.  </P> <P> At the same time, suits and countersuits have been filed between Nike and  Madonna. Representatives for Madonna claim the singer and Nike had signed a  $4.25-million endorsement contract for which she was never paid. And in May,  her song "Hanky Panky" was banned from some radio stations that received  objections to lyrics like these: "Some guys like to sweet talk and others like  to tease. Tie my hands behind my back and ooh, I'm in ecstasy."  </P> <P> Madonna, her manager and publicist were all out of the country and unavailable  for comment.  </P> <P> A Pepsi spokesman declined to comment on the company's short-lived experiment  with Madonna. But spokesman Tod MacKenzie said, "Any time you get involved with  a personality of that stature, there's always the risk of the unknown."  </P> <P> One consultant who matches celebrities with sponsors said she is not surprised  by the latest snafu between Madonna and Reebok. "Between her films, her  concerts and her love affairs, I'm sure there would be a problem with most  advertisers," said Noreen Jenney, president of Woodland Hills-based Celebrity  Endorsement Network. "It takes a very special advertiser to take these kinds of  risks."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICAL LOOK AT NEW READING PROGRAM;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: NEW WHOLE-LANGUAGE APPROACH TO TEACHING READING MAY BE A PRELUDE TO  FUTURE PROBLEMS FOR PUPILS.  </P> <P> Sharp-eyed readers of the recent California Assessment Program scores may have  noticed that the third-grade children in San Diego usually scored higher in  reading than the sixth-graders.  </P> <P> Of the 80 elementary schools tested in the San Diego Unified School District,  in only 16, or 20%, did sixth-graders score as high or higher than the  third-graders.  </P> <P> The foremost reason for this poorer performance by sixth-graders, according to  the state Department of Education, is that the tests for sixth-graders contain  about 40% more critical-reading items. These questions require the student to  make inferences about what they read.  </P> <P> What this would seem to signify is that San Diego sixth-graders have received  less than the ideal instruction in how to read critically. CAP expects teachers  to develop more critical-reading ability in their sixth-grade pupils than they  actually do.  </P> <P> Critical reading is certainly more difficult than reading literally.  </P> <P> In literal reading, the goal is to comprehend precisely what an author  intended. Critical reading, on the other hand, requires the student to evaluate  the ideas -- to decide whether they are accurate, honorable, relevant,  complete, up-to-date, metaphoric or symbolic, accompanied by supporting  evidence, or whether they meet a host of other criteria.  </P> <P> But, although critical reading is more complicated than literal reading, its  success depends on good literal-reading skills. Only after literal knowledge is  obtained, can critical reading commence.  </P> <P> The San Diego city schools and many others around the state have recently  adopted a new way to teach reading: the so-called whole-language approach.  Under this teaching philosophy, students are no longer grouped by ability; and  the reading texts contain a higher quality of literature and less emphasis on  word recognition.  </P> <P> But will this new approach produce sixth-graders who are better critical  readers? Or is this just another educational fad?  </P> <P> The whole-language theory of reading development has at least five disabling  suppositions. Taken together they comprise an invitation for disaster for  reading instruction:  </P> <P> 1) Whole language insists that children best learn to read the same way they  learn to speak, that is, with no formal instruction. The reading research, to  the contrary, supports direct, systematic and intensive teaching of reading.  </P> <P> 2) Whole language de-emphasizes word recognition. Children can comprehend the  meaning of a written sentence before they can recognize the words in it, says  the state Department of Education's "English-Language Arts Framework," which  mandates whole-language instruction for teachers. The truth is that there has  been no reading factor more closely related to comprehension than quick and  accurate word recognition.  </P> <P> 3) Whole language encourages children to omit, substitute and insert words in  sentences they read -- at will. Students thus are encouraged to make eccentric  decisions as to precisely what an author intended to impart. No accurate  literal or critical reading is possible under these circumstances.  </P> <P> 4) Whole language denies that there is any sequence of reading skills.  Everything about reading must be taught simultaneously, whole-language  proponents maintain. Quite the contrary, says the research. Teaching a  hierarchy of reading skills, from the easiest to the more difficult, works  best.  </P> <P> 5) Since the whole-language theory has fared badly when examined  experimentally, leaders in the movement now claim that experimental research  findings in reading are fraudulent. According to whole-language proponents, the  only proper way to evaluate progress in reading development is to write  subjective anecdotes of children's reading behavior. It goes without saying  that this disavowal of the scientific method raises alarms about the merit of  its other propositions.  </P> <P> The delivery of critical reading skills is the most important function of the  schools. One cannot participate effectively in a democratic society without  this ability. People without reading skills often find themselves on welfare  rolls or in prison. Poor readers require costly remedial instruction.  </P> <P> The taxpaying public must provide for all these services. It is not only  parents, therefore, who have a vital stake in making sure that the schools are  not indulging in transitory fads and theories, which Harvard President Derek  Bok recently chastised them for doing.  </P> <P> A critical question for our school board members therefore should be: "Did you  understand what you were approving when you authorized the whole-language  approach to reading development?"  </P></p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Banking on new capital It has become almost automatic for each downward lurch of the Japanese equity market to prompt cries of alarm over the implications for international bank credit. Since Japanese banks rely on unrealised equity profits for part of their capital, they must in theory withdraw further from international lending as share prices fall. But does this mean the rules on bank capital drawn up by the Bank for International Settlements are unnecessarily tight? And if so, should they be relaxed for everyone, or should Japanese banks get special exemption till the market recovers? The answer on all three counts is probably not. Banks in the UK, Germany and Switzerland have the spare capital to pick up any slack in international lending. So any worries about the availability of credit are not necessarily due to the BIS requirements. Nor is the immediate capital problem for Japanese banks that dire, as the Ministry of Finance in Tokyo pointed out last week. Most can still raise capital through issues of relatively inexpensive subordinated debt. Such issues may not, however, exceed 50 per cent of core or so-called tier 1 capital. If either the stock market or the yen fell much further, the banks could come against this limit. They would then have to raise new tier 1 capital through preference shares whose dividends have to be paid out of taxed income. The prospect of that expense might provoke a more rapid retreat from the world arena. There would, however, still be little point in the finance ministry softening the rules. It has no formal obligation to enforce them, but credit rating agencies would certainly respond to exemptions by downgrading Japanese institutions, pushing up their cost of funds. Overseas authorities would in theory be entitled to refuse banking and securities licences to Japanese banks which failed to meet the requirements. In short, BIS requirements are likely to pose more problems for shareholders in Japanese banks than for the world at large, especially since the slide in domestic property prices has yet to be fully felt in their profit and loss accounts.</p>

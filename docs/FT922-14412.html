			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Where credit is due The faint stirring of recovery suggested by the modest increase in yesterday's UK consumer credit figures for February is probably more reliable than the continuing recession implied by plummeting car sales in March. Since the consumer credit data follow other positive indications - from retail sales as well as imports - one wonders why incipient recovery is not a campaign issue. But presumably no one believes Mr Norman Lamont's protestations on the subject any more, while Mr John Smith would prefer the electorate not to know. If recovery were already in train, he could not claim credit later as chancellor. Even the car figures are not as bad as they seem. The trend is distorted by comparison with a 1991 month in which purchases were advanced ahead of the increase in VAT. Adjusted for this, the slide in sales seems at least to be levelling out. That is probably as much as one could expect, despite the halving of car tax in this year's budget. Many buyers would probably now prefer to wait till the K registration comes in August. Still, the 2 per cent increase in new consumer credit over the past three months marks only a fragile revival of confidence. It does not extend to the housing market and could be killed stone dead by a rise in interest rates after the election. The trouble with weekend forecasts to the contrary is that they are based on models which make scant allowance for the effect on confidence of higher base rates and falling house prices.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): What makes a defector? - A model of brand loyalty inspired by religion and politics If your customers are satisfied, will they be more loyal? If your answer to the question is yes, you are fully in tune with current conventional wisdom. But you may also be wrong. Customer loyalty is a modern marketing buzzword. Studies by consultants such as Bain &amp; Co have proved that tiny increases in the rate of customer retention can produce big boosts to the bottom line. Not surprisingly, loyalty schemes are proliferating and more and more companies are tracking customer satisfaction in a bid to improve customer loyalty. Some, such as Rank Xerox, have made customer satisfaction their leading performance indicator. Others, such as IBM UK, link staff bonuses to customer satisfaction targets. But new research throws doubt on one of the basic assumptions behind such schemes. Sometimes disgruntled consumers are loathe to defect to another brand and never do. Others, who are 100 per cent satisfied, will switch allegiance at the drop of a hat. Last week, for instance, British Airways revealed that the defection rate among 'satisfied' customers was 13 per cent  -exactly the same as among customers who complain. The key is to understand the dynamics of conversion, says Jan Hofmeyr, a South African religious psychologist turned market researcher. At any one time, he argues, a certain proportion of a brand's followers (be it a consumer product, service, political party, religion or ideology) will be on what he calls a 'conversion trajectory'. Effective customer retention - and the successful poaching of rivals' customers - depends on understanding the four factors that drive individuals along that trajectory. They are: the degree to which the brand fits the individual's needs and values; the degree to which it involves the individual; the availability of an alternative; and the individual's attraction to that alternative. The first factor, the needs/values fit, is the stuff of traditional customer satisfaction surveys. But it misses the crucial element of commitment, says Hofmeyr. Where involvement is low, for example in a consumer's relationship with his cat litter brand, loyalty switching is usually a simple 'hop, skip and a jump'. But where it is high - the result of heavy emotional or financial investment as in a financial services product, a car, or even a marriage - people are much more conversion resistant. Hofmeyr first developed his theories when completing a PhD on religious belief formation. In a study of South Africa's large Hindu population he found a new generation of 'exceptionally unhappy' Hindus desperately trying to hold on to their beliefs. The Hindus wanted to stay loyal but large numbers ended up defecting. He then turned to South Africa's ruling National Party, discovering in 1987 that a growing number of its supporters were increasingly restive about apartheid's long-term viability. Their doubts had never bubbled to the surface because they were strongly repelled by the alternatives. They drifted on, ambivalent, until FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela offered them a way out. Since then Hofmeyr has applied such insights, gained from the study of religious and political conversion, to nearly 50 categories, from banks to beers. Companies using the model include Anheuser-Busch, Gillette, Mobil, Nestle, Nissan, PepsiCo, and the current soap wars rivals Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. According to his 'conversion model', which he presented publicly in Britain for the first time at a Dragon International seminar recently, purchasers of any brand can be broken down into four types: 'entrenched', 'average', 'shallow' and 'convertible'. The entrenched feel the brand fits their needs and values perfectly. They have no need to look elsewhere. The last two, while still 'loyal' purchasers, are weakly committed, or on the threshold of defection. Significantly, the research process (a simple two-minute questionnaire) also classifies non-purchasers into similar categories: 'available', 'ambivalent', 'weakly unavailable' and 'strongly unavailable'. The crucial analysis for any brand is how many consumers fall into each of these categories, and why. One of the main conclusions of Hofmeyr's research so far is that too many marketers allow their strategies, especially pricing strategies, to be dictated by the waverings of the convertibles, only to end up compromising the very brand values that keep their entrenched followers entrenched. The conversion model is not the only psychology-inspired attempt to help companies delve deeper into the black box of consumer motivation. At Mathematical Market Research (MMR), researchers are employing techniques originally used to pinpoint perception differences between psychopaths and the rest of the population. Central to the technique is the 'method of triads' where the interviewee is asked in what way A and B are different or similar to C. By asking a myriad of such questions, the researcher can build up a detailed picture of the interviewee's world view. Different levels of questioning, from 'which brand do you prefer, A or B?', through 'why do you prefer A?' and on to 'why does that attribute particularly matter to you?', unveil consumers' preferences and what drives these preferences, says MMR managing director David Thomson. This can be used to identify gaps in what appear to be crowded, mature markets. Hofmeyr and Thomson's theories are a challenge to those who confuse habit with loyalty, who believe that the incentives or 'bribes' associated with most loyalty schemes create genuine customer loyalty, or who assume that continued repurchase is proof of customer satisfaction. They also suggest new ways for marketers to convert their rivals' loyal followers. Customer loyalty may currently be a bandwagon, but it is no longer clear that it is heading in the right direction.</p>

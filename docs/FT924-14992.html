			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: A racial crackerjack - Theatre If you would like to see a short crackerjack of a play at one of the most modern theatres in London, go to the Albany Empire in Deptford SE8 where there is an explosive production of Dutchman by Leroi James. The piece was first performed in 1964 when racial tension in the US was at its public height. Dutchman contains the very best of American drama: it is sharp, cerebral, full of subtle changes of pace and ultimately violent. Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train will inevitably come to mind. So, in a more roundabout way, will Strindberg's Miss Julie, especially if you can imagine Miss Julie being played by a black, as once happened in South Africa. Dutchman is about race, sex, class and language - the body language is quite as important as the spoken. A white woman enters a train in New York to join a black middle-class male. They have looked at each other before through the train window when she was still on the platform. He, in his suit and tie, is reading; she, with obvious symbolism, is eating an apple. She teases him, flaunts her sexuality, appears genuinely fond of him, but also accuses upwardly mobile, educated blacks of being Uncle Toms in a white society. He hits back. The play ends with a fatal stabbing - I shall not say which way round. In the meantime, without anything much happening, we have been through all the racial, sexual and linguistic nuances that you can expect to see on a stage. In the background, but not obtrusive, there is the continual noise of the train. The stage seems to sway slightly, as trains do. The train is a metaphor for an unfinished journey where strangers meet. Here are Americans talking to each other about race, sex and society, while also concealing thoughts, in a way that you will not find in a British writer. The other American play showing in London which has some of the same subtleties is John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation. Dutchman, written much earlier, is tighter and a minor masterpiece. The man, who in his youth saw himself as a black Baudelaire, is played by Mark Vidol, the white woman by Nicola Winterson. She dominates the first half, but note also her physical reactions of subjection, longing, envy and rage when Vidol talks back in the second. She is just as good when silent. I think that it is a mistake that there is a killing at the end. It raises questions that cannot be answered about motivation and whether the murder was premeditated. Far better if the couple simply walked away from each other, as passengers do at the end of a train journey. But no doubt even the best playwrights assume that there must be a dramatic climax. If it has not been done before, Dutchman, which lasts for little more than an hour, would make a magnificent piece of television. Here on stage it is flawlessly directed by dein jones-ere, as he insists on calling himself in small letters. The Albany Empire belies its name. It is not one of those old Edwardian houses, but a remarkably pleasant modern hi-tech place opened by the Prince of Wales in 1979. Sadly, very sadly, on the opening night on Monday there were only 15 people in the audience. That did not deter the performers who deserve a full house. The nearest obvious landmark is New Cross underground station. Dutchman: Albany Empire until October 29. 081-691-3333</p>

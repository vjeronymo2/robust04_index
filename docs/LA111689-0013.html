			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: IT'S ALL RIGHT TO BE LEFT-HANDED  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Even though our son has always been encouraged and has never  (as far as we know) been made to feel strange or inferior because he's  left-handed, he still makes comments about it and wishes he were right-handed.  Since he's 19 and an excellent student who seems to be adjusted in other ways,  we're wondering if he'll ever accept this condition. -- A.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR A.Y.: There's no doubt about it that, in a world designed primarily for  right-handed people, lefties can often feel they're getting a raw deal or that  they've been treated unfairly. However, most adjust very well and consider it a  minor irritation.  </P> <P> You might remind your son that many people who have made lasting contributions  in many different fields have been lefties. Michelangelo, Babe Ruth, Thomas  Edison, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Paul Klee, Cole Porter, Charlie Chaplin,  Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, even Paul McCartney, Sandy Koufax and Jimi  Hendrix were all left-handed.  </P> <P> It's important for all children to be taught that it's all right to be a little  different. In some way, each of us is unique and this is one of the many things  that helps to make the world a better and more interesting place in which to  live.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son is 5 years old and my husband feels there's no reason  to tell him about the possibility of having a baby sister or brother. Since our  son will be at my mother's for the last few months of my pregnancy, my husband  thinks our little boy would have a better time on his holiday if he didn't  know. Is there anything wrong with letting the new baby be a surprise? -- H.S.  </P> <P> DEAR H.S.: Yes, there's really a lot wrong with this idea. First of all,  children have a great need for predictability in their lives. Youngsters are  amazingly resilient if they know what to expect and if they're properly  prepared well in advance. Your son has been the center of attention for some  time and he's now going to have to learn to share the spotlight. This will  present much less of a problem if you let him know that he'll soon be a big  brother and encourage him to be an important part of the planning for this new  addition.  </P> <P> Talk with your son about what he was like as an infant, for this will help him  to empathize and identify. Once the baby has arrived, make sure you talk with  your son not only about his feelings but also about how he thinks the baby  feels. Let your son take part in preparing the baby's room and planning in the  care and feeding.  </P> <P> I think it would be a good idea if your son could return a short time before  the birth of this baby. The more he's included, the less likelihood for sibling  rivalry later.  </P></p>

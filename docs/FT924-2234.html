			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Boy who cried 'shoots' We all know the story of the boy who cried 'wolf' so many times as a hoax that when there really was a wolf no one believed him. But what do we call his cousin, who announced imaginary good news so frequently that he, too, was disbelieved when right? The best I can suggest is 'the boy who cried 'green shoots''. The long-awaited Treasury monthly report, published last Thursday, is not written by either kind of boy. But it contains a far more comprehensive set of indicators than anything published on as timely a basis by academic institutes, private analysts or the press. The value of the report is as an example of both the economies of scale and of a public good. Government economists and statisticians can provide a more comprehensive service than almost anyone else and it is absurd that publication has been so long delayed. The most important uncertainty on the monetary and inflation front is whether the depreciation of sterling will pass through into domestic prices in the next year or two - thus devaluing the pound in your pocket - or whether the depressed state of demand and activity will stop the pass-through. Sterling's departure from the ERM is far too recent for even a tentative answer to appear in the latest indicators. The December Treasury report is thus more interesting on the real economy. The impression given is of an economy that has bottomed out in terms of real demand and output. There are a few indicators such as cash balances (M0), corporate borrowing and retail sales suggesting something a bit better. But wise people will not shout 'green shoots' until they have seen them springing out of the ground. One analyst complained that the monthly report did not even restate the government's own goals and objectives. But that is to assume that 'the government' knows them itself. For instance, is the objective of macroeconomic policy confined to keeping inflation within the 1 to 4 per cent band explained by the chancellor to the Treasury committee immediately after departure from the ERM? And is the talk of 'going for growth' just mood music? Or are there output objectives as well? We have not a clue. My main technical criticism of the report is that there is almost nothing that enables one to evaluate the gap between output and capacity, either in terms of physical capacity or the margin of unemployed labour. This cannot be right. An x per cent growth of output must mean something different in the aftermath of a deep slump to what it means when production is pressing against the limits of capacity. I have tried to remedy the deficiency by adapting a Goldman Sachs chart. This suggests at first sight that the gap between output and capacity is now so large that a hefty kick-start is indicated. In the Goldman Sachs version, however, the greater part of the output shortfall appears to be due not to depressed home demand but the trade deficit. In other words, recession conditions are due mainly to the diversion of British demand into imports and the export slowdown. My own suspicion is that part of the overseas gap is temporary, representing depressed international conditions, especially in Europe. Part represents remaining deficiencies in the trade statistics. Another part may be remedied by sterling's depreciation, if that is not completely eroded by domestic inflation. Yet a further part may be offset by sustainable inward investment and thus allowed to run. In addition, the level of usable capacity may be less than suggested by the trend line. In that case the recession gap that can be safely closed either by policy measures or by spontaneous recovery is that much smaller. Such barely articulated ideas may help to rationalise the official penchant for a modest initial recovery. But without some concept of capacity output and its trend, even the best of economic reports is just a string of numbers to be tagged at the back of executive summaries.</p>

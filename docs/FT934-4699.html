			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Argentine unit sold by Eni arm AgipPetroli, the petroleum distribution arm of Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, has sold its Argentine operation to local buyers for about L120bn (Dollars 70m). The deal is part of a drive to dispose of non-core activities and raise money ahead of privatisation plans for Eni's oil and gas operations by the end of 1995. AgipArgentina is being bought by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the recently privatised Argentine state oil group which has more than 50 per cent of the local petroleum market. AgipArgentina, created in 1960, specialises in bottling and distributing liquefied natural gas and has about 700 employees with a market share of about 15 per cent. The sale, which follows that of AgipPetroli's Steuart Petroleum subsidiary in the US this year, is part of a plan to focus on markets in Europe and south-east Asia. However, Agip will remain active in Argentina in the lubricants sector.</p>

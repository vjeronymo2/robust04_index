			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 27 Apr -- "We are not starting from scratch;  a very good foundation already exists. Figuratively speaking,  the field has been plowed and, in principle, it is possible to  complete the Bosnian settlement process quickly enough," Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev commented on the results of his  working meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  which took place on 26 April in Geneva.    The partnership is working, he told Russian journalists. Our  Western colleagues are paying attention -- though, perhaps, not  immediately -- to what we say to them. They realize that it is  useless to rely on military solutions, and here, in Geneva, the  secretary of state emphasized the priority of the political  process.    The Russian minister recalled that a contact group  comprising  Russia, United States, the European Union, and the United  Nations had been set up and said it would become involved in  shuttle diplomacy in the near future. At the same time, work at  the level of ministers is also under way. The U.S. secretary of  state held meetings with his counterparts from France and  Britain on 25 April. "I have planned a meeting with French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and with German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel. I shall certainly be in touch with my British  counterpart, Douglas Hurd, as well," Andrey Kozyrev said.    "We are not starting from scratch; a very good foundation  already exists.

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Nigerian parties fall in line: Politicians back Babangida, though some dissent MILITARY coups have ousted civilians from power twice in Nigeria's recent history but the annulment of last month's presidential elections may have deprived Mr Moshood Abiola of power even before he was sworn in to office. By co-opting both political parties, Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party (SDP) and the rival National Republican Convention (NRC), to back the idea of an interim government, President Ibrahim Babangida may succeed in overturning the mandate of the ballot box aided by civilian leaders. The manipulation of the June polls had provoked serious divisions in the senior ranks of the military and mass protests on the streets of Lagos. When Gen Babangida threatened to dissolve all democratic institutions, the instinct for self-preservation brought the civilian politicians into line. This is the fourth setback since 1990 to Nigeria's transition to democracy, which is unlikely to reach completion by the August 27 deadline. Gen Babangida proposes to hand over to an unelected interim government which would be approved by the military regime. Except for an elected head of state, Mr Babangida has created every other democratic civilian institution during his overhaul of Nigerian politics and last week they came to his aid. Party officials, elected leaders of local and state governments and members of the two-tier national and state assemblies enjoy the status and privileges of office while the standard of living among most Nigerians is in sharp decline. In a speech broadcast at the end of June, the president said the elections, in which the SDP gained a clear majority, were so flawed that if the results were upheld it would provide an unsound basis for democracy after August. The NRC argued for fresh elections, which the SDP rejected. Then came the ultimatum: dissolution of all democratic institutions unless the parties agreed to co-operate with the government by Friday morning. From all over Nigeria, anxious politicians converged on Abuja, the federal capital, to talk to the government which had created their positions. 'State governors were lobbying hard, late into Thursday night, to prevent their jobs being scrapped,' said a federal government adviser in Abuja. The parties agreed to form an interim government provided that 'democratic institutions remain in place' and subject to agreement on 'the composition and tenure of the proposed government'. However, there remain signs of dissent. Mr Abiola yesterday reiterated his opposition to the deal, ruling out his participation in an interim civilian government. In a sign of political division, meanwhile, some members of the NRC were still demanding parity with the SDP. Gen Babangida has summoned all his senior security service officers to Abuja before announcing his next move. The future of Mr Abiola is unclear. The Sultan of Sokoto, head of Islam in Nigeria, made a rare political speech last Thursday in support of him. The sultan is foremost traditional ruler in northern Nigeria, where Mr Abiola as a southerner was expected to lack support. In June the SDP won a majority of states in the north including Kano, home of his opponent Mr Bashir Tofa. As Gen Babangida promised six years ago, Nigerian politics produced a leader cutting across ethnic boundaries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Ange Felix Patasse returned to Bangui  this afternoon at 1425 aboard a special aircraft provided by the  Federal Republic of Nigeria, after an 18-hour visit to Abuja,  where he attended the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin  Commission [LCBC]. In the VIP lounge of the Bangui-Npoko  International Airport, President Patasse announced that the  Central African Republic [CAR] had joined the LCBC. He stated  this during an interview with Adrien Ngueya:    [Begin recording] Ngueya: Mr. President, you left  Bangui yesterday and are back today. What was the CAR's  interest in being at the LCBC summit?    Patasse: Before answering your question I would  first of all like to discharge a duty, that of thanking the  entire population of the CAR, and informing them that I have  returned very comforted. This is because Africa has woken up. I  would also like to thank Gen. Sani Abacha, leader of the Federal  Republic of Nigeria, and the entire Nigerian people for the  reception accorded me yesterday and this morning. [passage  omitted]    As you know, the CAR is the main water source for the Lake  Chad. As I speak, Lake Chad is in danger. From an initial area  of 25,000 square kilometers, Lake Chad now covers only 1.5  square kilometers. Despite all that has been done, the  encroachment of the desert and the sahel continues. The only  thing we can do now is to try to save Lake Chad. Fortunately  the heads of state of the LCBC member countries understand that  they cannot find solutions to Lake Chad's problems without the  CAR.    In 1964 the countries bordering Lake Chad decided to create  the LCBC. At that time there was plenty of water, and in our  capacity as the then minister of rural development in this  country, we called for the adhesion of the CAR to the LCBC. Our  appeal was not heeded, and at that time we threatened to divert  the waters of the Laou and the Louam to the south, but wisdom  prevailed and today we have now become a member of the LCBC, not  to ask for anything, but as a member who has something to offer.  That is why the Abuja summit constitutes a decisive step on the  way to true regional integration. The four member countries --  Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon -- (?border on) Chad Lake, but  the CAR possesses the headwaters, which puts us in a privileged  situation. That is why the heads of state asked for my  presence, to know whether the CAR would like to be part and  parcel of this commission. There will be some readjustments to  make, because desertification is continuing, and it is not in  our interest to let it encroach upon our respective countries.  On this occasion we once again demonstrated our sense of  solidarity [words indistinct]. All the member countries  realized the looming danger, and we also stated that, since the  CAR is the backbone of the Lake Chad basin and that of the Congo  River, we will have a decisive role to play. That is why the  heads of state are counting on the CAR, so that we can fully  contribute to the achievement of this regional integration. We,  therefore, hoisted the CAR flag among those of the LCBC member  countries, and for us, within the framework of changes wanted by  the CAR people, this membership in the LCBC is additional proof  that we have recorded a victory. That is in a few words what I  can tell you. I came back very (?satisfied). I spoke on behalf  of the people of the CAR with pride and conviction that our  country has a decisive role to play. The ideals of Boganda  [deceased prominent political figure] and of the entire  population of the CAR -- who struggled for regional integration  -- are being proved correct each day. These are the ideals we  have adopted.    That is why we want a dynamic and concrete diplomacy, and  why  we have to use our knowledge and experience, so that Central  Africa, and in short Africa, can say that at last Africans have  understood the situation and are now pooling their resources for  the welfare of the entire African people. I thank you. [end  recording]    Outside this summit, President Patasse and Chadian Head of  State Idriss Deby held discussions this morning before leaving  Abuja. Our colleague, Koudeyere Nokonk, who was present in  Abuja, interviewed President Deby.    [Begin recording] Nokonk: Mr. President, the  deliberations of the summit were suspended yesterday to wait for  the CAR leader. Can you explain the reasons for that decision?    Deby: First of all I would like to air my views,  that is, Chad's views, on the membership of the CAR in the LCBC.  Chad is very happy about the CAR's new membership in the  commission. It is a great event which contributes to the  consolidation of the LCBC. In fact, we suspended the  deliberations after the first plenary session at the level of  the heads of state to wait for the arrival of my brother,  President Patasse. This is because we know that the CAR's  contribution to making decisions concerning the entire subregion  is essential. There was also a need for the CAR to participate  in decisions which had to be taken immediately after it joined  the LCBC. Furthermore, Patasse was willing and fully ready to  contribute, and that is why we deemed it useful to wait for him.    The arrival of President Patasse -- who actively took part  in  very (?significant) deliberations yesterday evening, and in the  decisions that you heard about and which continue (?to be  commented) on -- was a major event in all that can affect the  commission's future. I am happy about that, and I think that we  have (?strong) support within the LCBC, not only concerning the  CAR's membership, but also thanks to the new dimension that we  gave to the LCBC.

			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish, in its  13 March issue, carries five copyrighted articles with charts  totalling 2,500 words on pages 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving details of  an exclusive poll carried out by the Center for Public Opinion  Studies, CEOP. The results show that the Justicialist Party, PJ,  is "comfortably" ahead of the Radical Civic Union, UCR, in the  nationwide voters' preference for the national elections for  Constituent Assembly members that will be held on 10 April.    The poll was carried out between 16 February and 8 March  among 2,450 people in the largest voting districts of the  Republic: the Federal Capital, Greater Buenos Aires, Buenos  Aires Province, and in the cities of Cordoba, Mendoza, Rosario,  Tucuman, Santiago del Estero, and La Banda in Santiago del  Estero Province.    A 700-word article by Maria Seoane published on page 2  states  that, less than a month before the elections, 30.8 percent of  the voters favor the PJ, and 16.8 favor the UCR. This  difference is "overwhelming" in Buenos Aires Province where the  list headed by Governor Eduardo Duhalde has 33.5 percent while  that headed by Raul Alfonsin has 15 percent. In the Federal  Capital the PJ list headed by Carlos Corach, the legal and  technical secretary of the presidency, has 26.3 percent while  the UCR list headed by Jesus Rodriguez has 16 percent. The  results show that five out of 10 voters approve the PJ-UCR pact,  while two out of 10 disapprove. The article points out the  importance of a "landslide victory" by the PJ in Buenos Aires  Province given that it is the district that will elect the most  delegates which will give the PJ an absolute majority in the  national Constituent Assembly. In third place in Buenos Aires  Province comes Aldo Rico's Movement for Independence and  Dignity, Modin, with 7.2 percent, followed by the Grand Front  headed by Pino Solanas with 4.8 percent.    A 330-word unattributed article on page 3 comments on how  the  UCR has lost voters. It states that the UCR has lost half of  those who voted for it in the last October elections.    The same page carries another 300-word unattributed article  that states that the PJ in Buenos Aires Province is not the same  as that of the times of Peron because now it is equally  supported by the rich and poor. The middle class, the article  states, continues to favor the UCR. In the same district, Modin  mainly attracts former Peronists who are disenchanted with the  current PJ.    A 400-word article by Mariana Garcia published on page 4  describes the voters' preferences in the main polled cities. In  Cordoba city the UCR runs slightly ahead of the PJ by 24.6  percent to 24.5 percent, with the Democratic Centrist Union,  Ucede, coming third with 5.5 percent. In Mendoza City the PJ  leads with 37.9 percent, the UCR comes second with 16.6 percent,  and third comes the Democratic Party with 3.4 percent. In  Tucuman City, the PJ alliance has 34.3 percent, the Republican  Force has 25.6 percent, and the UCR has 12.9 percent. In Santa  Fe City and Rosario, the PJ has 28.3 percent, the UCR has 18.7  percent, while the Socialist Union has 6.1 percent. In the  cities of Santiago del Estero and La Banda, the UCR runs  comfortably ahead of the PJ with 29.1 to 15.1 percent, with  Modin in third place with 5.5 percent.    Finally, a 500-word unattributed article on pages 4 and 5  states that five out of 10 Argentines -- some 11 million voters  -- do not know what they are voting for in the upcoming 10 April  elections. A breakdown of this figure shows that 30.4 percent  have no idea what they are voting for; 13.9 percent think the  elections are to reelect President Menem; 2.1 percent think the  elections are to elect national deputies; 1.0 percent think they  are to national senators; 1.1 percent gave other answers; and  1.4 percent did not answer.</p>

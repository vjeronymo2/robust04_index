			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE BLEAK FOR MADAGASCAR'S LEMURS  </P> <P> The first rays of sunlight pierce the swatches of mist above the leafy green  roof of Madagascar's eastern rain forests.  </P> <P> The cacophony of twittering birds mingles with a penetrating howling that  appears to come from the lush treetops in the distance.  </P> <P> Maurice, the 24-year-old son of the local gamekeeper, recognizes the odd call  immediately. "Those are the indris, the largest woolly lemurs on the island,"  he explains.  </P> <P> Suddenly, a family of four indris answers a call from another group of the  species about a mile and a half away. The indris, known by the natives as  babakoto or amboanala, have the loudest call of the lemur family.  </P> <P> "There are mating calls or hedging-off cries designed to show whose territory  it is," said Maurice, who compared the lemur utterances to the jungle calls of  Asiatic gibbons.  </P> <P> The gray and black indri, with its long hind legs, short tail and doglike head,  measures about 2 feet long and belongs to a family of prosimians found only on  Madagascar and the neighboring Comoro Island to the northwest.  </P> <P> The future for the indris looks bleak. People here are gradually destroying the  lemurs' natural habitat by chopping down the trees on whose leaves the  creatures feed.  </P> <P> In spite of a ban, the local population is chopping down the rain forest to  provide grazing land for their herds of Zebu African cattle.  </P> <P> The percentage of Madagascar's 342,000 square miles given over to the rain  forest has declined from 72,000 square miles (21%) in the last century to  41,000 square miles or 12% now.  </P> <P> As the branches vanish, so do many unique species that are only to be found on  the island. Here 86% of flowering plants, 65% of birds and 99% of reptiles are  native to the island.  </P> <P> The forefathers of the indri probably drifted from mainland Africa to the  world's fourth-largest island on natural craft made of driftwood more than 40  million years ago.  </P> <P> The lemurs had the place largely to themselves, since only a few other mammals  managed to make the journey.  </P> <P> There are currently 30 types of woolly lemur on Madagascar. An estimated 12  species are thought to have died out since human beings began settling the  island 1,500 years ago, including two lemur species whose representatives  weighed up to 200 pounds each.  </P> <P> Survivors are the dwarf lemurs such as the mausmaki, or the bizarre-looking  aye-aye, which uses its bony middle finger to pry insect larvae from tree bark.  </P> <P> The indri remains the most impressive of the lemurs. Its bushy ears, cut-off  tail and howling cry have earned it an important place in Madagascan folklore.  </P> <P> Maurice tells the story: A young man called Koto who climbed a tree in order to  collect honey was attacked by a swarm of bees and could not get away.  </P> <P> An indri came along and carried the youngster on his back to a safe forest  clearing. Since then, the natives have dubbed the lemurs babakoto, or father of  Koto.  </P> <P> Frenchman Pierre Sonnerat chose the scientific name indri after discovering the  creatures at the end of the 18th Century. He was the first European to set eyes  on them but made the mistake of christening his find after the words used by a  local guide, meaning simply, "There he is."  </P> <P> Not a great deal is known about the indri, whose feeding habits have not been  researched by zoologists. No zoo has succeeded in keeping an indri in  captivity.  </P> <P> Eight indris were taken to the Jardin de Plantes in Paris in 1939, but all of  them died within a month, and not even the zoo here in the Madagascan capital  has been able to keep an Indri alive and well behind bars.  </P> <P> The indri's life style still puzzles animal behaviorists, who know for sure  only that the female of the species assumes the leading role in the family  groups of two to eight animals. Such female dominance is seldom found among  primates.  </P></p>

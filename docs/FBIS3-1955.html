The party Central Committee and the CMC have been paying  great attention to improving the party's work style and  promoting ethical integrity in the Army. In line with the  guidelines laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress, the CMC  made a decision to carry forward the Army's fine tradition and  intensify ethical construction. Leading comrades of the CMC have  repeatedly stressed at a number of important meetings the need  to regard the building of the party's work style and clean  government as a major issue. They took a personal interest in  cases, read reports on self-examination and self-rectification  by party committee standing committees in major military units,  giving instructions to them, and checked up on the work done by  major military units. On the inspection tour, they made it  their main task to investigate whether senior cadres had  maintained high standards of ethical integrity, and, whenever  they found anything wrong, they pointed it out in earnest and  saw to it that the mistake was corrected. The CMC has resolved  to straighten out Army production and operations and has called  special meetings to set out the tasks. On the CMC's  instructions, the General Political Department and the CMC  Discipline Inspection Commission sent work groups to nine major  military units to investigate the situation in building up the  party's work style and clean government. All these measures  have provided important guarantees for achieving the phased  objectives set by the CMC.    Party committees and leading organs at regimental level and  above throughout the Army have taken self-examination and self-  rectification as a practical step to put into effect the call by  the party Central Committee and the CMC to improve the party's  work style and maintain ethical integrity. They have paid great  attention to and meticulously organized the campaign. Leading  cadres and staff members at all levels carried out  self-examination and self-rectification in real earnest and  received education in the campaign, thus promoting the building  up of clean government.    In improving the party's work style and building clean  government, leadership at all levels has focused on the problems  affecting army building in line with actual conditions. Taking  into account their professional characteristics, various organs  instituted new rules and regulations to plug loopholes, uphold  unified standards, rigorously enforce work procedures, and  clearly define duties and powers. Many units took practical  measures to cut down administrative expenditure, relinquished  plans to refit their offices and expand their guest houses or  reallocate or conceal cars bought without authorization, and  rectified unhealthy tendencies, including indulging in  ostentation and extravagance. Leaders at all levels have  encouraged cadres to work industriously for the people through  the campaign to build clean and honest government. They also  reduced senior cadres' activities so that they could go down to  grass-roots units to help solve practical problems.    To comprehensively carry out the tasks set by the party  Central Committee and the CMC, party organizations at all levels  throughout the Army have paid equal attention to education and  to identifying and acting on violations of laws and discipline.  They conscientiously studied the third volume of the "Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping" to arm party-member cadres' minds with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. They conducted in-depth education on  the party and the Army's objectives, ideals, convictions, and  fine traditions to increase cadres' ability to resist hedonism,  extreme individualism, and the decadent way of life. Various  units throughout the Army also gave publicity to and commended  in many forms those units and individuals who acquitted  themselves splendidly in improving the party's work style and  building clean government in urging officers and men to preserve  the true qualities of veteran Red Army men.    A responsible member of the CMC Discipline Inspection  Commission said that though the Army had made fairly great  achievement in building up the party's work style and clean  government in the previous stage, it has a long way to go to  meet the requirements of the party Central Committee and the CMC  as well as the expectations of the people. It is a long-term  task to improve the party's work style and build clean and  honest government in the Army, so it is necessary to continue to  keep sustained attention on the job, he added.</p>

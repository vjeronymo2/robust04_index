			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: I flew around the hairpin at 130mph - Peter Whitehead swapped his commuter bike for a racer and tested his skill and courage on the track Motor cyclists live in a strange world of exaggeration. They travel at exotic speeds - always above 100mph - they can never be beaten away from traffic lights, and they never have bumps or scrapes, just heroic acts of derring-do. I know this because I am a motor cyclist. And like other motor cyclists, I have felt the rush of adrenalin that accompanies riding at speed and I have heard the call of the race track. I can also hear myself exaggerating: 'Put me on a superbike and I could break the lap record in a grand prix.' Such boasts are now so much hot exhaust. I have been caught out - sent to school and found wanting. On one of Britain's racing circuits I discovered that blasting around a track pushes you to the limit: it is a test of courage and confidence in your own skill and in the capabilities of the machine beneath you. As a birthday treat, I was packed off to Mallory Park in Leicestershire to join a class at the Drayton Croft Racing School. There it was that my bluff was called. I was fast but not quite fast enough. Exact speed is a mystery as the school's bikes have no speedometers but, without exaggeration, it must have been 100mph on the straights. I had begun to tremble even during the pre-school pep talk - 'If you see oil on the track, avoid it . . . If you 'high-side' it will hurt . . .' By the mid-session de-briefing I was speechless. When asked a simple question - 'How is it going?' - I felt strangled, my reply spluttering into nothing like a clapped-out engine refusing to start. Here I was, a commuter grappling with a highly-tuned 130mph-plus Honda VFR400R racing bike, and all I had learnt about riding and roadcraft now seemed wrong. I was looking ahead, seeing the coming bend and slowing as if on my way to work, rather than maximising my speed on every inch of track. I was weighed down by years of road experience on two and four wheels, and knocked off balance by the sudden need for naked aggression. Overcoming this background was clearly going to require more than the hour or so we had been allotted on the circuit. But my fellow students seemed to have grasped the idea rather more quickly as they flashed past in their turquoise or mauve leathers, hired for the occasion. There were 16 of us on the track for that hour-and-a-bit, divided into four groups of four, each with an instructor to guide us round the 1.4-mile circuit. Steve Bevington, the tutor allocated to my turquoise quartet, briefed us briefly and finished with: '. . . so follow me.' This was easier said than done. Out of the pits, round Gerards curve, along Stebbe Straight, and I was keeping up nicely with Bevington and the rest of the class. But a gap began to open up through the Lake Esses. 'Hang on,' I gasped as the screeching Honda engine below me begged to be shifted a gear or two higher. I closed up a little on the approach to the hairpin, fell back through the chicane, missed a gear as I was changing up on the adversely-cambered Devil's Elbow leading to the Kirkby Straight, and that was it. The thimbleful of confidence I had begun with was spilled on the track and only occasionally did I catch sight of my class-mates from this point on. We did meet up again in the pits for that mid-session 'discussion'. Bevington wanted to assess our performances; he sensibly arranged to assess mine separately. I had already witnessed the astonishing speed and nonchalance of the other instructors flashing past, one hand on the throttle, the other on the hip, as they glanced over their shoulders. This time the glance was at me, and to my total amazement Bevington raised his thumb. Back in the changing room, the 15 survivors - one had hurtled into a fence and been bundled into an ambulance with seemingly minor injuries - were handed their certificates and 'Rider Analysis Sheets'. Bevington's generous marking awarded me nine out of 10 for position on the track, application of instruction, and improvement. And he definitely hit the spot with his low marks for confidence and potential. 'Good improvement. Well done,' he wrote at the bottom. With those words glowing inside me, I set off home - at 150mph, of course.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Economists fear record PSBR total PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by less than expected last month, but economists warned that Britain was still heading for a record deficit this financial year. The public-sector borrowing requirement in May was Pounds 3.1bn, including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.8bn. That brought the cumulative PSBR total since April - the beginning of the financial year - to Pounds 6.6bn, compared with Pounds 5.6bn in the same period last year. Mr James Barty, UK economist at investment bank Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The two monthly figures we have had so far are on the whole consistent with a PSBR of around Pounds 32bn.' In the March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28bn, double the size of the previous year's deficit. With any economic upturn this year likely to be weak, the Treasury's figure is likely to be exceeded as tax receipts fail to live up to expectations and high unemployment keeps government spending high. Total cash receipts in May were Pounds 15.2bn and Pounds 32.1bn for the first two months of 1992-93, 2 per cent lower than the Pounds 32.8bn of receipts in the first two months of the previous financial year. Inland Revenue receipts in April and May were 4.5 per cent lower than a year earlier at Pounds 11.4bn. The Treasury said income tax collected to date this year had been boosted by the payment of bonuses before the general election to avoid planned tax increases by a Labour government. According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at investment bank Salomon Brothers, the month's figures were also cushioned by prompt receipt of poll tax payments. Lex, Page 22</p>

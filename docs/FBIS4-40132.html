			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 13, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas, in his traditional Monday interview to  Lithuanian Radio, said that no major problems exist in  Lithuanian-Russian relations.    Commenting on last week's two-day round of talks between the  Lithuanian and Russian interstate teams in Vilnius, Brazauskas  described as "too long" the break before the latest meeting.    The Lithuanian president expressed satisfaction over the  results of the latest round of negotiations. The delegations  have started taking concrete steps to solve the issue of  compensation by Russia for the damage caused to Lithuania by the  Soviet Union since 1940, according to Brazauskas. The  Lithuanian Ministry of Economics has been obligated to form a  working group to figure out the damage and to foresee a legal  basis for claiming a compensation.    Progress in talks on the debt of the former Russian  Vnesheconom Bank to Lithuania "also gives grounds for renewed  hope," Brazauskas said. A few years ago the Vnesheconom Bank  expropriated Lithuanian people's savings worth over 7 million  dollars and almost 150 million dollars belonging to Lithuanian  companies.    Speaking about unsettled problems, the Lithuanian president  mentioned the issue of Russian transit over Lithuanian  territory. Talks on the regulations for the transit of Russian  passengers and cargo, expected to be finalized by Lithuanian  negotiators soon, as well as on a visa regime for Russian  citizens are to resume in the near future, according to  Brazauskas.    "Of course, a lot of problems remain in the fields of  energy,  fishing and environment. So in the future both our negotiators  and the Foreign Ministry will have enough work," said the  Lithuanian president.    Brazauskas reiterated Lithuania's position that the military  potential in the Kalinigrad enclave of Russia should be  decreased and the region should be demilitarized eventually. "It  is an ideal area for the development of economic relations,"  said the Lithuanian president.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A four-day provincial work meeting on rural  diversified economy, which was held by the provincial party  committee and government, ended in Yingshan County on 23 April.  The meeting stressed: Making a breakthrough in developing a  diversified economy is an important content of the guiding  thought of the provincial party committee and government for  developing agriculture and the rural economy. It is an  important aspect of the five breakthrough points in the economic  work of the whole province this year. It is an important  measure for fulfilling the entire strategic plan for economic  development of the whole province, and for attaining the target  of small-scale prosperity. Proceeding from the high plane of  reform, development and stability, and ensuring the sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, the  party committees and governments at all levels must fully  understand the importance of developing a diversified economy.  They must further enhance their sense of urgency. While  stabilizing the development of the production of grain, cotton  and edible oil, they must treat the diversified economy as a key  undertaking in agriculture and the rural economy. They must  grasp it as a strategic focal point for attaining small-scale  prosperity in rural areas. They must make great efforts to  organize the masses to make a breakthrough in the development of  a diversified economy.    Those who attended the meeting included Governor Jia Zhijie,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Hui Liangyu,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and chairman  of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Vice Governor Wang Shengtie,  member of the provincial party committee standing committee;  (Song Guozheng), member of the provincial party committee  standing committee; Zhou Zibai, vice chairman of the provincial  CPPCC committee; Zhang Hongxiang, secretary general of the  provincial party committee; and responsible persons of the  relevant departments directly under provincial authorities,  prefectures, cities, autonomous prefectures, and Shennongjia  forest zone; as well as responsible comrades of some counties  and cities.    At a preparatory meeting, Jia Zhijie said: The present  provincial work meeting on diversified economy in rural areas is  the first high-standard meeting in our province's history of  developing a diversified economy. It is necessary to build up  momentum, make a big issue of, and greatly promote the drive to  make a breakthrough in developing a diversified economy.  [passage omitted]    The meeting clearly pointed out: It is necessary to fully  understand the great strategic importance of developing a  diversified economy, and to enhance our sense of urgency in  making a breakthrough in the development of a diversified  economy. Since reform and opening up, the diversified economy  in our province has been greatly developed. However, the  development was uneven in different localities, trades, and  spheres. Compared with other advanced areas throughout the  country, our pace of development is slow. As a whole, we have  not yet assigned the diversified economy a proper position.  Under such circumstances, our top-priority task is to guide our  cadres and masses to enhance their understanding, and further  realize that developing a diversified economy is an important  breakthrough point for optimizing the agricultural structure;  enhancing economic efficiency; and promoting the sustained,  rapid and healthy development of the rural economy. It is an  important channel for absorbing the surplus labor force,  increasing peasants' income, and ensuring rural stability and  social progress. It is also a hope for speeding up the  development of town and township enterprises, promoting county  and township finances, ensuring good results of collectives and  villages, expanding exports, and earning more foreign exchange.    The meeting urged a correct analysis of the new situation  facing the rural areas, earnestly summing up new experiences  achieved by various localities, and making still more clear the  idea of developing a diversified economy. With regard to  coordination work, we must persist in the principle of  integrating the stable production of grain, cotton and edible  oil with a breakthrough in the development of a diversified  economy. With regard to the guideline for production, we must  persist in integrating the stable development of major crops  with the efforts to assail weak links. With regard to the  decision on what kinds of crops to plant, we must persist in  integrating market demand with the strong points of local  natural resources. [passage omitted)    The meeting emphasized: To speed up the development of a  diversified economy, we must grasp the principal contradictions,  mainly assail the weak links, and effect a breakthrough in terms  of strategic measures. First, we must make a breakthrough in  developing the market and enlivening the commodity flow. We  must promote development through stimulating the commodity flow.  Second, We must make a breakthrough in developing key  processing industries so as to vigorously promote the  industrialization process. Third, we must make a breakthrough  in input. We must ensure the development of a diversified  economy in terms of funds. Fourth, we must make a breakthrough  in terms of science and technology so as to upgrade the level  and increase the efficiency of our diversified economy.  [passage omitted]</p>

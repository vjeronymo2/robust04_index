			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED SECRETARY RETURNS WITH A GUN  </P> <P> A secretary who had been fired from her job at a Century City law firm returned  with a gun Friday but surrendered without incident after a lawyer coolly  excused himself and summoned authorities, police said.  </P> <P> Rone Ellis, about 35, was booked at the West Los Angeles Division on suspicion  of assault with a deadly weapon. Detective Steve Osti said Ellis readily  complied when officers ordered her out of a 34th floor office at Sidely &amp;  Austin, 2049 Century Park East.  </P> <P> Managing partner Charles Vogel said Ellis told police that she was "just trying  to scare" those in the office. "Well," Vogel added, "she succeeded. It was a  good act."  </P> <P> Ellis was fired on Wednesday for a reason Vogel declined to discuss. He said  the North Hollywood resident returned about noon Friday, went to the office of  Rex Beaber, sat at the attorney's desk and said she wanted to talk.  </P> <P> "Just a moment and I'll continue that thought with you," Vogel quoted Beaber as  saying just before leaving the office to summon help.  </P> <P> Other employees were evacuated while waiting for police to arrive. They were  back to work by 1:30 p.m., Ellis said.  </P></p>

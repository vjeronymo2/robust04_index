In recent years, with the  constant deepening of reform and opening up, various localities  have made bold experiments and positive explorations in light of  their own conditions. In the last two years, in particular,  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his  southern China tour and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, reform of the property rights  system has markedly gathered pace and made positive progress.    According to a briefing by a comrade from the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy, reform of the property  rights system in China has made impressive progress in the  following aspects:    --Fundamental changes have taken place in the traditional  ownership pattern and an ownership structure with the public  economy as the main body and the common development of many  economic sectors has gradually taken shape. The proportion of  the output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the  total industrial output value dropped from 77.6 percent in 1978  to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992, while that of collective  industrial enterprises rose from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent,  and that of foreign-invested, self- employed, and private  industrial enterprises grew from zero to 13.5 percent.    --Experiments in transforming enterprises into joint-stock  companies have developed healthily. By the end of 1993, there  were more than 4,000 enterprises across the country, with a  total stock market value of around 400 billion yuan,  experimenting with the joint-stock system; over 200 joint-stock  companies were listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen; and six large  enterprises including the Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. and  Qingdao Brewery issued stocks in Hong Kong. Rural enterprises  under the cooperative shares system have shown momentum of rapid  development.    --Introduction of foreign capital into the country and  capital export have further expanded. There are now 117  countries and regions investing in China. Last year, China  signed agreements worth $110.852 billion in foreign capital,  with the actual foreign capital input at $25.759 billion.    --A large number of small state-owned enterprises are  operated by civilians. Such enterprises account for a  considerable proportion in various provinces, prefectures, and  counties in northeast, northwest, east, and central south China.  The proportion is 60 percent in Henan, 43 percent in Hebei, 35  percent in Nanjing, 60 percent in Chongqing, and 60 percent in  Beijing's commerce department and its affiliated organizations.    --Property rights exchanges have been gradually set up, and  an important step has been taken in experimenting on the public  sale of state-owned enterprises and their "grafting" with  foreign capital. Property rights exchanges have so far been set  up in over 20 cities and areas in over 10 provinces, and their  business has become brisker with each passing day. Hunan  Province put 220 enterprises on sale last year and sold 16 of  them at a total value of 63.7 million yuan. Quanzhou City  "grafted" all its state-owned enterprises (41 in all) and Wuxi  City over half (170) of its large and medium-sized enterprises.    --Like a new force suddenly coming to the fore, rural  enterprises under the cooperative shares system have become  another invention of the peasant masses. Such enterprises grew  so rapidly last year that they accounted for 10 percent of the  total number of township and town enterprises across the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 1 SAPA -- Housing Minister Louis  Shill on Tuesday [1 March] denied that the government's  announcement of a R[rand]90 billion housing plan was premature  and accused the National Housing Forum [NHF] of delaying tactics  to obstruct its implementation.    "By frustrating the housing process rather than encouraging  it, my impression is that the forum has now yielded completely  to political influences which sole purpose is to delay the  delivery of housing until after the election for political  gain," Mr Shill said in a statement.    Discussions with mortgage lending organisations were far  advanced and it would be "sad" if the forum should try to impede  progress in this regard. He was reacting to NHF criticism that  the announcement was unilateral, premature and jeopardised a  resolution on the housing crisis.    Mr Shill pointed out that the scheme had been negotiated  with  housing role players for about a year and that it had been  recommended by the fully representative National Housing Board.    "The government has not been premature in announcing the  scheme. If anything, we stand accused of allowing the NHF of  delaying the process for too long." [as received]    The NHF had literally since its inception delayed the  discussions on the grant scheme, he said. "The suggestion that  we have to delay the process -- which in fact means that the  regional housing boards cannot proceed with their task until the  administrative arrangements have been approved by the forum --  is preposterous. This decision was based on lengthy discussions  and expert advice. Any accusations of premature and unilateral  action is based on a frustration of not being able to delay  matters any further."    Citing examples, Mr Shill said in March last year the NHF  declared December 1993 as their target date for resolving the  subsidy policy but the body did not start discussions until  September 1993 despite requests by him.    It was then agreed by the Department of National Housing and  the NHF that the target date for finalising the subsidy policy  would be November 1993, but through further delays documentation  was only agreed upon on December 14 1993, after which it was  submitted to the National Housing Board for advice.    "The National Housing Board recommended that the minister  (Mr  Shill) proceed with the scheme but at this late stage the NHF  insisted on further changes and wanted to refer the matter to  their plenary meeting on March 14, 1994."    He was happy to discuss housing matters with the forum but  the decision to proceed with the scheme and when to announce it  remained his responsibility, Mr Shill said.</p>

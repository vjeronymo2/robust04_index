			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Observer: Remorse Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds, is not wont to drop ill-considered remarks, but he must be regretting some he made at a British Chamber of Commerce lunch in Tokyo a month back. He told assembled bus- inessmen that Hongkong Bank's attempt to acquire Midland had some 'hurdles' to overcome, that it would 'take a bit of time', but that 'because of the strategic basis to the argument the prob- ability is that it will go ahead'. The remarks were of course made before Lloyds joined the battle for Midland.</p>

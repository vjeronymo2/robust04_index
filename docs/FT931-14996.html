			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US trade officials hold out little hope of early end to Uruguay Round US TRADE officials in Geneva yesterday held out little prospect of an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round but said negotiations would continue in the hope of progress by next Tuesday's stock-taking meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee, writes Frances Williams. Trade negotiators will try to present the Clinton administration, which takes office the following day, with as few outstanding problems as possible, in the dwindling hope that an accord can still be reached before the current US negotiators' authority expires on March 2. A senior US negotiator said a number of 'significant sticking points' remained in talks with the EC on industrial tariffs, and there had been little progress in resolving vital issues in separate discussions on the draft package of Uruguay Round rules. There were also still differences with the EC over agriculture.</p>

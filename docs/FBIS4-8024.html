			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received the following announcement by the  Press Center of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina:    On 7 April 1994, beginning at 1800, Army General Rasim Delic  issued the order to units of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina on a general cease-fire with the Serbian  aggressor's side to last 24 hours. This order ensued as a result  of the insistence of the Security Council and Mr. Akashi in  order to create necessary conditions for military-political  talks with the representatives of the Serbian aggressor. The  order issued to the units of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina fully implies meeting the demands presented  by representatives of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This above all applies to stopping the  offensive of the Serbian aggressor's forces on Gorazde and  Bihac, which was presented to General Rose and the public during  the day.</p>

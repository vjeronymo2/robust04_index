The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry said Saturday it had set this year's rice output at  5.08 million tons (37.2 million sok), down 4.6 percent from 5.35  million tons in 1993, a bad crop year due to cool summer weather.    Farmland was estimated to drop 21,000 hectares to 1.11  million hectares based on the past five-year average decrease,  with each 300 pyong (990 square meters) producing 456 kilograms  for this year's output quota. As a result, in view of the 1993  provisional record of 96.9 percent, the rice self-sufficiency  rate is expected to be under 100 percent in 1994 (estimated at  89.1 percent) and 1995 (95.9 percent), but Korea will attain 100  percent self-sufficiency in edible rice by 2001 The ministry  said it had revised this year's rice policy to put quality above  quantity in the wake of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  trade agreement.</p>

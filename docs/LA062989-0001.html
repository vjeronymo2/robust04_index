			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> Expressions of conflicting ideology, even when contained in symbolic speech on  the fringe of the extreme, deserve protection from government sanction. The  willingness to allow the free exchange of ideas and philosophy is the core of  the American democratic process. Any decision other than the courageous and  honorable one refusing to place off limits the ultimate symbol of our declared  liberty would have been clearly incorrect.  </P> <P> ALVIN M.

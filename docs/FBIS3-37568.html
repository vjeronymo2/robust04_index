Along with the main draft prepared by the  constitutional commission, an alternative draft was examined,  which was proposed by one of the republic's public movements.  The latter was finally adopted as a basis: it proposes the  introduction of a unicameral parliament and the post of  nationally elected head of the republic. Premier Vyacheslav  Khudyayev, who put forward the initiative to call a republican  constitutional conference, suggested that, in addition to  deputies, representatives of organs of local governments, public  organizations, and entrepreneurs should take part in its  proceedings. According to the premier, however, the Council of  Ministers "does not intend to convene the constitutional  conference independently from parliament."</p>

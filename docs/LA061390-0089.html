			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CENTURY 21 DROPS ITS L.A. AD AGENCY;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: MCCANN-ERICKSON LOSES THE $30-MILLION ACCOUNT TO A MINNEAPOLIS  FIRM. THE MOVE IS A BLOW TO THE LOCAL INDUSTRY.  </P> <P> In one of the biggest advertising deals this year, Century 21 Real Estate Corp.  on Tuesday awarded its $30-million national account to Minneapolis-Advertising,  dropping incumbent McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The decision to split with the agency, which had the account for seven years,  is a blow to the local advertising market because it pulls a trophy account and  major piece of business out of Southern California.  </P> <P> Irvine-based Century 21's switch, which takes effect in 60 days, also  underscores the tenuous relationships between ad agencies and real estate  firms. As the real estate market has softened, several large real estate  companies have switched agencies in recent months.  </P> <P> "Advertising is a high-visibility component of any business, and it often  translates to problems (for the ad agency) when business takes a downturn,"  said Rich Edler, managing director of McCann-Erickson/L.A.  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate and BBDO/Los Angeles parted company in  January after four years. Coldwell last month gave its $15-million national  account to the Los Angeles office of Grey Advertising. And in April, Coldwell  Banker Commercial switched its $5-million account to the Los Angeles office of  Della Femina, McNamee WCRS after J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles resigned from  the account.  </P> <P> Century 21, the nation's largest franchiser of real estate brokerage services,  put its account up for grabs in March. The company said more than 100 agencies  initially responded to its call for proposals and that seven agencies were  invited to make creative presentations -- basically, to outline their proposed  ad campaigns -- at its headquarters last week.  </P> <P> McCann-Erickson/L.A. was one of the contenders, as was the firm's New York  office. Two other Southern California firms, Chiat/Day/Mojo of Venice and  D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles/L.A., also were finalists.  </P> <P> A Century 21 spokesman said Tuesday that the company was not unhappy with  McCann-Erickson's work but had put the account up for review in March because  it wanted to see ideas offered by other firms.  </P> <P> But Bruce Oseland, Century 21's senior vice president for marketing, said in  March that when an account is put up for review "there generally is some level  of concern about a particular aspect of the advertising." He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> McCann Erickson's Edler said loss of the account would result in a staff  reduction, but he could not say how many jobs would be lost. The firm employs  120 in the Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> "From time to time," Edler said, "clients and agencies separate, and sometimes  it is difficult to understand exactly why.  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Berlin to keep disputed properties BERLIN'S city government said yesterday it would take over more than DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) worth of properties in east Berlin, instead of allowing their former owners to claim them. Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman of the Berlin Finance Office, said the decision, taken on Tuesday night, would end the deadlock in rebuilding east Berlin, caused by rival property claims. The ruling is expected to be legally challenged by former owners. The decision runs counter to a previous recommendation by the German government that the properties, which were confiscated by occupying Soviet forces shortly after East Germany was established in October 1949, should be returned to their previous owners. Mr Kammradt estimated that 'considerably more' than DM10bn worth of property would be affected. Among the most valuable real estate to revert to the city is a sprawling site on Leipziger Platz, which had belonged to the Jewish-owned Wertheim department store chain, now part of the Hertie group. Prime sites owned by the Hohenzollern family, descendants of the former emperor of Germany, were also affected by the decision. A total of 589 companies and 951 property sites, mainly in the inner-city Mitte district, is being claimed by the city, although it represents only a small proportion of all buildings that might be subject to claims by former owners. Mr Kammradt said city-owned property could now be developed by investors who might include some of the former owners. It was up to the Bonn government to decide whether restitution would be paid to former Jewish owners, their heirs or the Jewish Claims Commission, he said. Under the German unification treaty, three categories were excluded from claims made by former owners: property confiscated from former Nazi activists, from war criminals and from buyers of property owned by Jews forced to sell in the 1930s. Berlin's government said it had approved the merger of three state-owned banks, creating one of Germany's top 10 financial institutions, Reuter reports from Berlin. The Berlin state government said the city's coalition of Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats had approved the merger of Berliner Bank, Landesbank Berlin and Pfandbrief-Kreditanstalt. The new company will be called the Berliner Banken Holding AG and will start operations in 1994. Approval clears the way for the city to draft a law to put the three institutions under one roof. 'It will now be possible to finance large projects in Berlin,' said Mayor Eberhard Diepgen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mecca, May 16, IRNA -- The headquarters of the  representative of the leader of the Islamic revolution here was  surrounded by the Saudi police early Monday [16 May] morning on  the eve of the "Disavowal of the Unbelievers" ceremony, due here  Tuesday.    The Saudi police has increased the number of personnel near  the headquarters and stationed tens of military vehicles  carrying security forces and commandos and 10 armoured personnel  carriers equipped with machine gun and water cannon. The forces  are also equipped with tear gas.    Last year, the Saudi police surrounded the headquarters a  day  before the rally and prevented people from approaching the  place. The siege was lifted when pilgrims left for 'Arafat and  Manni deserts for special Hajj rituals.    This year, the headquarters was surrounded after a large  gathering of Muslims in solidarity with Bosnian people ended.  Iran declared May 15 the Day of Support for Bosnian People.    Hojatt ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader's  representative for Hajj-related affairs, said that the Disavowal  of Unbelievers ceremony would be held in front of the  headquarters on Tuesday if no restrictions are set by the Saudi  Government. He called on pilgrims to remain calm and orderly  during the ceremony.</p>

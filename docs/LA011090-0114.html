			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SUCH A DEAL: When Disneyland signed up former President Ronald Reagan for its  35th anniversary celebration Thursday (A1), it received Reagan's bargain rate.  . . . He charged a Japanese media conglomerate $2 million for appearances last  October, but his trip to the Magic Kingdom is costing the park only $50,000 in  the way of a donation to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. . . . Reagan was  invited, along with actor Robert Cummings and TV personality Art Linkletter,  because the three men hosted the park's opening-day telecast on July 17, 1955.  Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Colonel General Ante Roso, commander </F> of the Croatian Defense Council, HVO, by unidentified  correspondent in Siroki Brijeg; from the "Picture vs. Picture"  program--live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers, it is my pleasure  to welcome for the first time this evening our guest on the  "Picture vs. Picture" program, Mr. Ante Roso, commander of the  Croatian Defense Council, who is in the studio in Siroki Brijeg.  Good evening, General Roso.    [Roso] Good evening, Madam.    [Correspondent] Welcome to "Picture vs. Picture."    [Roso] Thank you.    [Correspondent] If I am not mistaken, this is your first  public appearance since you became HVO commander two months ago.  Why have you waited so long?    [Roso] I was rather busy.    [Correspondent] General, you had a meeting yesterday with  Gen. Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina forces, in  order to agree upon the modalities of the cease-fire that should  come into effect on 15 January. All that is in line with the  Bonn agreement between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic. What  specifically did you agree on?    [Roso] It seems to me that many things have been interpreted  wrongly. We have not agreed on anything. We are waiting for  basic political documents, that is, certain specific political  guidelines. Consequently, we only agreed that we can proceed to  establish specific modalities of the cease-fire. Nothing else  was agreed upon, and nothing was signed.    [Correspondent] President Izetbegovic indicated yesterday  that he would not accept the Croatian president's proposal.  Will that have an impact? What impact will it have on further  cease-fire agreements?    [Roso] You see, as long as we are talking about the  political  behavior of the Muslim side, it is unpredictable. This means  that I am not a prophet, and I cannot tell you exactly whether  or not there will be a cease-fire, whether or not we will  achieve anything because there is nothing concrete. We have  nothing concrete on which to base our statements as to what is  really going on for the public, or even for the Army and  everyone else. It is very difficult to interpret such behavior.    [Correspondent] If I am not wrong, you had a meeting with  Gen. Delic in Visoko on 17 December last year, and you agreed on  a cease-fire that was to last from 23 December to 3 January. It  was exactly then that the Muslims launched a fierce offensive on  the Lasva valley. Can you comment on this and describe the  situation now?    [Roso] You see, we only talked about things in Visoko last  time. Nothing was signed, and there was no official document.  All we asked for was to spend the Christmas and New Year  holidays in peace. As you know yourself, that verbal agreement  was not honored, and we drew specific conclusions from such  behavior. We heightened combat readiness, and the HVO was then  ready to respond to any attack or surprise. We waited for the  holidays and New Year in a state of readiness.    [Correspondent] What is the situation like now? Where is the  fiercest fighting taking place?    [Roso] The situation now is relatively complex. Fighting is  going on more or less everywhere--mainly in central  Bosnia--where the intensity of armed clashes has reached a  climax that could turn into a larger-scale escalation. More  precisely, when I returned from Sarajevo yesterday, the Muslim  army was continuing its offensive in the Vitez area from three  directions, as well as against Novi Travnik. Thank God, all the  attacks have been repelled, and the Croat nation, as well as the  army, has retained its positions, .    [Correspondent] General, some newspapers in Croatia are  speculating about the fall of Vitez, the withdrawal of the HVO  forces, and a possible fall of the arms factory in Vitez into  the Muslims' hands. Is that possible?    [Roso] You see, talking about the fall of Vitez, I would  like  to tell those eggheads that they are a bit abstract. That is  out of the question as long as we are alive here, and as long as  there are Croats in central Bosnia. This is not only my own  stubbornness, or my own determination, but the will of the  people whom I have seen recently. I even had the honor to meet  some of them. It is out of the question that a part of Croat  territory where the Croats in central Bosnia live should be  brought into question at all and at any moment. We will surely  not only fight, but also keep control of the territory.    Concerning Vitez itself and the industrial plant, I  personally issued a written order that the explosives factory in  Vitez be destroyed if necessary, regardless of the consequences.  Of course, we will take care of the people and so on, and  provide maximal safety during such an operation. It is  certain, however, that we will hand over the factory in one  piece to no one other than the Croatian Defense Council.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Tell us, what is the role of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To what degree are  they impartial?    [Roso] You see, I personally believe that in such a complex  environment as Bosnia-Herzegovina, ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, is in,  it is very difficult to treat everyone in a fair way. I  perfectly understand that side. I think that UNPROFOR's  neutrality is questionable. The contacts between the HVO and  UNPROFOR are relatively fair. We honor what we have pledged to  honor, which is the free passage of humanitarian convoys and  certain relations of a more or less technical and military  nature. We have had no other relations with them.    [Correspondent] There has been talk recently that the blue  helmets could withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the  military point of view, what would happen if they did withdraw?    [Roso] In my opinion, if the UN forces withdraw from the  territory that they are occupying now, nothing special would  happen. That is my personal opinion. I am more than convinced  that this is nothing spectacular, but simply a way of exerting  pressure on all three sides.    I believe that it is not difficult to predict what would  happen in the field if they withdrew.    [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, is the likelihood of  NATO's military intervention?    [Roso] I think that is fiction. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Then, of course, the questions arise: How  satisfied are you with the situation within the HVO ranks? Are  there any groups which are evading your control? What kind of  situation did you find when you took up your post, and what is  it like now?    [Roso] You see, I usually say: an event is not a process;  the  situation is as it is; we cannot create everything at the same  time and have a perfectly formed, elite army in legal and  military terms. The army is being formed gradually; it is the  reality of the people in this small area, the people who  displayed more than just courage, who had to sacrifice a lot for  this reality and freedom, and who are continuing to make  sacrifices in a chivalrous and brave manner.    We are undergoing an administrative and legal reorganization  of the armed forces on this part of Croatian territory. The  HVO, like any other army, is embarking on its restructuring.  The role of the commander, it seems to me, does not mean all  that much. He only partially plays the role of an intermediary,  while the army as a whole, as a culture, as a defense, is a  whole process. It does not depend only on me, or on my  successor or predecessor. The creation of the armed forces in  the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna will take time, but it is an  interesting period in the history of this people.    [Correspondent] Of course, journalists [words indistinct]  that we lack information. But the fact is that there seems to  have been some kind of information block recently, because,  prior to Krizeljcevo Selo, the world was only concerned about  the suffering of the Muslims but not of the Croats. What do you  think about that?    [Roso] It is very simple. Justice can have a bad roll.  Everybody seeks it, but nobody really wants it. It appears when  someone needs it. These are certainly orchestrated topics with  set scenarios, and that should not bother us too much. We had  great difficulty in breaking the information blockade as regards  the Croats, as always. We have too much experience with such  things. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] I must not forget to ask you: What is  happening with the HVO members in Sarajevo?    [Roso] The HVO members in Sarajevo have been disarmed and  they are no longer -- for the time being -- an active official  part of the HVO. You yourself know that there are several  versions of events, but there is one realistic -- that they are  completely disarmed and deprived of their rights as regards the  Croatian national, ethnic body of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna.    [Correspondent] What is the likelihood -- in your opinion  and  based on your experince so far -- of re-establishing a military  alliance between the Croats and the Muslims?    [Roso] This is a complex question. I think that no Croat  today can give you a definitive answer. But everything is  possible in human life and in the life of a country. For  example, France and Germany were at war for centuries and today,  as far as I know, they are relatively close allies.    I think that the time is not yet ripe to talk about an  alliance. But we can talk about certain relations, at least  human relations. We have to communicate, we have to live, we  have to keep going further as a human community because others  are observing us. Consequently, we will treat the Muslims as we  would any other people.    [Correspondent] You are a soldier with truly rich military  experience. From the military viewpoint, how do you anticipate  developments and the military balance in the next few months?    [Roso] I think that the problem in Bosnia, particularly, and  in Herzegovina, has to be taken very seriously for several  reasons. One reason is that this is a question of the survival  of our people, of the Croatian people, on its legal, historic,  ethnic territory. We cannot raise any obstruction to this,  apart from reality. [sentence as heard] We have to survive  there. There is no Bosnia without the Croats. Everybody must  understand this, and this must be completely clear to everyone.    [Correspondent] But the front is very large. Excuse me, will  this be possible without the intervention of the military forces  of the Republic of Croatia.    [Roso] We do not need the Croatian Army. I deeply respect  it, but we have enough people and technical equipment and we  know how to use it. We have technologically mastered the use of  certain materials. We have certainly introduced some up-to-date  military technology, some new types of equipment, and if  necessary we will use it. I think that we have not yet reached  that option, but I can guarantee this before God: We will use  anything to preserve the Croatian people's territory in  Herceg-Bosna.</p>

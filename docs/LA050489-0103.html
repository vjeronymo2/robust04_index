			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UMPIRE DEFENDS WALKOUT;  </P> <P> VETERAN OFFICIAL SAYS ABUSE FROM CSUN PROMPTED DEPARTURE  </P> <P> A veteran umpire who walked off the field during the sixth inning of a  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game between Cal State Northridge  and UC Riverside said Wednesday that he did so because it was his only  recourse.  </P> <P> Bob Hernandez, who has umpired at the collegiate level for 13 years, departed  Tuesday's game, which Northridge eventually won, 12-10, after several ejections  and a bizarre play.  </P> <P> Hernandez, who was the base umpire, said that plate umpire Frank Mason, a  20-year veteran, should have called a forfeit after Northridge coaches had  become abusive and violated NCAA rules by communicating with their players and  the umpires after their ejections.  </P> <P> "Never in my 15 years of officiating at all levels have I been subjected to  something like that," said Hernandez, who is scheduled to work a Division I  regional and is an alternate for the Division I World Series. "There's  something called professionalism, and yesterday there was no professionalism on  that field.  </P> <P> "I don't know how it would have ended if I had stayed. . . . If I had it to do  over again, I'd do the exact same thing."  </P> <P> Mason declined comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dale Williams, president of the Southern California Collegiate Baseball Umpires  Assn. and in his 31st year as an umpire, said he could not recall a similar  incident at the collegiate level. Tom Morgan, the commissioner of the CCAA,  said that Hernandez's exodus was a first for the conference.  </P> <P> "It's a black eye for all of us," Riverside Coach Jack Smitheran said.  </P> <P> The chain of events that led to Hernandez's departure began in the fifth inning  of the game at the Riverside Sports Complex and featured the ejections of  Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, Northridge assistant Randy Day and Northridge  players Greg Shockey and Anton Siegl.  </P> <P> With none out in the fifth and Northridge leading, 5-3, Matador baserunner  Chae-Ho Chong collided with Riverside second baseman John Holmes as Holmes  attempted to field a ground ball hit by Rusty McLain.  </P> <P> Hernandez, 48, appeared to have ruled that no interference had occurred.  Smitheran approached Hernandez, and, after a short discussion, Hernandez called  Chong out.  </P> <P> Day, the third-base coach, and Kernen were both ejected for arguing vehemently  about the call. Kernen said he objected to the call being reversed.  </P> <P> "I would prefer that the coaches coach and the umpires umpire," Kernen said. "I  don't think I would have argued if he (Hernandez) made the call. All I ask him  to do is make his own call and we'll live with the result."  </P> <P> Shockey, a freshman center fielder, was ejected by Hernandez later in the  inning for arguing after he was thrown out at second trying to stretch a single  into a double.  </P> <P> The climactic event, however, was triggered in the sixth inning when Northridge  third baseman Greg Hansen bobbled a ground ball and accidentally hit Hernandez  with an off-line throw to first that enabled Riverside to score a run.  </P> <P> Hernandez, after being hit by the throw, was subjected to a verbal hailstorm  from Kernen, who was seated in the bleachers behind the Northridge dugout.  According to NCAA rules, an ejected player or coach must leave the field and  dugout area immediately and is not allowed to communicate with his team or the  umpires. Failure to abide by the rule is grounds for forfeiture.  </P> <P> Hernandez said that Day communicated with Northridge players after being  ejected but that he did not take action "to give the players the benefit of the  doubt."  </P> <P> Hernandez said that while Kernen was berating him, he indicated to Mason three  times that a forfeit should be called. Mason, who as plate umpire had sole  authority to forfeit the game, did not acknowledge the request. Hernandez then  departed, leaving Mason to finish the game by himself.  </P> <P> "When a person (Kernen) is in a tirade like that, there is no telling what can  happen," Hernandez said. "There's no other way to keep control. The only  recourse you have after they've been ejected is call for a forfeit."  </P> <P> "If the shoe would have been on the other foot, I would have walked with my  partner."  </P> <P> Siegl was ejected in the seventh after hitting Riverside first baseman Logan  Ostrander with a forearm while running out a grounder.  </P> <P> Hernandez said that as far as he is concerned the entire incident is over.  Kernen agreed.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a historical event as far as I'm concerned," Kernen said.  "Meaning, it's in the past."  </P></p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Used cars and after sales work curb Reg Vardy decline to 4% GROWTH IN the sales of used cars and in repairs and servicing helped to cushion Reg Vardy, the motor dealer, against the falling new car market in the six months to October 31. Pre-tax profit slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 2.1m) on a near Pounds 2m increase in turnover to Pounds 95.6m. Interest costs rose to Pounds 721,000 (Pounds 651,000), although debt of Pounds 4.3m was wiped out in October by a Pounds 12.9m placing and open offer. Nearly Pounds 2m has been invested in a Nissan dealership after Vardy won the first franchise from the Japanese manufacturer's new distribution company. The Tyne and Wear-based group announced its results as the UK industry was digesting dismal figures showing that new car sales fell by 21 per cent to 1.59m units in 1991, nearly a third less than the 2.3m record set in 1989. Mr Peter Vardy, chairman and holder of 53 per cent of the equity, reckoned that the new car market would start to grow again this year, gaining perhaps 10 to 12 per cent. However, because of political uncertainty ahead of the Budget and the general election, the recovery would not benefit the group in its current financial year. He also estimated that interim pre-tax profits would have been about Pounds 500,000 higher had it not been for finance companies and banks tightening up on credit. 'We used to get 80 to 85 per cent of deals accepted by finance companies; in this period it was 60 to 65 per cent.' He claimed the sale of 1,300 new cars had been lost. The bulk of Vardy's customers are individuals rather than companies. Mr Graeme Potts, managing director, said that three or four years ago, sales of new and used cars were roughly equal, now the ratio was three to one in favour of used vehicles in the private market. Compared with the first half of last year, used volume car sales were 13 per cent up, compensating for a 7 per cent fall in new car sales. Altogether the group sold 12,365 (11,865) units from 18 outlets. The amount of gross profit contributed by repairs and servicing went up from 44 to 49 per cent, as poorly performing dealerships bought a couple of years ago improved. About 60 per cent of sales and a much higher proportion of profit came from the volume car dealerships led by Rover and Vauxhall. The Anchor Ford division, comprising two large sites at Wolverhampton and Reading, contributed about a third of turnover but only Pounds 300,000 operating profit - 'nothing to write home about', said Mr Vardy, but he added that a group of Vardy's size needed to be involved with Ford. Specialist cars, including Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Aston Martin, sold 8 per cent more units. Turnover totalled Pounds 17m, but margins were thin. Earnings per share slipped to 4.22p (4.56p) with shares from the placing and offer in for a matter of days. For the full year, the average number in issue will go up from 31.7m to 39m. The interim dividend is increased to 1.3p (1.2p), a rise of 8 per cent.</p>

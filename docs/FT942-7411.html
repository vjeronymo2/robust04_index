			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (6): Accessible and co-operative - Favourable legislation has allowed fast growth of offshore funds Over the past two years offshore fund management in Ireland has grown at such a pace that Dublin now rivals Jersey and Guernsey in terms of the amount of offshore funds under management. More than Dollars 9bn in offshore funds is managed in Ireland, almost entirely by companies based in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre. This compares with Dollars 2.8bn of overseas funds managed in Dublin in June 1992, according to official figures. The main reason behind such rapid growth has been the introduction by the Irish government of favourable legislation since 1989, and the development of an International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. Ireland was one of the first EU states to adopt the UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) directive in 1989. The UCITS directive allows funds that are regulated in one member state to be marketed throughout the EU. Ireland and Luxembourg are the only two EU states where tax exempt managed funds can make use of this facility, something which has been crucial to Ireland's recent success in attracting offshore funds. After deciding to set up an offshore fund in a tax-free zone, the next factor influencing the decision of where to establish the fund is the markets in which it will be sold, says Pat McNaughton, managing director of Morgan Grenfell's Irish fund management subsidiary. 'If you wish to sell to the public in Europe then setting up where you can avail of the UCITS directive is a great advantage,' he explains. Morgan Grenfell decided to set up in Dublin rather than Luxembourg because it was a more cost-efficient location, particularly from the point of view of staff costs which are roughly two thirds of those in comparable offshore locations. The attitude of the workforce was also attractive, according to Mr McNaughton. 'There is more enthusiasm for work here than in other tax havens because the others nearly all have full employment,' he says. Morgan Grenfell's move to Dublin followed the pattern of most of the more than 40 companies that manage more than 150 funds in Dublin. In 1991, Morgan Grenfell transferred some existing funds from its operations in other tax havens to Dublin, in order to establish a base in Ireland from which to launch new funds and provide custodial services for other fund managers. Morgan Grenfell now manages funds worth Dollars 1.5bn in Dublin. Tax incentives are available to companies setting up in the International Financial Services Centre. It is located on disused docklands near to the centre of Dublin and companies that obtain an IFSC licence before the end of 1994 can make use of a 10 per cent corporation tax rate until 2005. Companies that obtain an IFSC licence are expected to establish an office on the Dockland site but many have not yet done so, preferring to operate out of cheaper offices elsewhere in Dublin. However, companies that do move to the docks site can make use of a remission of municipal rates and double rent relief for 10 years, as well as generous capital allowances. Although companies that move to the docks site can obtain 25-year leases, rather than the traditional 35-year lease common in Ireland, most would still prefer five-year leases, such as those in the US, or the roll-over indexed leases of three, six or nine years that are available in Europe. The accessibility and co-operative nature of the Irish regulatory authorities makes Dublin attractive to foreign funds, says Paul Dobbyn, a partner in one of Ireland's largest commercial law firms A &amp; L Goodbody. The main regulatory authority is the central Bank of Ireland and its approach to the regulation of offshore funds can be characterised as 'putting a lot of store by the credibility of the funds operator,' says Mr Dobbyn. 'The regulators are very accessible,' agrees Mr Nick Alford, general manager of GT Asset Management Ireland, the Irish subsidiary of the bank in Liechtenstein-owned CT Asset Management, which manages 14 funds worth more than Dollars 1.8bn in Dublin. 'They respond quickly and let you know if they can help.' Most funds under management in the IFSC are unit trusts, many constituted so as to comply with the UCITS directive. However, Irish legislation also allows for other types of tax-exempt funds that are more attractive to international investors, including investment companies with variable or fixed share capital. Both UCITS investment companies and non-UCITS investment companies are managed in the IFSC and there are also a number of private funds. Although the Irish legal and regulatory framework is highly competitive it could soon lose this edge, warns Mr Dobbyn. Any changes in the law required to maintain Ireland's competitiveness as a location for offshore fund management have to go through the normal Irish legislative process, a drawn-out affair which does not give as high a priority to financial services legislation as other tax havens - such as the Cayman Islands, where financial services are of greater significance to the economy. So far the government has been active and recently it added another type of investment vehicle to the 'menu' of vehicles which can be operated from the IFSC. The Irish partnership law is shortly to be amended to allow limited investment partnerships to operate from the IFSC. The government is projecting that more than IPounds 100m will be attracted to investment limited partnerships at the centre once they are operational. Dublin's other attractions include Ireland's membership of the OECD, which is important for marketing funds in Japan, and the Irish legal system which, like the US and British systems, is based on common law. Fund managers can also get funds listed on the Dublin stock exchange which is part of the London stock exchange and is similarly regulated. Although the two exchanges are to split this year, the Irish exchange has indicated that it intends to continue following the rules of the London exchange. But the main attraction of Dublin for international fund managers such as GT and Morgan Grenfell is the workforce. 'The 10 per cent tax rate is just another bonus,' says Mr McNaughton. Ultimately Morgan Grenfell will repatriate any profits made in Ireland to its German parent, Deutsche Bank, and pay tax on it in Germany, he explains. The Irish government hopes the workforce, and wider aspects of the business environment, will keep the notoriously mobile offshore fund managers in Dublin once the corporation tax breaks expire. The funds themselves will remain tax exempt after 2005. 'We would not have moved here just for the 10 per cent tax,' says Mr McNaughton. 'The raw materials had to be here. Ultimately the financial services centre that will win will be the one which provides the proper skills and people at a reasonable price,' he says. Companies arriving after 1994 will not be eligible for the 10 per cent corporation tax incentive but the fund managers who have established themselves by that time will be able to offer highly competitive custodial facilities to other fund managers. There are also suggestions that the Irish government will seek approval from the EU to extend the 1994 deadline, but as yet no official request has been made.</p>

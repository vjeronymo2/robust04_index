			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan -- One in 10 Russian border guards  among the rank and file and the sergeants is now on contract  service. This way of building up border troops in Russia's  federal border service is regarded as promising and makes it  possible to resolve the personnel shortage to a considerable  extent. By the end of this year, one in four, and in another  year, one in two Russian border guards will be on contract  service, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the press  service of the Russian border troops.    It is justifiable to stake on building up border troops on a  contract basis, it is believed here. Those on contract service  are distinguished by endurance, good discipline, and  professionalism. If before they used to be sent to logistics  subunits, nowadays they are entrusted with the main posts of  junior commanders and service in leading specialities.    According to the press service, contract servicemen are  eager  to go to "hot spots." They regard service at the outer borders  of CIS states as prestigious and in line with Russia's national  interests.    According to the same source, women, too, have been enlisted  in border guard service of late. There are 2,500 women in  Russian border troops now.</p>

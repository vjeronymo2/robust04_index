			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Achievements in China, Happiness in </F> the World"]    [Text] Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a New Year's  speech to be broadcast worldwide over the China Radio  International tonight, extends his warm greetings to all friends  of China and especially to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and  Taiwan.    Expressing his sincere wishes for achievements and happiness  in the coming year, the Chinese leader points out that 1993 has  been a year of success for the Chinese people.    "We have seized opportunity, deepened our reforms under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line," Jiang  says, adding that great progress has also been made in  establishing a socialist market system, as formulated by the  14th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.    China is now enjoying a period of economic growth, political  stability, national unity and social progress, Jiang says,  adding that the policy formulated by the Party and government to  develop the economy has proved to be correct.    Though China still faces new challenges as she marches  ahead,  she is determined and confident about overcoming all the  obstacles, the Chinese leader tells listeners around the globe.    "We begin the new year and face the future with greater  confidence and enthusiasm."    Looking ahead to China s tasks in the coming year, Jiang  says  that building socialism with Chinese characteristics demands  adherence to the policy of reforms and opening up to the outside  world, because "this is the only way to build a modern socialist  China, and transform our motherland into a strong, prosperous,  democratic and civilized country."    The whole Chinese nation hopes to rapidly transform China  into a prosperous land, free from poverty and backwardness,  Jiang stresses in his speech, adding, "We are an Asian country  with 5,000 years of history and a population of 1.1 billion  citizens. A prosperous and strong China will not only  contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people, but also to  all of humanity."    China's stability and development cannot be separated from  peace, development and prosperity throughout the world.    "This relationship is obvious to most of you, I am sure,"  says Jiang.    Turning to the international situation the Chinese leader  cites the accelerated process of multi-polarism and the popular  wish for co-operation and relaxation of tension.    He points out, however, that the Earth is still far from  peaceful. "The contradictions in some areas have intensified,  resulting in turmoil and armed conflict. Hegemonism and power  politics are still a big problem, challenging world peace and  development."    Under these circumstance, the Chinese Government and people  firmly adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and  have contributed to world peace and development, he points out.    Noting that China's international prestige has risen  remarkably, the Chinese President says, "We have friends all  over the world."    China will never seek hegemony, he goes on, and its  development will not constitute a threat to any country. Jiang  pledges that China will continue to develop friendly and  co-operative relations with other countries on the basis of the  Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.    "It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people  including our Taiwan compatriots to complete the unification of  the motherland. Unification is also the way China's history is  going.    "People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are longing for  this. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one  Taiwan," and "one China, two governments," goes against the  aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of  the Taiwan Straits.    "It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities take all this  into consideration, put national interests above all, strive to  unify the motherland and, together with the mainland create a  more prosperous China," Jiang says.    In the speech, the Chinese President notes that the dates  when Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland are  approaching.    Due to the fact that the British side persists in its wrong  stand on the Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong  Kong have broken. This is something that the Chinese Government  did not want to see.    "But no matter what happens, we share the feelings and  aspirations of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our  policy of 'one country, two systems' will not change, our  principal stand of adhering to the Basic Law on Hong Kong will  not change, and our resolution to restore China's sovereignty  over Hong Kong will not change.    "We are fully confident that we have the ability to keep  Hong  Kong prosperous and stable for a long time to come."    Jiang invites more overseas friends and compatriots to visit  China in the coming year.    Quoting an old Chinese proverb, "It is better to see once  than hear a hundred times," Jiang notes that 1994 is the 45th  anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.    "In the coming year, we invite all of you to come to China  and see for yourselves. Such contacts will promote mutual  understanding, trust and friendship."    Jiang concludes his speech by wishing his listeners around  the world very Happy New Year.</p>

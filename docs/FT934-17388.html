			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Rehabilitation of the conquered hero - Philip Stephens interviews Neil Kinnock as the union reforms he began finally became a reality MR JOHN PRESCOTT was the public hero of this week's Brighton conference. But as Mr John Smith savoured his victory on internal party democracy the private plaudits were going to Mr Neil Kinnock. After a week of relentless campaigning in favour of one-member-one-vote, Mr Kinnock could draw almost as much satisfaction as his successor from the defeat of the union barons. He, after all, started the process of loosening the unions' institutional grip on the Labour party which culminated in this week's vote. Interviewed in Brighton's Grand Hotel, the former Labour leader said that the vote had represented 'a contest over democracy' in the party. He added: 'The contest was won by the leadership. As a result the party is now more democratic and self-disciplined than a week ago. That sends a good positive message.' The modern tradition of the Conservative party is that former leaders spend their retirement vilifying their successors. It is no accident that Mr John Major's Blackpool conference next week will be darkened by the long shadow of Lady Thatcher. Sir Edward Heath did exactly the same for her. Labour, in many ways an altogether rougher party, has a surprisingly honourable tradition. Lord Wilson did nothing to undermine Lord Callaghan who in turn declined to join the widespread sniping at Mr Michael Foot. Mr Kinnock is following in their footsteps. He spent the days before Wednesday's vote touring union delegations and conference fringe meetings to drum up support for one-member-one-vote. When the vote was won he offered generous tributes to his successor's determination. A delighted Mr Smith responded by saying that he had learnt how to lead from the front by following the example shown by Mr Kinnock when he confronted Militant at the party's conference in 1985. The gloom which enveloped Mr Kinnock after last year's general election defeat appears to have been replaced by an inner calm. Friends say that inevitably he still looks back in anguish to what might have been. He no longer lets it show. Asked about his own political future after his re-election this week to Labour's National Executive Committee, he said if Mr Smith made it to 10 Downing Street it would be 'great' to get a telephone call asking him to serve in a Labour cabinet. But he dismissed the speculation in Brighton that he is campaigning actively for a return to the political top table: 'I can't gear my life to sitting around and waiting for a call.' He is following up the recent television series on his leadership with a BBC documentary on the future of socialism and is looking at other possibilities that do not conflict with his 'main job' of representing his Islwyn constituency. Mr Kinnock is concerned, however, that the long march to turn Labour into a party of government on which he set off in the 1980s should not be halted now. The end of the constitutional wrangle, he says, should give the party the 'chance to settle down and concentrate on developing its policies'. But that must not erode its new-found willingness 'to renew and reinvigorate those policies which are no longer applicable'. He added: 'We have to plan for the future, make a candid appraisal of our policies. There is a difficulty sometimes in taking down the 'Do not disturb signs'.' He is quietly scathing about those in unions who combine public outrage about the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement with the suggestion that Labour should add Pounds 15bn to boost the level of investment. It might sound exciting, but in reality it was 'immature and unrealistic'. Instead Labour should concentrate on a handful of inter-related themes in its policymaking: economic efficiency, mutuality or social cohesion and democracy. A stronger economy would provide the opportunity for fairer distribution of wealth. Constitutional change would buttress individual rights and responsibilities. He is convinced that if Labour proves that it is reasonable, and interested in value and efficiency, the party has the chance to catch the national mood. 'We can argue the case with confidence for better (public) services. It goes with the grain. People want decent standards, more security.' Mr Kinnock lost two general elections. He is determined Mr Smith should win the next one.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES markets lacked direction yesterday as dealers began to feel uncertain about the trend on Wall Street, writes Peter John. On the Liffe, early trading in the March FT-SE future contract helped the underlying cash market to pick up from its weak opening. Volumes were not heavy but a few dealers had been able to leave themselves short overnight. Consequently, they were able to benefit from the effect of the sharp overnight fall on Wall Street and buy back their short positions more cheaply. In the afternoon, the March contract began to drift off in spite of the relative firmness in New York. There was some nervousness ahead of the announcement about the UK Budget date and when it came, the date, which was in the middle of market predictions, provided no direction. The only impetus appeared to come from a large sell order carried out by one securities house. At the official close, March was 2,558, down 19 on the previous day but still at a hefty premium to its estimated fair value of around 20 points. In the LTOM, volumes remained low, with the FT-SE option turnover of 2,639 contracts particularly poor. Total volume of 22,990 lots was modestly up on the previous day.</p>

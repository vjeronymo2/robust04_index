			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "We Must Survive Along With You"] </F>   [Text] And so today's issue of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA is being  published with money collected from the readers. But the debts  remain--250 million to Pressa Publishing House and many millions  to paper combines, printing offices, and partners in the  delivery of the newspaper. How did these debts arise?    It is known that through the actions of the former Ministry  of Information and the Press, subsequently declared illegal by  the court, publication of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA was halted for two  and a half months during the October-December 1993 period. The  editorial office sustained large losses as a result of the  interruption of the subscription campaign during the first half  of 1994 and was deprived of income from advertising and retail  sails--on the whole the losses for the end of 1993 exceeded R1.3  billion rubles. In addition, the working account of the  editorial staff was frozen for a long time by an order of the  Central Bank, which was deemed by the High Arbitration Court to  be invalid--thus arose a string of debts and unjustified fines.    At the same time we know that our readers need the newspaper  very much--soon it will largely have restored its readership:  The number of subscribers has exceeded 270,000 and the overall  circulation is approaching a half million. Since April, 18,000  subscribers have joined us. And it is becoming increasingly  expensive to publish the newspaper. We now spend R25-R30 million  to publish one issue. And this is--for now! How can this be?!  Let us consult.  <H5>  Contribution of State Duma Deputies </H5>   The Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction of the  State Duma also decided to render aid to SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA.  Literally during one break between sessions Tatyana  Astrakhankina filled out a "notice of support":    V.M. Zelenin, Yu. P. Ivanov, A.F. Potapenko, N.G. Bindyukov,  V.N. Volkov, V.D. Filomonov, L.V.

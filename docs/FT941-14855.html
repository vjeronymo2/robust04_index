			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chrysler boosts Jeep production in Beijing Beijing Jeep, Chrysler's Chinese joint venture, plans to more than double production to an annual 200,000 Jeeps by early next century. Present production of the Jeep Cherokee off-road vehicle and military-style Jeep is about 80,000 units annually. The Sino-US venture will spend Yn2.1bn (Dollars 241m) over the next five years to upgrade Beijing's plant to meet international competition. Chrysler owns 42 per cent of the Beijing venture. It plans to build 20,000 Jeep Cherokees and 50,000 traditional semi-military Beijing Jeeps in 1994. Sales of the Jeep Cherokee fell below its 35,000 target last year with only 20,000 sold, largely due to a government-imposed credit squeeze. 'A production target doesn't mean much to me,' said Mr Fu Deru, the plant's spokesman. 'The most important question is how many units can you sell. We've already acquired a production capacity that could churn out more than the market could consume.' In the past decade Beijing Jeep has produced 354,000 jeeps including 70,000 Cherokees, earning Yn1.07bn in profits. Sixty per cent of Cherokee components are now made in China. China recently lowered its vehicle import tariff from 220 per cent to 150 per cent and lifted controls on car purchases. The move is expected to enliven China's car market, which has been severely restricted with little opportunity for private ownership. China has so far allowed eight foreign vehicle companies to set up joint venture plants, with Germany's 50 per cent-owned Volkswagen Shanghai venture the largest. Other producers are lobbying the Chinese government to enter the quickly expanding China car market. China produced 1.18m motor vehicles last year, and sales reached 1.17m. The plan for 1994 is 1.3m; Chinese officials say they want to keep the vehicle growth rate at 10 per cent a year.</p>

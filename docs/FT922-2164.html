			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (13): Now the technology comes of age - Audio-Conferencing THERE MAY be many new and exciting technologies for business communications, but the telephone is coming back into its own in the electronic office, as the medium for time-critical conferencing applications. Swanning around the country, or hopping on Concorde just to attend a half-hour briefing meeting, could be a thing of the past. Audio-conferencing has been available for many years, of course, but 1992 marks a turning point in terms of the technology, according to Steve Gandy, manager marketing &amp; sales, BT Visual &amp; Broadcast Services. 'In fact, things have started changing quite radically. The key change has been the introduction of low-cost audioconferencing equipment which is purpose built for the conferencing environment, enabling a number of people to participate, no matter where they are located. 'More importantly, the new generation of systems feature full-duplex operation and the latest echo cancelling technology, which means that every- one in the room, and people in remote locations, can all speak at the same time and be heard by each other as if they were all in the same room, with no clipped sentences or lost meanings,' he says. The market: according to researchers, Frost &amp; Sullivan, the US market for audioconferencing in 1990 was worth Dollars 726.6, of which Dollars 87.8m was equipment sales, Dollars 180m value-added services revenues and Dollars 458.8m transmission revenues. A five-fold jump is forecast over five years, which suggests it will represent a Dollars 3.54bn market by 1995. Since it is estimated by other sources that North America accounts for 82 per cent, and Europe for 12 per cent of the worldwide market, audio-conferencing was worth around Dollars 880m in 1990 and will rise to Dollars 4bn in 1995, with network operators, service providers and equipment manufacturers all able to look forward to a slice of the action. Indeed, BT says that the audioconferencing in the office-to-office business communications sector alone will be worth Dollars 49m in Europe by 1995. The applications and benefits: audio-conferencing is set to become one of the most important communications tools for the 1990s, helping people to run their businesses more effectively and save costs - not just the upfront expenses of air fares and hotel accommodation, but the below-line costs associated with the time, inconvenience and effort spent gathering people together in a single location and taking them away from their core activity. Face-to-face meetings will not, of course, become, a thing of the past but the physical presence of participants will not always be necessary. In fact, it will be possible for people to hold meetings more often, without adversely effecting the time spent on their core activities. The improvements in the decision-making process could be dramatic. Using their own equipment, or the service of a bureau, businessmen can set up telephone meetings in whatever combination they like. It could be half a dozen executives, each in their own offices but linked together; it could be two groups, one in the London boardroom and the other in the New York office, or it could be one person, linked to many different individuals spread around the country. Another application might be telephone broadcasting, using the telephone system like a radio transmitter to send a message to the whole workforce simultaneously. The broadcast can be turned into a phone-in programme, allowing key regional managers to quiz the boss on an important policy issue. Users: audio-conferencing is being used for crisis management in commercial operations. The AA and RAC are big users for control of traffic and general operations. It is also used in the professions, such as law and management consultancy, where time is money and fee-earners must be seen to be offering a cost-effective service. BT says that 25 per cent of its user base is in the financial sector, where audioconferencing is used for the early morning 'prayer meeting,' as well as for time-critical meetings, where, for example, dealers need to discuss how to react to a financial crisis before the news breaks. A large proportion - around 30 per cent of users - is in sales and marketing, where audio-conferencing is used for weekly briefings and sales update meetings. 'The alternative is for the manager to ring each sales person individually or take everyone off the road to gather in one location, reducing their selling time. The cost, time and effort involved normally means it just doesn't happen", says Mr Gandy. But what about the all-important psychology factor where face-to-face meetings enable those participating to determine what mood someone is in, or what their attitude is by interpreting body language? 'That is where the new technology plays an important part. Providing you know the person, you can tell their reaction by detecting the nuances in the tone of someone's voice,' Mr Gandy suggests. The technology: though there are a number of audioconferencing equipment manufacturers, UK-based GPT Telecom being one of them, most tend to focus their marketing effort on the seemingly more glamorous videoconference market. However, those manufacturers whose products are marketed by BT are likely to be the market leaders, not least because BT claims 80 per cent of the Pounds 5.4m UK audio-conferencing market. As well as offering a Conference Call bureau service, BT has four products in its portfolio, with prices starting at Pounds 680, and moving up the range in terms of sound level quality, duplex operation, and the number of people that can comfortably participate in a conference. The low-cost entry unit for desk-to-desk audioconferencing is the AC2000 which is manufactured in the UK by Cairntek. For desktop or small roundtable conferences, the AC4000, manufactured by NEC of Japan and sold by them as the Voicepoint, is priced at Pounds 1,200, the price premium being accounted for by the marginally better sound level quality and duplex operation. For bigger rooms, BT offers the ST3000 and ST6000 both of which are manufactured by US-based Shure - 'the reason we offer a choice is so that customers can be provided with a system that is fit for the purpose in a particular environment,' says Mr Gandy. The other important element in the new generation of technology is the bridge which connects the telephone lines for multiple-location audio-conferencing. Bridges are modular in concept, starting with a five-line bridge costing Pounds 3,000 that can connect five locations into the conference. There is no theoretical top limit to the number of bridges that can be provided. The limit comes with meeting dynamics. BT tends to find that the optimum size using their computer controlled bridge, the PC Elite is 40 lines. As to operating costs, through the bureau service the average audio-conference call charge is between Pounds 25 for local area point-to-point call and Pounds 85 for an international call. Obviously, calls from user premises will be at the normal telephone rate. According to Malcolm Bartlett of NEC (UK) Telecoms Division, the cost of the equipment could be covered if just two executives can avoid having to cross the Developments in audio-conferencing as a business communications technology are continuing apace. Enhanced facilities will enable an operator to take control of conferences, bringing people into a meeting and taking individuals out as the conference progresses; send faxes to each participant simultaneously; and use the keypad to access a bureau service, as and when required. The availability of ISDN (the integrated service digital network) adds further dimensions to desktop-to-desktop audioconferencing. Among the benefits will be stereo-quality sound, since ISDN provides a 7Khz frequency range compared with the 3-4Khz maximum offered by public switched telephone network (PSTN), with no crackles on the line to drown out speech. Also, it will be possible to have audio with simultaneous multimedia transmissions, using one of the two 64K channels on the ISDN line for voice and the other for fax or data transmissions.</p>

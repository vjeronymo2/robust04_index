			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Potential bid for Mosaic Mosaic Investments, which licenses cartoon characters such as Tom &amp; Jerry and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, said it was in talks which could lead to a bid for the company. The announcement was prompted by the rise in the share price from a low of 92p last Tuesday to 122p on Friday. The shares were 206p in March until a profits warning wiped 40 per cent off in a single day. Mr Leon Angrave, managing director, said the discussions with the other party were 'amicable' for the moment. If there was to be an offer, he said, it was likely to be at a small premium to the 110p price at which the announcement had been triggered. The potential bidder is believed to be in a similar business to Mosaic.</p>

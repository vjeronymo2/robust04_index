			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Share issue helps boost Gambro Gambro, the newest Swedish recruit to the Wallenberg domain, has reported first-half pre-tax profits of SKr582m (Dollars 73.8m), up 18 per cent from SKr495m a year ago. The rate of increase outpaced growth in sales and operating profit, largely because a share issue last year reduced interest expenses. The Swedish medical equipment specialist said it expected its earnings to continue to develop favourably. It became part of Incentive, one of the key companies in the Wallenberg sphere, in June after being targetted because of its strong growth prospects. Higher costs, increased depreciation and R &amp; D expenses restricted growth in operating income to 9 per cent, and lowered the operating margin to 14.8 per cent from 15.3 per cent. However, the group made up for this with a reduced interest bill of SKr156m, compared with SKr195m a year ago, following its SKr400m rights issue last year. All but of one of the group's five business areas expanded sales, taking group sales up 13 per cent to SKr4.89bn. The increase was 10 per cent after adjusting for exchange rates. The group's main unit, renal care, increased sales to SKr3.2bn from SKr2.90bn. However, sales within the intensive care and anaesthesia division fell because of health sector investment restraints.</p>

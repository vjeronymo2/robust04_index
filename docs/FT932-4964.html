			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Rule change for charity reporting attacked ACCOUNTING standards proposed by the Charity Commission will prove impractical for smaller charities, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants warned yesterday. Sorp 2, the statement of recommended practice for accounting in charities, issued as a discussion document in March, introduces a number of changes designed to represent more fairly charity finances. It comes at a time when the Charity Commission is increasing pressure on charities of all sizes to file accounts that are accurate and on time. The association said that the tougher standards would exceed smaller charities'resources or expertise and, because fo the extra work involved, threaten their ability to draw on voluntary help in preparing and auditing accounts. The association recommended a simplified, modified accounting regime for charities with an annual income of less than Pounds 250,000. The association also said that Sorp 2 meets the requirements of regulators more than readers of accounts, and would prove hard to understand. Sorp 2 is likely to be adopted later this year, and the draft was launched with a very tight timetable for discussion and modification. Although the guidelines are voluntary, it is likely to form the basis for statutory accounting rules to be introduced by the Home Office as part of the 1992 Charities Act this year. The association also recommended that the requirement to show intangible income - the donated and voluntary help a charity receives - should be removed, as it would be difficult to measure and if quantified might discourage these contributions.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM denies failure on repossessions MR John Major yesterday denied that the government's scheme to help people facing home repossessions had been a 'complete flop' as he clashed in the Commons with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during Prime Minister's questions. Under a scheme announced last December, the government agreed to pay the mortgage interest element of social security benefits direct to lenders. In return, the mortgage lenders agreed not to repossess the homes of people covered by such benefits. In addition the lenders would set aside up to Pounds 1bn for mortgage-to-rent schemes under which housing associations would buy the homes of repossessed borrowers and rent them back to their former owners. Put on the defensive by Mr Kinnock's charge, Mr Major retorted by saying that 'only about half a per cent' of home-owners had had their homes repossessed, and claimed that repossessions often resulted from domestic difficulties within families. In a testy series of exchanges, he defended measures taken by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, maintaining that they were helping to alleviate problems. Many mortgage lenders had agreed not to repossess homes where mortgage interest was covered by income support, he said. He finally rounded on Mr Kinnock, accusing him of being hypocritical on the issue. 'It is your party that would have denied 1.5m people from becoming homeowners in the first place,' he said. Mr Kinnock had opened by inquiring whether Mr Major would still claim, as he had in January, that the government had stopped housing repossessions 'before Christmas'. Pointing out that Mr Lamont had promised that the government's rescue plan would reduce repossessions by 40,000, Mr Kinnock said despite this, 'action was started' against 42,000 families in the first three months of this year. Branding the government scheme a 'complete flop', he urged the prime minister to 'start taking steps to ensure we have an effective scheme before thousands more families are put out of their homes'. For the small percentage affected, repossession was a '100 per cent tragedy', while many more families were under 'intense pressure' on mortgage payments. 'It is necessary in a country where there could be 80,000 repossessions again this year for the government to introduce a proper mortgage rescue scheme.' The exchange was prefaced by a question from Mr Chris Smith, a shadow Treasury spokesman, who urged the government to allow local authorities to use more than Pounds 6bn of capital receipts in their hands to build more homes.</p>

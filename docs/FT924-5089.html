			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Total design Sir, Hugh Aldersey-Williams ('Identifying the shape of bins to come', November 26), treats 'design' as being a process by which a pleasing appearance is added on to a product. To suggest that the Lotus Elan failed because it was too expensive to build, yet design was not to blame, is contradictory. The challenge for any company involved with new products is to combine aesthetic design into the overall development process. This includes being competitive on cost and meeting safety standards.

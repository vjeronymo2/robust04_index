			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Clinton backs California over tax The US Justice Department has kept President Bill Clinton's campaign promise to California by backing the state in its 16-year-old tax case against Barclays Bank of the UK. In a brief filed last week with the Supreme Court, Mr Drew Days, the solicitor general, argues that even if the US federal government has since objected to California's unitary system of taxation, in 1977, when the Barclays dispute began, it had merely expressed a preference for the internationally recognised arm's-length tax method - not enough to throw out the unitary method on constitutional grounds. If California were to lose the case, it would have to pay around Dollars 400m of refunds to Barclays and other foreign-owned companies which have disputed their unitary tax assessments. It could face another Dollars 1.3bn of refunds in a related case brought by Colgate-Palmolive, the household products group, involving US-based multinationals. California would also lose another Dollars 2.4bn of taxes it has claimed but not yet collected under the unitary method, in which companies may be asked to pay taxes on a percentage of their parent group's worldwide income, rather than only on income they have earned in California. The Justice Department opinion is particularly important because the case against the unitary method hinges on the constitutional argument that it interferes with the federal government's powers over foreign trade. As a fallback position, Mr Days argues that even if the Supreme Court decided in favour of Barclays, it should dismiss Colgate's claim; and even if it ruled against California in both cases, it should not order refunds, as it has already changed its tax law in a way that meets the complaints made against the unitary method by foreign governments. Previous administrations have argued strongly against California but Mr Clinton had promised to back the state if elected.</p>

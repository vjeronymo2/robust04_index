			<p>BFN     [Text] An expert conference for about 200 officers of the  Military Security Service and Military Police of the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was held in Sarajevo today. The  Security Administration of the Ministry of Defense and the  Military Security Sector of the 1st Corps organized the  conference. Participants in the conference were addressed by  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, among others.  Here is a report by Edin Muhic:    [Begin recording] [Muhic] The aim of today's conference is  to examine the experience so far in the work of the Military  Security Service and the Military Police and to define further  tasks. Among others, Rasim Delic, commander of the Headquarters  of the Supreme Command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-  Herzegovina; Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic; and Bakir  Alispahic, minister of internal affairs attended the conference  and submitted reports. Jusuf Jasarevic, head of the Military  Security Administration, submitted an introductory report.    Jasarevic pointed out that the present security situation is  much better than it was some half a year ago, and the  cooperation between the Military Security Service and the  Ministry of Internal Affairs is at a satisfying level. In the  future, the focus will be on preventing the enemy's subversive  activity and at the same time on further clearing units from  criminals and other forms of law violation, Jasarevic said.    Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic spoke about the  government's activity on organizing and strengthening the Army.  As regards duties of the Military Security Service, Minister  Hadzihasanovic said the following:    [Hadzihasanovic] The main aim of the Military Security  Service is to prevent the enemy from obtaining information about  our forces and intentions and to make it impossible for him to  undermine the moral-political unity and combat readiness of the  units and to carry out espionage, sabotage, and other subversive  activities in our ranks.    Participants in the conference were then addressed by Alija  Izetbegovic, president of the republic Presidency. From his  speech, we shall single out a part dealing with the need to  prevent deviant phenomena in the work of the Security Service.    [Izetbegovic] In your job, you should (?compound) [word  indistinct] into another component that is very important, and  that is respect for man, that is, a certain humanism.  Sometimes, these services may turn into, well, (?only one sharp  edge), a (?sharp edge) of a sort of struggle against the enemy  and are sometimes forgetting the other (?thing), that is, that  they should at the same time respect the law (?well), that they  should be careful. As you know, it has happened, not in our  country though, but has nevertheless happened that those  services escape control and sometimes do some things that are  not all right and that [word indistinct] struggle against the  enemy, they sometimes forget that they may sometimes trample  upon or crush or squash some innocent man and so on and to be  (?too severe).    [words indistinct] to nourish these two things ---  professionalism and humanism in your work, and the more  professional you are, you shall probably be more humane as well.    [Muhic] After President Izetbegovic, Army General Rasim  Delic took the floor. He said that one should continue this  upward trend of strengthening the system of Military Security  and Military Service and added the following:    [Delic] It is necessary to continue to ensure close links  among organs and units that deal with security in all  institutions of our society, as that is the only way to ensure  unity of all factors on the protection of basic values of the  system we are building and will continue building.    In this respect, it is [word indistinct] for the Military  Security Service to enjoy support by all those people who desire  a stable democratic state and the protection of the people from  all forms of endangerment of its security and (?survival).    [Muhic] Let us add at the end that it was concluded at  today's conference that with a view to ensuring an expert  training of the cadres, such conferences should (?in future) be  held at the seats of three corps of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thereby the security actions that are  already under way and those that are yet to be carried out will  certainly be even more (?fearful) and deadly. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, May 31 (AFP) -- Libya rejects the secession  by southern Yemen and will oppose any plans to send UN troops to  keep the warring sides apart, a parliamentary leader said here  Tuesday [31 May].    "There exists only one state in Yemen, the republic of Yemen  (which merged north and south in 1990) and nobody has the right  to interfere in its internal affairs," parliament's foreign  affairs secretary, Sa'd Mujbir, told AFP.    "Libya supports Yemen's unity and is opposed to any  secession," he said.    Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid proclaimed an independent  state with Aden as its capital on May 21, two weeks after civil  war broke out. His northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, has vowed to crush the "rebellion."    Libyan officials had earlier stopped short of denouncing the  secession, issuing statements of support for Yemen's unity.    Mujbir also warned against any "plan to send troops" from  the  United Nations to keep the warring sides apart, adding that will  "repeat the catastrophes which took place in ex-Yugoslavia and  Somalia."    The Security Council is due to debate the Yemeni conflict on  Tuesday.</p>

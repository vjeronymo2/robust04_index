			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Zhilyakov] </F>   [Text] Maykop (Republic of Adygeya), 21 Apr -- From today  there will be two state languages in the Republic of Adygeya --  Russian and Adygey. A law to this effect has been adopted by  the republican parliament. While upgrading Adygey to the level  of a state language and giving it state support, the legislative  assembly at the same time did not downgrade Russian or discredit  it. It did not discriminate against the Russian-speaking  residents of the republic in any way. "Knowledge or lack of  knowledge of a language does not provide sufficient grounds for  any restriction of the rights of the citizens of the Republic of  Adygeya", stipulates one of the opening articles of the law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Responses to reader letter by several officers, prepared by </F> Colonel Aleksey Andreytsov and Lieutenant-Colonel Aleksandr  Tarapatin under the rubric "Servicing of Hardware and Weaponry:  "`The Hardware, Well, the Hardware Later..."]    [Text] "Dear Editors!    "To paraphrase the words of the well-known song, it  could be asserted that the aircraft come first, first the  aircraft, and the hardware, well, the hardware later... Such is  life. We have not received our special clothing or gloves for  two years now. The `clothes people' have moreover said that the  service lives of the fur articles have been increased due to  difficulties with supply.    "The motor vehicles are completely worn out. The TM-59  heating vehicles, for instance, have already served more than  one decade, and have undergone several overhauls. We have to  manufacture the heating vehicles using whatever's lying around,  in homemade fashion. There is a chemical method for fighting  surface ice build-up, of course, but the concrete surface gets  ruined from it, and the ecology will weep bitter tears as well.    "It's bad enough that the hardware sits in unheated  tents. Try and drive out after you start it up -- the heaters  don't work, and there are not enough blowtorches to heat up the  oil in the crankcase. And that's not to mention the worsening  supply of fuel, oil, spare parts and other mat&eacute;riel for  flights because of the unbalanced state of the economy.    "Now everyday living. We are living in a single-story  wood-panel barracks. The steam heating radiators leak. The roof  is falling apart. The electric lighting goes out sometimes. Only  fragments remain, if you will pardon me, of the lavatory. After  flights you are so `drained' that you want to take a bath and a  steam in the bathhouse. Go right ahead... 20 kilometers away. It  is simpler if you are not married. But what about those with  families? The children are taught in the same barracks in three  shifts. When they finish, what then? The library is closed --  there is no job slot for it. They show films from the times of  the Khrushchev thaw. The commissary is stuffed with scarce  goods, but the prices really sting. It is difficult to maintain  a family, since most of the wives are not working. There are no  jobs. So the specialists are running away. Those who are a  little older and have nowhere to go simply toil in silence, and  endure the drudgery. Those who are a little weaker in spirit  take to drink, since there is plenty to be had. They cry on  someone's shoulder, and that is enough. In short, I still have  faith in future changes. But will that faith last for long?"    --Senior Lieutenant Andrey Skorobogatov.    The author's indignation regarding the increasingly  difficult problems in the servicing and maintenance of aviation  equipment is understandable to us. Most technical specialists,  to all appearances, share his opinion as well. This can be seen  from their letters to the editor and from the materials that  have been published on this topic in the journal.    Yes, the situation is a difficult one. We could sit  with arms folded and wait for our last breath, on the one hand,  or we could ask determinedly, doggedly and inventively at all  levels to see that the technical services survive in these  difficult economic times, and support the process of combat  training for the fighter pilots to the full extent. That is  indeed the approach to matters that has been planned, in our  opinion, in the aviation rear-support services of the PVO  [Air-Defense] Forces. Here is what the corresponding officers  had to say in answer to the angry questions of the author.  <H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Chief of Staff  Major-General F. Klus </H3>   Background: Frants Iosofovich Klus was born  in 1944. He completed the Military Academy for Rear Support and  Transport. He has served in the Baltic Fleet, the Transcaucasus  and the Moscow PVO District. Major-General F. Klus has been  chief of staff of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces  since July 1992.    Airfield technical flight support is a crucial, multifaceted  and complex process. It demands highly trained specialists and  the use of diverse technical equipment. Specialists of the  aviation-technical, airfield-engineering, and electrical and gas  services, along with the aviation weaponry service, are occupied  with these problems in the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO  Forces. The spectrum of tasks they perform is most diverse. They  include those that Senior Lieutenant Skorobogatov names in his  angry letter to the editors.    It is bitter and disappointing read such "epistles" (and  they  are being encountered more and more often in our own mail as  well, and not just in letters to the editor), but there is no  way to get away from them. And if we approach this voice from  the field more seriously, we detect a grave paradox: The heads  of the chiefs of various ranks are still more worried about  getting the aircraft up and hitting the target than about whose  hands are "reviving" that equipment.    I repeat -- all of this is distressing. But we will be  realists. It is difficult for the rear-support services to reach  each flier. That is the prerogative of the commanders of the  aviation technical units. The tasks of flight support, including  the organization of food for flight and technical personnel,  clothing for officers and warrant officers, bath and laundry  services for the conscript soldiers and NCOs and the maintenance  of the housing and barracks stock, are resolved in those units  as a group.    The aviation headquarters, detached airfield  technical-support battalions and aviation-technical bases, aside  from the enumerated tasks, support the combat alert duty of  fighter aviation. They perform this latter task with more and  more difficulty each day. This is caused, first and foremost, by  the low manpower levels of the units. They are at 35-40 percent  today, while the amount of tasks they perform remains the same!  I would add, with profound regret, that this problem is not  always taken into account by the staffs of the aviation  regiments, making the resolution of these problems even more  difficult. I have in mind here not a decline in exactingness  toward the quality of flight support, but rather the fact that  the capabilities of the aviation technical units are not always  taken into account when planning flights, and they are not given  the necessary assistance.    The crisis in the economy, on the other hand, has had a  sharp  impact on logistical support for PVO aviation. A number of  enterprises that were producing and performing overhauls on  flight ground-support equipment have ended up outside our  borders. These include those producing the AMK-24/56 airfield  air-conditioning equipment in Baku and the TM-59MG heating  vehicle in Minsk, among others. And what can one say about the  supply of aviation technical mat&eacute;riel anyway, when we are  left without a quarter of the enterprises that produce spare  parts and assemblies for the aircraft?    Aircraft engines for transport aviation have stopped coming  from Zaporozhye, and Il-76 aircraft and spare parts for them  from Tashkent. The question of repairs for MiG-25 aircraft  engines has not yet been resolved. Matters are no better with  the training of specialists. The well-equipped detached training  regiment for aviation support has ended up, strictly speaking,  abroad. The funds are gone, as they say, while we are left with  our own interests. We are putting the question point-blank. But  easier said than done... The creation of such a training  regiment on territory of Russia is still in the decision stage.    Financing spending for the procurement of aviation technical  flight-support equipment and aviation technical mat&eacute;riel  has  become much more difficult. The funds initially allocated for  the aviation rear-support services have been redirected to  solving other problems. The placement of orders with industry  has been disrupted.    The departure of the logistical-support service from the  composition of rear support has disrupted the structure of  logistical supply, servicing and repair of weaponry and hardware  right in the field that had been operating without problems.    The aviation rear-support service does not have the legal  rights or monetary means to conclude contracts and acquire  products for production-engineering purposes. All of this is  resolved according to the "whatever's-left-over" principle. As a  result, whereas in 1992 the requirements of PVO aviation for  products for production-engineering purposes were only  50-percent satisfied, only 10 percent of contracts have been  concluded for 1993. This, of course, reduces the quality of  airfield technical support for aviation flights. Whence all of  the other misfortunes, including those they are writing about  from the field. We still see no end to the problems. I hope the  chiefs of the services will talk about them more concretely.  <H3>  PVO Forces Rear Support Aviation Weaponry Service Chief  Lieutenant-Colonel N. Tarasov </H3>   Background: Nikolay Anatolyevich Tarasov  completed the Perm Military Aviation-Technical School in 1978,  and seven years later the Military Aviation Engineering Academy  imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. He has served in the Southern Group of  Forces and the North Kazakhstan Military District in various  positions in the aviation armaments service. He has been chief  of the aviation armaments of the Rear-Support Directorate of the  PVO Forces since November of 1990.    The uninterrupted support of units with aviation armaments  (ASP) is known to be one of the basic conditions for their  fighting ability and combat readiness. The pursuit of the  necessary measures to maintain ASP in constant readiness, and  competent servicing and storage are entrusted to the specialists  of our service.    We strive with all of our might to provide cover and  reliable  protection for ASP stores at air bases and storage areas for  missile armaments and ordnance, both in the rear and at the  engineering stations in the zones of dispersion of the squadrons  of air regiments. This is especially topical of late. There have  been instances of penetration by outsiders in certain regions.  They continue to attack ordnance stores.    There are also other matters affecting the normal operation  of the armaments soldiers. There is a catastrophic shortage of  storage space. New storage is being built at an exceedingly slow  pace, owing to the reduction in appropriations. Moreover,  effective measures are not always taken in the field to avert  violations in the organization of storage or the handling  regimen.    Inspections conducted by officers of our service show that  there have been virtually no attempts at the penetration of  stores areas by outsiders in the units where they approach these  matters with all seriousness. I would like to note the creative  and purposeful work of the chiefs of the aviation armaments  services of the formations of Colonel A. Kuzmin and  Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zvonov.    There are, unfortunately, still more negative examples in  our  service than positive ones. They are unable to equip facilities  for the storage of armaments and ordnance with technical  security devices in some units. There have been instances of  unprincipled behavior and a failure to perform their duties by  officials.    All of this is not facilitating any improvements in the  matter. The question of servicing and technical maintenance is  meanwhile becoming exceedingly important. I am not exaggerating  at all. The very process of maintaining contemporary guided  aviation missiles has become considerably more difficult. The  servicing of ASP has become very expensive. Other factors could  be cited as well. The old maintenance system is nonetheless  being used even on new types of missiles to this day, where the  basic operations are performed at certain time intervals.    This was justified with regard to missile armaments in which  mechanical and electro-mechanical structural elements  predominated. The elemental base of recent models is completely  different. The proportionate share of electro-mechanical  assemblies and systems has been reduced considerably. It is thus  essential to move from calendar-based technical maintenance [TO]  to servicing based on condition, with the volume and frequency  of monitoring stipulated by the servicing documentation therein,  and the start and amount of TO determined depending on the  technical state of the missiles.    The technical condition of the ASP is determined in this  context either using the method of monitoring the level of  reliability, in which the constituent items are operated until  fail-safe with the performance of planned operations to detect  and eliminate the defects, or by means of the monitoring of  parameters characterizing the technical condition of the units.  This would scarcely be understandable to everyone, but it makes  no sense here yet and would be very difficult to expand the  bounds of the customary and usual.    Matters are also not being improved by the organizational  separation of the specialists in aviation armaments at all  levels of rear support and aviation of the PVO Forces that  exists today. They are performing a uniform combat task, after  all. The functional ties of rear-support and aviation elements  supporting combat readiness that were prescribed at various  times by the guiding documents are complex and contradictory,  owing to the varying subordinations. The lack of a unified  command and control element or responsibility for the combat  readiness of aviation missiles and their maintenance, storage  and servicing is not promoting the quality of  missile-engineering support.    The servicing of aviation armaments, by analogy with  aviation  hardware, should be a stage in the life cycle from the moment of  its acceptance in the unit from the manufacturing plant or  repair element until its shipment for repair or write-off.    The creation of the structure of a unified service for  aviation armaments at all levels of PVO aviation would make it  possible to eliminate drawbacks and instill order and  organization into the support of combat readiness for aviation  units.  <H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Aviation-Technical  Service Chief Colonel L. Preobrazhenskiy </H3>   Background: Colonel Leonid Mikhaylovich  Preobrazhenskiy has been in the armed forces since 1973. He is  42 years of age. He completed the Military Academy of Rear  Support and Transport. He has been chief of the aviation  technical service of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO  Forces since April 1992.    It does not seem possible to cover the whole range of tasks  facing the aviation-technical service in a short journal  article. Suffice it to say that the service annually orders and  delivers to the units more than 180,000 types of items of  aviation mat&eacute;riel essential for maintaining the aircraft  inventory in combat readiness and supporting the everyday  activity of the flight, engineering and technical personnel and  the flights of the aircraft in PVO aviation.    The service performs all of these tasks in constant  interaction with the directorate of aviation and the  aviation-engineering service [IAS] of the PVO Forces. Experience  shows that aircraft are inevitably standing idle, and that the  personnel do not receive the mat&eacute;riel that is due  according  to the standards in a timely manner, at aviation garrisons where  constant and businesslike contact and mutual understanding are  lacking among the officials of the aviation,  aviation-engineering and aviation-technical services. This can  be seen very well from the letter of Senior Lieutenant  Skorobogatov.    Questions of providing aviation mat&eacute;riel are  resolved in  most stable fashion by the department for aviation support in  the formation headed by Lieutenant-Colonel G. Kovko, who has  achieved fulfillment of the plan for expeditionary deliveries to  the regions of the Far North.    The financing allocated by the government of the Russian  Federation for the provision of aviation mat&eacute;riel in  1991-93  remains at the same level. The prices for it have meanwhile gone  up a hundredfold or more.    All of this has forced a review of the whole system of  ordering, and a concentration of the principal efforts on  obtaining and delivering as fast as possible to the units the  spare parts and assemblies only for the aviation hardware that  is standing idle and the latest models of aircraft, with the  rest of the requirements for them satisfied only through  available reserves and aviation mat&eacute;riel obtained from  repair and after the write-off and cut-up of aircraft being  removed from service.    The situation is complicated by the fact that a considerable  portion of the aviation mat&eacute;riel is being produced only at  aviation enterprises in Ukraine and Uzbekistan. An  intergovernmental agreement between them and Russia on mutual  deliveries has not been signed, and the output of this  mat&eacute;riel at aviation plants has not been organized.    It follows from this that only the correct determination of  the quantity of aviation units, engines, assemblies and other  mat&eacute;riel that has served out its stipulated service life,  the ascertaining of existing stockpiles in warehouses and their  efficient utilization and timely redistribution among the units  will make it possible to maintain the aircraft inventory in good  working order and support the vital activity of flight,  engineering and technical personnel.    Significant difficulties have arisen lately with the  delivery  of mat&eacute;riel to the consumers as well. Some 22 units of  rolling stock were plundered on railroad lines in the last half  year alone. The railroad returns the money as compensation for  the damages, but as is well known, that does not support the  flights or clothe the people. The involvement of transport  aviation, continuously occupied with accomplishing the task of  evacuating personnel and mat&eacute;riel from the Transcaucasus,  Baltic and Central Asian regions, in the delivery of  mat&eacute;riel would unjustifiably drag out the time frames for  the delivery of the mat&eacute;riel, as well as waste the  "precious" service lives of aircraft engines.    I would like to dwell separately on the question of  providing  flight personnel with flight and technical clothing. Owing to  the lack of raw materials, the constantly decreasing number of  enterprises operating and the constant price increases, the  enterprises in the woolen industry fulfilled the plan for  certain items only by 45-60 percent in 1992, and they have not  produced any leather jackets since May of 1991. The command was  forced to impose a series of restrictions for that reason.    The supplying units were thus temporarily issued directives  as special instructions to issue fur-lined gloves, leather  gloves without liners and leather jackets only to pilots, and to  issue one pair of fur-lined leather gloves to engineering and  technical personnel for four years and an additional pair of fur  mittens for one year. These items are not being issued to other  categories of servicemen who receive flight and technical  clothing.    The service lives of map holders, navigator's cases,  inclined  map tables, unlined fur trousers and fur-lined cotton items have  been doubled. The service lives of shrouds for aircraft have  been increased considerably under all climatic conditions.    Taking into account the organizational measures being  carried  out to cut back the armed forces, the officers, warrant officers  and servicemen on conscript service are permitted, (when they  wish and by intercession of the commander of the unit), to keep  for themselves items of flight and technical clothing regardless  of their wearing times, for a fee, when being discharged into  the reserves, retirement for years served or under personnel  cutbacks.    The prices for the items obtained before 1 January 1992 are  defined therein proceeding from their retail prices in 1991 with  an increase of 20 percent (value-added tax), while transactions  for mat&eacute;riel issued to the personnel after 1 January 1992  are made on the basis of prices from the reference for 2  February 1992 adjusted for retail and increased by 20 percent.    Servicemen who have expressed the desire to continue to  serve  in the armed forces of member nations of the CIS that have  declared the creation of national armies, shall turn over items  of flight and technical clothing (owing to the shortage of them)  to supply. A delay by servicemen of more than one month in  turning them over is considered to be their appropriation  (theft).    The measures enumerated are of course forced; the need for  them will recede to the extent of the convergence of the  defensive interests of the countries that make up the near  abroad today.  <H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Electrical and Gas  Service Chief Colonel V. Khokhlov </H3>   Background: Colonel Vladimir Ivanovich  Khokhlov was born in 1948 in the city of Temirtau. He has been  in the armed forces since 1966. He completed the Kiev Higher  Engineering-Aviation School in 1971. He was in the department  for training supervisory engineering personnel of the VVIA  [Military-Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy.  He has served in Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Moscow Oblast and  Moscow. He has served in positions from the engineer of a  fighter regiment to the chief of the electrical and gas service  of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces.    A great many tasks are entrusted to the "toilers" of the  airfields. The safety of the flights of aviation depends to a  considerable extent on the quality of their fulfillment, the  timely ordering and delivery of electrical and gas equipment and  mat&eacute;riel, the organization of the servicing, repair and  storage of the equipment, the production of oxygen and nitrogen  and the training of the specialists in this service.    There are 150-170 vehicles being operated in every aviation  technical unit, 70 percent of which are special ones. These are  the oxygen- and nitrogen-producing stations, the transport tanks  for liquid oxygen, the gasification installations, the  standardized compressor and gas-charging stations, the equipment  for electric-power supply and the start-up of aircraft, the  check-out and recharging of hydraulic systems (airfield mobile  electrical units, electric-motor/generators, electro-hydraulic  systems and installations for checking out the hydraulic  systems), as well as the means of cooling and heating air  (airfield air conditioners and standardized motorized heaters).  The aviation batteries -- which, as opposed to motor-vehicle  batteries, have large capacity, are difficult to service and are  very expensive -- also have to be serviced. The specialists of  this service should thus possess profound knowledge.    The chief of the electrical and gas service of MO [Ministry  of Defense] PVO, Lieutenant-Colonel A. Beletskiy, and the chief  of the unit's electrical and gas service, Major Yu. Tizengauzen,  have labored hard and fruitfully this year to retrofit the  fighter air regiment at the Dorokhovo airfield, equipping the  regimental technical position with a centralized system for  electric-power supply and training the personnel in the  operation of the new type of electrical and gas equipment.  Eleven units of new electrical and gas equipment have been  shipped to this unit from the centralized supply of the PVO  Forces rear support, and the UGZS-63OK gas-charging station has  been put into service for the first time. Support for the air  regiment is difficult, however, owing to the shortage of  specialists. There are only 16 people out of the 59 there should  be in the electro-technical company, for example, and only three  out of seven at the oxygen-producing station.    The physical demands that these people have to bear are not  difficult to imagine. This misfortune unfortunately applies to  most of the aviation-technical units of the PVO Forces.    I see the way out of this situation in service on a contract  basis and in the replacement of military specialists with  civilian ones. The commander of the aviation technical unit must  be given more independence to hire specialists from the wage  fund, and not on a fixed salary. He should determine what  specialists are needed first and foremost. This would make it  possible to make more efficient use of the personnel and raise  the quality of aviation support.    The question of junior specialists in the service has also  not been resolved. They were trained up until 1992 in the  detached training regiment for aviation rear support in Kerch.  The training of aviation specialists has been organized at one  of the schools for junior aviation specialists, with the  transfer of that regiment to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.    Classes could be organized in the future on the basis of  that  regiment with warrant officers and other specialists of aviation  rear support, for example in the fuel services,  airfield-engineer service, aviation armaments service and  aviation technical service. The performance of these  organizational measures would thus best be accelerated to the  benefit of the matter.    The necessity has arisen, in connection with the transition  to a 1.5 year term of service, for a proportionate reduction in  the training and retraining periods of drivers for army  conditions.    Drivers in the ranks have been trained in the field since  July 1992. The quality of training for specialists, I think,  would go up if the DOSAAF schools were assigned to the PVO  Forces in various regions, depending on the requirements for  driver personnel. We would in that case have a vital vested  interest in strengthening those schools with cadres and  improving their physical plant.    An experiment would seem possible here -- assign several  schools to the rear support of the PVO Forces. We have the  capability of equipping those schools with new electrical, gas  and airfield equipment, the more so as it is constantly being  improved. The drivers and other specialists, after completing  such a school, would have been purposefully trained and would be  engaged while in the aviation technical unit only with studying  the specific features of the principles of the special vehicles  and their operation at airfields.    The personnel have to master various types of hardware under  varying climatic conditions. The advance, careful preparation of  hardware and service facilities for the harsh winter and the  creation of conditions for the performance of technical  servicing, routine maintenance and repairs of vehicles are  required in the northern regions and in Siberia. The failure to  fulfill the requirements for the preparation of the equipment  leads to the disabling of the special systems and a reduction in  combat readiness.    Additional spending is required in the northern regions for  the capital construction of heating facilities for the service,  and locations for the personnel to warm up in the motor pools  and on the airfields. These requirements are not always being  met. Only 15 of the 180 vehicles are in heated tents, for  example, in the aviation technical unit at Berezovka, and there  are no heated enclosures for servicing and repairing the  equipment. There have been disruptions in flights in that unit  as a result, owing to the lack of readiness of the airfield  technical support equipment; the technical readiness factor of  the vehicle fleet is too low.    We have been forced, despite what is stipulated by  regulations, to maintain increased stockpiles of electrical and  gas mat&eacute;riel and a dual set of oxygen-producing station in  remote and difficult-to-reach areas, in order to support  autonomous operations.    One of the principal problems in the Far East remains the  supply of oxygen and nitrogen. Many aviation garrisons are  stationed large distances from industrial centers, or on islands  or peninsulas. Gas is supplied under those conditions using  standard oxygen and nitrogen producing stations, and standard  electric-power stations are moreover used at five out of twelve  owing to the absence of industrial electric-power supply. There  are not enough warrant officers because of the lack of housing.  Half of them are missing at six stations, and there are none at  all at two in the garrisons of Dzemga and ten sections.    Women, who after the appropriate training are permitted to  perform practical work by order of the commanders of the units,  are coming to the rescue.    One way of solving this problem is to reach direct,  bilateral  contract obligations with plants in industry for the delivery of  gas. Even those, however, are often not fulfilled. The  Daltekhgaz joint-stock company had failed to ship 100 of the  planned 200 tonnes of liquid nitrogen as of 1 January 1993.    We are experiencing serious difficulties in financing owing  to the unrestrained rise in prices for gas.    The price of one tonne of oxygen was 1,550 rubles, and  nitrogen 2,450 rubles, as of 1 January 1992. Those prices have  increased significantly today. The spending of monetary  resources on payments for gases in the field totaled about 20  million rubles in 1992, which is tens of times higher than in  1991.    The chiefs of the oxygen and nitrogen producing stations in  Yelizovo, Captain A. Yermakov, in Burevestnik, Captain A. Dikiy,  in Postovaya, Captain O. Pakhvashchev, and shift chiefs warrant  officers Aksenov, Bilenok and many others are meeting their  obligations in organizing the gas-production work successfully  in the face of all the difficulties. The repair of the airfield  technical-support equipment remains a problem. Two of the five  plants for performing major overhauls are on the territory of  Ukraine. Our requirements are only met 35-40-percent of the  time, and matters are especially difficult with regard to  gas-producing and gas-charging equipment.    There are no subunits in the field to perform intermediate  repairs on electrical and gas equipment, as a result of which  the vehicles are operated from routine through to major repairs.  This question has been put before the command more than once,  but has not been developed.    The development of the production base of existing repair  enterprises in the larger units and detached repair and  rebuilding battalions and formations would be expedient, in  order to carry out comprehensive intermediate repairs on  electrical and gas equipment.    The diversity of the tasks facing the service and how they  are performed determine the nature and intensiveness of the  utilization of the vehicles. The expenditure of motor-vehicle  resources is a problem under these conditions. The personnel are  working under greater demands with the intensive utilization of  the equipment, and there is not enough time for technical  maintenance and routine servicing operations. The consumption of  servicing materials increases, and the danger increases of the  appearance of preconditions for flight accidents through the  fault of the personnel.    The officers and warrant officers of the electrical and gas  service, despite all of the difficulties, are devoted to their  difficult profession and, in interaction with the other services  of rear support, are doing everything they can to see that the  equipment entrusted to them is in combat-ready condition.  <H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Airfield-Engineering  Service Chief Lieutenant-Colonel A. Kozhin </H3>   Background: Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy  Yuryevich Kozhin was born in the city of Kursk in 1955. He has  been in the armed forces since 1972. He completed the Voronezh  Higher Military Aviation-Technical School. He has served in  airfield-engineering units in the Moscow and Far East districts.  After completing the Military Engineering Red Banner Institute  imeni A.F. Mozhayskiy, he was assigned to the apparatus of the  commander-in-chief of the PVO Forces. He has been chief of the  airfield-engineering service of the Rear-Support Directorate of  the PVO Forces since September 1992.    The servicing of flight fields, artificial coverings and  complex and expensive airfield structures has become markedly  more difficult with the appearance of aircraft that have high  takeoff and landing characteristics, large flight weights and  high tire pressures.    Whereas the length of runways usually did not exceed 1,200  meters by the start of World War II, today their dimensions have  increased several times over, and the materials used to  construct and maintain them have changed as well. The length of  taxiways, aircraft parking areas and the ground portions of  flight fields have increased accordingly. Many different  structures and systems to support flights have appeared at  airfields. A whole series of problems is arising in connection  with the preparation and operation of airfields in the regions  of the Far North.    This pertains first and foremost to the vehicles that fight  ice buildup on airfields. The TM-59 vehicle, developed as long  ago as 1959, is still in service in airfield-operations  subunits. The inventory of these vehicles is completely worn  out, with each of them having been subjected to a minimum of 5-6  major overhauls and in service for some 16-18 years now. The jet  engines used on these vehicles, from older types of aircraft,  are not produced by industry today. The new vehicles coming to  the aviation technical units are equipped with the same engines,  which have been rebuilt and assembled from several parts, which  in turn reduces their service lives considerably. There has long  been no stockpile of these engines in the armed forces, while  the development of a fundamentally new vehicle with a new and  accessible engine is still not under consideration; this forces  the independent manufacture of homemade heating vehicles, with  new aircraft engines, made from whatever is available in the  field.    All of this pertains to the other vehicles used for the  operational maintenance of airfields as well, on which only the  base vehicle has actually changed, as a rule, while they  essentially remain the same as before with the same production  capabilities.    The delivery of new vehicles, especially with the transition  of the economy to market relations, is limited and difficult in  view of their high cost, the shortage of jet engines, the lack  of an adequate quantity of appropriations and the locations of  the principal supplier plants of airfield operational equipment  in now-sovereign states. Their overhaul is also performed on the  territory of the independent state of Ukraine, which often leads  to unwarranted delays in the performance of repairs and their  shipment to the units, also reducing the technical-readiness  factor of the airfield-operation subunits.    There is also another way of battling the formation of ice  on  artificial surfaces -- chemical-mechanical methods, consisting  of melting the ice buildup that has occurred with the subsequent  removal of the by-products of the interaction of reagents with  the ice. But this does not have full impact in fighting the ice,  especially when the temperatures of the surrounding air are  considerable, and has a negative impact on the quality of the  concrete and the ecology of the environment. These methods can  thus be used only in extremely limited instances.    There are other problems connected with providing the  aviation technical and airfield-engineering units with the  engineering equipment supplied through military-district  channels as well. The shortage of specialists able to work with  that equipment is also causing enormous unease. The engineering  equipment levels in rear-support unit are currently less than 50  percent, and the same goes for specialists. They are being  trained in the units, and their professional level clearly does  not meet requirements.    There are also not enough junior specialists for the  airfield-operation equipment, since the rear support of the PVO  Forces has been left without the training regiment that is now  on the territory of Ukraine.    Another nuance that complicates the operational maintenance  work of airfields is the removal of the logistical-supply  service from the composition of rear support; the procurement of  national-economic equipment, tools for the performance of  operations on the artificial surfaces and operational materials  for the maintenance of not only the surfaces of the airfields,  but also a host of buildings and structures in the service and  technical infrastructure, was carried out through them until  quite recently. The rear support of the PVO Forces now does not  have an independent body that has the right to order products  for production and technical purposes.    These are far from all of the problems arising today in  airfield engineering support for PVO aviation. We could talk a  great deal more about the extremely low manpower levels of the  airfield-operations and airfield-engineering subunits with  conscript personnel, or the shortage of officer cadres.    No difficulties, however, remove from the "field"  specialists  their crucial duties for the reliable airfield-engineering  support of the aviation of the PVO Forces.    From the editors: The problems that were  raised in this correspondence roundtable cannot be resolved in  an instant. Many of the issues, after all, cannot even be  removed by the specialists "on high." But they, invested with  authority, are nonetheless able to ease the service of those who  are below, on the ground, preparing the equipment to go up into  the sky. They need only alter somewhat their psychology in  relation to the specialists of the supporting services, and  focus on the paraphrased words of that well-known song, "The  aircraft come first, first the aircraft, and the hardware, well,  the hardware later..."

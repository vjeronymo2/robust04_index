			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BODDICKER, RED SOX STAY ON SKIDS  </P> <P> In June, when they seemed unbeatable, Roger Clemens and Mike Boddicker of the  Boston Red Sox were being compared with other outstanding pitching duos.  </P> <P> They had been largely responsible for the Red Sox climbing from third place in  the American League East to a 4 1/2-game lead over Toronto.  </P> <P> In June, Boddicker was 4-0 and in the middle of a 10-game winning streak.  Clemens was 4-1 for the month.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the two right-handers have faltered, and the Red Sox are struggling  to stay ahead of the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Although the Royals were without Bo Jackson, and Danny Tartabull pulled a groin  muscle in the third inning, Kansas City jumped on Boddicker and the Red Sox,  5-3.  </P> <P> It was Boston's fifth loss in a row. Boddicker, who has lost two of the five,  gave up 10 hits and four runs in seven innings. Clemens also has a loss in the  string of defeats.  </P> <P> Jackson, missing because of a death in the family, is not expected back for  today's doubleheader with the Red Sox, and Tartabull will be out several games.  </P> <P> Mike Macfarlane, who struck out the first two times he faced Boddicker, was  successful the third time. The catcher hit a two-out, two-run single in the  sixth inning to break a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> "As I stood in the on-deck circle," Macfarlane said, "I knew he would throw the  curve that usually gets me. This time I got enough of it for a base hit. I had  runners in scoring position every time. I guess I was due."  </P> <P> Boddicker has lost two in a row since learning that after winning 10 in a row,  he wasn't chosen for the All-Star game.  </P> <P> Tom Gordon (6-6) was the winner, but the Red Sox had runners on second and  third in the ninth inning when Jeff Montgomery retired Mike Greenwell with a  grounder to end the game.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, New York 2 -- Greg Hibbard (7-5) said he was rather lucky to extend  his string of unbeaten starts to seven in this game at New York.  </P> <P> Hibbard gave up seven hits and both Yankee runs in seven innings before Barry  Jones and Bobby Thigpen took over. Thigpen pitched the ninth inning for his  28th save.  </P> <P> An errant throw by Steve Sax contributed to the White Sox scoring in the fifth  inning. After Scott Fletcher singled, Sax tried to catch him rounding first,  but his throw went into the stands for a two-base error.  </P> <P> Lance Johnson hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Fletcher with what proved to be  the winning run.  </P> <P> Baltimore 8-1, Minnesota 5-3 -- Phil Bradley made an auspicious return from  arthroscopic wrist surgery in the opening game of the doubleheader at  Baltimore.  </P> <P> With the Orioles trailing, 5-4, and the bases loaded in the eighth inning,  Bradley, batting for the first time since June 16, hit a grand slam to win the  game.  </P> <P> The Twins, getting sparkling pitching from David West (5-6) and Terry Leach,  won the nightcap when Kent Hrbek and John Moses hit home runs. Hrbek also  homered in the opener.  </P> <P> Randy Milligan hit two home runs in the opener for the Orioles.  </P> <P> The Twins received a scare when starting pitcher Kevin Tapani was hit in the  shin by a line drive hit by Joe Orsulak in the first inning. X-rays were  negative and the nine-game winner is not expected to miss a turn.  </P> <P> Texas 7, Detroit 6 -- Cecil Fielder hit his major league-leading 29th home run  in the sixth inning at Detroit to give the Tigers a lead, but they couldn't  hold it.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia delivered the big hit for the Rangers. His three-run double  keyed a four-run seventh inning that brought them from behind.  </P> <P> Bobby Witt, who is 4-1 in his last eight starts, needed help from the bullpen  to win it.  </P> <P> Kenny Rogers earned his eighth save when he struck out Fielder and Gary Ward  with runners on first and third.  </P> <P> It was the sixth victory in a row for the Rangers.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 2, Oakland 0 -- Mark Knudson (6-4) pitched a seven-hitter and Dave  Parker hit his 12th home run at Oakland as the Brewers beat their nemesis, Dave  Stewart.  </P> <P> Stewart, who was 12-1 against the Brewers until he lost to them on July 4, has  lost four of his last five decisions, two of them to the Brewers.  </P> <P> The defeat, in which Stewart (11-8) gave up seven hits in eight innings, cut  Oakland's lead in the West to one game over Chicago.  </P> <P> Cleveland 13, Seattle 7 -- Sandy Alomar Jr. drove in four runs and the Indians  scored eight runs in the seventh inning at Seattle.  </P> <P> Tom Candiotti (10-4) allowed just five hits in seven innings, but the Mariners,  trailing, 13-1, scored six times in the bottom of the eighth inning.  </P> <P> The Indians sent 11 batters to the plate in the seventh inning.

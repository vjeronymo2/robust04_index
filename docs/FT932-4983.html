			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Dignity dies in Russian democratic dealings: The conference called to draft a new constitution has begun in chaos ACRIMONIOUS scenes over the weekend at President Boris Yeltsin's Constitutional Convention do not bode well for its ability to hammer out a new democratic constitution for Russia. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, stormed out with about 70 of the 700 participants, declaring the gathering illegal. Mr Yuri Slobodkin, author of an alternative Communist draft, was carried out kicking and screaming by security guards. Those leaving with the speaker included leaders of the local parliaments of Russia's 89 regions and republics. The scuffles have made it less likely that Mr Yeltsin will obtain endorsement for the constitution to be enacted through constitutional means. This provides for a final draft to be hammered out by the Constitutional Convention by June 16, and then initialled by the regional and republican leaders. The latter would then ask the Congress of People's Deputies to endorse the new constitution, which until now it has refused to do because it would be dissolved in the process. Elections to a new bicameral parliament, which would replace both the full and standing parliaments, would be held no later than October. If this plan is rejected by parliamentary deputies, Mr Yeltsin has said he will resort to other unspecified methods. Mr Khasbulatov's behaviour was dismissed as a 'provocation' by Mr Yeltsin, who had valiantly tried to keep the meeting dignified. He told delegates 'our descendants will not forgive us. . . if we do not reach the agreement which is our main task'. The new constitution, providing a clearer division of powers and a stronger executive, was essential to replace an old system incompatible with reforms and democracy, he said. However, while many members of the existing parliament are co-operating with him and some are uncertain whether to back Mr Khasbulatov in a fight he is likely to lose, the president cannot yet count on a majority of Congress. This puts Mr Yeltsin at the mercy of republican and regional leaders, who are seeking significant concessions diluting plans for a federal state in return for endorsing the constitution. Mr Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the young millionaire president of the republic of Kalmykia, said yesterday he wanted his own draft constitution to be discussed, adding that Moscow should no longer levy taxes directly from subjects of the Russian Federation. This would be a first step on the road to the country's collapse, even though Mr Ilyumzhinov's draft proclaims the Federation to be united and indivisible. A group of regional leaders also demanded more subsidies from central government and that the central bank continue covering debts accumulated between inefficient enterprises. The undignified circus at the convention was symptomatic of the point-scoring gripping Russian political life. On Friday, the head of the president's control department held a news conference to report on his investigation into corruption allegations by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi. While the official, Mr Alexei Ilyushenko, did not get round to the most serious allegations involving some of Mr Yeltsin's closest aides, he said most of the vice-president's accusations of embezzlement by commanders of the Russian army had been unsubstantiated. He added that he was also trying to investigate a business alleged to have benefited from corrupt practices. Simultaneously, parliament voted to ask the Constitutional Court to protect the vice-president's rights. His limousines, staff, and official functions have been systematically whittled away by Mr Yeltsin since making those allegations. Mr Rutskoi's post will also be abolished under the new constitution. An unwitting party to the chaos was Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, who found himself squeezed into the president's and prime minister's timetable just as the convention was about to start. 'He (President Yeltsin) is very confident they are going to win those reforms and that there will be no stepping back,' said Mr Bentsen, leaving the Kremlin as the delegates were arriving. He told Russian leaders the country had to get inflation under control and proceed with structural reforms in order to benefit from large-scale western aid.</p>

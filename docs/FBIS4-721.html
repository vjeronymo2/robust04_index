			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwanda is enduring a wait. The capital, Kigali, is  waiting to see one of the two sides gain the upper hand. It  does not appear that the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] have taken complete control of the town. So far, they  have dug trenches along a frontline in the center of town. This  morning, the government radio called on the people to mobilize  against those who want to take power, I quote.    The United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda is  continuing  its contacts with the warring sides to attempt to get them to  meet. Meanwhile, the French and Belgian paratroopers are waiting  for a period of calm at the airport in order to be able to  repatriate their nationals.    The International Committee of the Red Cross has announced  that it has lost 30 employees; as for UNICEF, it has lost 7 of  its employees.</p>

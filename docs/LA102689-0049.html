			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX, PENGUINS STRUGGLE AGAIN  </P> <P> For the last two seasons, Mario Lemieux has been the National Hockey League  scoring champion and has been voted by his peers as the league's best player.  </P> <P> Last season the powerful center, in his fifth year, finally led the Pittsburgh  Penguins into the playoffs.  </P> <P> This season, Lemieux, 25, was supposed to remove any doubt regarding his  superiority over Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> Instead, the 6-foot-4, 200-pounder has been mired in a slump.  </P> <P> Lemieux ended a two-game scoreless string with an assist Wednesday night at  Pittsburgh, but it was not enough to keep the Penguins from losing again.  Daniel Marois scored the tiebreaking goal with two minutes left and the Toronto  Maple Leafs won, 8-6.  </P> <P> With Lemieux scoring 15 goals and accumulating 33 points, the Penguins were 6-3  at this stage last season. This season, they are 3-5-1, and Lemieux has only  four goals and 15 points. He has a simple explanation.  </P> <P> "I'm not the player I was a year ago," he told the Associated Press. "I'm not  playing like I did then. It seems that I'm a step behind all the time and I  don't have the jump I had last year. With the season almost a month old, it's  beginning to get serious."  </P> <P> Hartford 2, Quebec 0 -- After a decade as one of the best goaltenders in  hockey, Mike Liut slipped last season. Bothered by nagging injuries, he played  in only 35 games and had a high goals-against average of 4.25.  </P> <P> Injury-free again, Liut, 33, is off to a brilliant start. By stopping all 22 of  the Nordiques' shots at Hartford, Conn., Liut improved his league-leading  goals-against average to 1.81.  </P> <P> It was his 21st shutout, tops among active goaltenders, but his first in almost  a year.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever played a stretch in which I had such support in front  of me," Liut said.  </P> <P> Six of Liut's saves, including three spectacular ones, were against Hall of  Famer Guy Lafleur.  </P> <P> Dave Babych and Pat Verbeek scored first-period goals to give Liut all the  support he needed.  </P> <P> Edmonton 3, New York Rangers 3 -- The way things have been going for the Oilers  lately, ties on the road against both New York teams represents a good trip.  </P> <P> For the second night in a row, Jari Kurri rallied the Oilers in the closing  moments to get the tie.  </P> <P> Tuesday night at Uniondale, he scored a goal and assisted on another as the  Oilers wiped out a two-goal deficit. In this one, the high-scoring wing got the  puck in a scramble in front of the net and scored his seventh goal with 4:14  left in regulation.  </P> <P> Minnesota 4, Buffalo 2 -- Defenseman Larry Murphy scored his first goal of the  season 17 seconds after Soviet Alexander Mogilny tied the score for the Sabres  in the third period.  </P> <P> Murphy, who leads the North Stars with 11 assists, enabled his team to remain  perfect at home (4-0-0).  </P> <P> Mogilny's goal, his first in the NHL, came at 1:25 of the final period.  </P> <P> Winnipeg 6, Washington 4 -- Dale Hawerchuk scored a goal and assisted on two  others at Winnipeg to lead the Jets to victory.  </P> <P> Dave Ellett scored the go-ahead goal on a power play halfway through the final  period, then set up an empty-net goal in the final seconds by Greg Paslawski.

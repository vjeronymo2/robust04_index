			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / The Nature of Things: Maths-based trading brings eldorado closer Making money out of financial markets purely by applying mathematical principles, without having to know anything about the shares or currencies or commodities being traded, is a long-standing dream. Chartists - or technical analysts, as they prefer to be called - have believed for decades that they are half way to eldorado, identifying buying and selling signals on price charts. But the evidence backing their claims has been equivocal at best. Now, however, new-style mathematical operators are emerging. They use powerful computers, programmed with innovative models of the way markets work, to pick out subtle signs that would be invisible to the eye of the traditional chartist. And the latest evidence suggests that some have struck gold. It is hard to gauge the extent of maths-based computer trading, or its record so far, because almost all the active practitioners are highly secretive. They think that as word gets out about their successes and more people join in, it will become harder to maintain an advantage. So the pioneers are reluctant to talk about what they are doing, let alone divulge any details of technique. But observers believe that more than a dozen companies, ranging from large banks to specialised investment boutiques, have started such funds within the last year. Their returns (net of transaction costs) are said to be at least 10 per cent a year better than the overall markets in which they operate. So what is the secret? Unfortunately, there isn't one - or rather, nothing within the reach of ordinary private investors. There is no simple formula to learn, no predictive program you can feed into a personal computer to flash reliable 'buy' and 'sell' signals. Profitable trading requires an immensely complicated combination of formulae, extracted from relatively new mathematical fields such as non-linear statistics, chaos theory and neural networking. To make good use of them, you need an immense database - filling billions of bytes of computer memory and ideally covering every trade or price movement in your chosen market for the past few years. Before you begin live trading, your computer has to analyse the database extensively, finding consistent patterns on which it can base predictions of future movements. And of course you must have on-line access to the market, so that you can execute a deal the moment the computer tells you conditions are right. Given the present state of computer technology and knowledge about market behaviour, you probably need at least Dollars 100m to sustain a maths-based trading fund. Computer-based prediction does not rely on inefficiencies in the market - getting hold of price-sensitive information before everyone else has. Indeed it works best in a perfect market undistorted by inefficiency. Ultimately it makes use of the fact that market traders act in ways that are inconsistent but, to some extent, predictable. In technical terms, their behaviour is non-linear; their reactions are not in proportion to events. A very simple example of non-linearity is to ask yourself whether you would prefer to receive a guaranteed Pounds 8,000 or an 80 per cent chance of winning Pounds 10,000. Then ask whether you would rather lose a certain Pounds 8,000 or take an 80 per cent risk of losing Pounds 10,000. The common answer is to take the cheque in hand in the first case and run the risk in the second. In other words, people are more ready to take a chance with a loss than with a profit, even when the odds are identical. Although some non-linear systems are too complex to predict even with the most powerful computers, financial markets come just within the bounds of useful predictability. And they seem to be rather more predictable at times of increased volatility, when markets are rocked by external events. The point is not to forecast the events themselves but their knock-on effects. The techniques offer a feast of jargon. The autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model, for example, shows how periods of market volatility are clustered. Time-delayed embedding reveals that market trends last for longer in periods of low volatility. Maths-based computer trading is likely to spread rapidly as word gets around about its success. Once the technique has proved itself, financial institutions will enable small investors to join in, by launching mathematical mutual funds or unit trusts. The veins of predictability will become harder to exploit, as more people try to mine them. Ever more sophisticated programs will be required, running on ever more powerful computers. But now that a mathematical eldorado has been discovered, it is unlikely to disappear completely.</p>

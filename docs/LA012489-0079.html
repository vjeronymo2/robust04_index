			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS SEND CARPENTER TO BRUINS TO GET KASPER  </P> <P> General Manager Rogie Vachon, acting like a man who believes the Kings have a  shot at winning the Stanley Cup this spring -- a laughable notion in the  pre-Gretzky era -- made another deal Monday, sending forward Bobby Carpenter to  the Boston Bruins for center Steve Kasper.  </P> <P> In trading Carpenter, Vachon gave up the player who cost the Kings center  Marcel Dionne 2 years ago but never regained his scoring touch, even with the  advantage of playing left wing with Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> In Kasper, 27, the Kings are getting a player once voted the top defensive  forward in the National Hockey League, a reputation earned in great measure by  his skill in shadowing Gretzky.  </P> <P> "We're getting ready," Vachon said, looking forward to the playoffs. "Our team  has been giving up too many goals, and we have to adjust defensively to go into  the playoffs.  </P> <P> "Steve Kasper is the type of guy we needed," Vachon added. "He is one of the  best defensive forwards in the league, and he is an outstanding penalty killer.  </P> <P> "We have to really start thinking defensive hockey. There are some teams,  you're not going to get too many good scoring chances. That's when you have to  play a grinding game and wait for your chances. We haven't been doing that  consistently, which is one of our problems."  </P> <P> Kasper became the second Bruin-turned-King in 3 days. Late Saturday night,  Vachon -- looking for more muscle -- obtained wing Jay Miller for future  considerations, which at the time figured to be a mid-round draft choice. The  Carpenter-Kasper deal wipes out any further compensation by the Kings for  Miller.  </P> <P> The timing of Monday's trade was curious, because Carpenter has not played  since Dec. 31, when he broke a bone in his right hand, affecting his thumb. But  the injury-wracked Bruins, Stanley Cup finalists last spring but 3 games below  .500 this season, decided after consecutive weekend defeats by Buffalo to make  the deal.  </P> <P> "It might look like a bit of a shot," Boston General Manager Harry Sinden said,  "but it's not easy to go out and deal for a goal-scorer. Hopefully, we'll get  him scoring again."  </P> <P> Sinden said that Carpenter, who was scheduled to be examined by a doctor in Los  Angeles today, thought he could have his cast removed and be ready to play in a  week to 10 days. One King official, however, estimated that it could be closer  to a month before Carpenter returns.  </P> <P> Carpenter, the first American player ever to make the jump from high school to  the NHL, scored 53 goals for the Washington Capitals in 1984-85, the first  American to score 50 or more. He was 22 years old.  </P> <P> Now, after a brief stint -- 28 games -- with the New York Rangers and 120 games  with the Kings, Carpenter will be playing for his fourth team before his 26th  birthday.  </P> <P> "I'm reading nothing into that," Sinden said. "I've learned not to read  something into situations like that. If I'd believed what was out there at the  time we traded for Rick Middleton, I would have been 100% wrong."  </P> <P> Middleton, who retired last season, was a journeyman forward who blossomed into  a 50-goal scorer with the Bruins.  </P> <P> Carpenter had only 11 goals and 15 assists in 39 games this season. After  scoring 145 goals in his first 4 seasons, all with Washington, Carpenter's  totals read: 27, 9, 19 and 11.  </P> <P> Sinden is hoping that a return to the Boston area, where Carpenter was a prep  star, will help to revive his game.  </P> <P> "I thought he was playing pretty damn good until he got hurt," Sinden said.  "I've always followed his career, but in those last couple of weeks I noticed a  change in his play. A little more intensity, a little more drive."  </P> <P> Carpenter came to the Kings on March 10, 1987, from the New York Rangers, along  with defenseman Tom Laidlaw, for Dionne, Jeff Crossman and the Kings'  third-round pick in this year's draft.  </P> <P> "It's a case where we weren't really dissatisfied with him," Vachon said. "He  worked really hard in the time he was here. We were just expecting a little  more offense from him."  </P> <P> Coach Robbie Ftorek, who said that Carpenter reported to camp in great shape  last fall, moved him from center to left wing to give him a chance to play with  Gretzky.  </P> <P> Guaranteed goals? Not for everyone, Ftorek said.  </P> <P> "Bobby worked so hard this year -- I thought his defensive game improved  immensely," Ftorek said.  </P> <P> "But with Wayne, you've got to relax and play, don't be intimidated. Some  players become intimidated a little bit, at least subconsciously. . . . It's a  difficult position to be put into."  </P> <P> That difficulty wears off, Ftorek said, once you start scoring goals and  recognize when to take your shot and when to make a play. Carpenter, however,  never got going.  </P> <P> "He didn't shoot the puck as much as we would have liked him to shoot it,"  Ftorek said. "He's got a great shot.  </P> <P> "Bobby has so much talent, I feel confident in him. I know he was coming  around. He's going home now, and the shorter rink (at Boston Garden) with his  quickness should help him."  </P> <P> Vachon said he has been after Kasper for 3 years. In 1982, Kasper won the Selke  Award as best defensive forward. As a rookie, he followed Gretzky everywhere so  closely that after a game at Edmonton, when Kasper failed to show up on the  team bus and Coach Gerry Cheevers wondered where he was, another player said:  "He followed Gretzky home."  </P> <P> Kasper, who is 5-foot-8 and 170 pounds, has 10 goals and 16 assists in 49  games. Last season was his best offensively, with 26 goals and 44 assists.  Besides being a strong penalty killer, he is regarded an excellent faceoff  player.  </P> <P> "There was never a time he put on the Bruins' uniform when he didn't play all  out," Sinden said. "Never."  </P> <P> Kasper is expected to join the Kings in time for tonight's game against the  Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> "The way it looks, the Bruins are going nowhere right now in a hurry," Kasper  said Monday. "Now I'm going to a team that seems to be making a real run at  things.  </P> <P> "They're certainly not just the Wayne Gretzky show. His coming to L.A. has made  other guys believe they can do it, too. Guys like (Bernie) Nicholls and (Luc)  Robitaille.  </P> <P> "(Mike) Krushelnyski and (Marty) McSorley have been there before, and from  everything I read, (John) Tonelli has been playing like a kid."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate  for the National Action Party [PAN], is in Chiapas, where he  commented on the debate.    [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I believe Dr.  Zedillo  suggested the three main parties hold the first debate. I,  however, am willing to attend debates with the other candidates.  We all have the right to participate. It would be practically  impossible to have all the candidates in the same place at the  same time, but I am open to the idea, and the other candidates  will find that I am very willing to participate with them in  many debates. Perhaps we can soon set dates to debate national  issues and our political proposals with other candidates. [end  recording]    [Further on in the same newscast, there is a recording of  Institutional Revolutionary Candidate Ernesto Zedillo responding  to Fernandez de Cevallos' acceptance of the debate invitation:  "I am very pleased to know that a least one of the candidates I  invited to this debate has responded in the most constructive  manner possible. He has even suggested a date, 3 May, and a  debate format. This encourages me, and I would like to tell the  candidate who answered my invitation that I accept the date he  suggested."]</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for World Bank's 30-year global issue THE World Bank's careful preparation for its 30-year global bond paid off as bankers reported strong positive feedback to the much-awaited Dollars 1.25bn issue. Bankers say the indicated spread of 28-30 basis points over comparable US Treasuries is generous, particularly as the bond is strippable. Detaching the coupons from the bonds and selling them separately will add value, they say. Credit Suisse First Boston, joint book-runner with Goldman Sachs, said the issue was oversubscribed by buyers worldwide. Final pricing will take place today. More large-scale activity is being forecast in fixed rate dollars, involving borrowers with large requirements locking into the low fixed rates available. The durability of demand for collared floating rate notes continues to confound expectations, say bankers, noting that of all the issues so far this week only the Republic of Austria's has so far broken syndicate. Austria increased to Dollars 300m the 10-year collared floating rate note launched at the start of the week, in response to investor demand, said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the lead manager. Salomon Brothers said Nordic Investment Bank's Dollars 100m 10-year issue offers a slightly higher floor than some recent issues to reflect the relative trading levels of NIB paper compared with other supranational borrowers which are more traditionally considered to be retail names. The run of Canadian dollar issues continued, bringing the total launched this week to five, worth CDollars 850m. After General Electric Capital Corp's CDollars 100m five-year 8 per cent issue went well and broke syndicate quickly, lead manager UBS said the main attraction for the retail investors targeted was the pricing. Other bankers agreed the launch spread of 53 basis points looked generous. It tightened to around 49 basis points towards the end of the day. Electricite de France's CDollars 200m five-year deal was also attractively priced, with a launch spread of 45 basis points, said bankers. There was less certainty about Banque Nationale de Paris, which is tapping the 10-year area. Lead manager Hambros said it had detected strong retail demand, but the issue was thought to be moving rather slowly, given investor preference for five-year paper and for corporate rather than bank names. Hambros said the majority of the paper was sold, but conceded that the volume of supply meant investors might find it difficult to choose. This is BNP's first issue since its debt was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service last December. Credit Commercial de France described Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer's FFr3bn 12-year 8 1/4 per cent domestic bond with warrants as a re-opening of the French franc sector. It says around 55 per cent of the bonds were distributed internationally. SNCF also raised SFr300m over 12 years at 5 1/4 per cent through Swiss Bank Corp, representing the lowest coupon achieved for several years.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKBUSTING  </P> <P> Not having been to a New Kids concert I cannot honestly say what their concert  style is like, but I can say that if it's like their "Hanging Tough" or "Live  at Your House" specials on Disney, then it's not as bad as you say.  </P> <P> Saying that Jonathan Knight was a candidate for the Andrew Ridgely award for  superfluous presence in a pop act was uncalled for.  </P> <P> He holds the group together and doesn't need to be in the limelight. When I  told my 9-year-old cousin what superfluous meant, she was upset. Jonathan is  her favorite because he is shy and quiet.  </P> <P> (And as for) saying that maybe fans and their parents should stop wasting money  on New Kids paraphernalia, I would rather my cousin buy New Kids paraphernalia  than drugs on the street.  </P> <P> Have you ever really listened to the words of the New Kids songs? Up until  their last album, I never even heard them cuss. Their one cuss word is hell.  How many times a day does the average kid hear that word (from his or her)  parents?  </P> <P> What right do you have to judge people you don't even know? Calling Donnie a  lout was in my opinion unprofessional. Do you know him enough to call him a  lout? I wouldn't judge you on what you wrote about the New Kids. How can you  judge them on one concert?  </P> <P> ESTHER DAVIS, Yucaipa  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> LEAF BLOWER LAW EXEMPTION  </P> <P> Businesses and institutions will be exempt from a ban on gasoline-powered leaf  blowers that was approved two weeks ago, the City Council decided.  </P> <P> Mayor Nick Presecan and council members Algird G. Leiga and Bill McCready  opposed outlawing the blowers on commercial and institutional property when the  ordinance came before the council for a second reading Tuesday.  </P> <P> Arguing that the pollution produced by blowers is "insignificant," Presecan  proposed that businesses and institutions be permitted to use the equipment if  there is no harmful effect on nearby residents and their property. The ban on  use of the blowers in residential areas will be effective March 1.  </P> <P> The revision was opposed by members Judy Wright and Dianne Ring, who said the  move would create a "code enforcement nightmare."  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Europeans urge better Japan investment deal JAPAN must improve direct investment conditions for foreign companies or face 'increasingly strong' political pressure to redress the present imbalance in investment flows, according to a paper produced for European companies. Japanese investment in Europe had been more than 20 times larger than European investment in Japan in the past decade, the European Business Community (EBC), a Tokyo-based advisory committee to the EC, said in a paper. Tokyo had to ensure European companies had equal access to the Japanese market. 'If such opportunities are not created, this problem, which today has mostly commercial and economic dimensions, will develop an increasingly strong political dimension as well,' the EBC said. The paper focuses on the manufacturing and distribution sectors. It came as the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) released a report suggesting the pace of Japanese manufacturing expansion in Europe is slowing. At the end of January, 721 manufacturing companies had operations in Europe, an increase of 69 over the year, against an increase of 132 the previous year. About 21 per cent of those companies procured all of their components in Europe, up from 15 per cent a year earlier, while 34 per cent had Europeans as chief executives, against 31.6 per cent in January 1991. European companies listed five conditions hindering investment in Japan: high cost of land; a relatively long wait for returns on investment; high corporate taxes; problems of attracting well-qualified Japanese staff; and 'extreme difficulty' in acquiring Japanese companies. EBC officials said Japanese mergers and acquisitions abroad last year totalled 294, while only 18 foreign transactions took place in Japan. There were no legal obstacles to acquisitions but the environment 'was not conducive to foreign investments'. The EBC asked that Japanese government agencies 'affirm their commitment' to an increase in European investment and, more specifically, that the Japan Development Bank increase its pool of funds available to foreign companies from Y88bn (Pounds 373m) to Y120bn (Pounds 508m). Tokyo was urged to lift formal curbs on foreign investment in farming, mining and the leather industry, and allow foreign lawyers more freedom.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: A landmark case of old-fashioned theft - Two of the four defendants are found guilty Crash has cost British taxpayers over Pounds 150m THE COLLAPSE of Barlow Clowes was a landmark for the UK investment world of the 1980s. While insider trading and stock market manipulation had become known as the fashionable ills of the age, Mr Peter Clowes' little-known investment management business from the north-west was busy perpetrating a more old-fashioned form of financial wrongdoing: theft. Investors' money was used to provide Mr Clowes with an extravagant lifestyle, according to the prosecution case mounted by the Serious Fraud Office. New investments were taken in and used to pay 'returns' to existing investors in a constant recycling of money. It worked as long as new cash was available to feed the machine - a classic 'ponzi' scheme, one of the oldest forms of investment fraud. The case proved a watershed for the UK's system of financial regulation, for the public's confidence in investment firms, and, above all, for the strongly non-interventionist government of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Despite strong denials of any responsibility by the Department of Trade and Industry, which had been responsible for regulating the firm for many years, the government bowed to an unprecedented campaign mounted by Barlow Clowes' 11,000 mainly elderly investors. Attempts to launch a City 'lifeboat' to bail out Barlow Clowes' hapless investors were initially rejected by a financial establishment unwilling to admit Mr Clowes as one of its own. About 500 elderly investors had already died by the time Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, gave way to pressure to pay out compensation. The announcement of the pay-out coincided with the publication of a report by the ombudsman, which criticised the DTI on five counts of maladministration regarding the licensing and regulation of Barlow Clowes. The case has so far cost British taxpayers more than Pounds 150m. In its attempts to recover some of this money, the DTI has already issued more than 800 writs. The accountancy firms Touche Ross and Spicer &amp; Pegler (which has since merged with Touche), the four biggest UK clearing banks - and a number of investment advisers who put money into Barlow Clowes - may all be sued to recover the taxpayer's money. So far only Pounds 550,000 has been recovered  -after a successful action against an adviser, ACD Miller. At the start of the trial last summer, the jury was told that the Barlow Clowes fraud was massive, flagrant and 'as old as the hills' in style. According to Mr Alan Suckling QC, bringing the prosecution for the SFO, investors were persuaded that their money would be securely invested in gilts, when in reality it was spent on 'living the life of Riley'. Showing the jurors a photograph of Mr Clowes's yacht - formerly owned by Christina Onassis - he told them: 'If you look carefully you will see the only gilt-edged object bought with investors' money by Mr Clowes. Can you guess what it is? The taps'. One of the last things investors thought their money would be spent on was the chateau and vineyard near Bordeaux bought for Pounds 600,000, he said. As he listed other ways that clients' money had been spent - on luxury cars and funding corporate raids - Mr Suckling's style was to let the facts speak for themselves, underlining his points with only a tone of dry irony. The jury was presented with a detailed account of how the fraud operated. The company's brochures stated that clients' money would be invested in gilt-edged stock - a crucial selling point for those anxious to find a secure place to invest their life savings. However, contracts contained clauses authorising non-gilts investments which, Mr Clowes was to maintain, enabled his company to adopt an 'alternative investment strategy'. This strategy, far from being based on gilts, saw Barlow Clowes operating as a mini merchant bank and funding take-over bids for public and private companies it wanted to control. Between 1983 and 1987 more than Pounds 113m of the funds invested in the offshore companies and partnerships in the Barlow Clowes fund management empire were milked from investors, Mr Suckling said. At the end of 1987, when DTI inspectors began investigating, strenuous efforts were made to throw them off the track. Documents were shredded, bogus letters were placed on files to indicate accounts had been closed and Pounds 16m of clients' funds were used to plug holes in the accounts. When the firm collapsed in May 1988 the true position emerged. More than Pounds 225m had been invested by clients and a Pounds 115m liability to them remained. Only Pounds 1.9m was found invested in gilts. The value of other assets discovered by the receivers and liquidators totalled Pounds 60m. Otherwise, the cupboard was bare. Mr Clowes had been 'the instigator and driving force' behind the fraud, the prosecution said. Mr Peter Naylor, a computer consultant, had been his 'lieutenant' in helping milk investors' funds. Over the course of the 109-day trial, 113 witnesses gave evidence. These included a succession of investors who recounted why, attracted by the security of gilts, they had put their money into Barlow Clowes. One, who had invested Pounds 440,000, said she had done so because she understood that her savings would be 'as safe as the Bank of England'. Only two of the defendants - Mr Clowes and Mr Naylor - opted to go into the witness box to give evidence. Mr Clowes admitted very few gilts had been bought. He agreed that although the group billed itself as a gilts specialist it in fact acted as a mini merchant bank. However, he repeatedly denied that his dealings had been dishonest. The clauses in his company's contracts allowing other investments meant his conduct had been 'absolutely honest', he insisted. The complex arrangements for handling investors' funds were not a laundering operation, as the prosecution suggested, but a means of maintaining clients' confidentiality, he told the court. Summing up, Mr Justice Phillips ruled that the Barlow Clowes contract with investors did not permit the alternative investment strategy adopted by Mr Clowes. This did not necessarily mean, however, that the defendants' conduct had been dishonest or criminal. That was for the jury to decide, he said.</p>

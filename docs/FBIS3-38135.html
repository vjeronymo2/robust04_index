			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial: "France Versus America -- A </F> Convenient Quarrel"]    [Text] Sarajevo's cannons have sparked an unexpected  controversy in Franco-American relations, even though portents  of the current crisis have been far from scarce in the last few  months. In any case, acrimonious may be the kindest term that  can be applied to relations between Paris and Washington today.  Given the tone used by the French and the Americans in  lecturing each other on political ethics, one finds it hard to  believe that this is a dialogue between two allies, two friends.    Paris is convinced that those who are today blocking the  peace process painstakingly elaborated by the Twelve are the  Muslims, encouraged by the United States, which has been  sustaining the hope of an illusory Western intervention. Such  is clearly the opinion of the French foreign minister, who has  asked the Americans to exert pressure on the Muslims. As a  result, a suitably incensed Washington has reminded the  apparently oblivious France of decency's imperatives. Any  pressure should be exerted on the Serb aggressor, not on the  Muslims, who are the victims. In other words, the Americans do  not mind a continuing war as long as moral standards are  preserved.    The oratory contests stemming from this basic disagreement  are only a symptom of the malaise that permeates an  international community confronted with its obvious inability to  put an end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has known since 1940.    While France, together with its European partners, has  spared  no effort in its attempt to achieve a negotiated settlement, it  can only recognize today that every initiative it took was  ultimately a failure. As for America, the only country able to  muster the necessary means for imposing peace on the three  warring factions, its primary concern has always be and still is  to avoid being drawn into the Bosnian bloodbath. Thus heaping  charges and countercharges upon each other, Paris and Washington  look like an old couple bickering over its reciprocal  shortcomings.    However, the slightly sordid quarrel may in fact be no more  than a convenient smoke screen. Since neither the French nor  the Americans or their European Union and NATO allies agree on  what must be done, it necessarily follows that nothing will be  done. Which is exactly what all of them want. One must be  resigned to the fact that the end of this war is as far off as  it ever was....</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur April 20 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec and Premier of the Malaysian Federation  Datuk Sri Mahathir talked today about the necessity of  diversifying international contacts, Zieleniec said at the end  of his Malaysian visit.    They also discussed the possibilities of cooperation between  the Czech Republic and Malaysia, and the export of traditional  Czech goods here. At the press conference Zieleniec mentioned  Czech glass, saying that he had seen Bohemia Glass products in  several Kuala Lumpur shops.    He and Mahathir had agreed that joint companies were a  suitable form of cooperation, Zieleniec said, adding that the  two countries could work together in Vietnam, for example.    They did not talk about specific projects, he said, because  this was up to individual companies. Asked by local journalists  what the Czech Republic could offer Malaysians interested in  cooperation, Zieleniec replied that the Czechs offered the same  possibilities to everybody.    He also declared that he believed in the rapid signing of  two  agreements, on trade and the protection of investments, and had  given proposals for them to Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian  trade and industry minister.    There had been no talk for the meantime about a further  necessary document, that on the prevention of double taxation,  Zieleniec said.    He told journalists that he had conveyed an invitation to  the  Czech Republic from Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus to Premier  Mahathir.    Relations between the Czech Republic and Malaysia began to  develop properly in the 1980's. The main Czech exports to  Malaysia are engineering products and consumer goods, including  glass, pianos and sporting and hunting equipment.</p>

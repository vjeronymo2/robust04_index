			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia has announced the composition of the  parliamentary delegation which will consult Vietnam on human  rights. The one-week visit to Vietnam will start on 7 July and  will be led by the chairman of the parliamentary standing  committee on foreign affairs, defense, and trade, Stephen  Loosley. The other two parliamentary members will be the  opposition spokesman on foreign affairs Andrew Peacock and the  Australian Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Vicky Vaughan.    The consultative delegation to look at human rights and  other  issues in the relationship was confirmed during the visit to  Vietnam last month by Australia's prime minister Paul Keating.    Announcing the delegation's makeup, Foreign Minister Gareth  Evans said it would be accompanied by two academics noted for  their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights and two  prominent Vietnamese now living in Australia.    The academics are Professor Nancy Viviani, dean of faculty  of  the Asian studies at Queensland's Griffith University; and  Professor Philip Olsten, director of the Center for  International Law at the Australian National University.    Senator Evans said Australia had taken up the suggestion  from  the Vietnamese prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, made during his  visit in May last year that Vietnamese Australians should go  back to Vietnam to see the situation.    The foreign minister said the delegation will include Quang  Luu, head of radio for the Special Broadcasting Service and Ho  Mai, a Footscray city councillor in Melbourne.    Senator Evans said the delegation was a strong,  well-balanced  one that had  both status and expertise.</p>

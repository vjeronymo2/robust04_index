			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY PAY  </P> <P> How can it be possible that the state only pays it citizens $5 per day and 15  cents per mile one way for transportation when they are asked to report for  jury duty? This doesn't evencome close to minimum wage.  </P> <P> The daily pay barely covers lunch in one of the local restaurants, and the  allowance of 7 1/2 cents per mile does not even cover the price of gas for a  car.  </P> <P> Some people who serve are compensated by their employers, but those who are  unemployed and/ or retired are insulted by a payment of $5 per day for their  time.  </P> <P> This is an injustice and certainly should be remedied in the near future.  </P> <P> LESTER PRICE  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

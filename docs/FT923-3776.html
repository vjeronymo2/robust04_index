			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading behind Hillsdown fall DIFFICULT TRADING conditions facing a number of Hillsdown Holdings' activities contributed to a 10.8 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 2.12bn and a 12 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 92.1m. Pre-tax profits rose slightly to Pounds 78.1m (Pounds 77.6m) thanks to a lower interest charge of Pounds 14m (Pounds 27.1m). Excluding discontinued operations, sales rose 1.1 per cent to Pounds 2.06bn and operating profits fell 1.3 per cent to Pounds 86.4m. Operating profits from the food businesses fell from Pounds 84.7m to Pounds 77m. The main decline was in the fresh meat and bacon division, where operating profits were down from Pounds 13m to Pounds 7.7m. Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said there was severe overcapacity in the slaughtering industry. This had been expected to be reduced as higher standards for abattoirs were to be introduced. However, the industry had been given more time to meet the new standards, prolonging the overcapacity problem. Hillsdown has closed seven of its 23 abattoirs. Further there had been a shortage of sheep for slaughter following changes in the way farmers are paid for sheep, pushing up prices. Pig prices had risen as abattoirs bought more pigs to offset the fall in the number of sheep, and it had been difficult to pass on higher prices to consumers. In the food processing sector operating profits fell from Pounds 58.2m to Pounds 54.5m, but those from continuing operations rose from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 48.7m. Mr Newton said the acquisition of Anglia Canners had brought benefits, while growth continued in the salads, sandwiches, fish, fruit and vegetable areas. Poultry and egg profits rose from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 14.8m following the purchase of the JP Wood poultry business in the first half. Mr Newton said that so far margins in this business had not improved as hoped. Further cost cutting was planned. Among the non-food operations, which the group is planning to sell when conditions are better, furniture profits rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 5.9m despite the difficult state of the market. Housebuilding and property profits were down from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 11.9m, though on a comparable basis profits were up. Exchange rate movements, mainly the weakening Canadian dollar, had cost Pounds 1.4m at the operating level in the first half, and Mr Simon Moffat, finance director, said the effect could be double that in the second half.</p>

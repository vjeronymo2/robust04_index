			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Brussels misjudgments have cost millions, watchdog says THE European Commission is weakly managed, has poor accounting controls, and its misjudgments have cost European Community taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, according to a report published by the Court of Auditors yesterday. The EC financial watchdog's 1,100 page report criticises the Commission for wasting money in fisheries policy, programmes to widen sexual equality, aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and through extra expenses for travel-conscious members of the European Parliament. Its release comes as member states prepare for a showdown today in Brussels over new British proposals on the EC budget. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, has already called for the Pounds 47bn annual EC budget to be raised by just under a third over the next five to seven years. The UK and Germany, which doubt the need for such a rise, will find plenty of ammunition in the court's report identifying areas of endemic mismanagement and fraud: Subsidies for the olive oil sector have risen almost threefold to Ecu1.774bn (Pounds 1.4bn) since 1985 - even though there is often no proof that many of the producers exist. 'The system continues to be unreliable, even though the Commission has continued to tinker with it for more than 20 years,' the report says. Special support for beef and veal producers has risen more than sixfold to Ecu335m since 1987. But there is no common system for checking eligibility, and the payments encourage production at a time when beef and veal consumption are falling. The EC is paying wine growers to improve the quality of vines, while handing out subsidies to convert wine for industrial use or to destroy surplus vines. The court also criticised Operation Phare, an EC aid programme for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union which now covers 10 countries. It found that appraisal of projects took between 12 and 18 months, judged its contribution to the private sector as 'feeble' at the start of 1992, and considered the programme's extensive use of subcontracting inefficient. The court also said it saw no economic reason for building a 60-metre wide highway through thinly populated jungle in the west African state of Cameroon. And it voiced concern over the 11 per cent increase in travel expenses for European MPs to Ecu32m to cover the shuttle between their constituencies and European Parliament locations in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg. The Commission yesterday responded to the criticism by pointing out that some of the waste was the result of political decisions by member states, particularly on farm subsidies. Errors and shortcomings were often related to Community law, while the court had to be careful of making dubious general-isations and conclusions on the basis of isolated examples.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Exxon signs Indonesian natural gas field accord Exxon, the US energy group, announced yesterday it had finally reached agreement with the Indonesian government to develop the largest natural gas field in south-east Asia, the Natuna field in the South China Sea. Exxon will share the development costs with Pertamina, the state-owned Indonesian oil and gas company. Natuna will be the largest natural gas development project undertaken by Exxon. If demand for gas in the Asia-Pacific region is strong enough, it could involve the group spending as much as Dollars 40bn over the next 30 years. However, analysts believe the cash-strapped Pertamina will be unable to fund its share of the development costs, and that a third partner - possibly Mobil of the US - will be asked to join the project. Mobil said yesterday that it would be pleased to be invited to join the the Natuna development, but it had not been approached by either Pertamina or Exxon. Before construction and engineering work begins, Exxon must secure market outlets for the gas product. It will immediately start marketing the gas to Japan, North and South Korea, Taiwan and other countries in the region. The level of demand will determine the scale of the development, said Exxon, which estimates that production will not begin until after 2000. For Indonesia, the signing of the contract between Pertamina and Exxon should ensure that the country remains the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas over the next few decades. In recent years, production at other Indonesian gas fields has begun to decline, and a report by the World Bank last year attached 'critical importance' to the development of the Natuna field for the future of the country's natural gas industry.</p>

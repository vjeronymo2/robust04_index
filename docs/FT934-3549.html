			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sturge falls to Pounds 1.21m after Lloyd's dispute provisions An operating loss on insurance activities and a Pounds 2.5m provision to cover the potential costs of resolving Lloyd's disputes cut pre-tax profits at Sturge Holdings from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 1.21m in the year to September 30. A sharp decline in insurance fee income and profit commission was offset by a rise in other fees and commissions, and by substantially higher income at Wise Speke, the stockbroking subsidiary, leaving overall turnover flat at Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 33.2m.) Fee income fell by 32 per cent to Pounds 9.86m reflecting a reduction in the amount of insurance capacity managed by Sturge coupled with lower fee scales. Similarly profit commission (paid by syndicates to the agency) dropped by 29 per cent to Pounds 4.18m. These declines were partly offset by an increase in other fees and commissions to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 3.03m) but overall the insurance agencies incurred a Pounds 3.44m operating loss on turnover of Pounds 18.6m, compared with a Pounds 4.07m profit on turnover of Pounds 23.5m the previous year. In contrast Wise Speke reported record operating profits of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 100,000) with fees and commissions jumping by 54 per cent to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 9.64m.) Overall, the group reported a Pounds 1.32m operating loss compared with a Pounds 4.14m operating profit the previous year. Net interest and other income of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 3.61m) helped the group edge back into profits at the pre-tax level. Earnings per share of 1.5p compared with 9.4p a year earlier. The final dividend is cut to 2p (5.5p) making a total for the year of 3p (8.25p). Mr David Coleridge, chairman, noted that the results represented 'a significant fall,' but pointed out that the profit was struck after making the further provision to cover Sturge's contribution to the Lloyd's offer to Names. Commenting on the outlook Mr Coleridge said: 'Whilst the profit outlook for the group in the near future remains difficult, the prospects for Wise Speke are good and the portents for the insurance agencies are more favourable'.</p>

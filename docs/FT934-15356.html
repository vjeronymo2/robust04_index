			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Aker - Correction THE FT last Saturday incorrectly stated that the NKr526m (Dollars 74m) profit returned by Aker, the Norwegian cement and offshore technology group, for the first eight months of the year was due to a NKr702m exceptional gain, most of which came from the sale of its stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement producer. The sale of this stake in fact took place in the same period last year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts of Sharad Pawar Interview by Mahesh Vijapurkar: </F> "Ready To Work for Party: Pawar"]    [Text] Bombay, March 7. The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr.  Sharad Pawar, has stressed the need for the Congress to dispel  the impression that it was only chasing after power. Congressmen  should work hard to regain the confidence of the people. "The  time has come for the party functionaries to volunteer for  organisational work." I will be the happiest person to take up  any responsibility," he said in an interview to THE HINDU  excerpts from which [as published] been published yesterday. The  following are more questions and answers.    Q: You were once credited with the idea that those in  Government give up power.....    No, I am not speaking of another Kamaraj Plan. I had  definitely suggested that our position has reached such a state  in some areas that unless we work very hard, we will not be able  to enthuse the party workers and regain the confidence of the  public. We should make the people realise that we are serious.  There is an impression that we are here only for the sake of  power. We have to act to prove that power is only one important  instrument to deliver the goods and there are Congressmen who  are not chasing power but wish to give a stable government,  stability to the country and a proper direction to the  Government. If the Congress is weakened, the nation will be  weakened. If there is no strong Government in Delhi, the  country's economy would be hurt.    Without a proper environment, its health would deteriorate,  affecting the common man. It is the party's moral duty to keep  this country together, keep a stable government at the national  and State levels and see that the economic health improves. If  this has to be achieved I think the time has come for many  important party functionaries to forget other things, including  power for some time and concentrate on the party by volunteering  themselves for organisational work. I will be the happiest  person to take up any responsibility like this.    Q: Will persons come forward?    There are many who are ready to work, are in a position to  deliver the goods. If this kind of suggestion comes from the  party leadership, I think there are many leaders who will  respond.    Q: The economic reforms are in place. You have listed the  problems, you have suggested what attitude is required. What is  the specific programme to deliver the goods?    If the Congress were to discuss and decide some definite  programme...but how? To rebuild, go to the masses. There should  be more mass contact. Go and listen to the hostile people. Have  to go into details to understand why the hostility.    Q: In effect, is it like having to almost start a new party?    Yes, in some areas, it is like that. In the Hindi belt we  have to work like that.    Q: You once floated the idea of wider consultations to get  the party back to its healthy bounce. What happened to that?    It was discussed and decided that there should be a broader  meeting, beyond an extended CWC [Congress Working Committee], of  100 to 200 people from all over the country for a Narora-type  session, to assess the situation and finalise the programme. Our  colleagues in CWC are thinking on those lines. These kind of  camps could give a definite direction. Then the question would  arise: who will execute the task? Then the question will be  about who will give time and not expect anything in return? I  think a lot of people will respond within the Congress party.  <H5>  Collective Action </H5>   Q: A lot of people will have to respond since the party is  not the same as it was in its earlier phases, not specifically  controlled by an individual...    The situation is definitely changing. No individual can do  all this. There has to be collective action. There has to be a  team and there has to be a leadership like that of Narasimha  Rao, who has to give direction to the team.    Q: The solution lies in collective action emerging under the  direction of the party president?    That is right.    Q. Has it been missing for some time, maybe one or two  years?    I don't say missing, but we are not going on those lines.  That thinking is there, that feeling is there but no action on  those lines.    Q: This lack of action cannot be the character of the  Congress, which normally sets much store by its own survival  regardless of...    You see, though Congressmen are generally inclined to work,  unfortunately, this time what has happened is that the  traditional bases of the party have been wiped out...the  minorities, SCs [Scheduled Castes], STs [Scheduled Tribes],  backward classes, the middle classes, the brahmins in UP [Uttar  Pradesh]. They have deserted us. And we are not ready to pay a  serious thought why they have deserted. Karunakaran and  Janardhan Reddy Committees have given their report. I read it in  the newspapers but have no official copy. I think we have to go  into details, repair things, because there is no choice.    Q: Do you agree with the tone and content of the report?    I have not read it. The tone of the newspapers is motivated.  Just to write against me. It is the tone of the person who  briefed. His tone was perceptible in the reports. Some of the  members of the committee have said we have not discussed this.  We discussed poll outcome with 700 persons.....It is not  important. Except for one or two persons who may have said  something. It is not important, there may be some sentences here  and there. They said it was not the committee's contention. Some  of the members have told me that.    Q: The time and effort needed to build the party in time for  the polls would be....?    We are not in a position to wait for years. We have to act  immediately since we have to face the Lok Sabha elections in  1996 and get people's support. That is an immediate task. The  other side is to rebuild the organisation at various levels. It  may take two, three years, maybe even five years.    Q: When the bottomline has to evolve, some major decisions  would have to be taken. Do you think CWC will rise to the  occasion?    It has to. It is the question of next two, three weeks.  Major  decisions on organisation have to be taken. What is happening  today is that when Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh are taking  decisions and there is some acceptance, though it has led --  some rise in prices -- people are suffering they also feel this  is a proper direction. But this is what the Government is doing.  That is not enough. I have seen in China, where communism has  been continuously propagated in the past, that the whole nation  is talking about economic reforms, and that is because the party  has taken up that challenge. It has created that atmosphere.  Take any person, landless labour, factory worker or a jawan of  the PLA [People's Liberation Army], everybody discusses  restructuring of economy. Because the party has taken the job on  hand. Here the Government has done everything and as Congressmen  we could not create that kind of favourable atmosphere for the  reforms and there is a gap. Who has read Dunkel carefully? Are  we to isolate ourselves from the global community? In national  interest we have to sit with others in a shrinking world,  everyone coming together. We cannot escape from the changes.  There is no deliberate gap but there is no effort. We are the  people who are responsible for it. All leaders at all levels. We  have to go to the people and explain to them. If we talk, people  respond, they are happy with the changes. People have to take  the party president more seriously.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: 'Seeing the whole' - The route to introducing management processes Sir, I was disappointed by Christopher Lorenz's conclusion from his reading of 'The Fifth Discipline', by Peter Senge, that organisational learning is likely to become the 'next American-spawned management fashion' (Management, February 17). Systematically, perhaps, Lorenz has captured the major themes of the book. Systematically, he has failed, in spite of the fact that the Fifth Discipline is all about systemic thinking. Lorenz shows every sign of being event-driven rather than rising above management fashions to understand the underlying processes. I accept that there are gaps and over-simplifications in the book. However, the message is clear: we need to 'see the whole' if we are to succeed in introducing any of the management processes of total quality, time-based competition, change management, etc. Our consultancy experience indicates that organisations are beginning to realise the power of systemic thinking - it is this that integrates the functional and operational areas of the organisation resulting in greater organisational effectiveness. The concept of the Learning Organisation is just one facet of systemic thinking. It is the application of systemic thinking that permits organisations to address such paradoxes as 'autonomy and control' and 'continuity and change'. TQM itself has raised these very questions: how do you 'empower' the workforce without losing control over the organisation; how can 'continuous improvement' take place? Management fads and recipes are no substitute for systemic thinking as a way to manage complexity. True, Senge is not the first to promote these ideas. One of the UK's foremost proponents of systemic management is Professor Stafford Beer, whose numerous works include 'Cybernetics and Management' in 1959; 'Platform for Change' in 1975; 'The Heart of Enterprise' in 1979; 'Diagnosing the System for Organisations' in 1985. So, what is new? Again the UK has been slow to accept its own home-grown ideas. If it takes Senge's evangelical fervour to waken UK plc and public sector organisations to the potential of systemic thinking, then so be it. Tony Gill, Syncho, Aston Science Park, Birmingham</p>

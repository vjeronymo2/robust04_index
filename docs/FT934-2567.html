			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Israeli and PLO leaders admit peace deal faces crisis Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation faced a potentially serious setback to their peace deal yesterday when they failed to implement the first stage of their agreement. Both sides admitted facing a crisis as Israeli troops remained in position in Gaza and Jericho, ignoring the first day of the timetable under which they are to withdraw by mid April. Israeli troops were due to begin pulling out of Gaza and Jericho yesterday under the accord signed in September. Three Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops in Gaza yesterday. One attempted to drive an ambulance packed with explosives into an Israeli patrol. Colonel Shuki Shichrur, deputy military commander of Gaza, said his troops were ready and waiting to withdraw from the strip and could do so within five weeks. However, Israel made not even a symbolic gesture yesterday to mark the start of the process. Both sides conceded that serious difficulties remained after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, failed toagree in Cairo on Sunday. The two have agreed to meet again in 10 days. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, told Reuters: 'It is a serious crisis . . . It is not the first, it is not the last. Negotiation is, in a way, a chain of crises you have overcome.' Mr Arafat said in the Hague: 'Definitely there are serious problems, otherwise why the delay for 10 days?' The PLO leader warned that any further delay would seriously damage the credibility of the peace process. Mr Rabin said it would be difficult to iron out outstanding differences between the two sides within 10 days although 'matters of principle' could be resolved in that period. Three key issues have yet to be agreed: the size of the Jericho area, control over the Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan border crossings, and the size and role of an Israeli military presence around Jewish settlements in Gaza. Mr Rabin said he would allow a Palestinian presence at the crossings, but would not concede control as this would involve fundamental issues of security and sovereignty. Some political analysts in Israel believe Mr Rabin is playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship by increasing the pressure on the PLO at a time of spiralling violence by extremists on both sides opposed to the peace process. They also believe Mr Rabin is playing the security card to win back waning public support for the government's peace drive after a growing number of attacks on Israelis.

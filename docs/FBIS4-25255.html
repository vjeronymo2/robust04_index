			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 KYODO -- Chinese police have  released a dissident in Fuzhou, Fujian Province after detaining  him during the June 4 anniversary of the crushing of  pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the  dissident said Wednesday [8 Jun].    Lin Xinshu, 51, interviewed by telephone, said he believes  his four-day detention was due to a letter he and nine other  Fuzhou intellectuals and students sent in late May to the  Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.    The letter called for the resignation of Premier Li Peng,  the  promotion to prime minister of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and for  compensation for those killed when the Chinese Army opened fire  upon unarmed citizens in the streets of Beijing in 1989.    Lin was picked up by plainclothes police on June 2 and  released Monday, he said. He did not know the whereabouts of  the other nine signatories.    He was forced into exile in Fuzhou from his native Beijing  in  1992 and has been detained six times since the 1989  pro-democracy protests, he said.    Three previous letters he sent to the central committee  demanded the resignation of Li, who signed the martial law order  of May 1989, Lin said. The letters also called for the  rehabilitation of ousted Communist Party general secretary Zhao  Ziyang, he said.    The Chinese Government in March ordered a nationwide  crackdown on political dissent aimed at weeding out those who  are opposed to the official verdict that the peaceful  demonstrations in 1989 was a "counterrevolutionary rebellion."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Assembly has adopted the government  proposal for Hungary to submit its application for accession to  the European Union. The parliament adopted the draft resolution  on submitting the accession application with 233 votes in favor,  zero votes against, and three abstentions.    It is possible that Hungary will submit its application to  join the European Union as early as next Thursday, and Poland  will probably do this at the same time, the Hungarian Foreign  Ministry's state secretary said. Janos Martonyi was speaking to  the MTI correspondent in Warsaw. He said that the main  objective of his visit to Poland was to coordinate policy on  European integration.    The state secretary observed that like the Hungarians,  Polish  foreign policy regards cooperation between the Visegrad  countries to be important.</p>

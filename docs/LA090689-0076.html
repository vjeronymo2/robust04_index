			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARK REBOUNDS WITH A KEY ASSIST BY MAGIC  </P> <P> At East Compton Park, where loitering gang members and drug dealers often  outnumber children at play, things started falling into place Tuesday like  Magic.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Laker star Earvin (Magic) Johnson and three other National  Basketball Assn. players dropped in at the Atlantic Avenue playground to teach  youngsters about dribbling, slam-dunking and free-throwing. By the end of the  day, the park itself was learning about rebounding.  </P> <P> Sparked by the enthusiastic turnout, recreation officials began making plans  for the playground's first-ever after-school reading program. Leaders of a  community sports league talked of introducing new teams at the park. And  mothers who had escorted their children to the playground without fear for the  first time in years were thinking about coming back.  </P> <P> At the center of it all was the 6-foot, 9-inch Magic.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old Laker guard brought along teammates Larry Drew and Michael  Cooper and the Los Angeles Clippers' Gary Grant for a free basketball clinic  for neighborhood youngsters. Johnson arranged for free T-shirts, tennis shoes  and lunches for the 300 children who signed up in advance for the two-hour  sports tutorial.  </P> <P> Hundreds of others, including adults, turned out to listen to the basketball  tips and admire the sports stars up close.  </P> <P> "Normally, I wouldn't let my kids come to the park because it's too rough,"  said Lawana Stephen, a Compton mother of three. "But this kind of activity is  nice. It gives kids who would probably just be hanging out something good to  do."  </P> <P> The expanded after-school park program was proposed Tuesday to Johnson by Mary  Lee Gray, senior deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana. She told  Johnson marketing manager Lon Rosen that the basketball star had brought "kids,  adults, senior citizens, ex-gang members" and others together to East Compton  Park for the first time.  </P> <P> Rosen said Johnson readily agreed to back the program.  </P> <P> "There are some things that Magic wants to try here," Rosen said. "He knows the  importance of role models to children."  </P> <P> Details about the after-school program will be worked out in coming days, Rosen  said.  </P> <P> Backers hope that Johnson -- either with his own funds or sponsors -- will  provide some of the money necessary to run the program, while the county and  local groups and such clinic participants as the Community Youth Sports and  Arts Foundation and the Brotherhood Crusade contribute matching funds.  </P> <P> The new athletic program was promised by Los Angeles County sheriff's officials  who run a growing sports league program from the sheriff's Lynwood station,  said Bob McCall, a county recreation supervisor in charge of East Compton Park.  </P> <P> "It took something like this to get things going," McCall said, watching lines  of children practicing their free-throws under Johnson's guidance.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Manny Anaya, a coordinator of the program and one of those  helping at Tuesday's basketball clinic, said sheriff's sports programs already  established at other parks include karate, baseball, soccer, baseball and  boxing.  </P> <P> Working with groups of 50 youngsters between the ages of 6 and 18, Johnson and  the other professional players managed to offer each child some personalized  instruction during the two-hour clinic.  </P> <P> "You just open your arms and say, 'I care, I love you,' " Johnson explained  during a break. "The motivation is to let people know that other people care  about them and they don't have to turn to crime or drugs."  </P> <P> From the background, Lynwood resident Charlie Edwards watched as Johnson put  his own two sons, Rance, 11, and Christopher, 13, through their paces. "Things  like this can give kids incentive," said Edwards, a pipe fitter. "It puts  something other than gang things on their minds."  </P> <P> Ten-year-old Jason Keith of Los Angeles was enthralled when Johnson put his  hands on his shoulders. Magic reached down to steady the boy when his shot  toward the hoop fell about five feet short.  </P> <P> "I felt like I was his son," Jason grinned afterward. "It felt good."  </P></p>

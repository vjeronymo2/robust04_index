			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Oil industry to share database Oil companies active in the UK are to set up a common database to store geotechnical data. The proposed scheme is part of a trend towards greater co-operation in areas where there is no competitive advantage at stake. The Common Industry Data Access Initiative might eventually eliminate the need for oil companies to retain paper copies of all technical data on individual wells in which they are financial partners. The industry spends between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year in reproducing well logs.</p>

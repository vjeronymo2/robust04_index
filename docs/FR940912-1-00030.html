			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In both the SOCMI NSPS and the HON, ``wastewater'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined to encompass both process wastewaters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance wastewaters. Examples of process wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams include, but are not limited to, wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exiting process unit equipment (e.g., decanter water, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as condensed steam used in the process), product tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drawdown, feed tank drawdown, filter-press filtrate, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residuals recovered from waste management units. Examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of maintenance wastewater streams, which encompass all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance-related wastewater streams, are those generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distillation traps, and draining of pumps into an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drain system. However, the regulatory approach taken in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI NSPS is different from the one taken in the final HON.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS requires that controls be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to reduce air emissions from both process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance wastewater streams from SOCMI process units that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce any of the listed chemicals. In the HON,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance wastewater is regulated by subpart F, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process wastewater is regulated by subpart G. Subpart F,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.105, requires the source owner or operator to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which includes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of procedures for managing wastewaters generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during maintenance. In the final HON, the facility's plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include a description of procedures that will ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all maintenance wastewater is properly managed and HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are controlled. No such plan is required in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA selected the regulatory approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance wastewater as proposed in the NSPS because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was determined through review of the industry, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included plant visits to newly constructed SOCMI process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, that the technologies available for the collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and treatment of these wastewaters have been adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated at SOCMI plants. The EPA is soliciting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on the proposed approach to regulating SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process unit maintenance wastewaters. The EPA is interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in receiving information on why new SOCMI process units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not be designed and operated to control air emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from maintenance wastewaters in the same manner as process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters and information on the impact the small-quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutoff for process units and the low-flow exemption for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams will have on the collection and treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of SOCMI maintenance wastewaters in relation to air emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wastewater streams at SOCMI plants are collected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated in a variety of ways. Generally, wastewater passes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a series of collection and treatment units before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being recycled to the facility or discharged from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. Collection and treatment schemes for wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are facility specific. The flow rate and organic compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition of wastewater streams at a particular plant are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions of the processes used, which in turn influence the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sizes and types of collection and treatment units. Many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the collection and treatment system units are either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly or indirectly open to the atmosphere; this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric interface creates a potential for VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The magnitude of VOC emissions from SOCMI process unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters is dependent on factors such as the physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties of the pollutants, the temperature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater, and the design of the individual collection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment unit managing the wastewater. Climatic factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as ambient temperature and wind speed also affect VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions at many wastewater collection and treatment units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential sources of VOC emissions associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater collection and treatment systems include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual drain systems, manholes, junction boxes, lift  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations, trenches, sumps, weirs, oil-water separators,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equalization or neutralization basins, clarifiers, aeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basins, storage and treatment tanks, surface impoundments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and containers. A discussion of each of these emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources is contained in Chapter 3 of the BID.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Pollutants to be Regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New source performance standards are developed under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority of section 111 of the Act. Section 111 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act requires the regulation of new and modified sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria pollutants (identified under section 110 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act) and certain other designated pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

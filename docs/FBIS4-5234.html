			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], the largest group in the coalition, will  accept a consensus among ruling parties on who should succeed  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, party head said Friday.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met reporters shortly after  Hosokawa announced he would step down.    The SDP differs from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  another  powerful party in the coalition, over major policies including  defense and tax.    However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader  Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, is named as new premier,  Murayama said that if the coalition parties' representatives  agree, "we will cooperate with the agreement."    A meeting of representatives is currently under way.    Asked whether the SDP would object to a prime minister from  Shinseito, Murayama said the most important thing now is to form  a government that can deal with the nation's domestic and  foreign problems.    "An agreement will not be made if each party sticks to its  own opinion," he said.    Murayama also said the coalition government should not  change  its current seven-party structure.    Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic  Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the  next premier.    Funada also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling  coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party, may join the cabinet.</p>

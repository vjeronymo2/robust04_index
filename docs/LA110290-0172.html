			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> BUILDERS EXPECT HOUSING SHORTAGE AFTER SLUMP ENDS  </P> <P> They don't claim to know when the housing slump will end, but builders  attending the biennial Barratt Business Round Table earlier this week in Irvine  agree that when it does, it will go out with a bang.  </P> <P> The end of the current economic slump and an increase in the demand for homes  in Southern California's coastal counties will be accompanied by a tremendous  housing shortage and yet another burst of price inflation, said Mark Frazier,  president of Barratt America.  </P> <P> Because homes already built aren't moving well in much of Orange and other  coastal counties, builders have all but stopped putting up new homes, Frazier  and other building industry insiders say.  </P> <P> In addition, savings and loans no longer are able to make construction loans  and most banks are no longer willing, so a principal source of financing has  dried up.  </P> <P> "So even if demand were back to normal, and we could get the (zoning)  entitlements, we couldn't build enough" to restore a balance of supply and  demand, Frazier said.

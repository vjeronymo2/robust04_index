			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA) -- PLO Executive Committee  member Samir Ghawshah has declared that the PLO holds the  Israeli Government under Yitzhaq Rabin's leadership responsible  for the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today. He  accused it of failing to put an end to the violence, killings,  and highway assaults that the settlers have been perpetrating  for the past several months.    In a statement to MENA's Tunis correspondent, Ghawshah said  the Palestinian leaders will hold an urgent meeting later today  to discuss the massacre and adopt appropriate decisions in light  of the reactions that will proceed from the international  community and the UN Security Council, particularly the United  States and Russia in their capacity as the sponsors of the  Middle East peace process.    Ghawshah added: We will discuss the situation and adopt a  firm stand, not only with regard to the negotiations but also on  how to confront these dangers and prevent their recurrence.    He stressed that this massacre is directed at the peace  operation and at the negotiations, which the perpetrators want  to undermine.    Ghawshah urged Rabin's government to arrest the culprits and  punish them, promptly implement the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles, and withdraw the Israeli forces from  Gaza and Jericho. He assured that when the PLO assumes  responsibility and authority in these areas, these assaults will  stop.    He called on the world community to help end these acts and  urged Washington and Moscow--the sponsors of the peace  process--to make Israel fulfill its obligations and play its  role in giving impetus to the peace process.    He said: While we condemn this massacre against our  Palestinian people at the hands of Israeli settlers, we  emphasize the need for all patriotic Palestinian forces to unite  and confront these brutal actions that seek to undermine the  peace process.</p>

The controversy surrounding the cod  has been settled, but the dispute over the blocking minority in  the Council of Ministers which has been enlarged to 16 members  continues within the European Union. The majority believes that  it should be 27 votes (of a total of 90 votes distributed among  the countries of different sizes). The British and the Spanish  want to stick to the current regulation of 23 votes. The causes  of the quarrel are questions of power stemming from different  motives.    Spain is interested in a veto coalition with Portugal,  Italy,  Greece, and Ireland. The five countries belong to the less  prosperous receiver countries. For them "Europe" is a pecuniary  source that is supposed to bubble. Europe's enlargement might  curtail their influence. Since these countries, which hold a  total of 31 votes, are likely not to agree on every issue, the  proud Spain would like to be in a position together with Italy  and Portugal, or with Italy and Greece to prevent decisions with  23 votes (per combination). The proud Britons aspire to the  same position of power -- together with as few states as  possible. They are not so much interested in "taking" but in  preventing. As defenders of classical self-determination, they  would like to prevent being overruled by other states.    Theoretically, a decision can also be blocked with 27 votes.  It is possible to scrape the required votes together, if need  be. It might be a little more difficult for the southern  countries than for Britain. Their attitude is ambiguous: If  they insist on the smaller blocking minority, they might prevent  an expansion of the European Union, to which they attach great  significance. Together with sensible Germans, they welcome a  shift of the axis of the European Union to the north and east  and a loose form of cooperation. In view of these advantages,  an increase of the blocking minority from 23 to 27 is the lesser  evil.</p>

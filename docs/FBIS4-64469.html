			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Kinkel: Marching Separately, </F> Attacking Together; FDP Executive Committee Approves Coalition  Statement"]    [Text] Bonn, 2 May -- On Monday [2 May] in Bonn the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] Federal Executive Committee confirmed the  party Presidium's 11 April decision to recommend continuing the  coalition with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian  Social Union [CSU] after the Bundestag election in October to  the party congress, which will be held in Rostock at the  beginning of June. There were no votes against and four  abstentions. FDP Chairman Kinkel came out in favor of  reexamining the solidarity surcharge after three years with the  goal of abolishing it, but he added: "At the moment the FDP is  not imposing any conditions for continuing the coalition." The  FDP has ideas and goals. However, one cannot divide the skin of  the bear before the bear has been shot and say that a coalition  is possible only if certain conditions are met.    Kinkel told the Executive Committee that over the past two  weeks he had gained the impression at the laender party  congresses that there was relief everywhere "that the  clarification of the coalition statement has strengthened the  FDP's ability to act on key issues." For the FDP the prospects  for the success of the coalition in October have improved: "Now  the CDU/CSU also has to do its part."    Kinkel announced that the FDP will campaign on its own,  adopting the slogan "marching separately, attacking together."  The election program, which was discussed by the Executive  Committee on Monday in preparation for the paper to be adopted  at the Rostock congress, will "clearly demonstrate the FDP's  autonomy" with a list of demands. The FDP's "function argument"  has again gained in importance. Kinkel said: "Anyone who wants  to prevent a red-green or a grand coalition must vote for the  FDP." A red-green coalition in Bonn would lead to a crisis of  trust in foreign policy and to a "disaster for jobs." Kinkel  warned against a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU with the Social  Democratic Party [SPD], calling it "autocratic rule by two." By  continuing the current coalition, on the other hand, internal  unification can be completed and Germany's role in the world can  be made active.    Kinkel said that all "speculation" about the FDP's behavior  in the presidential election is currently moot. The FDP  supports its candidate Hamm-Bruecher. After every ballot the  FDP group in the Federal Convention, which is to be held on Whit  Monday, will discuss its further course of action: "There will  be no anticipatory decisions." However, it is already clear:  "The FDP will be a decisive element." North Rhine-Westphalian  Land Chairman Moellemann said that the party chairman has the  right to make his own proposals. If the proposal says that one  should also vote for Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher in the third ballot, no  one will contradict him. "However, if the proposal is Herzog,  there will be a counterproposal: Then the FDP group must vote  on it." Moellemann repeated that his "preference" is SPD  candidate Rau.    Kinkel reproached the SPD: "Scharping's popularity in the  SPD will continue to decline." With the party's "failed tax  plans," Scharping made a crucial mistake. The SPD wants to  raise property and inheritance tax, raise the standard value of  houses and apartments, and burden qualified secretaries and  skilled workers with the supplementary tax. Kinkel said: "A  vote for the SPD is a costly one." The FDP rejects a general  speed limit, advocates computer-controlled traffic guidance  systems, and wants to maintain for citizens with the pleasure of  driving on the few kilometers of highway that are not yet  subject to a speed limit. Mr. Zoepel's withdrawal from  Scharping's team reflects rising dissatisfaction with  Scharping's "attempt to tiptoe to power without giving offense  to anyone." Instead, "Scharping should have the courage to put  the SPD's policy openly and honestly up for a vote."    In the Executive Committee FDP Bundestag Caucus Chairman  Solms denied reports that he doubted that Justice Minister  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger would be nominated as minister again  after the Bundestag elections. Kinkel said: "The justice  minister is doing good work, which meets with widespread  appreciation; I support her without any ifs or buts."  Moellemann used a newspaper report about alleged critical  statements by Solms about the justice minister as an opportunity  to reproach the caucus chairman: "It is unacceptable that  ministers or other leading functionaries are simply released for  the kill." If Solms had wanted to avoid the impression that he  opposes Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, he should have done  that at the appropriate time "as a professional." Moellemann  then annoyed Solms with the question: "What would happen if  someone asked who the next caucus chairman is supposed to be?"  Then there would be general uncertainty. Moellemann said: "We  must support all ministers, chairmen, etc."    In the Executive Committee Moellemann, Saarland Chairman  Cronauer, North Rhine-Westphalia Chairman Rohde, and domestic  policy expert Baum abstained from the vote. They did not  contradict the "contents" of the coalition statement, but they  considered the date of its issuance to be wrong. There was  almost unanimous approval in the debate, but some Executive  Committee members -- in particular from eastern Germany --  demanded that the coalition statement now be supplemented with  "details of contents." The FDP must not just say that it wants  to get together with certain partners but also why it considers  this appropriate. Kinkel responded that the FDP will answer  these questions with its election program. Moellemann  criticized the fact that the Executive Committee, which is the  responsible body, is dealing with the coalition statement only  two weeks after the Presidium made its decision.    Because of the letter with which Solms rejected  Moellemann's criticism of the coalition statement and accused  him of attempting to build a "counterstrategy," and as a  response to Kinkel's statements at the land party congress of  the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP in Dortmund a week ago,  Moellemann complained about "the unprecedented reprimand of a  land chairman by the Bundestag group chairman and the party  chairman." However, there is no point in continuing the  quarrel. Logic dictates that the Bonn coalition should be  continued because it has held up until now and it is not  expected to fall apart before the elections. However, the  "function of the coalition statement" must be clarified with a  description of priority goals "in essential fields."    Some younger Executive Committee members demanded that the  FDP avoid tying itself down by "setting down specific topics,"  which Moellemann wanted to be understood as prerequisites. The  path toward a social-liberal coalition must not be completely  blocked, since the other parties reserve for themselves various  postelection options. FDP Honorary Chairman Genscher left the  Executive Committee Meeting during Kinkel's opening statement  and before the debate. The Executive Committee received  Moellemann's attacks against Solms and Kinkel without a  response. It is said that the party leadership received  widespread support in the Executive Committee.</p>

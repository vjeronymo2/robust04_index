			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Black governor quits politics in surprise move Virginia Democrats had been bracing themselves for a brawl in the primary for this year's Senate election, but Governor Doug Wilder's surprise withdrawal from politics leaves the way clear for incumbent Senator Chuck Robb to win his party's nomination. Mr Wilder, who became the first elected black governor in the US in 1989, will leave office this weekend - Virginia law allows only a single term - but no-one anticipated he would leave politics. In a farewell speech he said the governorship had given him 'the luxury of political zenith I never imagined.' His election in 1989 was a striking example of a black candidate building a multi-racial electoral coalition, even in a southern state such as Virginia. His efforts to move on to national politics proved less successful and his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992 quickly fizzled out. In Virginia, Mr Wilder established a record as a fiscal conservative, steering the state through a budget crisis without raising taxes. He also succeeded last year in winning passage of gun control legislation, no small feat in a state traditionally one of the easiest places to buy a gun in the eastern US. Sometimes he spoke with real fire on broad social issues, but Mr Wilder often seemed to be driven less by political conviction than by petty resentment, especially in his long feud with Mr Robb. Mr Robb now seems the overwhelming favourite to win this year's Democratic senate nomination, but he still faces an uphill race for re-election. Once the most golden of Democratic presidential prospects, Mr Robb is now irredeemably branded as the man who claims he 'only' had a nude massage from a beauty queen. His likely Republican opponent in the election for Virginia's senate seat, Mr Oliver North, is, like Mr Robb, a decorated former Marine, but has drawbacks of his own. Mr North's conviction on three felony charges arising from the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair was overturned on the grounds that his trial was tainted by earlier testimony that he had given to Congress under a grant of immunity.</p>

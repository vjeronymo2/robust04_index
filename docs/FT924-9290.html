			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clwyd appointed to Gould heritage post MS ANN CLWYD was yester-day appointed shadow heritage secretary by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader - replacing Mr Bryan Gould who resigned from the post in September, Ivo Dawnay writes. The mini-reshuffle of Mr Smith's shadow cabinet was prompted by the election to the shadow team earlier this week of Mr Ron Davies after Mr Gould's resignation over his party's European policy. Mr Davies, the MP for Caerphilly who had been Labour's agriculture spokesman, will take over the Wales portfolio from Ms Clwyd, MP for Cynon Valley. Mr Davies's agriculture job will be taken by Mr Gavin Strang, MP for Edinburgh East.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Intel wins microchip dispute with AMD SHARES in Intel surged yesterday, while Advanced Micro Devices declined sharply, following a court ruling denying AMD the right to use Intel microprocessor software after a long-running copyright dispute between the two US chipmakers. The ruling protects Intel's exclusive rights to the microcode for its microprocessors, which are widely used in personal computers. Microcode is the internal software that controls the functions of a microprocessor chip. AMD had claimed rights to use Intel's microcode under the terms of a 1976 licensing agreement between the two companies. But a federal judge ruled on Wednesday the prior agreement did not give AMD the right to distribute products containing Intel microcode. AMD said it was planning an appeal of the ruling and might seek a new trial in the microcode copyright dispute. Intel closed Dollars 4 up at Dollars 77 1/4 yesterday, while AMD's stock ended Dollars 1 7/8 lower at at Dollars 16 1/8 .</p>

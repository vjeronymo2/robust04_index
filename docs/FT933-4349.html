			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Technology: Just the ticket for parking offenders - Computer system to ease congestion Almost unnoticed, a roadside revolution is taking place in London as new computer systems are installed to simplify parking control and to clamp down on offenders. With parking a growing worldwide problem, the developments in the capital are attracting keen interest. Over the years, an awkward system has developed in London. In areas of 'controlled' parking - yellow lines, meter bays, pay-and-display and residents' areas - the police used to authorise all clamping and towing away. In June, this authority was handed over to traffic wardens, who always presided over yellow-line infringements. In addition, parking attendants - under the control of the local authorities - cover infringements in meter bays, pay-and-display parking and residents' areas. By the middle of next year this will change further. Following the 1991 Road Traffic Act most parking control in the capital will be handed over to the 33 local authorities including the City of London. The impact of the change on each local authority depends on the amount of controlled parking. Wandsworth, with very little, has implemented most of the changes on a trial basis. Westminster, which has just over eight square miles of controlled parking, is taking the opportunity to introduce an ambitious system with new computers and mobile data networks. Despite differences in scale, the way the parking attendants work will be the same throughout London. Westminster is about to sign a contract for 200 hand-held computers for its attendants. At present, they write each ticket by hand, put one copy on the vehicle and, at the end of their shift, hand in a duplicate. The information is typed into a computer. With the new system, attendants will type details of the vehicle into their hand-held computers. Printers attached to them will produce the ticket and, at the end of the shift, the data will be dumped into a central system. Another important development is the introduction of a mobile data network so that the attendants' computers can send information instantly about a car or van which, under their new powers, they want clamped or towed away. The message can indicate the degree of urgency, especially where the vehicle is causing an obstruction. The network can also deliver information to an attendant's computer so that the typing in of a registration number could warn that the vehicle's owner has not paid previous fines. The attendant could then decide that clamping was suitable to ensure payment and open the way for discussions about the previous fines. The heart of Westminster's approach is a central computer system, replacing the separate ones used for handling parking attendants' data, ticket processing, permits and meter maintenance. The system will provide a prioritised list to the despatchers who send out the clamping vans and removal trucks. In the cabs, details of offending vehicles will appear on screens and crews will be able to send back progress reports. Car pounds will also be linked to the system along with a telephone help desk for distraught motorists and those seeking advice on parking. To help motorists, there will be a 'super-system' covering the capital. The Parking Committee for London, set up under the 1991 Act, will provide a number which motorists can ring when their cars have been clamped or towed away, regardless of which borough they are in. For this, it will have a computer system constantly updated by the 33 local systems. It will also be able to send data back to them to ensure, for example, that databases of persistent offenders are kept up to date. The contract for this system is due to be signed in November. Bidders are likely to include groups like EDS Scicon of the US, which has experience of similar operations in Chicago and Spain, and smaller companies like Compex Parking Services of the UK. For drivers who feel they are suffering from high-tech harassment, the Parking Committee will run an adjudication service. So they should at least find it easy to complain.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Croats and Serbs near all-out war: Rivals 'grab for land' to split Bosnia-Hercegovina between them CROATIAN and Serb forces are preparing for an all-out war in Bosnia-Hercegovina aimed at dividing the independent republic between the two sides, western military attaches confirmed yesterday. The diplomats said that, despite attempts by the United Nations to try to re-open Sarajevo airport, Croatia and Serbia were now engaged in a 'grab for land throughout Bosnia'. Croatia wants to control a swathe of territory in the largely Croat-populated region of western Hercegovina, west Bosnia, as well as the north of the republic, they said. Yesterday Mr Mate Boban, leader of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union, announced the establishment of a canton system in those areas held by Croats in Hercegovina. Mr Boban is the personal appointee of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Croatian control of the north of Bosnia is designed to prevent Serb units from forming a corridor between Serbia and the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, south-western Croatia. The military attaches added that Croatian forces, which have direct contacts with Mr Tudjman, had yesterday consolidated their positions in many parts of western Hercegovina. 'The speed in which they (the Croats) are moving, both across the north of Bosnia, and west of Bosnia, is both remarkable and very dangerous,' one diplomat said. He added that the recent military alliance between Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatia legitimised forces from Croatia on Bosnian territory. The Bosnian presidency declared a state of war against 'the aggressor, Serbia' at the weekend, but did not mention Croat advances in Hercegovina. The Croatian offensive from the west is being matched by attempts by Serb irregulars, and Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia, to consolidate their position in the eastern part of Bosnia, as well as establishing a 'green line' dividing Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The UN yesterday announced another ceasefire after it suspended operations and negotiations to de-militarise the airport, now held by both Serb irregulars and Bosnia's Territorial Defence forces, under which Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb, and Croat communities are grouped. Apart from sporadic shooting, the 48-hour truce appeared to be holding. The blockade on the airport has prevented the airlift of food to the 300,000 starving people of the city, who have been besieged by Serb irregulars for the past 79 days. 'The UN is desperately trying to enforce this ceasefire, but I wonder if either side really wants it now,' a UN official said.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: In time for Eurostar A reader has telephoned the FT, furious about the treatment he received from Eurostar, the new cross-Channel train service, writes Michael Skapinker. The reader had booked his journey from London to Paris through a travel agent, paid his fare, received his ticket and arrived to board his train at Waterloo Station. He was stopped at the gate by Eurostar staff who told him he could not board because he was too late. He protested that the train had not yet left, but Eurostar staff insisted he did not have enough time to board it. He was supposed to arrive at least 20 minutes before departure. The aggrieved reader says he was not told about the 20-minute rule. However, Eurostar insists that its staff were acting according to proper procedures. Eurostar passengers must arrive at least 20 minutes before departure so that they can go through security. A notice on the ticket wallets makes the 20-minute rule clear.</p>

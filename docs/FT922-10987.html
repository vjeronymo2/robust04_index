			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to put a value on a share of the action / A look for the pointers to a company's real worth Valuing the shares in a private company is a tricky matter. With no market to put a value on the business, the sums depend on fine commercial judgments, profit performance - past and future - and the calculation of some rough and ready discounts. Equally importantly, it is a matter of shrewd psychology. Take the case of one family-owned business where the managing director and majority shareholder was negotiating the sale of the company. He took the view that his hard work had created the value in the business and, since he had the largest shareholding, his shares, individually, were worth more than those of the minority 'sleeping' shareholders. An elderly aunt, who was a minority shareholder, objected to this valuation. Tempers were already frayed when the aunt suddenly announced her intention of bequeathing all her worldly goods to the local dogs' home. When her nephew, a dog-hater, heard this, negotiations became even more difficult. 'Often it is not a question of making a formal calculation of value but of dealing with psychology,' says Roy Nicholson, corporate finance partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. But the question of how to value private company shares is not just the stuff of family quarrels. Fewer than 3,000 of the UK's 1m companies have a public stock market listing so valuing private businesses is of crucial economic importance. Even when strong personal animosities are not part of the calculation, though, valuing shares in unlisted companies is more of an art than a science. 'You can only give an opinion as to value,' comments Trevor McDonagh, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. 'In the end, every single factor used in arriving at a valuation is subjective.' Value will depend on the shareholdings and personalities of the other shareholders and the possible benefits a buyer could get from incorporating the business into his own. 'You can't value a shareholding in the abstract; it depends on who wants to buy it and why,' says McDonagh. But amid all this uncertainty, there are pointers. The first place to turn for guidance is the company's articles of association. These frequently set down a rough outline for valuing shares, though long-established family firms with strong patriarchal traditions may have deliberately avoided enshrining any rights for minority shareholders. The articles may adopt general terms such as 'fair market value' or they may go into greater detail, insisting that there is 'no discount for minority shareholdings' or 'no price less than attributable net assets'. Very occasionally, they may require 'a multiple of (say) four times profits'. 'At one extreme, the articles may say something which is superficially acceptable but of little value,' says Charles Ranson, a partner of London solicitors, Hardwick &amp; Co. 'At the other, you may have something very detailed. I am not sure that any of these approaches is particularly satisfactory.' Unlisted company shares will usually be valued at a large discount to their quoted counterparts because they lack a convenient public market place. Price will usually be based on earnings but if the company pays a dividend, it may relate to dividend yield. A price/earnings calculation may also be adjusted downwards to take account of a company with a very small asset base or relatively low turnover. If shareholders are unable to agree on a price, the articles will usually stipulate that they must obtain an independent valuation, often from the company's auditor. Some shareholders may doubt the independence of the auditor, however and insist on an independent accountant doing the job. The articles of most private businesses will contain a pre-emption clause requiring any shares to be offered to other shareholders before being sold to outsiders. Unless there is an obligation for the other shareholders to take up all the shares being offered for sale, the vendor may be left with a small and unsaleable minority. This can create particular dangers for directors who have fallen out with the rest of the board or who have been dismissed. They may find dismissal triggers a 'bad leaver' clause which reduces the value of their shares. It is particularly important for directors to study the articles of their company when they are appointed to the board to see the conditions under which they can be dismissed and the terms which would apply to the disposal of any shares they acquire. Directors should also take independent legal advice on the terms of their service agreement, if they have one, and the terms of any shareholders' agreement, says Christopher Southam, a partner in Bristol solicitors Veale Wasbrough. 'If someone ceases to be a director, he may be automatically deemed to have given notice to sell his shares,' Southam notes. Valuing a 100 per cent holding is not always easy but it can prove relatively simple, compared with the problems raised by minority stakes. Unless the articles require a valuation to be on a pro rata basis, it is normal for a minority stake to be valued at a discount. A 25 per cent shareholding in a company which never pays dividends and which is dominated by a strong-minded managing director usually has very little value, says Peat's Roy Nicholson. Shareholders are sometimes able to argue, successfully, that although the business is incorporated, it is in effect 'a quasi-corporate partnership', that the shareholders are really partners with an equal share in the business. If this is so, then their minority holdings should not carry any discount. But a court is unlikely to be sympathetic to a shareholder who buys into a company, knowing there are limits to the value of his shares because they represent a minority stake, and then tries to argue he has been disadvantaged. Minority shareholders sometimes point to the price paid by a venture capital company buying into the company as a guide to the value of their own shares, says Trevor McDonagh. But they overlook the fact that the venture capitalist is often buying into a new class of share, possibly with conversion rights, and may also be getting a seat on the board. A commercial arbitrator may appear to be doing all he can to reduce the value of a shareholding; the taxman takes the opposite view. 'The shareholder may be locked into an investment which brings in no income and which is virtually unsaleable, but for tax purposes he has to pretend he can sell them freely,' says David Bowes, a consultant with accountants Grant Thornton. The taxman is also free to ignore any price formula set down in a company's articles. A father sold his son shares at Pounds 20 each - net asset value with no discount for minorities as prescribed in the company's articles - but the Inland Revenue insisted on taxing them at market value which it calculated at Pounds 45 a share. There is little that shareholders can do to escape the taxman's approach to valuations but the share valuation issue is becoming slightly less opaque. As more private companies establish share option schemes for executives and employees, and as more shares change hands, so it becomes easier to establish a true market value.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARE CERTIFICATE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What is your shareholding worth? Trigger points which will affect the value of your shares in a private company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 100%     of company: complete control  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 90%:     effectively complete control because minority shares can be          compulsorily bought.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 75%:     enough to carry a special resolution or wind up the company          but still could leave a difficult minority shareholder.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 50.1%:   effective control but still leaving exposure to difficult          minority.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 50%:     a recipe for stalemate if the other shareholders can all agree,          but valuable if other shareholders are on your side. And          nevertheless still likely to be worth much less than 50.1%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 49.9%:   likely to attract another big discount from 50%.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 25%:     practically worthless, particularly if no dividends are paid          and majority shareholder(s) are ready to freeze the minority          out. Not very attractive for an outside purchaser.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

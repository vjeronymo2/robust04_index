			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXTRA BREAKAGE IN EASTWOOD MOVIE STUNT  </P> <P> A department store window was accidentally shattered by an explosion a block  away during the filming of a Clint Eastwood movie stunt in which a luxury car  hurtles from an upper window of a downtown building, authorities said today.  </P> <P> The fiery blast accompanying the 11 p.m. stunt Wednesday shattered a window of  Robinson's department store at 600 W. 7th St., about a block from the vacant  warehouse near Eighth and Figueroa streets in which the stunt was done, Sgt.  Jim Leinen said.  </P> <P> The stunt otherwise went as planned without any injuries, but it set off  burglar alarms, Leinen said.  </P> <P> A videotape of the stunt shows the car smashing through the top floor window of  the 5-story building and flying through the air before it smashed onto hay  bales on the ground.  </P> <P> As soon as the car was airborne outside the building, a gigantic blast ripped  through the fifth floor. A freeze frame of the video showed the flying car  framed by a fireball. Fire erupted on several floors of the building, but was  soon put out, an eyewitness said.  </P> <P> Leinen said the stunt was staged for the Warner Bros. film, "The Rookie,"  starring Clint Eastwood. The car, which Leinen said was a Mercedes Benz 500 SL,  was unoccupied. The film crew re-staged the stunt about 1:45 a.m., Leinen said.  </P> <P> "It went as it was intended to," he said of the original stunt. "It was  supposed to be a fiery blaze and a tremendous blast. I think they just got one  too many windows."  </P></p>

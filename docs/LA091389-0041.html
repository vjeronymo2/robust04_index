			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDIT WINS RACE FOR COELHO'S HOUSE SEAT  </P> <P> In a special election that drew national attention, Democratic Assemblyman Gary  Condit won election to Congress on Tuesday as voters in the San Joaquin Valley  chose a successor to former Rep. Tony Coelho.  </P> <P> With 90.6% of the precincts reporting, Condit had 57.1% of the vote, while  Republican Clare Berryhill, a farmer who has served as a legislator and as  state director of food and agriculture, had 34.8%.  </P> <P> "This is a great victory," Condit declared during an election night party at  the Stanislaus County fairgrounds. "We thought it would be a lot closer. You  don't see many special elections won in the primary."  </P> <P> By capturing more than 50% of the vote, Condit won the election outright and  avoided a November runoff.  </P> <P> Republicans tried to capitalize on scandals that have plagued the Democratic  leadership of Congress. Majority Whip Coelho, the third-ranking Democrat, and  House Speaker Jim Wright both resigned earlier this year amid charges of  financial misconduct.  </P> <P> But Condit ran well throughout the rural Democratic district. His lead was  bolstered by a strong absentee ballot drive that was effective in increasing  the turnout among his supporters.  </P> <P> In Merced County, with all of the precincts reporting, Condit beat Berryhill  nearly 2 to 1.  </P> <P> Other candidates receiving only small percentages of the vote were Libertarian  Roy Shimp and five GOP candidates: Atwater farmer Robert Weimer, Merced housing  contractor Cliff Burris, Livermore engineer Dave Williams, Modesto businessman  Jack McCoy and retired Air Force Maj. Chris Patterakis of Modesto.  </P> <P> The 15th Congressional District, which sprawls across giant farms straddling  Interstate 5 and blossoming towns along U.S. 99, takes in all or part of  Stanislaus, Merced, Mariposa and Fresno counties. It includes the cities of  Modesto and Merced and the northern portion of Fresno.  </P> <P> Berryhill's campaign was an uphill battle from the start. To begin with,  rank-and-file Democrats -- although tending to be more conservative than party  members elsewhere -- outnumbered Republicans in district voter registration by  roughly 55% to 36%.  </P> <P> Berryhill entered the race weeks after Condit did and, as of Election Day, was  expecting to spend $300,000, compared to his Democratic opponent's $450,000.  </P> <P> Condit was also successful in persuading other Democratic politicians --  including two members of the Assembly -- to stay out of the race while  Berryhill competed in a crowded Republican field.  </P> <P> Berryhill, 63, who served in the Cabinet of Gov. George Deukmejian for more  than four years, had not run for election in the region since the mid-1970s,  when he served as a state senator.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old Condit, a member of the Assembly since 1982, already  represented about half the voters who reside in the congressional district.  </P> <P> Coelho resigned in June after it became known that he bought a $100,000 junk  bond from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of a $50,000 loan he did  not report as required by law.  </P> <P> But Condit, believing that Coelho remained a popular figure in the rural  district, used the former congressman in campaign commercials and relied on him  for fund-raising help.  </P> <P> Both Condit and Berryhill cast themselves as friends of agriculture who would  represent the farmers' interests in Congress. But Berryhill, a lifelong fruit  grower, charged that Condit was a career politician who knows little about  farming. Condit fired back with commercials portraying Berryhill as a political  quitter who left the Legislature and his cabinet post.  </P> <P> Berryhill also accused Condit of being "under the influence" of special  interests in Sacramento by working as a consultant for National Medical  Enterprises, a hospital company, and accepting $76,000 in campaign  contributions from the liquor industry.  </P></p>

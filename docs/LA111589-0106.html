			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE / HIPPIE REVIVAL  </P> <P> The Movie: "Drugstore Cowboy"  </P> <P> The Setup: Actors Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch (pictured above), James Le Gros and  Heather Graham are caught in a downhill slide caused by pharmaceutical drug  abuse combined with drugstore thefts in Portland, Ore., in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> The Look: Rather than play up the psychedelic colors and outrageous silhouettes  of the era (remember elephant-leg pants?) costume designer Beatrix Aruna  Pasztor chose somber simplicity for these flower children gone to seed. She  explains: "I looked for shirts with long pointed collars," the type Sonny Bono  used to wear. Key pieces in various characters wardrobes are the thigh-length,  double-breasted velvet coat that Lynch wears, a pair of plaid bell bottoms for  Matt Dillon, and the roughed up suede hat worn by Heather Graham. These items  irrevocably lock the movie into its time slot.  </P> <P> The Labels: Fortunately for designers and manufacturers of the  not-always-flattering vintage fashions in the movie, the names on labels have  faded with time and wear. "It wasn't so tasteful a period," Pasztor says about  dressing in the age of longhairs. She found her best buys scrounging through  sales racks at Salvation Army stores as well as second-hand shops in Portland,  instead of resale shops. Avoiding bastions of antique chic definitely helped  her modest costume budget. Pasztor claims that all of her second-hand purchases  were priced under $10.  </P> <P> The Stores: Goodwill Industries and Salvation Army in the San Fernando Valley,  as well as second-hand shops in Portland, provided the basics. When pressed to  find specifics, such as a white stretch lace shirt Lynch wears over a black  bra, Pasztor headed to Eric &amp; Co. on Melrose Avenue. The store carries  up-to-the-minute renditions of late '60s styles.  </P> <P> The Adaptation: For anyone interested in hippie fashion revival (as plenty of  European designers seem to be, judging from recent collections by Giorgio  Armani, among others) Pasztor recommends shopping second-hand thrift stores. In  particular, look for velvet jackets, wild-patterned vests and bell-bottom  pants.  </P> <P> The Payoff: There is something very appealing about the way bell bottoms look  in this film. They serve as a very effective balancing factor for broad hips,  as do shoulder pads, which seem to be losing position, after a decade of  dominance in the fashion scene. With pads on the way out, maybe it's time to  reconsider those ankle-slapping pants. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

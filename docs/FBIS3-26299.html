He warned against plots of "satanic powers" to physically  eliminate those Iranian people who are efficient and helpful for  the country, Islam and Moslems.    It is understood that the "satanic powers" refer to the  United States and Israel.    Iranian authorities said that President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  was the target of the unsuccessful assassination attempt on  February 1.    Shots were fired into the air at the shrine of Ayatollah  Khomeini as Rafsanjani was delivering a speech at a ceremony  there to mark the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic  revolution.    Ayatollah Khamene'i termed the Islamic revolution as a great  storm which thwarted treacherous conspiracies and ambitious  plans of the United States and its lackeys in Iran when he was  addressing a large group of people today.    At the same time, the local daily "TEHRAN TIMES," which  usually expresses the views of the Foreign Ministry, today and  Saturday also blamed the United States and Israel for the  assassination attempt.    The daily said in its editorial that the United States and  Israel are the two countries which consider Iran and its Islamic  revolution detrimental to their interests.    The editorial added that both Israel and its master, the  United States, have a long history of assassinating world  leaders.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Majority of Russian population below poverty line Meat is available in Moscow, for a price - a price beyond the means of most old people like this elderly woman looking at joints on a street vendor's stall. A majority of Russia's 150m population is living below the poverty line as a result of last month's price liberalisation, Ms Ella Pamfilova, social affairs minister, said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton. These were people who could not afford the Rbs 1,300 (Dollars 13) minimum cost of a basket of basic goods. Meanwhile, Mr Fyodor Prokopov, chairman of the Russian employment committee, announced he was preparing for a surge in unemployment this autumn as further market reforms begin to bite. He expected 7m-8m people, 10 per cent of the workforce, to lose their jobs by the end of the year. But the government, which is trying to pursue a tough monetary and credit policy, was also able to report some good news. It revalued the fixed 'market' rate for the rouble yesterday to Rbs100 from Rbs110 to the dollar after the rouble strengthened for a third week. At Tuesday's weekly currency trading, it fetched Rbs170, down from Rbs210 the previous week, and a high of Rbs230 at the end of January.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana </F> discusses his economic policy proposals during a meeting of the  29th Convention of Banking and Financial Institutions, 8 Apr in  Cartagena]    [Text] Cartagena -- According to candidate Andres Pastrana,  the essential and most equitable goal is to reduce inflation to  levels under 10 percent in the next four years. The tax burden  should also be reduced and improved coordination with the board  of directors of the Bank of the Republic is needed in order to  put an end to revaluation. The views of the conservative  presidential candidate follow.  <H5>  Taxes </H5>   The maximum income tax rate will be reduced from 37.5 to 30  percent. Tax instruments will also be improved.  <H5>  Revaluation </H5>   Quick action will be taken on this front, as it has become  an  obstacle blocking private investment. Revaluation is not caused  by an influx of foreign capital or the return of money from  Colombian citizens.  <H5>  Drug Traffic </H5>   One cause of revaluation is excessive drug trafficking  revenues, which have totally distorted the exchange rate. He  will oppose legalizing drugs.  <H5>  Banking </H5>   In an open economy the development of universal banking is  desirable, so the existence of a fragmented financial sector, in  which credit is directed toward goals preset by the government,  loses its rationale.  <H5>  Bank Reserves </H5>   He plans to reduce this burden on the financial system, thus  helping financial institutions to compete internationally.  <H5>  Credit </H5>   Government intervention in the private sector's financial  management will be minimal. Restricting the credit of savings  and loan institutions will stimulate even more the influx of  foreign capital to finance construction projects.  <H5>  Macroeconomy </H5>   There will be fluid and effective coordination between the  government's economic team and the board of directors of the  Bank of the Republic, faithfully respecting the commitments made  to pursue macroconomic goals. This is the only way to avoid the  sudden shocks that now jolt the economy, which are really  disastrous for activities like construction.  <H5>  Jobs </H5>   The biggest challenge of the current development process is  to find ways to help people who work peacefully and honestly.  Financial and economic conditions will be created that will  enable the development of more businesses, and consequently, the  creation of more jobs.  <H5>  Security </H5>   The state will be strong in fundamental areas, that is, in  the maintenance of public order and the campaign against crime  and violence. There will be strong consumer protections, and  abuses by monopolies will not be tolerated.  <H5>  Economic Liberalization </H5>   Savage capitalism is capitalism with public disorder, high  inflation, macroeconomic imbalances, excessive competition,  abuses by private and public monopolies, and closed markets.  These problems are going to be eradicated.  <H5>  Inflation </H5>   To control the cost of living and avoid revaluation, the  support of various social classes will be sought. He has made a  commitment to remove economic indexing.    All administrative prices, including public service and  utility rates, will be adjusted in line with inflation goals.  The aim is to keep the sacrifices incurred in reducing inflation  from striking wage earners or vulnerable population groups.  <H5>  Government Spending </H5>   Revaluation will be halted by measures to control inflation  and public spending. This policy has not been carried out by the  current administration, and in Pastrana's opinion, the liberal  candidate has not advocated such a policy. Government spending  will concentrate on areas like education, clean water supply  systems, health care, road modernization, and environmental  protection.</p>

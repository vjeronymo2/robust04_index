			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: More downward pressure on equities THE recent uncertainty in the UK equity market was again in evidence yesterday, with share prices coming under renewed downward pressure and the market moving further away from the top end of its perceived trading range of 2,600 to 2,900 on the FT-SE 100 Index. Senior dealers were hard pressed to come up with a good reason for the market's latest unhappy showing, but there was a growing feeling in some areas of the City that the government's sale of its remaining near 22 per cent stake in BT may not be going quite as well as some would have it. 'There is something unsettling the market and it is definitely not rights issue stories; with BT3 so close, the authorities would not have allowed any other substantial calls,' said one dealer. He pointed out that Wall Street had made a relatively comfortable opening, in spite of widespread worries that the US market could be overbought, and that the big Continental bourses had performed well yesterday, with the DAX up 20 points and the Paris market rallying well. 'The domestic economic news is okay, which leaves one thing - BT3,' he said. Worries about the drain on institutional cash balances, following the massive government borrowing requirement and the spate of rights issues - more than Pounds 7bn worth - so far this year, have been around for some time. An economist at one of the UK agency brokers put it bluntly: 'The institutions have run out of cash.' The Share Shops deadline for BT3 applications was 3.30pm yesterday, with the public offer closing at 10am tomorrow. The international and retail tender closes at 5pm on Friday, with dealings commencing on Monday. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker, issued a bearish review of BT yesterday, claiming that consensus profits estimates for the company 'are too high'. The broker lopped Pounds 520m off its current-year estimate and Pounds 650m off that for next year, citing 'ominous regulatory developments and a downbeat BT3 prospectus'. The equity market opened on a drab note and was on the retreat for the rest of an uninspiring session. The FT-SE 100 was down almost seven points by 10am, before staging a minor rally towards midday and then embarking on a further slide, eventually coming to rest a net 12.3 down at 2,830.9, its lowest since June 4, and a fall of almost 70 points since the start of the month. Turnover yesterday was low at 448.1m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 61 per cent of the total. Mondays are traditionally low turnover sessions for the market and dealers are worried that activity will remain under pressure for the rest of the week. The value of customer business transacted last Friday was Pounds 1.23bn. The outbreak of price war among the UK tabloid newspapers, instigated by the Rupert Murdoch-controlled Sun, triggered some sizeable selling of the newspaper companies, with Mirror Group Newspapers shares notably weak, along with United Newspapers. Composite insurance stocks were given a rough ride as analysts began to count the costs of the floods in the US. Banks provided one of the FT-SE 100's few firm spots in TSB, where there was talk of the imminent sale of the Hill Samuel merchant banking operation. Oil shares were helped by a further rise in crude oil prices.</p>

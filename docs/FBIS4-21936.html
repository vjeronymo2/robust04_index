			<p>BFN     [Text] London -- A flier distributed by an underground  opposition organization within the Sudanese Police force calling  itself "The Homeland's Vanguards," reveals interesting details  about the group that carried out the attack on the mosque of the  Partisans of al-Sunnah in Umm Durman on 4 February, 1994. The  leaflet indicates that the prime suspect in the case, Muhammad  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Khulayfi, confessed to the Sudanese police  that his organization is composed of 18 persons who come from  Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt. The group planned to assassinate  al-Sadiq al- Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, and  Communist Party Leader Muhammad Ibrahim Naqd. The plan did not  include Dr. Hasan al-Turabi or businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin as  Khartoum contended.    Sudanese opposition sources, speaking to AL-HAYAH yesterday,  said the Sudanese authorities had pensioned off 15 police  officers after charging them with distributing the flier and  making public part of the interrogation with the first suspect  in the case. Among the suspects are Brigadier General al-Khayr  Madani and Lieutenant Colonel Bura'i Wahbah.    The leaflet quotes al-Khulayfi as telling interrogators he  was of Libyan citizenship and received military training at the  al-Biqa' valley in Lebanon at the hands of the Iranian  Revolutionary Guards in 1987 and 1988. From there he proceeded  to Peshawar in Pakistan to join the Afghan mujahidin. According  to the leaflet, al-Khulayfi disclosed that he met in Lebanon  with Yasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al- Baqi Nur, both of whom were  killed in a clash with Sudanese police following the attack on  the mosque. They were also said to have set up a Sudanese  organization under the name "al-Jihad Organization." Yasir  Muhammad's group was said to be composed of 18 members who came  from Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt.    Al-Khulayfi traced his acquaintance with Bin-Ladin back to  Peshawar. The two were introduced by the Syrian martyr  "Bassam." While in Khartoum, al-Khulayfi pointed out, he was  staying with a group of Libyans, with whom he fell out and then  left to live in a room at Bin-Ladin's residence in the al-Riyad  neighborhood in Khartoum.    Al-Khulayfi is quoted as saying that his group was asked to  prepare a plan to kill al-Mahdi and Naqd. The implementation  was set for last 'Id al-Adha but was aborted by the tight  security around al-Mahdi. He indicated that "a Sudanese ordered  that we carry out the mosque operation, and told me that two of  the Muslim Sudanese mujahidin will shortly arrive to share the  house with me and implement this jihad duty."    In the course of the interrogation, al-Khulayfi assailed  Sudan's Interior Minister Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad  Husayn, and said: "This man, who is ignorant in matters of  religion, denied he knew me, although he used to see me at  Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi's home. Every time the debate in  religious matters became heated, he lowered his head."  Al-Khulayfi regarded what he did to be a punishment, indicating  that the following day members of his group went to al-Riyad  neighborhood not to flee as had been said but to inform  al-Turabi and Bin-Ladin. When we got to Bin-Ladin's residence,  he berated us because we had not sought his permission. But we  told him that war between infidels and Muslims is an ongoing  affair. Bin-Ladin then left me and went into his home and asked  his guards to arrest us, but we opened fire on them. They were  three, two Iranians and an Egyptian. His companion Yasir, he  went on, was killed in the clash, and 'Abd-al-Baqi died in the  ambulance.    Bin-Ladin, the leaflet goes on, has charge of the Arab  mujahidin in Sudan and al-Turabi the Islamic jihad in Egypt,  Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania. Al-Khulayfi was quoted as  saying: "Why should I attack al-Turabi as some news media  reported, when he is the leader of the world Islamic movement?"  He stressed that he had no regrets over what he had done.</p>

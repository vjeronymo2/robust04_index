			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The incident of Ming Pao reporter Hsi Yang took  place after the incident of Kuai Pao reporter Liang Huimin in  November 1992, and was another incident in which the arrest of a  reporter led to strong repercussions.  <H5>  Widespread Leaks by Small Newspapers </H5>   Whether or not Hsi Yang was really engaged in activity  incompatible with his status as a reporter, and whether or not  facts about the incident have been concealed, the outside world  cannot know. But in all fairness, the "criminal evidence"  revealed by the government about Hsi Yang is about two economic  news items, which is very difficult to link to "national  security" and "state secrets." Two of the "secrets" were fairly  inconspicuous news items that appeared in Ming Pao in May and  July and were said to be harmful to national security, which is  very farfetched.    In recent years, one could say that news of the inner  workings and so forth of many economic policies and reform  measures, which have been far more sensitive than the  above-mentioned news items, has spread far and wide. Many  domestic publications, such as JINGJI CANKAO BAO, BEIFANG  SHIBAO, ZUZHI RENSHI BAO and other semi-official newspapers,  have frequently revealed materials relating to economic reform  policy, and even materials as politically sensitive as trade  policy documents that have not yet been announced. These  publications can be easily purchased by Hong Kong reporters or  tourists who are visiting the mainland. Furthermore, amid  international concern over human rights, national security  departments should not take such drastic measures just because  of a few lines that appeared in a Hong Kong publication a few  months ago. However, how is it that another Hong Kong reporter  has stepped on the "land mine" within less than year? How is it  that Communist China has again self-righteously and with  criminal evidence in hand clubbed an outside reporter?  <H5>  Internal Preventive Measures Have Been Strengthened </H5>   Last year, after the incident of the Kuai Pao reporter Liang  Huimin, China's security and propaganda departments issued an  internal memo. The memo severely criticized and reprimanded  party and government cadres at all levels who ignored the  principles of national security and legality and provided  opportunities for outside reporters to steal secrets during the  historic reforms and opening up. It also reprimanded "a very  small number of our own news media who sold state secrets for  profit." As a result, Communist China's security departments  clearly redefined the general policy on news gathering by  outside reporters in China: "We must uphold reform and opening  up and make friends far and wide, and facilitate normal news  gathering work, and thereby actively provide guidance." However,  we must also "strengthen limits and reduce negative effects,"  and, in particular, regarding those targeted by the security  departments "we must mercilessly expose and attack the very  small number of unscrupulous people (reporters) who steal state  secrets and violate national laws." This internal memo instructs  the national security enforcement divisions to "select suitable  targets and select suitable methods" to "expose" the "illegal  activities" of foreign reporters to "intimidate" outside  reporters.    As an illustration of this memo, Beijing's public security  department sentenced Xinhua reporter Wu Shisheng, a suspect in  the Liang Huimin case, to life imprisonment, and sentenced Wu's  wife, Ma Tao, to six months in prison. This case raised concerns  in legal and media circles in China and abroad. This time, Xi  Yang is another target under attack as an outside reporter who  "acted improperly."  <H5>  Restrictions Have Tightened, News Gathering Is Difficult </H5>   The mainland propaganda departments' emphasis on the "angle  of the news" is in a nutshell: "Report only the good news;  reporting of bad news is prohibited." If this is violated and  the violation is light, you must be investigated and cleared; if  it is serious, you lose your position and publication is  stopped. This is fundamentally different from the "freedom of  the press" enjoyed outside. When Hong Kong reporters go to the  mainland, with the exception of hot news items, they all find  ways to dig out their own "exclusives" or "inside sources" to  meet the needs of commercial competition among publications.  Therefore, there are inevitably people who "go too fast" or  "apply too much energy" and violate the taboo. Furthermore, it  is a fact that some people will pay a monetary price to get  news. There is only a fine line between "news" and  "intelligence." Therefore, it is difficult for outside reporters  in China to avoid stepping on the "mine field."    There are other factors that make it difficult for Hong Kong  reporters to gather news on the mainland. First, since the  practice of giving news briefings began, all important news is  announced through formal official channels, which therefore  increases the transparency of the news. Second, widespread trade  and commercial activities have led to the dissemination abroad,  through various channels, of social news from all over the  mainland. As a result, in recent years the reports in the Hong  Kong and Taiwan media concerning mainland social problems have  been numerous and detailed. Third, since 1990, the burgeoning  "corps of writers" in Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities  who work for outside publications are mostly active persons with  many sources of information. The rumors and gossip they hear  rival the special reports of reporters.    All of these factors undoubtedly create pressure on the  reporters and media members from abroad. They compete within  their profession using only standard news gathering methods.  Therefore, they must resort to developing their own sources of  information. News gathering is not only tedious and exhausting,  but you cannot limit your means or your price to gather news.  Those in the media cannot deny this point.  <H5>  Developing New Sources of News </H5>   Xi Yang, a native of Beijing, is a new immigrant who  obtained  a one-way permit to Hong Kong in the late 1980s. As a person  with a mainland background gathering news from the mainland, Xi  Yang was not a rarity. In fact, there are quite a few reporters  with mainland backgrounds who are on the mainland under various  pretexts carrying out news gathering activities without official  permission. This has created an amusing result: If you openly  apply to gather news on the mainland, your results are limited,  whereas working in private, under the guise of visiting  relatives, sightseeing and visiting friends, you can get  impressive results. This is the reason that some news media are  happy to hire as reporters people in Hong Kong who are  originally from the mainland. When they return to the mainland  to gather news, they get twice the results with half the work  compared to those born and raised in Hong Kong who go to the  mainland.    Hong Kong reporters who return to visit relatives or friends  on the mainland can find, either intentionally or  unintentionally, all kinds of sources of newsworthy materials.    First, by widely contacting relatives, old schoolmates and  former colleagues, they can learn different views and gather  different news from different levels of society and different  professions, and this is very helpful in portraying certain  political incidents and major social activities.    Second, by choosing friends who hold leading positions or  sensitive jobs and by establishing personal relations, they can  have more direct access to news or more direct access to people  in high positions. In recent years, there have been frequent  news disclosures about previously unrevealed places on the  mainland, such as prisons and labor camps, and many of these  disclosures have been made possible by opportunities to  interview and photograph through private channels.    Third, reporters visiting relatives and friends on the  mainland will inevitably have money and exchange goods, gifts or  banquets, which used to be considered normal relations. Mainland  cadres often make material demands on friends from abroad, and  often give materials or internal information in exchange.    Whether international or unintentional, once a "leaking  situation" is exposed, these activities by outside reporters  inevitably become "criminal evidence" used by the public  security and pubic safety departments. Normal banquets and gifts  can become evidence of "bribery," and conversations between  friends can become "spying." The reason why the Xi Yang incident  has aroused the attention and concern of the Hong Kong media is  that the public security departments have not made very definite  and detailed announcements, and their charges are murky.  Concerned department should clearly define the difference  between "secrets" and "news."  <H3>  Reducing Levels of Secrecy; Outside Is Relaxed, Inside Is  Tight </H3>   At the beginning of this year, the National Security Bureau  decided to carry out necessary reforms of the national security  system to meet the needs of the economic reforms. Hundreds of  thousands of secret documents from central to local governments  were declassified, and they redefined the standards of security  classification. This was publicized in the official weekly  Liaowang, and the article emphasized that "even though secrecy  classification has been reduced, the maintenance of secrecy must  be further reinforced."    The main target of this prevention of leaks is outside  reporters. The State Council's memos concerning "Reinforcing the  Management of Foreign Reporters" and the "Regulations Governing  Foreign Reporters and Foreign News Organizations" were  disseminated to the county and regiment levels, requiring  leaders at all levels to comply. There are clear guidelines  regarding the approval of applications by foreign reporters to  visit, and regarding which groups of applicants must be refused.  In addition, the documents require that the receiving unit must  "provide designated guides throughout the entire visit," that  information on all activities of foreign reporters must be  gathered, and that the management of outside reporters should be  "relaxed on the outside, tight on the inside." Any foreign  reporters singled out by security departments and placed on a  blacklist will be put under the "supervision" of the security  departments from the time they enter China, and all their  activities and contacts will be recorded. The eyes and ears of  the security departments are everywhere. They might be service  workers in the hotels, they might be officials of community  organizations and they could be your mainland counterparts who  are working alongside you.    A worker in the Guangzhou customs office admitted that  because there is no comprehensive computer network, there are  large holes in the information about incoming reporters. Aside  from a few people who are on the security department's  blacklist, ordinary incoming reporters usually are not easily  controlled by the State Security Bureau. Furthermore, more and  more points of entry are being opened up on the mainland, and  concerned departments cannot in a timely fashion monitor  incoming reporters' activities. But as soon as you step on the  "land mine," you become a new target.  <H5>  A Planned Crackdown on the Hong Kong Media </H5>   It is naive to think that after 1997 the freedom of the  press  in Hong Kong will not be interfered with by Communist China or  the government of the special zone. As everyone knows, Beijing  has already done extensive studies of the Hong Kong media in  preparation for formulating policies governing Hong Kong's news  media and the arts, and to provide materials to take over the  arena of public opinion in Hong Kong. In the late transitional  stage, the general direction of the propaganda is to "maintain a  foothold in two newspapers, expand the base, unite the struggle  and attack key targets." The so-called "two newspapers" are Wen  Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. "Expand the base" refers to a number of  officially colored publications continuously published by  Communist China in Hong Kong, such as Zi Jing, Zhonghua Wenzhe,  Gangao Dongtai and so forth, which are put out at great expense.  "Attack key targets" refers to the abovementioned memos' "select  opportune moments, select suitable targets and select suitable  methods" to make a "frightening attack."    The Xi Yang incident happened during the national security  conference, and the prevention of secret-stealing by foreign  reporters was originally one of the key topics of the  conference. Therefore, the choice of Xi Yang as a target was  very well-timed, and the so-called "state secrets" and the fact  that "an open hearing could not be conducted" were merely  bargaining chips in the hands of the government. After Kuai Pao,  Ming Pao became another target of punishment.    In the 3d plenary session of the 7th National People's  Congress, the criminal code was amended to increase the penalty  for stealing national secrets, from under five years in prison  to death. Liang Huimin of Kuai Pao could have been given a heavy  sentence, but was magnanimously released. This shows that  criminal justice is a bargaining chip in the hands of Communist  China.    After the Xi Yang incident, this writer made inquiries to  friends in Beijing several times. An official of the city public  security department who understands the case refused to comment  on the facts of the case, but one sentence revealed all: "It  mainly depends on the attitude of the person." From this we can  conclude that the official statement saying that Xi Yang has  already "freely admitted the stealing of secrets," and that the  Ming Pao chief's attitude changed from "firmly believing in Xi  Yang's innocence" to a reversal on 10 October that clearly  admitted Xi Yang's "mistaken" violation of the law, and an  expression of regret, indicate that Communist China can deal  with this case using the Liang Huimin model at any time, and the  entire incident can be resolved. Whatever happens, it not only  resulted in the effect of "killing the chicken to scare the  monkey," but it was also one strike against Ming Pao. Therefore,  the national security department is apparently the winner, and  is also able to avoid criticism from overseas on the basis of  human rights.    The question is, whose turn is it next time?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has brought into  force the new program of privatization of state and municipal  enterprises which is to regulate the privatization process in  Russia beginning in 1994.    The approved state program does not greatly differ from the  privatization program which was in effect in 1992-1993. The new  program does not change the major peculiarity of the Russian  legislature on privatization, namely privatization by means of  vouchers; their term of operation is to expire on July 1, 1994.    In comparison with the previous one, the new state program  expands rights of the regions and increases the list of sites,  the privatization of which was earlier prohibited or restricted.    In addition, this document removes all restrictions for the  participation of foreign investors in the privatization of  Russian state property. According to the state program, foreign  individuals and legal entities can participate in auctions and  competitions organized to sell state property on equal rights  with Russian investors. Foreign investors are allowed to  procure state securities (including vouchers) without any  coordination with the RF [Russian Federation] Finance Ministry  (according to the decree on foreign investments, a foreigner had  to receive permission from the Finance Ministry in order to buy  state securities).    Chairman of Russia's State Property committee Dmitriy  Vasilyev says that about 80% of state property is expected to be  privatized by July 1, 1994. Currently, 45-50% of Russian  property belongs to the private sector.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / CIA man is held in US 'spy' case A long-serving CIA employee and his wife have been arrested on charges of spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia in one of the US's biggest-ever spy cases, the Justice Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Held without bail pending further court action were Mr Aldrich Ames, 52, most recently the chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's counter-intelligence unit, and his wife, Mrs Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, a US citizen who did not work for the CIA. Justice Department officials said the couple, arrested separately by the FBI on Sunday, had been charged with spying for the Soviet Union from 1985 until its demise in 1991 and then for Russia, in return for more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 685,000) in pay-offs. Mr Ames has been employed by the Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years, the department said. He served as chief of the Soviet Counter-intelligence Branch from 1983 to 1985. He had previously been a CIA operations agent recruiting Soviet officials and KGB officers to spy against the Soviet Union, according to court papers. Since 1969, he had served at CIA posts in Ankara and Mexico City, as well as doing several stints at the agency's headquarters. Officials described it as one of the biggest spy cases ever, because of the extent of the material allegedly passed and the sensitive nature of compromised national security information. The arrests capped an investigation that had run for over two years, they said, apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector. No further arrests were expected. The two arrests confirmed that the Soviet Union had been able to penetrate the CIA, planting a mole inside the US spy agency, just as some veteran intelligence officials had long suspected. In a brief court hearing in suburban Alexandria, Virginia, a federal magistrate ordered the couple to be held in jail without bail until another hearing on Friday. President Bill Clinton said later yesterday that it was 'a serious case'. 'We will be immediately lodging a protest to the Russian government,' he said.</p>

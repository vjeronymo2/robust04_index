She  chose co-winners, Sherrell Wilson and Richard Edwards, both of Slaton.  </P> <P> Slaton is about 15 miles from her hometown of Lubbock, where Holly also grew  up.  </P> <P> "Peggy Sue," a hit by Holly and his group, the Crickets, initially was called  "Cindy Lou," after Holly's niece, but the name was changed during a recording  session in 1957, Rackham said.  </P> <P> Rackham married the Crickets' drummer, Jerry Allison, in 1958. They shared a  honeymoon in Mexico with Holly and his bride, Maria Elena.  </P></p>

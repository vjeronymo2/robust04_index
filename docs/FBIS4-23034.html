			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.Yu. Fedorov, Ye.V. Volchenko, V.Yu. </F> Krestyaninov, V.I. Korzhenevich, Saratov Branch of the National  Scientific Research Institute of Commercial Microorganism  Genetics and Selection; UDC 579.695:574.635]    [Abstract] The urgency of removing acetophenone (AF), also  known as methylphenylketone or hypnone, an aromatic substance  present in waste water of acetone and phenol production by the  cumene method, from the environment due to its toxicity, and  known advantages of biological treatment methods, e.g., with the  help of the Nocardia and Arthrobacter  strains, prompted attempts to isolate acetophenone-destroying  strains from natural environmental entities, and select and  choose the most active strains capable of utilizing acetophenone  both in mineral media and real waste water samples. The  acetophenone-destructor strains were isolated by a conventional  procedure of direct soil suspension inoculation on an  agar-treated mineral M9 medium containing acetophenone as a sole  carbon source. The experimental procedure is outlined. The  acetophenone-destructor strains were tested in waste water  assays in 250 ml bulbs with 100 ml of waste water at a  10[.sup]7[/] c/ml inoculation density. The component  concentration was measured by gas chromatography and  spectrophotometry methods. Six strains capable of growing in  agarized mineral media with a 500 mg/l acetophenone  concentration as a sole carbon source were isolated from the 38  samples taken from phenol-producing enterprises. One was  identified as Azomonas macrocytogenes No. 139 and  one--as Pseudomonas putida No. 8. The remaining  strains were nonpathogenic gram-negative bacilli. The isolated  strains were capable of utilizing acetophenone in an up to 500  mg/l concentration; as a result of selection, they improved  their ability to degrade this substrate in a 625 to 1,250 mg/l  concentration in 96-120 h. The substrate utilization and biomass  accumulation dynamics during acetophenone biodestruction by  strain No. 8 of Pseudomonas putida as a function of  its concentration is plotted. After total utilization of the  toxic substrate by the strain, the culturing liquid was less  toxic than the initial acetophenone solution for a number of  test microorganisms. In the authors' opinion, the isolated  cultures are quite promising for microbiological waste water  treatment. Figures 1; tables 1; references 13: 8 Russian, 5  Western.</p>

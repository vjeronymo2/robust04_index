			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Coalition set to fall as Dublin ministers quit posts THE IRISH government is expected to fall today after the Progressive Democrats, until now junior partners in the coalition, resigned their ministerial posts and made clear they would support a 'no confidence' motion proposed by the opposition Labour party. Ms Mary Harney, a Progressive Democrat (PD) deputy who quit as junior minister for the environment, said yesterday: 'The country needs an election. The government has broken down.' She said there was no question that the six PD deputies would vote with the opposition. The two senior PD ministers in the cabinet - Mr Des O'Malley, industry minister and PD leader, and Mr Bobby Molloy, energy minister - informed Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of their resignation from the government last night after a PD parliamentary group meeting which had been convened to discuss the coalition crisis. Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner with 77 seats, will not be able to muster an overall majority in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) and will therefore fall. Mr Reynolds is expected to ask President Mary Robinson to dissolve the Dail this evening. A general election must then be held within 30 days. Two dates are being considered - November 26 or December 3. The elections and a controversial abortion referendum are likely to be held on the same day. The crisis began last week when Mr Reynolds accused Mr O'Malley of being dishonest in the evidence Mr O'Malley had given to a parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry earlier this year. Mr O'Malley had criticised Mr Reynolds' actions as industry minister in 1987 and 1988 in supporting beef sales to Iraq which he claimed had exposed the Irish taxpayer to unnecessary risks. The PDs called on Mr Reynolds to withdraw the accusation. He refused, precipitating the split. Mr Reynolds told his party yesterday that, after 15 years of Fianna Fail leading minority governments, he intended to lead it to victory with an overall majority. Most opinion polls indicate that an absolute majority will continue to elude the party. Mr Reynolds' future in the party is likely to be called into question. Some backbenchers warned this week that they felt an election had been precipitated unnecessarily and that a search for a new leader might begin if the party lost seats.</p>

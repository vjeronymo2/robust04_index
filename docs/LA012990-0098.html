			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KEY LEADER IN PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT SEIZED IN QUEZON CITY  </P> <P> Troops early today captured a key leader in last month's coup attempt, and the  military chief said the arrest will severely weaken efforts to launch a new bid  to topple the government.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, captured outside a house in suburban Quezon City  with two other rebel officers, is believed to be the senior officer involved in  the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.  </P> <P> Abenina jumped a fence fleeing the troops but fell and injured a leg, said  Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region Defense  Command. He then surrendered, Biazon said.  </P> <P> Biazon accused Abenina of forming the coalition of soldiers and supporters of  the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos who led the December attacks, the sixth  and bloodiest bid to oust President Corazon Aquino. Abenina is supposed to be a  member of the military junta that would have replaced Aquino had the coup  succeeded, Biazon said.  </P> <P> At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the failed coup.  </P></p>

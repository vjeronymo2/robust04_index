			<p>CSO     [Text] A group of Vietnamese who have been involved with  illegal drugs have been arrested by the Criminal Police of the  Ministry of the Interior in Doeum Thkov Market Ward right in  front of the Beng Trabek School in Chamkar Mon District.    In activities against this use of drugs, a high level force  of the Criminal Police arrested three Vietnamese illegal drug  users and seized a 20 ml. bottle of drugs on 3 March at 1700.    According to a statement by Mr. Chey Ritthi, the deputy  chairman of the High Level Office of Criminal Affairs at 0800  the following day, 4 March this High Level Criminal Police Force  conducted operations in this area and arrested a Vietnamese  named Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh who collaborated with his wife to  provide intravenous drugs. At that time the authorities  confiscated a number of pieces of evidence: seven packages of  opium power No. 4, a can of cotton impregnated with drugs for  rubbing or sniffing, four hypodermic syringes, approxiametly 10  ml. of drugs, a number of ampules of diazepam and prometazine  made in China, and a number of hypodermic needles.    People who know say that the drug problem became very active  in South Vietnam when the American soldiers arrived. Later, the  Vietnamese communist government made a show of strongly  suppressing this problem, but without much success. The  Vietnamese drug addicts who use these drugs call them "si ke" in  Vietnamese. In Cambodia prior to this the use of drugs in this  way has not been confirmed by any source. So this should be a  sign for the appropriate ministries and for the people in  general.    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang, a woman aged 33 born in Hau Giang  Province, Vietnam and currently living in an unnumbered house in  front of the Beng Trabek School in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward  admitted to the High Level Criminal Police, "I have been earning  a living giving intravenous drugs for the past five months.  During the five days before I was arrested, I ceased taking  intravenous drugs because I feared being arrested by the  authorities and I didn't dare buy any more drugs. I changed  from injecting drugs to taking them orally or applying them by  rubbing (rubbing them on the skin or on wounds) and sniffing  them."    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she had known how to take  intravenous drugs since her first marriage, but her first  husband later went insane and returned to Vietnam.    Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she bought these drugs  from  an old man about 70 years old whose name she did not know and  that he brought them from Vietnam in 1 chi lots (equals a little  less than 4 grams) worth 6,000 riels.    Each day Din Tieng Ngoc Vang provided illegal drugs giving  injections to at least six or seven addicts.    Responding to the question when had he started using drugs,  a  Vietnamese man named Ha Hung Ung, age 35, a native of An Giang,  Long Xieng Province, Vietnam, employed as a carpentar in Phsar  Doeum Thkov Ward recently admitted that, "I have been an  intravenous drug user for perhaps more than one month. At first  I got injections from an old woman whose name I don't know.  Then I got them from Din Tieng Ngoc Vang a.k.a. Sieng. I took  intravenous drugs once a day. At the beginning my friends got  me hooked. Now I am addicted to opium and I have to use drugs  every day. If I don't get a fix, I feel terrible."    Ha Hung Ung added that, "On 3 March at 1700 I was just about  to inject drugs when suddenly the police arrived and arrested me  and brought me here (the Ministry of the Interior)."    Ha Hung Ung's partner who, according to him, is called "A  Tung," is a worse drug addict than him. A Tung is also a  Vietnamese. This opium addict with heavily lidded eyes and who  constantly drools annoyed the High Level Criminal Police Force  because he would not admit to any of their accusations.    Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh, a male age 28 a native of Ba Dinh,  Hanoi, Vietnam first lived at house No. 105 Borikeyla 7th of  January District when he came to Cambodia, but he later moved to  the Beng Trabek area to a new house in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward.  He worked as a runner crossing the border from Cambodia to  Vietnam and buying stolen motorcycles.    A police investigation revealed that Sar Van Kha a.k.a.  Thanh  was a sapper for the Hanoi communist government which had  discharged him, but when arrested by the police he had a Human  Rights Card [as published] which had been issued by the LICADO  Organization.    Responding about his arrest for conspiracy together with his  wife in the illicit distribution of drugs, Sar Van Kha a.k.a.  Thanh admitted that, "the drugs that the authorities took away  on the morning of 4 March 1994 were my wife, Din Tieng Ngoc  Vang's, drugs, but I don't know where she bought them."    The High Level Criminal Police are building a case against  these four Vietnamese who are involved in the use and  distribution of illegal drugs in order to send it to court and  punish them according to the laws in effect.    This is the very first success of the Cambodian police in  the  suppression of people involved in the illegal use of drugs which  in the past we only heard stories about in Hong Kong videos.</p>

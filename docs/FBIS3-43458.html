			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Guinea the opposition continues to criticize the  election of President Lansana Conte in the 19 December  presidential election. His victory has been confirmed by the  Supreme Court of Conakry. The opposition, which is determined  to come together and begin consultations, says it is not  surprised by President Conte's victory. Here is the opinion of  Siradiou Diallo, chairman of the Party of Renewal and Progress  [PRP], in an interview with Carmen Diop:    [Begin recording] [Diallo] Everybody can be surprised by  this confirmation -- but not we of the PRP. Our party had for a  very long time before the polling day known that everything had  been set to proclaim the president elected right from the first  round. That is why the opposition held a series of meetings to  decide not to participate in the polls, which was going to be a  real masquerade. The president could not have an absolute  majority right from the first round; it is technically and  practically impossible. However, he was declared the winner. We  think this is a forced victory, and this result is far from the  rules of democracy. It is rather thanks to his military force  that he has been reelected.    [Diop] How do you plan to react to this?    [Diallo] Right now, we have asked our supporters and the  whole party to remain calm for the moment -- not to indulge in  an uncontrolled reaction. This a matter which should be studied  in detail before embarking on a new course of action or  strategy. But all this, in our opinion, should be done with the  other opposition parties. [end recording]    The reaction from the committee of support for President  Conte's action in France is that Guineans should put an end to  postelection wrangling and get down to work. The challenge  facing the country today is economic redress, as the chairman of  this association explains to Carmen Diop:    [Begin recording of unidentified official] We shall continue  to work for Lansana Conte and his actions, and we appeal to all  opposition political parties and their outfits, after exhausting  all institutional avenues for redress, to respect the verdict of  the polls, so that Guineans can get to work, because we have no  right to waste time. We have wasted time for 26 years, I think  Guineans must roll up their sleeves and get to work -- by taking  up the challenges of under development. [Words indistinct] many  Guinean students are indignant concerning the insulting  statements made by a representative from an obscure Guinean  students association. The entire presidential support group  wants to reaffirm that the 19 December 1993 elections were not a  masquerade. [end recording]</p>

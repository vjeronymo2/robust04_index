			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild underpowered The privatisation of the power industry four years ago has, in many respects, proved a great success. Electricity companies are running a leaner system which is much more responsive to consumers' needs and delivering cuts in real prices. But this impressive performance has been marred by the excessive rewards which have gone to two groups of people: managers and shareholders. Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, has no remit to tackle the extravagant remuneration packages awarded to executives, almost regardless of performance. He can and yesterday did, take action to improve the price regime, which has allowed shareholders to earn far larger returns from the monopoly businesses than thought possible four years ago. The review was never going to be an easy task, because the balance of reward between shareholders and customers had slipped so far in favour of the former. Dividends have greatly exceeded the City's predictions, and share prices have, in some cases, risen by as much as three times in value. Although domestic customers have seen electricity bills fall recently, this owes more to the decline in generation costs than to price regulation. The electricity companies have passed virtually all of the benefits of their improved efficiency through to shareholders, thanks to price formulae which were devised by a government more concerned with obtaining good privatisation proceeds than with protecting the interests of consumers. Partial success With the initial balance so far out of kilter, it is not surprising that Prof Littlechild's success yesterday was only partial. On the face of it, he has been quite tough. He is proposing to force the companies to make a once-and-for-all cut of between 11 and 17 per cent in their distribution charges (which account for about a quarter of electricity bills), and then limit future increases to 2 per cent below the rate of inflation for a further four years. Together, these actions should produce steady real declines in household electricity bills up to the end of this century. Yet stock analysts were calculating yesterday that the companies will still have sufficient earnings and borrowing capacity to sustain real dividend increases of at least 6 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. If that turns out to be the case, it will raise questions about the effectiveness of Prof Littlechild's new regime. Efficiency gains One reason why excesses may continue is that the potential efficiency gains in the electricity industry remain far greater than was ever imagined at privatisation. Even though companies have shed thousands of jobs and reduced their operating costs by impressive amounts, they are still only part-way through the cost-cutting process. Indeed, in the cat-and-mouse game that is inevitably being played between regulated companies and their regulator, there is an incentive for management to underplay the scope for rationalisation in order to secure softer price targets. There are other factors as well. Most electricity companies have paid off their debts, which means that there is considerable capacity for gearing up. The companies are also about to sell off their prize asset, the National Grid Company, which will enrich their coffers still further. And if the much-predicted shake-out of the industry materialises, there will be efficiency gains from mergers and takeovers too. Prof Littlechild has to ensure, of course, that his price regime does not damage the electricity industry's ability to deliver a vital service and maintain improvements. But all these factors indicate that there is little danger of this: indeed they constitute a case for setting more demanding targets than he did yesterday. Now that the deed is done, however, it would be a mistake to add a threat to reopen the price review, within the designated five-year period, if the electricity industry were once again to offend public opinion with the size of its earnings and salaries. That would only create inhibiting uncertainty. Ultimately, the country's interest lies in having the most efficient electricity industry possible, and that can best be achieved by allowing managements to exceed their targets if they can, rather than threatening to confiscate any excess gains. The pity, though, is that the targets are not tougher.</p>

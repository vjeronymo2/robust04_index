			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> ANIMAL LOVER;  </P> <P> LAGUNA STUDENT HOPES TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SPECIES ABUSE  </P> <P> Antonio Aguilar has three goals.  </P> <P> He wants to change all of his household items -- shavers, pens, shampoos, soaps  -- over to those brands that contain no animal byproducts.  </P> <P> Next, he hopes to persuade the city of Laguna Beach not to issue any more  business licenses to fur shops.  </P> <P> And finally, he plans to initiate a campaign protesting animal dissection in  schools.  </P> <P> Raising awareness of animal rights is a difficult, expensive and ambitious task  for Aguilar. However, it is an issue with which he is emotionally involved as  an animal rights advocate.  </P> <P> "I don't think animals should be killed for any purpose," said Aguilar, 16 and  a sophomore at Laguna Beach High School. "I don't see why human beings think  that they are superior to animals. What makes them think that animals don't  have a life of their own, a family of their own, or a living standard of their  own?  </P> <P> "Especially in this day and age, humans have no right to kill animals for their  fur coats when there are plenty of alternatives. It is the animal's right to  live his life unexploited and free, without humans saying that animals need to  provide them with new coats."  </P> <P> Aguilar has been actively involved in protests and demonstrations since he was  12, when he went with his mother to a rally protesting United States  intervention in El Salvador. As a charter member of his high school's Young  Liberal Activist Club, Aguilar is also a supporter of the Animal Liberation  Front.  </P> <P> His animal rights mission began 4 months ago, when Aguilar first saw a  television advertisement against fur and animal trapping. He requested  information about animal rights from People for the Ethical Treatment of  Animals in New York and In Defense of Animals in San Francisco, and began  researching the issue.  </P> <P> "I am fighting for animal rights and human rights," he said. "It is important  to raise public awareness. If you speak to 50 people and convince two not to  buy furs, 160 minks are saved."  </P> <P> "Also, some products which are tested on animals that scientists call safe,  often end up hurting humans. For instance, Tylenol kills cats, but it doesn't  kill humans. PCP and mushrooms don't kill animals, but they kill humans. So,  when I am working with issues like vivisection, I am also fighting for human  rights, because every time you take a pill that says 'new and improved' or  'extra-strength' or 'new formula,' you are really testing it out on yourself."  </P> <P> So far, Aguilar has been fairly successful. He has received support in the form  of money, legal advice and literature from such other animal rights  organizations as the Vegetarian Society, the People for Reason in Science and  Medicine, Last Chance for Animals and Real People for Animals. And 2 weeks have  passed since Aguilar stopped using products made from animals or tested on  them.  </P> <P> Aguilar organized a vigil at Laguna's Main Beach on April 9 in an attempt to  close down a fur store. He had earlier tried to put cards -- describing how  animals are supplied or killed for furs -- into the pockets of the coats at the  store. After successfully slipping one card in a pocket, he was asked to leave  the premises.  </P> <P> He came back a week later and began passing out literature in front of the  store. Again he was asked to leave and finally did so, peacefully, after the  police were called.  </P> <P> "I know my rights as a citizen, and I know what I can and can't do," Aguilar  said. "I know that I can pass out leaflets without being harassed.  </P> <P> "As long as there is a demand for fur coats for ladies, how about the demand  for fur coats for the animals? A lot of people are becoming aware of the fact  that wearing furs is not a fashion statement anymore. When I look at someone  wearing a fur coat, I don't see fashion -- I think of the animal that had the  fur before she did."  </P> <P> Aguilar is now embarking on a protest aimed at making his fellow students aware  of their rights to refuse to take part in dissection of animals in the  classroom.  </P> <P> He has spent about $400 attending to his various goals. But he added that the  money has been well spent on a cause that has provided him with great personal  satisfaction.  </P> <P> "People think I am a rebel against society and that I like to rebel against  anything that goes on," he said. "That is not true. I just have more causes  than the basically regular ordinary teen-ager would have because I want to be  active and do different things.  </P> <P> "If those are reasons why someone is classified as a rebel, then go ahead,  classify them as such. But every person who has a worthy two or three causes to  pursue is always going to be called a rebel."  </P></p>

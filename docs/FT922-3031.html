			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions: learning the lessons of Maxwell - Norma Cohen and John Authers on developments in the pensions scandal PUBLIC outrage over the plight of 20,000 Maxwell company pensioners has spurred the UK government into a wide-ranging review of pensions law. For the average occupational scheme member, any changes to pension laws could be of vital concern to beneficiaries. Most significantly, Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that the review will focus on the thorniest issue in pension law - the ownership and control of pension scheme assets. This means that the use of scheme surpluses, the biggest bone of contention between employers and employees, should get a full hearing. While employers have long taken the view that surpluses are the result of over-generous contributions to schemes in earlier years, recent court rulings have been more ambiguous. The present position is particularly galling for members of contributory schemes who have contributed, on average, a third of the pension fund's capital but are not given the option of a contributions holiday in line with that of their employer. Also, the review will consider whether schemes should be required to have beneficiaries or independent parties represented on trustee boards. Their presence could encourage some schemes to share surpluses more fully with beneficiaries. There is no guarantee that the independent commission will urge any major overhaul of pension law. Any change would provoke fierce opposition from key sectors. Recently, the 100 Group of Finance Directors, an influential group of Britain's largest companies, surveyed its members and found that most were threatening to reduce scheme contributions if limits were placed on their ability to extract surplus. Meanwhile, scheme members watching the government's half-hearted Pounds 2.5m donation to the Maxwell pensioners may take some comfort from knowing that the creation of a pensions safety net will also be under review. A compulsory compensation scheme could help ease the fears of those concerned about their schemes. However, it is not clear that the review will answer the most common questions raised by scheme members. According to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, the most frequent query comes from those who believe that their former employer has understated the transfer value of their pension. One of Maxwell's most unfortunate legacies is to have encouraged people to transfer out of good company schemes without realising how bad these transfer values can be. How can you spot potential misuse of your pension fund? Actuaries at Noble Lowndes suggest that you start by finding out about the trustees: Is there employee or trade union representation? Is there an independent professional trustee? Are the trustees all directors of the company? You should read all the information you are sent, which should soon reveal if something is amiss. Noble Lowndes suggests you look for the following: The latest audited accounts and report to members - particularly those from auditors and actuaries. Reports on investments. Are the top ten investment holdings in companies in big reputable companies, or have you never heard of them? Are significant amounts of funds invested in the employing company, or lent back to it? Are investments concentrated in a small number of shares? If the actuarial valuation says the fund is in deficit, what plans are there to remedy it? Finally, if the trustees do not give you the information you want, contact OPAS on 071-233-8080, which can if necessary refer your complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman. The name of a solicitor with pensions knowledge can be obtained from the Association of Pension Lawyers on 071-628-9151. Crooks like Robert Maxwell are not common. It would have paid to transfer money out of a Maxwell scheme and into a personal pension, but low transfer values mean that this should be regarded as an extreme step. If you are very worried, then it probably makes more sense to find a new job  -it is a crushing vote of no confidence in an employer to leave its pension scheme, according to Alan Jenkinson of Noble Lowndes. Putting your eggs in other baskets almost always makes good financial sense. That means cutting your contributions to the minimum allowable, and then funding a free-standing Additional Voluntary Contribution up to the maximum. This will be managed by an independent insurance company or fund manager. Then, if some of your pay is not pensionable, or if you have regular freelance income, you could take out a personal pension on top of the company plan. This area is complex, so take legal advice, but personal pensions are generally better than AVCs because you can take a lump sum on retirement, while the whole of an AVC has to buy an annuity. But all of these are stop-gaps. Pension law reform - when, and if, it happens - should remove some of the risks.</p>

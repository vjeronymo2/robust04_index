			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Land Securities The net asset value of Britain's biggest property company may have fallen 17 per cent last year. But Mr Peter Hunt, LandSecs chairman, is in the relatively happy position of having lost less of his shareholders' money than most of his peers. The shares have outperformed the property sector by 15 per cent over the past 12 months, a deserved reward for his consistent refusal to heed the siren calls of those urging a more aggressive stance. The idea that they will now underperform should not go unchallenged, but, on the basis of the gloomier net asset value forecasts for this year, the shares are on a tight discount.</p>

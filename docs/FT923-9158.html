			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IEA report highlights doubts over oil demand FEARS THAT the expected increase in oil demand may not occur are heightened by the latest report of the International Energy Agency and have helped to push crude prices below Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time since May. Brent crude for September delivery closed at Dollars 19.90 yesterday, compared with Dollars 20.35 at the end of last week. The price had remained above Dollars 20 since the last meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in May. The latest Monthly Oil Report from the IEA, the west's energy monitoring agency, said July output from members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries was 24m barrels a day. That was well above the agreed output ceiling of 22.98m b/d, although the agreement did allow for an increase of about 300,000 b/d in Kuwaiti production, and Saudi Arabia said it would continue to produce slightly more oil than it was officially allocated. The IEA said Saudi production remained steady in July at around 8.1m b/d. But production in Iran rose slightly to 3.3m b/d from 3.2m, and there were small rises from Nigeria, Kuwait and Venezuela. The IEA also said that while oil production in the former Soviet Union had continued to decline, averaging only 9.1m b/d in May and June, oil exports had increased to 2.25m b/d in June, and an estimated 2.4m b/d in July. This was due to a larger-than-expected decline in domestic consumption, and a fall in Russian crude supplies to other former Soviet republics. These factors, together with a decline in demand from refineries and the sluggish recovery in western economies have led to a larger supply overhang than previously expected. Weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute showing that US crude oil stocks had jumped by 6.28m barrels to 330.21m barrels also pushed prices down slightly. But Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London, said the decline in price was partly seasonal. 'The IEA's Opec figure is what we might have expected, and is a figure the market can live with. The next couple of weeks will see the price drift slightly, but I would expect it to pick up again after that.' Mr Gignoux said trading was thin in what was always a quiet period of the year. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, said in Turkey yesterday that an oil pipeline to carry Kazakh crude to the Mediterranean sea would be completed within three years. The pipeline would carry 40m tonnes of oil a year through Turkey to the Mediterranean. It could also carry oil exports from other republics such as Azerbaijan. In Moscow, Russian officials said oil, gas and minerals in the resource-rich but comparatively undeveloped Demyan zone of the western Siberian Tyumen region would be put up for international bidding.</p>

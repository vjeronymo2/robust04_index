			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Blunkett pledges to end 'two-tier' health service FAIR taxation and not private insurance and charges should ensure that patients receive adequate treatment under the national health service, Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, told delegates. He announced that later in the autumn a consultation paper would contain proposals for ending the 'two-tier service' that had resulted from the government's policy of allowing some family doctors to assume responsibility for their own budgets. Mr Blunkett said it would also contain proposals for ending the trust status which had removed many hospitals from the control of local health authorities. He maintained that the internal market introduced by the government had 'failed abysmally', with hospital waiting lists exceeding one million for the first time. Mr Blunkett said the NHS was cracking at the seams and only the dedication of the staff was holding it together. To applause, he protested: 'The internal market is crucifying the NHS before our eyes.' Labour's aim would be to put patients at the top of the agenda. Mr Blunkett said: 'We all pay our taxes and should be entitled to the best the NHS can give us'. He attacked the government's pay freeze for public-sector workers, and claimed that the extension of VAT to domestic fuel would cause illness. Urging the party to rally to the 'beacon of hope and confidence for the future' lit by Labour leader Mr John Smith, he declared: 'It's the Tories that are the party of tax and cut, borrow and squander, sell-off and sell-short. 'It's we that want decent, well-managed, well-afforded public services.' He accepted a composite motion urging the next Labour government to restore the NHS as a service 'free at the point of use' for all citizens. The motion also pressed for the introduction of a levy on private hospitals geared to the number of former NHS personnel they employ.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 2 GROUPS SEEK RECALL OF BONO  </P> <P> Charging that Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono has reneged on campaign promises,  members of two citizens' groups -- Save Palm Springs and Citizens of Palm  Springs -- have joined forces to seek the recall of the  celebrity-turned-politician. Critics charge that Bono, 54, who was elected in  April, 1988, failed to take decisive steps to revitalize the city's struggling  downtown and has been inaccessible to the public, despite his pledge to  maintain an "open-door" policy. Dick Sroda, one of five people who signed an  "intent-to-recall" letter mailed to Bono, also accused the mayor of using the  office to promote his acting career. Bono was en route to Hawaii and  unavailable for comment. Proponents of recalling Bono must gather 4,060  signatures to qualify the measure.  </P></p>

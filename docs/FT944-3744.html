			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / FT Guide to UK telecoms The telephone business used to be dull and predictable; suddenly it's exciting and confusing. What has happened? Two things; first, the privatisation of British Telecommunications and the subsequent liberalisation of the telephone business back in 1984. The government created first a duopoly - BT plus Mercury Communications - to bring an element of competition into what had been a monopoly. In 1991, after a duopoly review, it decided to open the market further, allowing other companies to bid for operator's licences. Some 57 new licences have since been granted. At about the same time, changes in the rules allowed cable television companies to offer telephone services. Second, an explosion of technological advances, including digital - computer language - transmission, which is making possible affordable services, such as call waiting, call diversion and call barring, not to mention video telephony and multimedia. So if cable companies can offer telephone services, BT can transmit television programs, I suppose? Not quite. The concession to the cable companies was necessary to encourage them to make the big investment in the infrastructure required. Allowing BT to transmit TV programmes would destroy that advantage. So BT is forbidden to broadcast entertainment until at least 2001. But it is allowed to transmit on-demand services, hence its experiment in the south east of England with video-on-demand, home shopping and home banking. Mercury seems to be in trouble; how did it get it so wrong?During the duopoly period, Mercury concentrated on skimming the cream from business traffic on long-distance and international routes, helped by BT's ponderous inflexibility at that time. But BT was handicapped by a formula which required it to hold its prices to a number of percentage points below the rate of inflation (currently the retail price index minus 7 1/2 per cent). The price cap encouraged efficiency at BT, which now offers prices little different from Mercury's. Mercury neglected to exploit other, potentially lucrative market niches. Small fleet-of-foot competitors have emerged to occupy niche markets Mercury could have cultivated. Now, squeezed on all sides, it is forced to cut staff and services. Who are these new companies in the telecoms business? Cable companies such as Cable London, which covers the area around Camden and Hackney in London, or Northwest Cable, covering Wigan and Barnsley, are one category. Their network provides the connection to the home or office and they use a carrier, typically Mercury, to provide long-distance services. Then there are utilities looking for a way into the telecoms market; Energis, for example, set up by the National Grid Company, provides long-distance services over fibre-optic cables wound round its power lines. WorldCom is representative of a third category. A US company, it set up in London in 1991 and resells international lines to big business at a discount. What about BT's position in the market? BT remains the dominant player with over 80 per cent of the UK market. It alone has a mature network covering the entire country with connections into most homes. It complains bitterly about the regulatory restraints on its behaviour and pricing freedom. Oftel, the telecoms regulator, has little sympathy with this view. Is telecoms becoming an international business? Inevitably yes, driven by the communications needs of large international companies. There is a race to become the leading 'global supercarrier', managing telecoms around the globe for these companies. The leader is probably Concert, operated by BT and MCI of the US, but AT&amp;T's Worldsource, and Atlas, operated by US Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom is not far behind. What does last week's Oftel document mean? The regulatory regime, designed to promote competitiveness in the UK market in an orderly fashion, has not been fully overhauled for a decade. The Oftel document is meant to open up a discussion which could lead to a more open, competitive market, where BT would have more freedom to set prices but all the players would have to obey new, tough competition rules. And the future? Prices have fallen substantially over the past decade and are likely to continue downwards, driven by competition and technology. There is a much interest in Ionica, a Cambridge company promising even cheaper voice telephony through radio links into the home. But customers might not find their telecoms bills decreasing as much as they might anticipate; every operator is looking for new and attractive services to encourage more telephone calls.</p>

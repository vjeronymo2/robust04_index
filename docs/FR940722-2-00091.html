(the licensee), for operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Lake County, Ohio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would revise the operating license to reflect the proposed merger of the Toledo Edison Company into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. The two companies are currently wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Centerior Energy Corporation. As described in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. The name of the combined operating company has yet to be determined (hereinafter referred to as ``NEWCO'') and the licensees indicate it will be provided by supplemental letter. The proposed amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company with NEWCO as a licensee, (2) designate NEWCO as owner of Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action in the form of an amendment application is needed to reflect the result of the proposed merger of the Toledo Edison Company into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. This action is also intended to maximize the operating efficiencies of the two affiliated companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there will be no changes to the facility or to the operating, maintenance, engineering or other nuclear-related personnel as a result of the proposed merger and license amendment. The proposed merger would not change the technical qualifications and responsibilities of personnel. All of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company personnel in the Perry organization would be transferred to NEWCO upon completion of the merger. This organization would continue to report to Centerior Service Company. After the merger, NEWCO and Centerior Service Company would be required to continue to operate, manage, and maintain the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, in accordance with the conditions and requirements of the NRC. No changes resulting from the merger are expected with regard to the following: lines of authority and responsibility, essential nuclear support functions provided to Perry, effectiveness of the organization, priorities and ongoing plant improvement projects, technical qualifications, and corporate financial resources presently available in support of Perry operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect the nonradiological plant effluents and has not other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, documented in NUREG&hyph;0884. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 2, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of July 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jon B.

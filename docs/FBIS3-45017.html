Akaka,  chairman of the U.S. Senate's Indian Affairs Committee, here  this afternoon.    When meeting Houti, Li said China is paying constant  attention to the situation in the Gulf region, and always  endorses respect for the sovereignty, independence and  territorial integrity of Kuwait, and the full implementation of  resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council.    Li said it is three years since the Gulf crisis, and China  hopes the problems left by the crisis will be resolved as soon  as possible so as to safeguard peace and stability there.    "As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China  is  willing to make its efforts along with the countries in the Gulf  region and the international community to this end," Li added.    Li recalled the days he visited Kuwait last June, saying  that  the Kuwait Government and its people had exerted great efforts  to heal the damages caused by the war, reconstruct their  homeland and reinvigorate their economy, and made remarkable  achievements.    Li pointed out that through joint efforts of the two  governments, Sino-Kuwaiti friendship and cooperation will be  furthered.    Houty briefed Li on Kuwait's losses in the Gulf war and  Kuwait's stand on compensation for war damages, and thanked the  Chinese Government and people for their help and support for  Kuwait during the Gulf crisis and war.    Houty and his party arrived here January 10 as guests of the  Chinese Foreign Ministry.    On another occasion, Li had a friendly talk on issues of  common interests with visiting U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka.    Akaka came to China January 7 as guest of the Chinese  People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.</p>

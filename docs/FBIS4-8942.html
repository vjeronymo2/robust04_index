			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Turkish charge  d'affaires has been handed a note of sharpest protest by the  Yugoslav Government over the terrorist attack in Ankara early  this morning, in which a car of our embassy's first secretary,  which had been parked in front of his house, was blown up and  destroyed. The protest note expresses indignation over the  terrorist act, which threatened the life and property of the  Yugoslav diplomat and members of his family. It is stressed  that the Yugoslav Government considers the Turkish authorities  fully responsible for the terrorist act, because -- despite the  Yugoslav side's warnings about threats and hostile  demonstrations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia --  they have not adopted efficient measures to protect the Yugoslav  diplomatic and consular missions, their personnel, and members  of their families.

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Germany's enfant terrible bows out: Mollemann's departure leaves Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises Chancellor Helmut Kohl may well be breathing a sigh of relief. Yesterday's resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister and vice-chancellor, removes from the ranks of Mr Kohl's coalition government a thoroughly disruptive influence, an enfant terrible and notorious self-publicist cordially disliked by most of his colleagues. The fact that Mr Mollemann was vice-chancellor was due entirely to the logic of coalition politics, and not at all to the choosing of Mr Kohl: the job belonged, as does the economics portfolio, to the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the three-party coalition. Following the abrupt resignation last year of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher from the government, after 18 years as foreign minister, Mr Mollemann became the most senior FDP member of the cabinet. The irony of Mr Mollemann's departure, for the apparent use of ministerial notepaper to promote a new product invented by one of his wife's relations, was that he finally fell victim to his inability to distinguish, in the words of Der Spiegel magazine, 'between public affairs and public relations'. Mr Mollemann's every new excuse brought fresh embarrassment, and from his own FDP party colleagues and Mr Kohl came only an echoing silence in his defence. Thus far, the chancellor would seem to be well rid of him. Yet Mr Mollemann is the seventh member of the current Kohl administration to leave office prematurely, the fifth in barely nine months, and the fourth to leave because of what might be called a 'silly scandal'. It all makes the Kohl administration appear fractious and adrift - just when the German economy is slipping into recession, and a clear lead from the government is needed more than ever. Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, the former defence minister, was forced to quit last March, accused of allowing the illegal exports of tanks to Turkey, a Nato ally. Ms Gerda Hasselfeldt, the health minister, went in April, after one of her closest aides was accused of espionage. Two days later, Mr Genscher announced his plan to resign, rocking the stability of the entire coalition. In December, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the minister of posts and telecommunications, said he was pulling out, allegedly because of the government's inability to act more firmly over Yugoslavia. As one of Mr Kohl's longest-serving cabinet ministers, Mr Schwarz-Schilling's exit was a personal gesture of bitterness. Mr Mollemann, a former teacher, public relations man and part-time parachutist, was regarded by many, not least in German industry, as having been promoted beyond his capacities; as economics minister he was in a job at the very interface between the government and industry. Moreover, the economics ministry is arguably the most important ministry in the task of reviving the collapsed economy of east Germany. One of the weakest areas of the Kohl coalition has been its inability to forge a working relationship of mutual respect with industry in the challenge of German unification. The chancellor himself is notoriously uninterested in the economy - although he has belatedly realised its critical importance at this juncture. Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, is a much more shrewd political operator than many would believe, but he is also no expert in his field, relying instead on his senior civil servants. As for Mr Mollemann, he sometimes chose the right issue (the need to dismantle state subsidies, and reduce the high costs of industry were favourite themes), but he never enjoyed the respect needed to put his words into action. Thus his resignation is both an embarrassment and an opportunity for the chancellor. If Mr Kohl can find an alternative candidate who would enjoy the respect of the business community, Mr Mollemann's resignation would be a positive blessing. One name being widely mentioned is that of Ms Birgit Breuel, the tough-minded head of the Treuhand privatisation agency. But she is a Christian Democrat, and the job remains in the say of the FDP, which leaves Mr Kohl at the mercy of coalition compromises. The chancellor's promised cabinet reshuffle by the end of January will therefore challenge his leadership capacity to the full.</p>

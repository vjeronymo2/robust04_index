			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victor Smart in London] </F>   [Text] The Governor, Chris Patten, has declared that the  row between China and Britain over Hong Kong is subsiding  despite the political stalemate over his democratic reforms.    "I believe that we are now through the worst of the  political  argument that we have had, alas, with China," the Governor told  an invited audience at the conservative Carlton Club in London  on Wednesday night. "I hope that we can find ways of  co-operating elsewhere."    Patten's remarks reflect the Hong Kong government's belief  that Beijing has now "ring-fenced" the deadlocked issue of  democratic reforms, and is willing to work jointly on projects  such as the building of the new airport.    Patten drew strong parallels between the legacy of democracy  Britain left behind in post-colonial India and his hopes riding  on the future of Hong Kong. Asserting that Britain had taught  India the "literature of liberty", Patten declared that by the  time he left in 1997, he hoped to have "put the stamp of the  continuance of an open, plural society" on the territory.    Yesterday, Patten reinforced his message about the  overwhelming importance of the steps towards democratic  accountability at a meeting in Manchester.    He said: "If the Joint Declaration is implemented in full, I  believe that Hong Kong will have a spectacular future."    The territory would be assured, he argued, of the role in  relation to the Chinese economy that New York played in the  opening up of the American continent.    "If the Joint Declaration is not implemented in full, Hong  Kong will put in jeopardy the characteristics which make it  special -- the rule of law, a free press, a high level of  resistance to corruption," he said. "Hong Kong will no longer be  special and the potential offered by the historic `one country  two systems' concept will have been squandered."</p>

According to the Mexicans the decision was taken  for economic reasons, reports ZIANA news agency. Last month a  senior Mexican diplomat was quoted as saying the mission in  Zimbabwe had been experiencing financial problems. Mr  Shamuyarira said his government was also disappointed at the  level of trade between Mexico and Zimbabwe, which he described  as "very low".</p>

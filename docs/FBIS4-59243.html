			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, 11 May (INA) -- Iraq has informed the UN  General Secretariat that U.S. and other warplanes, flying from  the Saudi and Kuwaiti territories, have violated Iraqi airspace  over various Iraqi governorates and dropped leaflets hostile to  Iraq and the Iraqi people.    In a message received by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali today, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf  said two enemy warplanes, flying from Saudi and Kuwait  territories, violated Iraqi airspace on 3 May. They overflew  al-Najaf and al-Muthanna Governorates and dropped large  quantities of provocative leaflets, the message says.    The message adds U.S. and other warplanes carried out  similar  aggressive acts over the Ninawa, Salah al-Din, and al-Ta'mim  Governorates.    The foreign minister stressed that the imposition of the  no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq is an illegitimate  and illegal act which has nothing to do with the United Nations.    Addressing the UN secretary general, the minister said: Your  excellency, you have stressed this point more than once, and so  did your spokesman, Mr. Gosles [name as transliterated]. The  entire world knows that these illegitimate and illegal acts  constitute a glaring aggression against Iraq and a serious  violation of its sovereignty, security, and the safety of its  people.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said Iraq strongly protests and  denounces these provocative practices which contravene the rules  of international law and the UN Charter.    He added: On behalf of the Iraqi Government, I officially  ask you to assume your responsibilities toward halting those  provocative practices and putting an end to the embargo imposed  on Iraq in observance of the UN Charter and in accordance with  the international body's responsibilities toward respecting  nations' sovereignty.</p>

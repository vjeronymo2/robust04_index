			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Augusto Cilloniz Benavides, </F> president of the Association of Peruvian Agriculturists, by  unidentified correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] The Association of Peruvian Agriculturists (AEA)  became affiliated with the National Confederation of Private  Business (Confiep) in November 1993. At that time, it set out to  improve the basic conditions for establishing a modern  agricultural sector without limitations on private property or  investment. Three months later, AEA President Augusto Cilloniz  Benavides says they already have a membership of 110  agriculturists. The goal is to enroll some 2,500 (or almost all  those owning more than 20 hectares). In the midst of this  process, the agriculturist leader describes the criteria that  will guide the AEA's activities directed toward working for the  modernization of infrastructure, investment, education,  information, and health. The summary of his conversation with EL  COMERCIO follows.  <H5>  Lack of Structures </H5>   In addition to what has been called the problem of Peruvian  agriculture -- read "financing" -- there is the lack of a  business structure to coordinate the processes of planting,  investing, selecting, marketing, and selling.    "In the mining and fishing sectors, the Central Peru Mining  Enterprise, the Peruvian Iron Mines Enterprise, and the State  Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency remained productive,  despite being owned by the state. In agriculture, this does not  apply."    Thus Augusto Cilloniz Benavides, president of the  Association  of Peruvian Agriculturists, sums up his thoughts on the problems  of the agricultural sector.    According to Cilloniz, the origins of the decline in  agriculture can be studied, for example, in the experience of  the sugar mill companies.    "They were forced to become cooperatives, and now they do  not  have the support for efficient operations," he said.    The agriculture leader said that 90 percent of sugar  production is in the hands of small proprietors who have lost  the capacity to maintain a business structure. This has resulted  in the destruction of the irrigation, farm machinery, and  marketing systems infrastructures, as well as the destruction of  companies involved in agriculture.  <H5>  Financing Is a Matter of Real Guarantees </H5>   [EL COMERCIO] Financing then is not a problem for  agriculture?    [Cilloniz] Yes, it is. But more than financing, the main  problem is the system of financing and the real guarantees that  agricultural business offers.    In order to exist, credit must be managed with reasonable  risk. The agriculture sector, with its low levels of  productivity, its inadequate marketing systems, and its  health-related problems, is a high-risk sector.    Any financial institution, whether it calls itself a  commercial or development bank, or a rural fund, requires a real  guarantee by the farmer. It also requires technical support to  assure the farmer and the bank that the loan will be well  employed and the risk will be minimum.    Cilloniz cites as a useful experience in dealing with the  problem of guarantees the Joint Responsibility Financing,  conducted in the Huaral and Canete valleys. This project  consists of farmers forming associations and contributing to a  fund of guarantees that enables them to deal with any unforeseen  circumstances that befall any of the members.  <H5>  There Are Several Levels of Agriculture </H5>   There is no single agriculture sector, but rather three  levels or sublevels with different problems and possibilities.    The first is the level attained by export crops, which  already have an assured market. They generally possess technical  support provided by the exporting firms. According to Cilloniz,  these farmers have no "serious problems."    The second level is composed of industrial crops whose  prices  are quoted on the international commodities markets. Included in  this category are, for example, coffee, corn, rice, cotton, and  sorghum. Their principal characteristic is that the demand for  them is known.    If these products are managed in a technically adequate  manner, the risk is only moderate and they are creditworthy. In  addition, companies participate in the management, such as those  that purchase textiles, in the case of cotton, for example.    The problems arise at the third level, for peasants in  subsistence agriculture who grow tomatoes, potatoes, onions,  garlic, and some of the fruit normally produced for the domestic  market. In agriculture as in any other productive activity, the  market should determine the final price. However, the very poor  condition of wholesale markets prevents that rule from taking  affect.    As a result, the AEA believes it is necessary to complete  construction of the Santa Anita market, so that farmers will  have a suitable place to market their products.  <H3>  The Agrarian Funds Have Only Fulfilled Their Social Welfare  Role </H3>   If the problems are concentrated in subsistence agriculture,  the AEA believes that the Agrarian Funds have been limited to a  social role.    The purpose of the credits extended by the Agrarian Funds  has  been purely social. The problem is that there is a very low rate  of loan repayment and inadequate management of lines of credit.    Therefore, AEA proposes that the role of the state be  intensified in the areas of research and plant disease, as  investment conditions in agriculture are evident.    [EL COMERCIO] Is it good business to invest in agriculture?    [Cilloniz] There is no such thing as good or bad business,  only good and bad businessmen.    Cilloniz thus assures us that if a farmer knows how to  purchase his supplies, sows with the help of technical  assistance, and negotiates with buyers, and if the marketing  infrastructure improves, that farmer is certain to get good  results.  <H5>  [Box, p B16] </H5>   "One of the sectors that will grow most in coming years is  agriculture, basically because we are starting out from a very  low base, because everything is to be developed anew, and  because we have rejoined the financial world.... I think we will  grow even more than Chile, because we have more resources than  they do," says AEA President Augusto Cilloniz on the future of  agriculture.  <H5>  [Box, p B16] </H5> <H5>  Five Short-Term Proposals </H5>   The AEA announced that its activities in future years will  be  directed toward five principal areas.    1. Marketing Systems    -- Modernize marketing.    -- Standardize packaging and canning.    2. Information Systems    -- Disseminate systematically all the information already  available that is needed by farmers, for example, that  information produced by the Office of Agrarian Information of  the Ministry of Agriculture.    3. Health Measures    -- An agreement with the National Agrarian Health System  and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture  to initiate programs leading to the elimination of the "fruit  fly," the "pink worm," and Aftosa fever, which create obstacles  to agricultural exports.    4. Technical Support for Farmers    -- An agreement with the IPAE [Peruvian Institute of  Business Administration] for the creation of  agriculture-livestock technical institutes to prepare mid-level  technicians to participate in agricultural productive processes.    5. Investment    -- Direct the interest of investors in agriculture so that  they will establish contact with agricultural businessmen,  either in associations or as individuals, who produce for export.    -- Intensify investment in the production of lemons,  tangerines, melons, alligator pears, garlic, and onions, for  export.</p>

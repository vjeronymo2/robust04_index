			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (12): Unfamiliar dangers - Tips on personal safety It may even be true that you have nearly as good a chance of being mugged in Maida Vale, London, as anywhere else in the world. But a businessman abroad is almost certainly less likely to spot the warning signs than one who is confronted by a robber on his home teritory. In unfamiliar cities business travellers are at their most vulnerable at the point of arrival: the airport. This is where you can fall foul of unlicensed or unscrupulous taxi drivers, who will rip you off because you have not done your homework and found out three vital pieces of information: what is the best mode of transport downtown, the distance and the average fare. The airport is also where your wallet or handbag can get lifted while potential vendors crowd around you to win your fare to your hotel. The first rule of foreign business travel is to get advice on which taxi company or taxi type is best to patronise. If you don't know the city, your agent, sales rep or even staff at the hotel you have booked into can advise you. While at airports, the time spent at check-in desks can also be dangerous. Again, the combination of crowds and the constant movement of luggage and endless distractions should put all travellers on their guard. The best advice is to spend as little time as possible on this stage. The move towards non-desk check-in at airports is to be applauded for this reason. Lining up at the terminal counter could soon become a thing of the past and it will also negate the need to have to drag your luggage through the terminal. KLM is one of the airlines in the forefront of this trend. It offers seven options for those passengers departing Amsterdam: through check-in, round-trip check-in, car park check-in, gate check-in, telephone and fax check-in and ticket office check-in. Telephone check-in is perhaps the most popular service that airlines offer. Scandinavian airline SAS reckons that business travellers need only queue for 10 seconds at the airport for their boarding pass. At least that reduces the time a mugger or robber can prey on you. Ask your airline whether it offers such a service, or whether it offers checking in at a downtown hotel or rail station. The danger does not end once you get downtown, however. Hotels can provide rich pickings for unsavoury types. Always take advice from the hotel concierge about the city's no-go areas before you venture out for some fresh air. Of course, there are some countries in the world where the traveller is perfectly safe. Singapore is virtually crime-free and South Korea needs only commonsense discretion. The dangers are much greater in Cambodia, the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and Colombia, Iran, Iraq, the Somali border in Kenya, the Iraqi border in Kuwait, in rural areas of the Philippines, in north Somalia, south-east Turkey, former Yugoslavia and Zaire. To generalise, it is in the Middle East and Latin America that there have been the most attacks on business people. In these danger zones being prepared is the secret. Caution must be exercised when using internal transport. You must vary your route home and avoid visits on public holidays which are often key terrorist dates. Do not use the company jet, which sits on the tarmac for everyone to see. If travelling in a group, split up between cabins and don't book into your hotel under a corporate name unless the danger is minimal (and the corporate rate too good to miss). Some nation- alities are more likely to become victims than others. It is not surpris- ing to learn that Americans come top of the list, but Britons and Canadians come close behind since they can often be mistaken for them. The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) advises in these matters and has a check-list for ensuring safety. It suggests, among other things, making two photocopies of the important pages of your passport (one to pack, the other to leave at home) which will expedite replacement. You are advised not to pack unmarked prescription drugs and political literature. Choose non-stop flights or flights with the fewest intermediate stops or connections and reserve a seat near the exit. They also advise dressing like a tourist and not a wealthy businessperson. Leave status symbols (watches and other jewellery) behind and do not discuss your travel plans with strangers. Greater security is afforded on hotel executive floors which have better staff levels and often separate entrances, with generally more privacy. And never use the Please Clean My Room sign on your door as it shows your room is empty. Lastly, people who walk with confidence and a sense of purpose rarely get mugged, say the OSAC.</p>

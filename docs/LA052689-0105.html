			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VA HOSPITAL ASSAILED ON CARE FOR HOMELESS VETS  </P> <P> The Veterans Administration Medical Center in Westwood is not moving fast  enough to expand its care and housing for homeless veterans despite the fact  that more than new 30 beds for that purpose have remained empty for two months,  an advocacy group for the homeless charged Thursday.  </P> <P> Acknowledging a "communications breakdown" with homeless veterans, VA officials  have begun to rewrite admission standards, but insisted that beds had stayed  empty because veterans either had not sought them or were ineligible.  </P> <P> Toni Reinis, co-director of the nonprofit California Homeless Coalition, said  the problem at the VA center reflects a "lack of commitment to the estimated  20,000 homeless veterans walking the streets of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston, in a strongly worded letter sent May 3 to VA Medical Center  Director William K. Anderson, agreed. Cranston said he was "concerned that a  lack of effective communication and working relationships between the VA and  Los Angeles-area homeless advocacy groups may have a played a role in these  beds not being filled."  </P> <P> In the letter, Cranston also requested an immediate survey of vacant buildings  at the medical center that could be used to provide care for homeless veterans  with little or no income.  </P> <P> Reinis said that the 101-year-old medical center, which provides medical and  psychological treatment for veterans, must accelerate its efforts to improve  outreach programs and clarify admission criteria.  </P> <P> "There are veterans groups all over the county that have no knowledge of the  existence of these beds or how to access them," Reinis said.  </P> <P> Betsy Hardie, chief of domiciliary operations at the medical center, which  currently has 298 beds in service for homeless veterans, accepted blame for the  "communications breakdown."  </P> <P> "We at the Veterans Administration have to provide more and better  communications with the community," Hardie said. As for the empty beds,  however, Hardie argued: "We must recognize that there are veterans out there  who do not wish all the services we provide . . . others are ineligible for  reasons ranging from dishonorable discharge to bad conduct."  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (11): Canadian companies cry foul - Telecom re-sellers make big gains and the established players in this market are not happy about it. Despite the presence of a conservative, deregulating government for the past 11 years, Canadian telephone companies have enjoyed nearly a monopoly in the provision of domestic and business telephone services, almost from the very moment Alexander Graham Bell, invented the telephone. But over the past three years that has started to change. In 1990 the government's telecoms regulatory body - the Canadian Radio and Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - allowed telecom resellers into the market. Two years later it approved the entry of independent competitors. The idea for the resellers was simple: they were to be allowed to buy long-distance telecom services in bulk from existing monopoly suppliers and then resell them competitively in much smaller units to business and residential customers. The problem for Canada's existing telephone companies, however, was that long-distance services were their bread and butter. LONG-DISTANCE services have traditionally cost more in Canada than in the nearby US, largely because long-distance profits have had to subsidise the cost of local residential phone services. The Canadian government has long kept a tight lid on the amounts that could be charged to consumers for such services. The average Canadian home-owner pays only about CDollars 15 (about USDollars 12.50) a month for their line rental, and can make as many local calls as they like once that line rental is paid. Realising that this might create problems, the government did force resellers to put in a part of their profits to help subsidise local calling. One of the reasons Canadian phone companies are now crying foul is that the re-sellers need not contribute anything like as much of their profits to support local calling services as the established Canadian phone companies must. For example, in British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, the long-time monopoly supplier British Columbia Telephone (BC Tel, as it is known locally) must contribute, towards the cost of subsidising local calls, 20 cents out of the 35 cent per minute minimum charge on every inter-provincial long distance telephone call. Competitive re-sellers such as Cable &amp; Wireless Telecommunications, the multinational telecom giant, or Cam-Net Communications, the Canadian supplier, are only required by government to contribute between two and three cents per minute. These means that although BC Tel and the re-sellers are both making 15 cents per minute on inter-provincial long-distance calls, BC Tel has to charge customers 35 cents per minute - while re-sellers can make the same profit by only charging as little as 17 cents per minute. BC Tel and other Canadian telephone companies say that this government-legislated encouragement to re-sellers is hitting them hard. BC Tel estimates that it is losing some CDollars 70m alone in long-distance business to resellers. When the government unveiled its scheme to increase long-distance competition three years ago, it estimated that resellers would only capture about 2 per cent of the market. But by mid-1992, the re-sellers already claimed some 6 per cent market share - and now have about 10 per cent. The area where Canadian telephone companies are losing the most money is in cross-border calls to the widely deregulated US. Using their leased bulk, Canadian telephone lines re-sellers can not only sell consumers a cheaper long- distance service within Canada, but they can route calls to the nearest US city across the border - and then patch into the US and international long-distance carriers. There are more than 40 long distance telephone service resellers in Canada. They are already claiming some 65 per cent of the Canada-US business long distance telephone traffic - representing a staggering growth from their entry into the market only three years ago. But telecom resellers are no longer the only worry facing established Canadian telecommunications providers. IN 1992, the CRTC approved bids by two Canadian companies to provide competitive long-distance telephone service throughout the country. The two companies, Unitel Communications based in Toronto, and BCRL, based in British Columbia (a telecom division of the provincially-owned BC Rail corporation), were granted the right to start offering competitive telecom services. The value of the Canadian long distance telephone market is estimated at about CDollars 7.5bn a year. Canada's existing telecom service providers did not give up this monopoly without a fight, either. As with the case of the re-sellers, Canadian phone companies argued that the new players do not have to subsidise the cost of local phone calls (which are still unlimited after a basic monthly line rate has been paid). The CRTC has addressed this, however, by agreeing to a plan that will see the new competitors pay in up to CDollars 11bn to assist in paying the cost of local phone rate subsidies during the period in which the competition is ramping up its business. Two of the country's largest established phone companies, BC Tel and Bell Canada, tried unsuccessfully last year to appeal the decision. They claimed that initially competitors are not being be required to pay as much toward subsidising local rates as they must - and that they have had to pay up to 70 per cent of the CDollars 50m cost of re-engineering their telephone networks so that their new competitors can more easily hook into them. According to Mr Brian Canfield, president and chief executive of BC Tel, Canadians ignore the regulatory problems of their telephone companies at their peril. 'The Canadian regulatory environment for telecommunications has served our country's social policy needs very well in the past, creating a national telecommunications network that is truly accessible to all,' he says. 'In British Columbia, telephone service is virtually universal - more than 98 per cent of our population is plugged into the (telephone) network. Unfortunately, the same regulatory mandate responsible for this accomplishment is becoming increasingly out of touch with reality.' Mr Canfield evinces strong Canadian nationalist sentiment in defence of his company's argument against the recent regulatory changes. Current regulations leave Canada vulnerable to telecom providers 'who are unencumbered by our regulations and who act solely in their own narrow, short-term interests, with little thought to what is best for Canada,' he adds. Individually, none of Canada's big telecom service providers is large enough, by world standards. In revenue-terms, 'we are only half the size of British Telecom, only one-third the size of AT&amp;T and only one-quarter the size of Nippon Telephone and Telegraph,' he says.</p>

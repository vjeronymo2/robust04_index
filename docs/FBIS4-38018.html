			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, June 27, SPA -- The second deputy premier,  minister of defense, aviation and inspector general, Prince  Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz presided over the weekly regular  session of the Council of Ministers at al-Salam palace in Jeddah  this afternoon.    In a statement to Saudi Press Agency, Information Minister  'Ali al-Sha'ir said Prince Sultan, at the outset of the meeting,  had briefed the cabinet on the latest Arab and international  events and reports related to the Yemeni arena.    Prince Sultan highlighted also the great role that had been  undertaken by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to end the fighting and save the blood of the  innocent Yemeni brothers.    "King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, may the Almighty God preserve  him, is making continuous efforts on Arab and international  levels for a decisive and firm ceasefire in Yemen," Prince  Sultan informed the cabinet.    Al-Sha'ir said Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign minister  presented a detailed report on the outcome of his recent tour to  a number of Arab and western countries during the last few days  and contents of messages he had sent to a number of Arab foreign  ministers and the outcome of his talks with them. Prince Sa'ud  also briefed the cabinet on his impressions of the tour. Prince  Sa'ud said the wise directives of custodian of the two holy  mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz at the current critical  circumstances facing the region, necessitate continuous efforts,  meetings and consultations to be directed with the aim of  dedication of peace and stability in the region.    Al-Sha'ir said the cabinet also reviewed the latest reports  carried by the media on the deteriorating situation in Somalia,  Afghanistan and Bosnia. Referring to Somalia, the cabinet  expressed regret over the latest and sharp escalations in  fighting in Mogadishu between the conflicting factions for the  third day running that led to a big number of casualties and the  loss of lives. It also expressed concern on the sudden  escalations in air bombardment operations in the western Afghan  city of Herat.    The cabinet also followed the latest developments in the  Bosnian arena and the efforts being made by commander of the  Bosnian Army to defend the lives, territories and honour of the  Bosnian people on all fronts vis-a-vis the unannounced Serbian  attacks.    In this context, al-Sha'ir said, the Saudi Council of  Ministers appealed to the conflicting parties throughout Arab  and Islamic worlds to put weapons aside, seek rational and  amicable solutions for disputes bearing in mind that conflicts  between brothers would serve no one except their enemies and  will never be in the best interests of the Arab and Islamic  nations.    "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is always looking forward for  establishment of peace and justice all over the world,"  al-Sha'ir noted.    Meanwhile, the cabinet reviewed a number of domestic items  on  its agenda and Prince Sultan listened to views and suggestions  made by the concerned ministers on them. It also opted for the  necessary procedures on them.    The cabinet agreed on the renewal of the commercial and  economic agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia and the Lebanese Republic which was concluded in  1391 AH [27 February 1971] for one more year effective from  26-1-1415 [5 July 1994].    It endorsed the closing account of the department of  retirement and pensions for the fiscal year 1411/1412 AH [24  July 1990 to 13 July 1991] and approved some appointments at  Grade 14th.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> DELAHOYA GIVES GRANT LIFT INTO FINALE AGAINST HOST  </P> <P> Grant High fires so many weapons in the gym that it doesn't seem to matter if  some of them miss the target.  </P> <P> Take Friday night's 76-66 victory over Reseda (1-4) in a championship semifinal  of the North Hollywood tournament.  </P> <P> Senior forward and floor general Setro Terzian made only two of 13 shots from  the field and missed his first seven. Terzian finished with five points -- none  in the second half -- and was called for a charge early in the fourth quarter  while throwing up an off-balance layup.  </P> <P> "The shot felt good," Terzian said simply. "I had to keep shooting."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Grant (6-0), however, the shooting of guard Rene Delahoya, who  scored a game-high 23 points, and center Brunell Mori (16 points) felt better.  Grant plays North Hollywood tonight in the final.  </P> <P> In other tournament games:  </P> <P> North Hollywood 55, El Camino Real 45 -- The Huskies (9-0) rallied for the  second time in three games to earn a date with Grant. Senior center Dana Jones  scored 11 of his game-high 21 points in the second half as North Hollywood  erased a 32-19 halftime deficit. North Hollywood rallied from a 13-point  fourth-quarter deficit on Tuesday against Dorsey in a 56-54 win.  </P> <P> Chatsworth 52, Poly 41 -- In a consolation semifinal, three Chancellors scored  in double figures to offset a game-high 21-point performance by Poly's Jason  Wilson and hand the Parrots their eighth consecutive loss. Eric Isaac (12  points), Darryl Porter (13) and Craig Hewitt (13) led Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Granada Hills 93, Bell-Jeff 63 -- Highlander Sag'y Koren came off the bench to  score a game-high 18 points, and teammates Osiris Nalls and Jermoine Brantley  added 16 and 15 points.  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Arts: Mahler, Bruckner and Beethoven - London Promenade Concerts THE audience for Mahler has not changed since he became popular in the Sixties. Last Friday, the Albert Hall was packed to the rafters and it was a sea of young faces, the second generation to have been raised on the composer's gigantic symphonies. It can be a problem to know what to put with the larger of them, but this programme neatly paired the Fifth Symphony with Berg's Violin Concerto, which can claim a direct Mahlerian line of descent. The soloist was Anne-Sophie Mutter, who has spent the past year on sabbatical. The Berg concerto is the work with which she has chosen to make her return, and her tender performance of it could almost have been intended to link with the favourite Mahler adagietto to come. In recent recordings of concertos by Bartok and Mozart, Anne-Sophie Mutter's playing had started to sound larger-than-life to an unpleasing degree, but this Berg marked a return to a subtler kind of musicianship. The quiet playing shimmered with colours. The portamentos, of which she is fond, were delicately done. Recent research has claimed to find a hidden autobiographical programme behind this concerto and in Mutter's performance it was possible to believe that this is indeed music of a secret love. After the interval, the symphony revealed few hidden charms. Michael Tilson Thomas likes his Mahler to be crisp and alert, if not going so far as to be a mere orchestral showpiece. On that level, his ideas about the Fifth Symphony are well sorted out and the performance might have succeeded if the London Symphony Orchestra's playing had been as consistently brilliant as he needed. It is good to hear the LSO away from the Barbican, but on this showing it did not sound a great orchestra. The best passages were the latter part of the scherzo and the finale, where conductor and orchestra alike were in a high state of alertness. The adagietto also started well, brisk, purposeful, unsentimental, although it lost momentum later. But in the rest, tension was relaxed and the ensemble lost the edge which was the performance's raison d'etre. On Saturday, another capacity audience gathered to hear a second big, romantic symphony. Last year, Gunter Wand was forced to cancel a concert of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra because of ill-health. Those who were disappointed then will have been delighted that he was able to take up the same programme at this season's Proms. At the age of 80, Wand is in no hurry to score points off the music he conducts. His performance of the Eighth Symphony was patient and spacious, although not excessively slow judged against the history of Bruckner interpretation. It was the music-making of a man who has spent his life working in the Austro-German musical tradition, who knows what is important and what is not. Listening at home on the radio, I found the resonant Albert Hall sound almost ideal.                          *      *      * Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony, his Ninth, is an indispensable Prom offering. On Sunday, Vladimir Ashkenazy conducted it, apparently to mark Britain's turn at the EC presidency, with the Berlin Radio Symphony, the London Symphony and Brighton Festival choruses, and four solo singers from EC countries. By way of a more specific salaam, Ashkenazy prefaced it with Elgar's Falstaff, a near-hermetically English piece. I thought its jauntily skewed rhythms never quite found a convincing pulse here, but Ashkenazy paid tender attention to its crepuscular details. The 'Choral', in his open-hearted treatment, sounded more cheerful than visionary. His tempi were brisk: the first movement went at a lithe allegro with little hint of 'maestoso', the great adagio sang sweetly and steadily. With sterling soloists in Margaret Price, Martine Mahe, Jan Blinkhof and Kurt Moll, as well as the intrepid choirs, the finale made the stirring effect that it usually does in the Albert Hall. Ashkenazy's tearaway ending, however, sounded like a last-minute bid to add glitter to an honest, good-natured performance. As a pianist, he can show his true mettle as a Beethoven interpreter better than on the podium.</p>

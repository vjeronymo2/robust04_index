			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / It's better when you're private: Are the salaries of bosses in former UK public utilities justified? This kerfuffle about salaries is a peculiarly British thing, said Mr John Bellak, once chairman of Severn Trent Water and recipient of a Pounds 512,626 pay-off last year. He was reflecting from the Carlton Club in London on the latest arguments about pay, pensions and share options that are swirling around the water and electricity distribution companies, four years on from privatisation. Some critics charge that the executives of the privatised companies are former civil servants who have managed to get their hands in the honey pot; supporters claim that they are overworked managers battling away in complex industries, whose personal merits are only now beginning to be recognised. The extremes of the debate are crude, of course, and do not address directly the question of whether reward should be matched to performance. But as annual reports have trickled out recently, and the small print at the back has revealed details of remuneration and pay-offs, critics have become more outspoken: the rewards have been outstripping performance, they say. In the Commons, warming to the theme that privatisation had turned into a swindle against consumers, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, asked the prime minister this week: 'How can you defend the fact that the chairman of North West Water got Pounds 47,000 a year before privatisation and now he gets Pounds 338,000?' Mr John Major defended the water privatisation programme and said directors should abide by the government's strict limits on pay increases for public sector workers. Meanwhile, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, has been telling executives that those who climb to the top of the ladder should be mindful of their responsibilities to others. Water and electricity executives might have had an easier time fending off their critics but for three factors: the recession, lay-offs in the privatised industries, and larger bills for consumers. 'For a lot of people, when they come into the industry, what really hits them is that they're in a goldfish bowl,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity. Those looking into the bowl see plumper and more valuable shapes than in recent years. This is true even in the goldfish bowl of Scotland, where, as in the case of Scottish Power and Scottish HydroElectric, the privatisations were priced more parsimoniously than the English electricity companies, and where the chairman and senior executives have been a little more restrained in taking salary increases than some of their English peers. None the less, the rises were substantial. Mr Ian Preston, chief executive of Scottish Power, has seen his pay rise from Pounds 63,175 before privatisation in 1991 to Pounds 255,218 in 1993-94. Sir Donald Miller, Scottish Power's first chairman, saw his pay increase from Pounds 75,873 in 1990 to Pounds 203,192 in 1992, the year he retired. In England, at Northern Electric, the salary of Mr David Morris, chairman, went up in the last financial year to Pounds 208,000; it was Pounds 72,151 in 1989-90. At Northumbrian Water, Mr David Cranston, the chief executive, earned Pounds 150,000 in the last financial year, three times more than the company's managing director at the time of flotation. On top of their salaries, most directors and senior executives of the privatised companies have been granted options to buy shares at a specific price. There is nothing unusual in this practice: it is a common method of allying hopes of personal fortune to corporate performance. But the bonanza has led to growing calls from the Labour party for an independent inquiry into the way the utilities are regulated. At Swalec, the south Wales electricity company, Mr Wynford Evans, chairman, has exercised options on 111,510 shares, making a paper profit of just under Pounds 500,000. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, and two other directors of Southern Electricity, had paper profits of more than Pounds 1m in total on the exercise of 240,000 share options. The departure last year of Midlands Electricity's managing director, Mr Richard Young, was made more comfortable by his possession of options which could provide a paper profit of more than Pounds 500,000. There is no doubt that, as one City utilities expert put it, 'many of the privatised company executives have gone from being moderately comfortable engineers to quite wealthy businessmen in three or four years.' But the qualification of the adjectives is significant. As the observer noted: 'There are plenty of 30-year-olds in the City making more money than these guys.' The amounts involved are trivial compared with the sums made by property entrepreneurs in 1989-90, when values were surging. But the privatised utilities' executives are a more cautious breed, trained to make technical decisions rather than to play percentages. 'When we were privatised - the 12 English electricity companies - the 12 of us were both chairmen and chief executives. Eleven of us were long term in the industry, 10 were engineers,' recalled Mr Townsend. Now the roles of chairman and chief executive have been split and 'virtually all the chief executives are engineers, not all of them from inside the industry'. They have in common the fact that they seem obsessed with work. Mr Alan Smith, managing director of Anglian Water, said he had never worked harder, never worked longer and never worried more than in the years since privatisation. Sir Desmond Pitcher, the subject of Mrs Beckett's ire as chairman of North West Water, uses the golf course and opera house as an extension of his office. 'He just hasn't time to be a playboy or anything like that,' said a colleague. Mr John Seed, chief executive of SWEB, the south-west electricity company, started work on Thursday at 7am, finished at midnight and was starting work again yesterday at 6am. There is little evidence that the higher salaries and the grant of share options has turned the technocrats into hedonists. 'After privatisation my salary increased significantly, but I did not buy a bigger house or car. My life did not really change,' said Mr Walter Waring, managing director of Eastern Electricity until 1992. Such modesty is characteristic. Sir Donald Miller formerly of Scottish Power has a yacht but did not bother to upgrade it when he moved off nationalised industry pay. Mr Bellak has a rambling country house in Staffordshire, but he owned it before he joined Severn Trent. Mr Preston, also of Scottish Power, who was taking a day off fishing yesterday, 'has a smaller house in Glasgow than I have', said a colleague, 'and a little cottage in Dumfriesshire'. Mr Townsend pointed out: 'The big difference is when you retire - if you look at the situation under the old regime, we wouldn't have been very well off at all.' Yet, for all their rather mundane aspirations, the executives and directors of the privatised utilities often attract venom. At the political level, the disparity between their good fortune and the misfortune of those made poor by recession is an easy target. In the City there are expressions of unease at their salary levels. 'These companies were privatised on the cheap as the merchant banks did a good job of persuading the government how little they were worth. They were then given an extremely relaxed regulatory regime as privatised monopolies. The directors were given a wodge of share options and the ability to sack people, so they got large increases in their share prices. So everyone's a millionaire,' said a senior fund manager. The executives in the privatised industries would say this is a gross exaggeration. They are not defensive about their pay packages. 'I would never have come here for Pounds 40,000,' asserted Mr Michael Hoffman, chief executive of Thames Water, who joined the company nine months before privatisation. 'And I would never have recruited top people into other positions if the company did not pay them proper competitive salaries.' Attracting top talent through salaries that compete with the private sector has been a crucial issue since the mid-1980s, when the government was seeking to strengthen the management of the state utilities. Often the incoming managers took pay cuts on the assumption that, as the state utilities absorbed private sector practices, the pay position would be redressed. Mr Waring argued that one reason for the pay rises of the past three years was the government's refusal to pay a fair salary in the public sector. It was common for senior staff reporting to him to be paid 10 per cent more than directors. 'There were discussions with government about adjusting salaries before privatisation, but they would not do it,' he recalled. After privatisation, as the water and electricity companies went into the market for new staff, they had to pay market rates. This had a ratcheting effect, as the wages of existing staff were brought into line with the newcomers. The arrival of new staff was only one element of the changes which took place in the state utilities in the period before and immediately after privatisation. 'As a nationalised industry, we had one paymaster. These days we have to explain our strategy and requirements to a wider public,' said Mr John Tysoe, for the last year non-executive chairman of Yorkshire Electricity. That wider public includes shareholders, City institutions such as merchant banks, the regulators and the customer; it is not as cosy as being an old-fashioned water authority. This wider range of functions is offered as one justification by executives for their higher salary rates. They also cite the more complex nature of their business. With finite profits from their regulated, mainstream activities, the companies have been diversifying into unregulated business such as power generation abroad, and waste disposal. So new and wider skills have been required. South West Water hired Mr Keith Court and Mr William Fraser as chairman and managing director just before privatisation. They have not had a pay rise since but, said the company, 'they were recruited for their extensive international business experience to manage huge capital programmes and to deliver to budget and on time. It was understood that, if they could deliver, then the rewards would follow.' What these rewards will be is not clear. In industries where, as Mr Bellak noted, 'different companies are developing different personalities', the levels of payment will remain a source of contentious debate. As they look out of the goldfish bowl, Mr Court and Mr Fraser will know that, in the interests of peace and quiet, they will have to be able to justify every penny in their pay cheques.

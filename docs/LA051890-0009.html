			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> STANFORD'S NO. 3 GRAHAM IS NO. 1 IN THE NATION  </P> <P> Stanford's Debbie Graham wasn't second-fiddle in a season in which the Cardinal  was 29-0 and national team champion.  </P> <P> She was third-fiddle, behind No. 1 Meredith McGrath and reigning national  singles champion Sandra Birch.  </P> <P> But on Thursday, Graham, a graduate of Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley,  finished the year No. 1 in the nation, defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida, 6-3,  6-3, to win the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships at Gainesville, Fla.  </P> <P> McGrath lost in the tournament's second round, and Graham upset Birch in  Wednesday's semifinals.  </P> <P> Graham said her being overlooked was a motivating factor.  </P> <P> "Whenever anyone ever thinks about Stanford tennis, it's always Sandra and  Meredith and I'm sitting at No. 3," Graham said. "I'm the No. 3 player in the  middle and no one ever cares. I wanted to prove to everyone that Stanford is  not just its one and two players."  </P> <P> Graham did not lose a set during the tournament, but Arendt had a far more  difficult route to the finals. She was extended to three sets in both Tuesday's  quarterfinals and Wednesday's semifinals.  </P> <P> "I was tired, but tried not to think about it," Arendt said. "I would say  something carried over (from the semifinals)."  </P> <P> Both players remained on serve until the eighth game, when Graham recorded the  only service break of the first set.  </P> <P> "The first set was so important for me to win," Graham said, "because I started  off the match, and I don't remember a time where I've ever been so nervous. I  was thinking about so many different things. I felt that she was really nervous  in the beginning too."  </P> <P> Graham, seeded sixth, broke Arendt in the first and third games of the second  set taking a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> "I wasn't serving extremely well at all today," said Arendt, who got just 53%  of her first serves in compared to 60% by Graham. "I missed a lot of first  serves and second serves were landing short."  </P> <P> Arendt, the seventh seed, was able to break Graham's serve twice, pulling to  within 5-3, before Graham served out the match.  </P> <P> "I have this tendency to get up sometimes and then choke," Grahm said. "I start  looking ahead."  </P> <P> "When I was down, 5-3, I thought there was a shot, there was a little light,  but she blew it out real fast," Arendt said.  </P> <P> The NCAA title is Graham's second important tournament victory in as many  months. She defeated McGrath in the final of last month's Pacific 10 Tournament  in Ojai.  </P> <P> "After I won the Pac-10s, people kept coming up to me and said that it's  tradition that the winner of the Pac-10s goes on to win the nationals," Graham  said. "I wasn't looking ahead that far, but it kind of made me nervous, so I  tried to put it into the back of my mind."  </P> <P> Graham and Birch lost to their top-seeded Stanford teammates McGrath and Teri  Whitlinger, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, in the doubles finals.  </P> <P> Graham, a sophomore, says she will stay in school until getting a degree and  then join the professional tour. This summer, she plans on playing in U.S.  Tennis Assn. satellite tour events.  </P></p>

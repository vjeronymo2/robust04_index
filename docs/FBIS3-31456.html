			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- The president of the  Srpska republic, Radovan Karadzic, said today after a meeting  with Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb Krajina  [RSK], that Martic's visit "demonstrated solidarity of the  people of the RSK with their brothers in the Srpska republic."    Martic was received in Pale with all state honors, and all  aspects of cooperation, particularly military, were discussed in  his lengthy talks with Karadzic.    "Our talks were very useful and in the interest of our  people. We discussed military cooperation in particular," Martic  told journalists, pointing out that he would not want this to be  understood as a threat, "because we are one people and it is  only natural that we cooperate with the aim of defending our  territories."

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bowater improves Paper group Bowater provided a glimmer of relief in the market as its half-time results suggested a turnround in the hard-pressed packaging sector. The shares improved 19 to 492p after the company posted profits of Pounds 105m and gave a very confident statement. Broker Hoare Govett upgraded its normalised profits forecast to Pounds 231m, and said margins were improving and organic growth was coming through. However, some analysts refused to believe that the company's past as an acquisition-led company was finally behind it. 'Has the leopard really changed its spots or is it just saying what the City wants to hear?' asked one. Bank shares, among the market's strongest performers in the past couple of weeks following a number of broker buy recommendations, made further rapid progress after a positive review of the sector by Kleinwort Benson. Takeover talk, involving the possible acquisition of a leading UK building society or the bank itself being absorbed by an overseas buyer, continued to promote heavy two-way activity in TSB shares, which ended unchanged at 233p. Turnover in the stock reached 12m, easily the highest since January when the company surprised the market with a 20 per cent dividend increase. Barclays, finally unchanged at 595p and a Kleinwort favourite, was the second most heavily traded bank stock, 8.8m shares being dealt. National Westminster, where there was heavy activity in the options, rose 8 more to 511p on 8.3m shares traded. Lloyds put on 7 at 580p as the market continued to speculate about a possible early sale of the bank's 4.7 per cent stake in Standard Chartered. Commercial Union was outstanding in composite insurances, climbing 11 to 564p on talk of an imminent broker buy note and following switching out of Royal Insurance, which fell 14 to 284p. Sun Alliance dipped 12 to 340p, but dealers are still hopeful of a good increase in the interim dividend when the group reveals its results tomorrow. Tate &amp; Lyle declined 5 to 444p after James Capel, the leading agency broker, was said to have taken the stock off its buy list. Iceland Group delivered one of the best individual performances in the market, the shares racing up 20 to 165p after the better than expected interim results, which included a 10 per cent increase in the dividend. Pharmaceuticals group Medeva was the best performer in the London market, jumping almost 18 per cent as investors responded to a sharp improvement in interim results. Even some of the more grizzled bears had to admit that a 70 per cent leap in profits to Pounds 22.1m was encouraging. One commented: 'This might prove to be a turning point in the company's stock market fortunes.' The shares ended the day 23 higher at 151p. A market-led fall in Wellcome shares masked a tussle between rival analysts following a migraine conference presentation on its answer to the Glaxo treatment Imigran. Lehman Brothers came away arguing that Wellcome's product was as good as if not better than Imigran and could generate peak sales of Dollars 500m. Hoare Govett concentrated on the treatment's sedative side effects. The shares fell 14 to 685p, while Glaxo dipped 13 1/2 to 620p ahead of figures due tomorrow. The City tends to see rationalisation as improved profits rather than lost jobs, and yesterday's announcement by Carlton was no exception. News that the group is to combine its common broadcasting services, commissioning and production arms with Central Television from January 1995 is estimated to lead to around 180 redundancies but a boost in profits of some Pounds 5m. The shares rose 12 to 857p, although they were bouncing from a low point and several brokers had begun to upgrade their recommendations. Greene King, the brewer, improved 16 to 537p after selling its 28 per cent stake in rival Morland. The 6.23m shares were placed with institutions via Hoare Govett at 460p each. Morland shares fell 15 to 493p. Disappointing car registrations for August depressed the vehicle distributors sector. The 2.8 per cent rise from last year's level was much less than expected and left Lex 12 cheaper at 384p, Cowie 5 lighter at 247p and Inchcape off 9 at 459p. IMI turned in interim results in line with expectations but not high not enough to hold the share price, which came off 11 1/2 to 325p. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull revised his full-year profits forecast from Pounds 80m to Pounds 82m, excluding the exceptional write-offs.

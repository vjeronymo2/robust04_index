			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK store's surprise Russian profit LITTLEWOODS, the British clothes, mail order and retail group, is forecasting an unexpected Pounds 1m profit from its pioneering St Petersburg stores this year. It is to plough the money back into expansion because it will not be able to remit it back to the UK. The group says there is immediate room for four more stores in St Petersburg and it is looking at moving next into Moscow and Kiev. However, Mr Des Pitcher, the group's chief executive, warned that growth would depend on political stability in Russia. He said demand was strong and accounted for a level of success that had been greater and achieved faster than anyone expected. Littlewoods, which runs 250 shops in the UK, opened two stores in St Petersburg last year. One trades in hard currency and offers the full range of Littlewoods goods on sale in western Europe. The other, in the famous Gostini Dvor department store on Nevsky Prospekt, sells Russian-made goods for roubles. The Gostini Dvor goods are made by the Mayak Tailoring Association under Littlewoods' supervision as part of a joint venture arrangement. Mr Pitcher said Mayak was now making clothes for the hard-currency store as well as the rouble one, but they could be bought at a discount in hard currency. Hard-currency cash flow was used to buy the raw materials for Mayak's manufacturing operations. The Pounds 1m surplus was being generated in roubles by the Gostini Dvor store. 'We cannot remit these funds, so we shall be using them to expand. We viewed this whole venture as a trial and would have been happy if it had just washed its face financially, so we are very pleasantly surprised.' The company has invested about Pounds 700,000 in the project so far. The St Petersburg operations are small, involving floor areas of less than 10,000 sq ft each, with frequent queues outside.</p>

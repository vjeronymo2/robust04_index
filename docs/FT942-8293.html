			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Expro to float with expected Pounds 100m tag Expro, a specialist provider of technical services to the upstream oil and gas industry, will float on the London Stock Exchange this summer through a placing and a public offering. Market capitalisation is expected to be about Pounds 100m. The company, formed in 1973 at the start of the North Sea oil boom, was the subject in 1992 of a Pounds 52.4m management buy-out from Flextech, the mainly media group. Expro's directors said they were seeking a listing in order to broaden the shareholder base and to enable the company to compete for larger contracts. Proceeds from the flotation will also enable it to make a substantial reduction in the Pounds 58m of debt, much of it related to the buy-out. Expro employs about 750 people in four operating divisions. These range from well maintenance and testing to drilling and project management. The company made a net profit of Pounds 3.1m in the year to end-March 1993 on turnover of Pounds 50.1m. About 55 per cent of profits come from overseas operations. Work for British Petroleum and Shell accounted for about 45 per cent of last year's UK profits. Mr John Dawson, chief executive, said the company's prospects were not dependent on the oil price. About two thirds of turnover comes from work on projects in the development and production phase. Only a third is related to more price sensitive exploration and assessment activities. He also said Expro was actually benefiting from some of the changes taking place in the industry due to weak prices.</p>

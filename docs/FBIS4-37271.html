			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed  Taya today received Mr. Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of  civil service and administrative reform in the sisterly Republic  of Yemen, who is also the special envoy of Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. [passage omitted]    After the meeting, the Yemeni minister made the following  statement to our colleague Zaidan:    [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I am very happy with and  honored  by the reception by his excellency, the president. I was able  to convey the message from Lieutenant-General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, the president of the Republic of Yemen.    As you know, the bilateral Yemeni-Mauritanian relations --  which go back to historical times -- and the brotherly ties  between the two presidents, the people, and the two governments,  are given special importance by this continuity. Also, it  should be mentioned that because of the current Yemeni situation  to defend Yemeni unity, and what is going on in the Yemeni  sphere, it was necessary to put the brother president in the  picture and to brief him on the outcome of dialogue resulting  from Arab and United Nations efforts.    We believe that the cause of Yemeni unity -- which is the  cause of all Arabs -- has the support and enthusiasm of the  president, as confirmed during our meeting. This support is to  consolidate Yemeni unity and democracy in Yemen. This is not  only to strengthen Yemen and secure victory in the cause of  unity, but to consolidate it with this satisfactory start on the  Arab front. [sentence as heard]    I cannot but express my thanks and gratitude in the name of  Yemen, its government, people, and leadership on this occasion  for the sentiments we received from the Mauritanian president,  people, and government. Thank you very much. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

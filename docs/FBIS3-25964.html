			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Xia: "State and Local Coal Mines Need Better Team </F> Work"]    [Text] The Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, which  ranks No 1 in quality, quantity and efficiency in China, has  been mining without a licence for years, it has been disclosed.    And it is only one of 193 State mines in the country in the  same predicament.    The Mineral Resources Law enacted in 1986 stipulates that  all  mines need licenses from State authorities.    Those set up before 1986, mainly State-owned ones, should  have additional licenses issued by the Ministry of Geology and  Mineral Resources (MGMR).    To obtain these licenses, however, the mining companies  first  need the approval of local governments on the sizes of the mines.    But the sizes are not always easy to determine. Many of the  State mines are usually surrounded by newly established local  ones. Sometimes their boundaries overlap.    Apart from the Datong Coal Mine, there are other big mines  still awaiting approval from local governments. These include  Yangquan and Fenxi mines in Shanxi Province, Pingxiang Mine in  Jiangxi Province and Fushun Mine in Liaoning Province.    Licenses for collectively- or privately-owned mines are  issued by local governments.    But some local authorities have, out of regional interests,  approved the establishment of small collectively- or  privately-owned mines within the boundaries of existing  State-owned mines, which have yet to get their licenses.    These small mines are posing a serious threat to large  State-  owned mines.    In Changguang Coal Mine in Zhejiang Province, for example,  four small separate mining companies were set up within its  boundaries. As a result, the mine has been almost depleted of  its entire coal stock.    Moreover, the often destructive excavation by the small  companies has led to a severe waste in resources and has caused  many accidents, said a ranking official from the MGMR, who  requested anonymity.    Some observers blame the problem on the Mineral Resources  Law, saying that the old large- and medium sized State mines  should have been granted licenses as soon as the law took effect  in 1986.    But the MGMR official rejected the accusation.    He said that the law should be observed by all concerned.    Local governments may face difficult times ahead as some of  the smaller, privately-operating mines could be closed down once  the boundaries of State-owned mines are determined. The  authorities will be expected to compensate the workers made  redundant by such a move.    Unless these problems are resolved, the law will not be  properly observed, the official said.    But government rulings alone will not be enough to resolve  potential disputes. Instead, careful mediation is needed.    In one case in 1990, the official said, local governments  were required to make a decision, within a month, whether or not  to grant licenses to a State-owned mining company.    However, most local government did not carry out the  national  government directive.    To help the mediation process, a vice-minister from MGMR has  been put in charge of solving disputes. Last year, 19 mining  disputes were settled. By the end of last year, 9,239 or 97.9  per cent of the 9,436 State owned mines were granted licenses.    Both central and local governments should make compromises  in  resolving their conflicts, the official said.    Mines that encroach on farm land and pollute the local  environment should pay compensation to the local people.  Compensation can be made in cash or through other means like  providing jobs for the locals.    In the meantime local governments should not consider only  their own interests. They should recognize that large and  medium-sized State mines play vital roles in the national  economy. They should also take some responsibility for  protecting precious resources.    Before disputes are solved, local governments should not  approve the establishment of small privately operated mines  within the boundaries of State mines, the MGMR official said.    If companies are found to be operating in such a manner, the  MGMR will report them to the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress and their licenses will be revoked.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Criminal Division of the Supreme Court has ruled  that the military personnel accused of abducting and killing  nine students and one professor from La Cantuta's Enrique Guzman  y Valle University will be tried by a military court.    Applying the Law on Venue Dispute -- a law promulgated today  by the executive branch -- the high court ratified its earlier  ruling by voting 3-2 in favor of the military court handling the  case. The Supreme Council of Military Justice and Lima's 16th  Criminal Court have been informed of the decision.    Going against the opinion of the Constituent Democratic  Congress, the attorney general, distinguished attorneys, and  Amnesty International, the Criminal Branch of the Supreme Court  finally ruled on the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta  case by applying Law 26291, which went into effect today.    Following the suspension of a public hearing convened by  ruling Justice Carlos Giusti Acuna -- a hearing held at 1100 to  allow the parties involved to make oral statements -- the  decision from the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court was  released to journalists without comment from Supreme Court  President Luis Serpa Segura or Criminal Court President Moises  Pantoja.    The document applying Law 26291 upholds an earlier ruling on  the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta case. Justices  Pantoja, Iberico Mas, and Montes de Oca Vegazo voted in favor of  the military court hearing the case, while Justices Almenara  Bryson and Sivina Hurtado voted in favor of the civilian court.  The decision has been reported to the Supreme Council of  Military Justice and Lima's 16th Criminal Court.</p>

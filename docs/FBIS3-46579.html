			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2130 GMT on 1 January 94, as part of its special New  Year "News 2001" program, carries a live 90-minute discussion on  political and economic issues. In the program moderated by  newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Yuko Ando, guest commentators  Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, professor  of Keio University, take part at the FNN studio; five others  join the discussion through remote hookups: Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, Kochi Prefecture Governor Daijiro Hashimoto,  businessman Yasuyuki Nanbu in New York City, writer Yasutaka  Tsutsui, and writer Yoshimi Ishikawa.    Most of the first 70 minutes of the program is devoted to  discussions on such subjects as Japan's politics, education, and  freedom of speech in general.    At 2240 GMT, newscasters turn to Foreign Minister Hata and  ask him questions about the political situation. Kuroiwa asks  the foreign minister what kind of year 1994 will be as far as  politics is concerned. Minister Hata says: "We must make this  year a year when politics will go forward and not backward, and  a year when we can make proposals internationally."    Kuroiwa brings up the political reform issue, and asks Hata,  who is president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party): "Will the  current Diet enact the political reform bills?... Please tell  us about the outlook of the bills getting passed."    Hata replies: "Some people predict it will be difficult.  But public opinion shows that if the politicians, blinded by  their own interests, fail to pass the bills again this time --  no one will trust what the politicians say in the future. I  think the Diet members have come to realize that too."    Kuroiwa notes that the economic recession remains another  big  issue, and asks for Hata's comment. Hata responds: "That issue  can be dealt with at the same time the political reform issue is  taken care of. We have a minister in charge of political  reform. Mr. Yamahana is that minister. He heads the Political  Reform Committee. It can take care of the matter, while other  people can take care of the economic issues. And that is  actually what they are doing. Some people talk as if everybody  were running around busy with the political reform issue,  neglecting the economic issues. Reality is nothing like that."    Newscaster Kuroiwa reminds Hata that Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa had pledged to carry out political reform by the end of  1993 and had to apologize when that was not done and that  Hosokawa then pledged that the reform will be carried out before  the current Diet session ends. Kuroiwa asks Hata: "If the  bills do not get passed again, will that mean the Diet will be  dissolved?"    Hata answers: "We cannot just dissolve the Diet because we  have many things to do now. On the contrary, however, it is  possible, if we make serious mistakes, that the people may start  demanding that we dissolve the Diet, calling for election system  reform."    Citing the recent election in Russia as an example of rapid  reform, Takemura points out that it takes time to make changes  in Japan. Hata responds: "I agree. It seems that the Japanese  people do not have enough courage to make changes." He adds:  "Nearly 50 years have passed since the end of World War II and  there are many things which are outdated in our society." He  then explains the need to change some outdated rules and systems.    Ishikawa says Japan cannot make changes without pressure  from  other countries (gaiatsu). Hata says: "Mr. Ishikawa is quite  right. Unfortunately, everything started to move in the past  because of other countries."    Kuroiwa asks Hata if he is willing to become Japan's next  leader. Hata answers by saying: "As I have been doing, I will  continue to exert all-out efforts to support the Hosokawa  administration, which we created."    The discussion on political reforms ends at 2251 GMT, and  the  whole program ends by asking all the participants to give their  views on what the Japanese should do in the future.</p>

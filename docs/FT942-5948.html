			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Big companies oppose social chapter Britain's big companies are overwhelmingly opposed to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, according to a Gallup poll for the Conservatives published yesterday. The poll of 301 top companies also reveals opposition to proposals by the Socialist Group in the European parliament for a minimum wage and cuts in working hours to reduce unemployment. Mr John Major said the poll showed that the social chapter was 'a licence to mess up the British recovery'. He said Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who support the social chapter, were 'stuck in the groove of the old corporate, centralised, over-regulated Europe'. Labour said the economy was being severely damaged by the government's lack of concern for public health and social welfare. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said Britain's rate of sickness absence from work was twice as high as Germany's. 'The need for the social chapter to be implemented here is matched by the crying need for Britain to lift its standards to those of a first-rate nation rather than an offshore tax haven,' he said. Gallup interviewed companies with an average payroll of 5,500 and average turnover of Pounds 220m. It found that 79 per cent support the UK opt-out from the social chapter. Nearly 80 per cent believe Labour's plan to adopt the chapter would damage British business, and 73 per cent believe it would cause a substantial loss of jobs. More than 80 per cent oppose European Union legislation on industrial matters within the UK; 74 per cent oppose a minimum wage; and 66 per cent believe wages legislation would increase unemployment. Nearly 90 per cent believe compulsory cuts in working hours would harm competitiveness. Gallup said 53 per cent of respondents believe that Britain has most effectively enforced EU legislation. Italy, France, Greece and Spain were the countries most widely regarded as ineffective in this respect. The poll also indicated that political integration is well down the list of business priorities for the EU. It showed that 73 per cent want improved competitiveness; 43 per cent seek more flexible labour markets; and 37 per cent want reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Just 22 per cent favour economic and monetary union; 12 per cent want an enlarged community; 3 per cent want implementation of the social chapter; and 2 per cent back political integration. Mr Major said the survey supported the government's claim that the economy had benefited from the opt-out from the social chapter. 'We are doing relatively better because we have the right ingredients for jobs and growth. The social chapter will put that at risk. It is the very last thing that Britain needs.'</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLAY TEARFULLY DEFENDS HIS COMIC STYLE  </P> <P> A defiant Andrew Dice Clay shrugged off criticism that his comedy is racist and  sexist, tearfully telling Arsenio Hall's audience that his foul-mouthed routine  is a deep expression of belief in himself.  </P> <P> Clay appeared on "The Arsenio Hall Show" Tuesday night to promote his new film,  "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane."  </P> <P> He faced a walkout by a member of the syndicated television talk show's band  and blunt questions from Hall about his brand of shock-comic routine.  </P> <P> Keyboardist Starr Parodi said she exercised her right to disagree with Clay's  humor by not performing during the show. Clay shrugged off the boycott, saying  "People do what they got to do."  </P> <P> Then, squaring his shoulders like Elvis Presley, Clay suddenly broke into tears  as he faced the studio audience.  </P> <P> He said his routine is the product of long, hard work to discover what is funny  and true.  </P> <P> "I broke my ass for 12 years . . . and tomorrow, when they go to see that  movie, they're all going to laugh," he declared, his voice cracking with  emotion.  </P> <P> "If you want to be a doctor, or if you want to be a lawyer, you don't listen to  nobody and you believe in yourself. That's what it's all about."  </P> <P> Clay is known for expletive-laden routines that contain vulgar references to  women, homosexuals and minorities. But he said he is misunderstood by critics,  including many fellow entertainers, who say his brand of humor is offensive and  hateful.  </P> <P> He said his ethnic put-down style is "just a joke."  </P> <P> "This is the greatest country in the world," he added. "We let everybody in,  and that gives me more comedic material."  </P></p>

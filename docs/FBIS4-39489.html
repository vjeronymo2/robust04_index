			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN reported  yesterday that Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's internal affairs  minister, met in an isolation remand cell with Citizen Rayil  Khayrov who is accused of the November 1993 murder of Crimean  Tatar leader Yuriy Osmanov.    The main public relations center of Ukraine's Internal  Affairs Ministry assessed these actions by Valeriy Kuznetsov,  whom Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry does not recognize as  head of the Crimean militia, as illegal.    Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry's official explanation  stresses that "R.K. Khayrov, born in 1968, was previously  sentenced to two years of corrective labor. He is presently  being held criminally liable in accordance with Article 93 `A'  (murder for mercenary motives) and Article 42 (robbery with  assault) of Ukraine's criminal code for the murder of Citizen  Osmanov Yu. B., committed on 6 November 1993.    Notwithstanding that the defendant committed the gravest  crime against an individual and in disregard of existing norms  and regulations, V. Ye. Kuznetsov issued an instruction to bring  Khayrov out of the cell where he was in detention, into an  individual office for a meeting with him. The employees of the  isolation remand center were ordered to leave the premises  immediately. The private conversation between V.Ye. Kuznetsov  and the defendant lasted for six minutes. Thus, by his actions  he grossly violated Article 12 of the law of Ukraine "On  preliminary confinement," Article 162 of the Criminal Procedural  Code of Ukraine, and also a number of clauses of the instruction  on the procedure for detaining individuals taken into custody  and defendants in isolation remand cells of Ukraine's Ministry  of Internal Affairs. In accordance with these normative acts,  V. Ye. Kuznetsov, even if he were a minister, did not have the  right to such a meeting with Khayrov without written permission  from the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court, which is currently  examining this matter.    In arranging a personal meeting with the defendant, V. Ye.  Kuznetsov exceeded his official authority, which could lead to a  leak of investigation secrets and other negative consequences.  There is not a single doubt that this was done purposefully,  consciously, and intentionally. The disdain and self-seeking of  V. Ye. Kuznetsov in achieving his intentions are also undoubted.    While addressing occasional recommendations to the personnel  of the Republic of Crimea's internal affairs bodies to abide by  legality and the provision of law and order, in practice he is  insolently disregarding the current laws of Ukraine."</p>

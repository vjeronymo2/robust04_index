			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 ORANGE COUNTY MEN CONVICTED IN $23-MILLION FRAUD  </P> <P> Guilty verdicts against two Orange County men charged in a $23-million fraud  scheme involving phony equipment-leasing transactions were unsealed Friday in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The verdicts against Robert P. Bernfeld, 37, of Huntington Beach and John N.  Griffith, 39, of Santa Ana were sealed while the jury deliberated on a third  defendant, Georgianna Carson, 41, of Huntington Beach. But U.S. District Judge  William J. Rea, saying that one of the jurors had to return to her job,  declared a mistrial in Carson's case and unsealed the other verdicts.  </P> <P> A jury deadlocked in April on two other defendants charged in the case,  including Kimball Richards, son of a former state senator. A new trial is set  for Richards in October, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Leon W. Weidman.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said the defendants arranged phony transactions in which Bernfeld's  Riviera Capital Corp. pretended to buy audio equipment, including gear for rock  concerts and recording studios, from a company run by another defendant.  Riviera leased the "equipment" to Richard's Consolidated Allied Cos. and then  sold the worthless leases to different financial institutions.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas at </F> the signing ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule  Agreement at the International Convention Center in Cairo --  live]    [Text] Mr. President, gentlemen, today we have completed a  difficult stage of negotiations on formulas, articles, and  contexts to begin a more difficult stage in which to translate  what we have achieved on paper into reality. We were lucky  enough to meet today in Egypt, the country with the greatest and  most profound experience in war and peace, to begin together the  first steps on the path that we hope will lead us to our dream  and the dream of generations, the dream of achieving a  permanent, just, and comprehensive peace.    I register here for Egypt, the land of civilizations, its  people, Government, and president, its essential and effective  contribution to what has been achieved, a contribution that  encourages us to be optimistic about the future when we all  proceed together side by side to complete the process and  provide the guarantees for its success.    Gentlemen, our people have chosen the path of peace and  expressed this choice with the most sophisticated means of  action. Their glorious struggle for peace was the subject of  admiration by the entire world just as their steadfastness in  the struggle for existence was an unparalleled miracle in this  and any other age.    As we take the first and most important step on the ground,  we realize that peace is not made through agreements and  documents alone, but gains its vitality and viability by its  ability to achieve the interests of peoples and by the extent to  which it can match their daily needs and its relationship with  their dreams. With this understanding, I would like to speak in  the language of the future and address my words first to our  Israeli partners, the other party to the equation and the other  party with which we have long fought and with which we are  trying now to shape new relations to end past calamities and  tragedies to benefit peace and tranquility today and in future.    I tell our partners: You have fought long but even at the  peak of your strength you never felt peace and security. Every  day, every moment, there was something that disturbed and  frightened you. This is because strength, however great it may  be, can never cancel the feeling of the harm of isolation from  your geographical and human environment and can never prevent  the pain from the constant bleeding in your body and the body of  those you are fighting. We have stretched our hand out to you  to get rid of all the pains of the past.    You, and among you there are some who support the peace we  are creating at this critical time and others who are against  it, you shoulder the major part of the responsibility for the  coming success or failure, God forbid. As we see it, your  responsibility begins by getting rid of the old thinking that is  full of fears and doubts and the endless search for guarantees,  which affects the core of the interests of others, to replace  them with a creative approach to tomorrow's requirements, in  which your partners in the peace course will feel reassured and  confident of the usefulness and permanency of cooperating with  you. This has nothing to do with a new language we find  ourselves speaking but with a new spirit that is reflected in  behavior on every level.    You have achieved peace with Egypt, the biggest country in  our Arab world. You are today trying to achieve peace with the  Palestinian people, whose cause it is, a people at the center of  the conflict. I do not doubt for a single moment your mature  awareness of a self-evident truth that says that peace in our  region cannot become firmly established and guaranteed without  completing its interconnected links so as to see it also  achieved with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan in the clearest terms  and fairest contexts.    While we feel increasingly confident when we hear about  serious actions to resume the efforts to achieve peace with our  remaining brothers, we do not hide from you our fears for  everything that has been achieved if it is not completed soon  with its other Arab links.    It has probably become clear to you and to the whole world  that the essence and dimensions of the peace with the  neighboring countries are not confined to the geographic scale  of the regional map and its borders but are much deeper, because  it should be a peace with the great nation, from the Ocean to  the Gulf. Fears will remain and an inadequate, if not  nonexistent, sense of security will remain if we do not put this  at the center of our attention and efforts.    On such a day, I address our Palestinian people. Among them  there is not one family that has not lost a martyr recently to  the convoys of martyrs who have fallen since the start of the  conflict and throughout every chapter and whose precious  sacrifices have built the bridge to the peace station. The  children of the intifadah and their sacrifices [applause] have  ripened this historic moment. We tell our vibrant, alert, and  very cultured people that we feel your pulse, share your fears,  and understand your observations on the formulas we have reached  between Oslo and this day. But with you we see an opportunity  for a new coming together to wage a new experiment. How great  it is to start with difficulty on the ground and how much more  miserable it is to continue to easily adopt verbal slogans and  remain confined by their restrictions. We will meet on the same  ground to share in the sweetness and bitterness of our new life,  to struggle to rebuild the society and homeland that has been  exhausted by the long and bitter war and that has planted many  illnesses in its heart. We will struggle together for the dream  that will never leave us as long as we live, the dream of  freedom and independence, the dream of the beautiful life for  our children and grandchildren, the dream of the hopes and  assuredness on the soil of our homeland, the dream of enjoying  dignity under our sun and skies, the dream of the creative  contribution to the building of our region and the consolidation  of the pillars of its stability, and the dream of the creative  cultural link with our Arab and Islamic nation and with the  whole world, without wars and their calamitous requirements.    Yesterday when Nelson Mandela [applause] dropped his voting  card in the ballot box we heard him say: I feel a dream has  come true. Today we say we feel that the march toward our hopes  has effectively begun. Still at the beginning of the road, we  extend an intimate and loving call to our brothers who either  reject, have reservations about, or have fears regarding our  steps: Come to the house so that we can build it together,  close the windows of evil together, make the best of the  opportunity, and besiege the chances of danger with all our  force.    We sincerely call for a national mobilization where efforts  and capabilities are integrated to achieve our present and  future missions on democratic bases and with a view toward  building modern institutions that will ensure for our  pluralistic society the best factors of progress and development  and boost our national aspirations, only the first steps of  which we have achieved, with all the factors that will allow  them to be realized. Let us work together for the sake of  repatriation, for Jerusalem [applause], on which we are about to  enter negotiations, and for fulfilling the requirements and  tasks of the final stage of the peace process in all its aspects.    The homeland we are hoping for is one for all the  Palestinians. Let us build it on its soil, not on impossible  slogans that only distance us from it.    On this day we address the new world, which is being shaped  in a new climate and under new considerations, saying that the  opening of the file of peace in the Middle East was the most  courageous step toward building a new international order, or  let us say new international life, on the rubble of the Cold War  and its scores of destructive regional and civil wars.    The Middle East, which burdened the conscience of the world  for half a century, troubling international interests and  placing them at the mercy of instability, deserves further  international efforts to entrench its new ambitious image. Any  serious and effective contribution to ensure the stability and  growth of this part of the world is, in essence, a vital  contribution to the stability of everybody's interests in their  every form and content.    Finally, we extend our appreciation to Warren Christopher  [applause], who is joining us in celebrating these historic  moments, and it pleases us to convey through him our greetings  to the American people, the U.S. Administration, and President  Clinton, who continued to work to achieve peace in our region.    I also greet Mr. Kozyrev [applause]. We are pleased to  convey through him our greetings to the people and Government of  Russia and to President Boris Yeltsin.    It is perhaps also useful to refer with appreciation and  loyalty to the Government of Norway and to remember late Foreign  Minister Johan Holst and his creative efforts [applause].    We do not forget the positions and initiatives of every  nation, each working as much as it could to support and sponsor  the peace process. I particularly refer to our fraternal Arab  Maghreb countries, which played a major and creative role in  embodying the Palestinian character and its political reality,  and also to our brothers in the Arabian Gulf countries, who,  from the beginning, joined us in the peace process, on both the  bilateral and multilateral tracks. I call on them today to  translate the slogan of frankness and reconciliation into action  on the ground [applause].    I also salute our brothers in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon,  who  are moving with us along the road of peace with great confidence  and the fraternal cohesion that embodies the nation's interests  and aspirations.    As we prepare to embark on the return trip to the homeland,  we do not forget green Tunisia, its hospitable people, and its  president, who protectively embraced us in the hardest of times  and who honorably and fraternally supported us [applause].    Mr. President, this is an additionally good act by you on  your birthday. We congratulate you [applause]. We do not only  say thank you; we will engrave this act in our hearts and will  plant it on the boundaries of our homeland so that the  generations will remember your position and noble work. Peace  be upon you. [applause]</p>

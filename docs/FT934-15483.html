			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: France wants Gatt to leave farm issues FRANCE believes Gatt negotiators should aim to reach an interim trade accord this year, leaving difficult issues such as agriculture and audiovisual broadcasting to be resolved later, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said yesterday. The call flies in the face of conviction among Gatt negotiators from the European Community, the US, and farm exporting countries that exclusion of farm trade, and a failure to meet the December 15 deadline for completion of the talks, would trigger a collapse of the Uruguay Round into trade war.

Only four bothered to reply, and none in clear terms. According to one Washington-based trade strategist, a good segment of the US trade community is so frustrated with the problems of the agriculture negotiations that it would like to take farm trade off the table: 'But we've gone over the waterfall in a barrel,' he said: 'There is no backing up.

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION / MITCH POLIN;  </P> <P> ON THIS POINT, CLAREMONT GOT A BIT DEFENSIVE  </P> <P> The Claremont-Mudd-Scripps football team accomplished a scoring rarity in its  Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game against Whittier  on Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Stags scored a defensive extra point. Make that two points.  </P> <P> Under a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule that took effect last season, a  play is considered live on extra-point attempts, not dead once the attempt  fails, as it was previously.  </P> <P> That means a defense can block a point-after attempt or intercept a two-point  conversion pass and return it the length of the field for two points.  </P> <P> Grayle Howlett, publicity director for the SCIAC and California Collegiate  Athletic Assn., said that it has not occurred often since the rule has been in  place. In fact, it had never happened before in an SCIAC game.  </P> <P> But it happened in Claremont's game against Whittier, after Whittier drove for  a touchdown on its first possession of the second half, cutting its deficit to  21-13.  </P> <P> On the conversion attempt, Claremont defensive back Mike McCorkle blocked the  kick and the ball bounced to teammate Jon Bagatelos, who took it 75 yards for  the score and a 23-13 lead.  </P> <P> It was a first for Claremont, which had a near miss when it scored in the same  fashion in a game against Trinity of Texas last season, only to have the play  called back because of a penalty.  </P> <P> The play did little to faze Whittier. The Poets rallied to score two more  touchdowns for a 27-23 win. It was the first victory of the season for Whittier  (1-2). Claremont fell to 0-3.  </P> <P> The season didn't get off to the best start for either the Cal State Northridge  or Occidental football teams but things have looked considerably better lately.  </P> <P> After dropping its first two games to NCAA Division I teams, 28-9 to Cal State  Long Beach and 27-20 to Cal State Fullerton, Northridge has rebounded for three  consecutive comeback victories against Division II squads.  </P> <P> The Matadors defeated Sonoma State, 15-10, Central State of Oklahoma, 31-28,  and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 13-10. The prospect also appears good for another  victory Saturday when Northridge plays host to struggling Cal Lutheran (1-3).  </P> <P> Occidental also opened its season with two losses, 16-14 to Menlo and 14-0 to  Azusa Pacific.  </P> <P> Since then, the Tigers picked up a win off the field when Azusa Pacific  forfeited the game because it used an ineligible player.  </P> <P> On the field, Occidental (3-1) has won its last two games by scores of 24-14  over Pomona-Pitzer and 24-12 over La Verne. The Tigers have a bye Saturday but  face a difficult test against the University of San Diego (4-0) on Oct. 14.  </P> <P> With less than a month remaining in the season, the Cal State Dominguez Hills  women's soccer team appears to be well on its way toward its first NCAA  Division II playoff berth.  </P> <P> The Toros (11-1), ranked No. 2 in Division II, certainly took a big step in the  right direction with a 2-1 victory over Cal State Hayward on Saturday.  </P> <P> It was a significant win considering that Hayward was ranked No. 3 and has been  one of the top teams in the West in Division II in recent years. The Toros also  defeated Sonoma State, another top-ranked team from the West, on Sept. 15.  </P> <P> That appears to put the Toros in a solid position to reach the four-team  Division II playoffs in November. Barry University of Florida is the top-ranked  team in Division II.  </P> <P> Two players from Dominguez Hills have also put themselves in good position for  All-American honors.  </P> <P> Leading the way on offense has been senior forward Kristi White, who has 11  goals and 10 assists. That's more points than some teams have scored this  season.  </P> <P> White is the school's all-time leader in points with 79 and assists with 25 and  also has 27 goals, which leaves her two short of the record held by Michele  Salas.  </P> <P> Perhaps even more impressive has been the play of goalkeeper Chris Pezzulo, a  junior transfer from El Camino College. Pezzulo has an 0.22 goals-against  average with nine shutouts. She has already tied the school record for most  shutouts in a season that was established by Sandra Powers in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> After winning its first 10 games, including three games over NCAA Division I  opponents, the Cal State Bakersfield men's soccer team finally had its first  setback in a 2-0 loss to Cal State Sacramento last Saturday in Sacramento. Even  so, the Roadrunners are ranked No. 2 -- their highest ranking ever -- in the  latest Division II poll and No. 1 in the West Region. Bakersfield should get a  strong challenge in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. race from  defending champion Cal State Northridge -- a Division II finalist last season.  </P> <P> For the second week in a row, UC Riverside (12-3) has been ranked No. 1 in NCAA  Division II women's volleyball. Other CCAA teams listed in the top 20 are Cal  State Northridge at No. 4, Cal State Bakersfield at No. 13, Chapman at No. 16  and Cal Poly Pomona at No. 17. . . . Defending champion Point Loma Nazarene  will be among the favorites in both the men's and women's divisions at the  Golden State Athletic Conference cross-country championships Oct. 14 at Morley  Field in San Diego. Westmont and Azusa Pacific are also among the top teams in  the women's division.  </P> <P> The Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's soccer team is off to one of its best starts  with an 8-0-1 record and is ranked No. 16 in the latest NCAA Division III poll.  The Stags have been led by senior goalkeeper Steve Goodson, who began the week  with seven consecutive shutouts and 28 in his career. . . . Cal State San  Bernardino will hold a free soccer clinic for boys and girls in high school and  younger at noon Oct. 22 on the school's soccer field. Women's coach Ralph  Perez, who is also an assistant with the U.S. national team, and men's coach  Carlos Juarez will be instructors.  </P> <P> The Cal State San Bernardino men's soccer team, trying to stay in position for  an NCAA Division III playoff berth with a 6-3 record, split its matches against  two of the top teams in the West Region in Division III last week. The  sixth-ranked Coyotes defeated Macalester of St. Paul, Minn., 2-1, and lost to  Colorado College, 5-1, at the Colorado College tournament in Colorado Springs.  </P></p>

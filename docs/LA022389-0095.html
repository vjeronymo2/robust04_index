			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING TOO EXPENSIVE  </P> <P> Denise Hamilton's Feb. 9 article, "Easing the Squeeze," really hit home.  </P> <P> Our family moved to California from Albuquerque, N.M., 10 years ago. Like the  others in your article, my father received a job offer he couldn't refuse.  </P> <P> My parents sold their home, which was middle-of-the-road but comfortable, to  move to California -- and not be able to afford a shack. My sister followed.  Now our neighbors and friends are selling and moving to Oregon.  </P> <P> My sister can't raise a family of five in her three-bedroom home and can't  afford to move up. So she's moving away. I don't have two incomes to support a  house, so I'm renting mine out and moving away also.  </P> <P> My parents are retiring here by themselves, with the family and neighborhood  moving away. Is Ventura doomed to become a retirement community?  </P> <P> RICK HOWIE  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

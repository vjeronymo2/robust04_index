			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Telecom NZ advances 20% TELECOM New Zealand, the former state-owned utility privatised last year, has announced a 20.6 per cent advance in net profits for the first nine months. Net profits for the nine months to December rose to NZDollars 292.8m (USDollars 159m) from NZDollars 242.8m a year earlier. This puts Telecom NZ on track to meet earnings of NZDollars 401m for the full year. Profits before tax rose NZDollars 17.6m to NZDollars 413m. There were no extraordinary items, but minority interests produced a bottom line of NZDollars 290m, up 22 per cent on the same period of last year. Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman, said it was a pleasing result given the tough economic conditions and increasing competition. Cost-savings from increased efficiencies in all areas of Telecom NZ's operations contributed to the result, which matched budget expectations. Strongest growth in the nine months was from directories and cellular services, while revenue from product sales and leased services grew strongly in the quarter. Operating revenue for the nine months rose 5.7 per cent to NZDollars 1.9bn. Current assets fell 27.4 per cent to NZDollars 746m, and current liabilities fell 27.9 per cent to NZDollars 807m. Total assets fell 2.5 per cent to NZDollars 4.6bn. Total shareholders funds rose 5.1 per cent to NZDollars 2.7bn. The results announcement follows this week's resignation of Mr Peter Troughton, managing director, half-way through his five-year contract with the company. His departure comes amid reports that Telecom NZ's US owners, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, which control 56 per cent of the company, were unhappy with the way he was handling competition with Clear Communications, Telecom NZ's main rival, in a bitter price-cutting war.</p>

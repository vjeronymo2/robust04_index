			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> URBAN ENERGY FROM STERN/BERG  </P> <P> The Mike Stern/Bob Berg Quartet's Thursday sets at Santa Monica's At My Place  had all the Sturm und Drang of a 42nd Street subway station at rush hour. The  New York-based group showcased a brand of improvisational music that pulsated  with restless urban energy.  </P> <P> Stern, a veteran sideman with groups ranging from Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears to  Miles Davis, is a state-of-the-art contemporary guitarist. His masterfully  executed solos -- solidly based on a Jimi Hendrix/John McLaughlin foundation --  pushed aside the barriers between styles.  </P> <P> At times, he moved very close to what might be described as heavy-metal jazz;  at other times his rich harmonies recalled an intensely energized Jim Hall.  </P> <P> Berg's tenor saxophone playing was equally fervent -- at times too much so. A  powerful technician, he seemed determined to attack every solo with his  complete arsenal of musical weaponry. The resulting series of improvisations  took the same basic arc -- from opening musical pleasantries to climactic peaks  filled with wild-eyed flurries of notes. Impressive, but ultimately too  repetitive.  </P> <P> Interestingly, for a group in which half the personnel were the leaders, the  evening's most powerful moments were provided by drummer Dennis Charles. His  solo on the concluding number (which, like many of the others, was  unidentified) made one suspect that there were one or two extra percussionists  hiding behind the stage.  </P> <P> Bassist Lincoln Goines, a solid rhythm player, was the rock on which the other  group members built their soloistic impromptus.

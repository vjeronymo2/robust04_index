			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Center's Heated EU Fight Did </F> Not Take Place"]    [Excerpts] Despite the speculations beforehand, European  Union [EU] did not become the major battle issue at the meeting  of the Center Party delegation in Tornio yesterday. The question  was touched upon just briefly, at least during the first day of  the meeting.    There was even less debate about former party leader Paavo  Vayrynen's recent proposal that the EU membership should be  postponed for a few years.    Vayrynen himself had earlier promised to participate in the  debate only if he was asked. No one put any questions to him. A  few speakers made a few snide remarks about Vayrynen, but he did  not allow himself to be provoked.    At yesterday's news conference Prime Minister Esko Aho, the  party chairman, explained the absence of a passionate EU debate  by the fact that EU is not an issue that divides the party, that  regardless of their position on the EU the members regard the  Center Party as the best channel for influence.  <H5>  Resigned Opponents </H5>   Yesterday's debate gave an indication that the categorical  EU  opposition in fact is rather weak within the party. A large  number of those who have opposed joining the EU have resigned  themselves to it and are more intent on making the best of the  situation, on minimizing the damage from a membership. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Draft Program Changed </H5>   If the EU debate in the delegation was unusually tame, it  was  said to have been all the more lively at the party executive  committee on Friday [22 April] and yesterday morning, when a  draft program, to be approved by the party congress in Jyvaskyla  in July, was discussed.    In a previous draft it was stated that "Finland supports the  development a European union, which expands, opens up and  gradually deepens and functions according to the subsidiarity  principle."    But at the discussion by the party executive committee the  expression "European union" was eliminated and replaced by  "European cooperation." This was in order for the program to  apply regardless of whether Finland becomes an EU member or  whether one is satisfied with the EEA [European Economic Area]  solution, explained activity leader Seppo Niemela, who has  headed the program work.

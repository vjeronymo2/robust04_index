			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: DREXLER WILL EARN $8 MILLION IN 1995-96 SEASON  </P> <P> The Portland Trail Blazers have given guard Clyde Drexler an extension on his  contract that he said will pay him more than $8 million for the 1995-96 season  -- believed to be the highest single-season salary for an athlete in a team  sport.  </P> <P> Drexler, 28, signed the agreement Friday in Honolulu, where the Trail Blazers  played an exhibition game against the Lakers Friday night.  </P> <P> "It's a fair contract," Drexler said. "I'm happy about it."  </P> <P> Drexler is the Trail Blazers' all-time leading scorer and a third-team NBA  all-star last season. He will earn about $1.2 million this season.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers promised Drexler they would boost his pay a year ago. Because  of NBA salary cap restrictions, his salary couldn't be increased immediately,  so Blazer officials negotiated a one-year extension with a balloon payment.  </P></p>

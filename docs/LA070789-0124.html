			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A headline in Thursday's editions incorrectly said the Dalai Lama addressed  "followers" at a meeting. In fact, most of those present were not followers of  the Dalai Lama, but were Buddhists of many sects and national origins. The  Dalai Lama has spiritual authority over Tibetan Buddhists but not over other  Buddhists.  </P></p>

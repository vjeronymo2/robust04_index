			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> REBATES FOR AUTO DEALERS  </P> <P> The city's auto dealers will be eligible for sales tax rebates under an  ordinance tentatively approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> Under the measure, the city's Housing and Development Department must first  establish a redevelopment project in order to legally return tax money to  dealers within the project boundaries.  </P> <P> Dealers in the redevelopment project area who wish to build or expand their  showrooms could apply for a rebate equaling up to 50% of the sales tax  generated by the new facilities. The rebates could continue up to 10 years from  the date of the construction.  </P> <P> The ordinance was passed in an effort to keep the city's 16 auto dealers from  leaving for auto malls in neighboring areas. Pasadena's dealerships provide the  city $3 million a year in sales taxes.  </P></p>

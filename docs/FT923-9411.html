			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / TUC plans to change priorities SENIOR trade unionists are proposing that the Trades Union Congress concentrate on just six priorities - a third of the current total - in a move they will present as a radical rethink of the TUC's role. The proposals, made in a confidential document approved by the TUC's ruling general council, have been formulated as a growing number of affiliated unions are questioning the organisation's effectiveness following a fourth consecutive Conservative general election victory. The AEEU engineering and electrical union has called for a 'radical reassessment' of the TUC in a motion submitted for the annual congress in September. The TGWU general workers is also calling for a refocusing of the organisation's role. Some union leaders have also questioned the TUC's leadership. The TUC document, due to be submitted to the September congress, follows a 20 per cent reduction in staff, implemented to avert financial deficits. It acknowledges that a 'more sharply focused programme of work' is needed. The TUC's priority tasks will be a campaign for full employment, promotion of an employee's charter, lobbying on trade union legislation, Europe, developing services on education, health and safety and equal rights and 'planning the inter-union future'. On the last area, the general council is suggesting that a voluntary code be reached between unions following the expected legislation to undermine Bridlington rules covering membership poaching. Although the document does not go into details on such a code, it is likely that the TUC will propose that unions do not actively recruit each other's members, even though the legislation would make it virtually impossible for the congress to forbid poaching. Current TUC policy is to concentrate on 17 priority areas. Those include the development of free trade unions in central and eastern Europe, 'quality in public services', joint action on training and union recruitment. The document says the reduction cut in priorities provides a basis for allocating the TUC's more limited resources and for a concentrated public relations effort around proposed campaigns.</p>

A leader of a southern city sighed with regret because  he had not known about the corporation earlier. At a recent  meeting to exchange experience in points selected for  experiments on comprehensive reforms in the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation, convened by the State Commission for  Restructuring Economy, a representative expressed his feelings  as follows: "A small match (meaning the case of the relocation  of a match factory) has lit up the whole space around."    We heartily rejoice at such strong repercussions of the  reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  because, in the course of making reports about the corporation,  we indeed had the feeling of a soft breeze blowing toward us.  However, because the enthusiasm to learn from the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation is intensifying, we are worried  that what is learned may be different from what is expected and  that things which should not be stressed, may be stressed.    Our desire and responsibility is to help our readers  correctly understand and grasp this typical example.    The focus of the reforms carried out by the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation is not to enliven the  enterprises but to enliven the assets. The corporation has  pushed reforms a big step forward and such reforms mark the  raising of the curtain of a new stage in the reforms of  enterprises.    "If I were the boss, what I should consider at present would  be how to enliven all the assets instead of how to save each  individual enterprise," said Zhou Dali, deputy director of the  State Commission for Restructuring Economy Distribution  Department, at an informal discussion meeting. "How should we  change the situation of three one-thirds in state enterprises?  If we concentrate our efforts on saving each individual  enterprise, all enterprises will be half dead. Assets must be  current assets. This is an essential demand of the market  economy. Some enterprises must survive while others must perish  and the disposal of resources should be optimized in the course  of readjusting the structure and layout. Only by enlivening  state assets will it be possible to enliven the overall  situation."    The shift of the focus from enlivening enterprises to  enlivening assets is a new change and a new demand of reform of  the economic structure. It is also something that makes the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation so prominent. Of  course, this does not mean enlivening enterprises is  unimportant. Enlivening enterprises is the foundation. How can  we enliven assets without enlivening enterprises? However,  enlivening assets is the goal. To attain this goal, some  enterprises which should survive should be allowed to live on  happily, while other enterprises which should perish should be  allowed to die a "natural and unrestrained death [xiao sa si yi  hui 3469 3155 2984 0001 2585]."    "Enlivening assets is different from enlivening  enterprises,"  said Li Yuan, director of the State Commission of Restructuring  Economy Distribution Department. "First of all, in enlivening  enterprises, impetus is often required only once. Such impetus  can be a policy, funds, or technology and if it can last three  to five years, it will be good enough. However, the enlivening  of assets needs a long-term effective mechanism and the  formation of such a mechanism is based on the construction of  systems. Second, the enlivening of assets needs comprehensive  reforms. In the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation for example, the solutions to the two  major difficult problems regarding the sources of funds and the  placement of surplus personnel must involve the reforms of  various systems, such as the land use system, the personnel and  labor system, the system for training staff members and workers,  and the social security system. Third, since the reforms are  comprehensive, a new role is needed. The person who plays this  role should undertake responsibility for state assets and should  be able to manage state assets with a free hand, in accordance  with the laws of the market economy, in a bid to preserve their  value. However, such a new role should be established through  reforming the enterprise property rights system."    Bai Jinrong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal  Committee for Restructuring Economy said: "The existing  enterprise systems cannot meet the demands of the market economy  on enterprises--to become competitive main bodies which raise  funds on their own, carry out construction and operation on  their own, and assume sole responsibility for their profits and  losses. Nor can they meet the needs of large-scale socialized  production--assets to float and disposal of resources to be  optimized. In carrying out reforms of enterprises in the past,  we always focused our attention on the relationships of  production. However, the universal significance of the reforms  carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  lies in the new path it has explored for enlivening the state  economy--the organic integration, through comprehensive reforms,  of the readjustment of the production setup, the enterprise  organizational setup, the layout of industries, the  transformation of the old urban areas, and the development of  the land resources with the reform of the enterprise property  rights system, with the goal of establishing a modern enterprise  system to realize the unity of the readjustment of the  production relationships with the development of the productive  forces. That is, the unity of reform and development, as we  usually put it."    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation shifted from  the management of production and enterprises to the operation  and management of state assets. Ever since then, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation has lost its original meaning  and like "Yiqing" and "Fazhan," has become a code name for large  enterprise groups with assets of several billion yuan.    If you agree with the above views, do you accept the  following judgment? The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Committee put forward the establishment of a modern enterprise  system and this enabled the reforms of enterprises in our  country to enter a new stage. With the intensive work carried  out for some time, the curtain of this new stage has been raised  and the opera has started.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has been  able to carry out operational activities to enliven state assets  thanks to the reform of the enterprise property rights system.  Through authorized management of state assets, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation has acquired the status of  the representative of the proprietor of assets and, therefore,  can handle affairs which a single production enterprise could  not handle and which government departments should not  handle.    Although there are different views on the comprehensive  reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, we  hold that the sequence of ideas is very clear: The point of  integration of deepening reforms in enterprises with the  development of the productive forces is to enliven assets; in  the market economy structure, enterprise actions should be  dominant ones in enlivening assets; and we must reform the  existing enterprise system, otherwise the property rights  relationship will not be clear and enterprises will find it  difficult to fulfill this task.    Cui Zhian, chairman of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation board of directors, recalled the formulation of the  train of thought on reforms, saying: "Our new exploration of  reform began in 1991 and the train of thought was really  formulated after Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks in the south  in 1992. The remarks about being beneficial to promoting the  productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the comprehensive  national strength of our socialist country, and beneficial to  enhancing the living standards of the people have enlightened us  a great deal and have become the ideological weapon for us to  deepen reform. We conducted investigations and made analyses of  our own position and discovered that we were in a very difficult  situation. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  mainly produced daily necessities and any other enterprise could  also do that. Besides, preferential policies were implemented  for joint ventures, township and town enterprises, and open  areas, but we were under the impact of contraband. We had no  strong points at all. What was the way out? We summed up the  experience of reforms carried out in some of our enterprises and  our train of thought became clearer. In the past, the  consumption rate of the No. 3 Glass Plant was great and its  products were of lower grade. After it was moved to Daxing  County and became a joint venture, it introduced advanced  technology and produced high-grade glass products. The price  for each tonne of glass products rose from 1,200 yuan to 8,000  yuan. Then came the lighting device plant which had been a  loss-making plant for many years. After it used the building of  a branch plant to do business, it was able to give jobs to over  100 surplus personnel and to bring in an additional income of 3  million yuan. It was most profitable to develop tertiary  industry in prosperous areas and everybody was able to see that.  The idea of relocating secondary industry enterprises and  developing tertiary industry enterprises, and of moving  production factors out of the Fourth Ring Road to develop  secondary industry at a high level was put forward on this basis.    "At present, state enterprises commonly face three  difficulties: Funds are in short supply, personnel are  excessive, and assets cannot be enlivened," said Cui Zhian.  "Viewed from the reality of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, the last of the three difficulties was the crux and  once this knot was untied, the other difficulties could be  overcome. Once the assets were enlivened, there would be money  and more jobs could be provided for the surplus personnel. How  could this knot be untied? We must have the right to operate  assets. To whom should the rights to operate assets be given?  Should they be given to a certain production enterprise? Given  the difficult situation the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation was in, it would not make things any better no  matter which production enterprise was given the right to  operate assets. Should such rights be given to government  departments? But government departments cannot take part in  operational activities. What should we do then? The only thing  for us to do was to change ourselves and shoulder the task."    "Unclear property rights relationships are the root cause of  the poor operation of state enterprises," said Li Yuan. "To  solve this problem, the idea of separating the two rights, that  is, separating ownership rights from the rights of operation,  was once put forward in carrying out reforms in the past. This  played a great role in ensuring the right to make decisions on  the operation of enterprises. However, since the state was the  proprietor and the enterprises were operators, it was still  difficult to separate the government from enterprises. The crux  of the problem was to find an appropriate position for the  proprietor in enterprises. Through authorized rights to operate  state assets, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  acquired the status as the representative of the proprietor.  This shows that separating government from assets is an  important condition for separating government from enterprises."    To enliven assets, we must establish a property rights main  body. The ultimate ownership of state assets belongs to the  state and enterprises only have legal person property rights.  Who then should exercise ownership of assets on behalf of the  state and undertake the responsibility of preserving and  increasing the value of such assets? The Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation has provided us with a train of thought.    The reforms by the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation have both universal and special significance. The  reforms by the corporation have been carried out on the basis of  its own reality. In learning from the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation, we should also proceed from our  respective realities.    There are two direct reasons for the success in the reforms  of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation: The right to  operate state assets and the right to develop land resources.  However, these two cannot be equated with the reform of the  property rights system and the construction of the modern  enterprise system.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has found its  own position in reform. It has changed from an organization for  the management of a trade into a company of an enterprise nature  for the operation of state assets. "Can we also do the same?"  This is perhaps the most directly associated thought in some  administrative departments.    Speaking about this question, Li Yuan said, "Where this new  role can be played should be based on the characteristics of the  respective specific situations and productive forces. In a big  city like Beijing, for example, if such a role is played at a  level higher than the original specialized administrative  department, the range of administration will be too wide. In a  small city, it is perhaps more appropriate for one or two  companies to play this role. Another idea is for the role to be  played by a single production enterprise but this has to be  determined by the scale and capacity of that enterprise. In the  Beijing light industry system, if the role is played by a  certain production enterprise, that enterprise can be enlivened.  However, the role of enlivening state assets of the entire  system will be greatly reduced."    "What is more important," stressed Li Yuan, "is to select  the  player of this `new role.' We must take into consideration its  quality and ability, including its sense of reform, its  comprehensive ability, and its operational capacity. Before it  was authorized to operate state assets, the leadership of the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation had already made  numerous attempts at reform. Under difficult conditions, it  constantly optimized the disposal of the production factors and  achieved initial results and valuable experience. Therefore, if  we want to follow its example we should act in the same way and  learn from them properly."    Whenever comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation talk about the reforms they carried out, they never  forget the support of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and  Municipal Government and the guidance from the State Commission  for Restructuring Economy. In fact, the reforms in the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation have been carried out ahead  of time. It is precisely because of this that some practices are  not completely in keeping with certain existing rules,  regulations, and policies. The Beijing CPC Municipal CPC  Committee and Municipal Government, from the angle of carrying  out experiments boldly, have given special treatment to the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The right to  comprehensively develop real estate within the system, for  example, has been granted specially.    According to a comrade from the Beijing Municipal Committee  for Restructuring Economy, land is a state asset. The use of  land has to be compensated and has a time limit. The  responsibility for land management is undertaken by special  government departments and specific work is carried out by local  governments. Taxes and fees collected are used for urban  construction. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  has changed the purpose in using land. According to regulations,  the land should be taken back, new applications should be  submitted for examination and approval, and taxes and fees  concerned should be paid. In this respect, there is no  exception for the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  However, the municipal government has adopted some relatively  lax policies and flexible practices in the relocation of  enterprises. For example, the amount of money to be handed over  to the state for the sale of land can be handed over by  installments and part of the money can be returned to the  enterprises as reinvestment by the state. In redeveloping the  land originally occupied by the Beijing Match Plant, the land  was converted into 47 million state shares in the Hongyun  Company. At present, the value of this part of the state assets  has increased by 200 percent. In this way, the reforms of the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation acquired the  necessary means and funds for the start. Therefore, in this  sense, it can be said that the attempt to reform the system of  using land has benefited the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation and the credit should go to the municipal  government. This is precisely a concrete action of "supporting  reform with reform" put forward by the Beijing Municipality.    Li Yuan holds that the reform of the land use system  centering round the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  carried out by the Beijing Municipality can meet the needs of  the market economy and has not changed the nature whereby land  belongs to the state. Compared with various practices of using  land to attract foreign capital in some localities and giving  preferential treatment to foreign businessmen and allowing them  to have more profits, the method adopted by the Beijing  Municipality is more normal. The merit of this practice is that  it has demonstrated the value of land assets and has prevented  the loss of land assets. However, the land use system is an  important state system and we should safeguard its solemnity and  authority. Reforms must be carried out in an orderly way, step  by step, and under the guidance of the government departments  concerned.    We should not just focus our attention on land in optimizing  the disposal of resources but should also pay attention to  management, technology, equipment, qualified personnel, and the  ways of combining various production factors. In Beijing,  because differential land rent exists, land resources are very  important. This may not be so in other localities. The reforms  of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have been  carried out on the basis of its reality. In learning from the  corporation, we should also proceed from our respective  realities.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Hungary raises interest rates, devalues forint HUNGARY yesterday devalued the forint by 3 per cent and announced a 3 per cent rise in a key interest rate. The Hungarian currency is linked to a basket divided equally between the dollar and the Ecu, and National Bank of Hungary passed off the devaluation as a 'technical step' in response to the dollar's rise against European currencies. This devaluation follows a 1.9 per cent devaluation in June, adding to speculation that the Hungarian authorities' exchange rate policy is softening. Pressure for a fundamental shift in policy has been growing as Hungarian exports have fallen and the external trade balance deteriorated. Exports in the first four months were down 27.2 per cent compared with a year earlier, depressed by recession in Hungary's main markets of Germany and Austria. The current account deficit amounted to Dollars 423m for the first two months, leading some analysts to estimate that the shortfall for the year could be as high as Dollars 2bn, about 8 per cent of gross domestic product. The NBH is financing the deficit with a record spree on international capital markets. Yesterday the central bank announced two more bond issues - a five-year Y50bn (Dollars 460m) bond in Tokyo and a Pounds 100m (Dollars 66m) bond in London. These latest issues take the NBH's borrowings for the year so far to Dollars 2.7bn. Despite the deterioration in Hungary's external balance, recent bond issues have sold relatively well and rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's said yesterday it had reaffirmed the NBH's BB plus rating. The Hungarian authorities yesterday sought to offset the inflationary impact of the devaluation with a 3 per cent rise in the central bank's open market security repurchase rates. Raising interest rates should ease the government's difficulties in financing its large budget deficit at a time when savings are dropping. The conservative government's proposal to increase value added tax on food and other basic items survived a parliamentary vote on Wednesday with a majority of 13 votes. Despite the anticipated revenues from VAT, this week's emergency budget still leaves Hungary needing to finance a public-sector deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP this year. An International Monetary Fund delegation is in Budapest and is expected to respond to the latest economic moves today.</p>

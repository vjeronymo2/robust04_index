			<p>BFN     [Text] Taegu, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Kim Sang-hyon of the  opposition Democratic Party, said here on Tuesday Kim Tae-chung,  chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, will return to  active politics if there is a nationwide support for him. "If  there is nationwide support for him and if need be, Chairman Kim  should return to active politics and he himself will," he said.    Kim Sang-hyon was one of Kim Tae-chung's closest confidants  for many years once in the past.    In a special lecture at a political science and  international  relations class of Kyongbuk National University, Kim added,  however, that since Chairman Kim commands outstanding political  senses, he won't return to politics unless there is a widespread  support for him or there are conditions warranting his return to  politics.    Kim Tae-chung himself said time and again that he had  retired  from politics for good and he would never come back to  politicking.</p>

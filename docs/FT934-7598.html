			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Farmers protest at rice imports A THAI vessel carrying a shipment of Japan's first import of foreign-grown rice since 1984 into Yokohama port was met by boatloads of Japanese farmers yesterday, protesting against emergency imports to cover the country's severe shortage, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Japan plans to bring in 1.1m tonnes (10 per cent of its domestic consumption) of rice from Thailand, China and the US, as it faces the worst rice crop in post-war history. Some analysts forecast a need for extra imports, as the shortage may be up to 2m tonnes. The emergency shipment arrived as Japan's rice import ban is debated in the Gatt multilateral trade talks in Geneva. The Japanese officially deny changing stance over opening the rice market on the one hand, and trying to work out a compromise over tariffs on the other. Mr Akio Kyoya, vice-minister of agriculture, yesterday denied reports that Japan and the US had reached a compromise agreement in Geneva. However, in October, US trade officials revealed that the two countries were negotiating terms to include a six-year moratorium on rice imports, during which a minimum access level of 3-5 per cent of Japan's domestic rice consumption will be imported.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Young and old take up 'Bolshevik' shares offer AS the Congress of Peoples Deputies yesterday decided the fate of Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, ordinary Russians gave a cautious show of support for his market reforms at the country's first share auction. Displaying a mixture of curiosity, excitement and caution, young and old queued to apply to swap their privatisation vouchers for shares in Bolshevik, a state-owned enterprise which produces 250 tonnes a day of some of the capital's sweetest cakes and biscuits. 'I don't agree with those who curse the government for distributing vouchers free of charge to every Russian citizen. We have nothing to lose, we can only hope that something positive will come out of them,' said Mr Viktor Vogman, an engineer. Founded by the French in 1856 before it was nationalised by the Bolsheviks, the enterprise is returning to private hands as part of the government's privatisation programme, which involves 6,000 enterprises going under the hammer over the next year. Mr Gleb Smirnov, a 79-year-old pensioner, said the country's leaders 'should be ashamed of dragging the country into this mess' but said he would look into the Bolshevik share offering because he lived next to the factory. 'We see the queues there, they must be doing something right,' said his companion, Ms Clavdia Sokolova. Handing in her form to buy as many shares as she could, she said: 'I hope the enterprise makes money but I don't need anything for myself. I just had to get rid of this voucher: it was my civic duty.' Mr Igor Mitvol, one of Russia's new entrepreneurs, said he was filling out a form to buy 150 vouchers' worth of shares 'just to see what happens'. To sweeten the deal for a suspicious workforce, the company has arranged to buy 51 per cent of the shares for its employees: another five per cent is being given to them free of charge by the state. The remaining 44 per cent, or 19,000 shares, are being offered to the general public (including Bolshevik workers with an appetite for more) in the auction which closes on December 24. The real fear of management, led by general director Oleg Shimanov, is that they could lose control. For this reason, no more than five per cent of the shares can go to a single bidder, even though there is nothing to stop workers and other shareholders from reselling their shares in a secondary market to start in January.</p>

This project  investment company will set up a joint venture with a major  European integrated circuit company to engage in the manufacture  of chips and the finishing process for grad-scale integrated  circuits in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is estimated that the  entire production scale will entail a total investment of over  $1 billion (about 7.7 billion Hong Kong dollars).    Wang Dianpu, director of the Shenzhen Saige [6357 2706]  Group, a major shareholder in the Chinese investment company,  indicated when attending a meeting marking the establishment of  the project's Chinese investment company in Shenzhen yesterday,  that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit  Project is a national-level high-tech project which was approved  by the State Planning Commission in July 1991 and which has the  backing of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and relevant leaders of  the State Council. After more than two years' preparation, the  project's Chinese investment company, namely Shenzhen Saige  High-Tech Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, was finally  set up in Shenzhen with a registered capital of 280 million  yuan. The company has the following five shareholders: The  Shenzhen Saige Group as the assets trustee for the Shenzhen  Government (with a 62.2-percent shareholders' rights); the  Shenzhen New Industry Investment Company Incorporated (with 7.1  percent shareholders' rights); the Shenzhen Urban Construction  Group (with a 12.5-percent shareholders' right); the Shenzhen  Zhongcheng Electronics Industrial Investment Joint-Stock Company  Limited (with a 10.7-percent shareholders' right); and the  Shenzhen Changhe Industrial Company Limited (with a 7.1-percent  shareholders' right; this company is a joint venture between  Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings Limited, Hutchison Whampoa  Company Limited, and relevant companies in Shenzhen). Wang  Dianpu also noted that it is just a temporary arrangement that  the company consists of the aforementioned five shareholders  only and the company plans to invite a number of major  enterprises in Shenzhen to be shareholders.    Wang Dianpu pointed out that the Shenzhen Saige High-Tech  Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, during the coming  period, will place stress on developing the design, manufacture,  packing, testing technology, and supplementary industries for  grand-scale integrated circuits. To this end, the company will  make full use of all preferential policies granted by the state;  develop new and high technology; carry out diversified  operations; uphold the orientation of internationalizing  investment, product, market, technology, able personnel, and  management; and explore and create a new pattern for China's  new- and high-tech industries. From a long-term point of view,  the company plans to turn itself into a pluralistic  transnational company with real economic strength.    The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit  Project  will be developed by phases in the form of a Sino-foreign joint  venture. The first phase of the project includes the  establishment of a factory and design center in Shenzhen's  Futian Bonded Zone for the finishing prossess for grand-scale  integrated circuits, which will occupy an area of 37,000 square  meters. The joint venture will introduce world first class  production equipment and technology for the design, packaging,  and testing of integrated circuits of all kinds. The designed  production capacity in the first phase is expected to be 318  million pieces of packaged integrated circuits and most of the  products will be sold overseas. Entailing a total investment of  nearly $1 billion, the project will be jointly developed by the  Chinese investment company and an international first class  microelectronics company. The integrated circuit packaging and  testing factory for the joint venture will have the country's  highest output volume, largest production scale, and most  advanced technologies. The establishment of this project is of  great strategic significance to enhancing the level of China's  electronic industry, narrowing the gap between the electronic  technologies of China and the world, building up an electronic  industrial base in southern China, and to pushing forward the  industrial development of the Zhu Jiang Delta.    The second phase of the project includes the establishment  of  a world standard factory in Hong Kong for the initial processing  of grand-scale integrated circuits, thus turning the  Shenzhen-Hong Kong region into China's integrated circuit  production and export base. It has been learned that a 34,000  square meter factory for this purpose will be set up in Hong  Kong's Tai Po industrial town, which the Saige Group purchased  earlier. Recently, Hong Kong's Industrial Department planned to  withdraw the land as no construction had been carried out on it  long after the purchase; however, the Industrial Department  recently agreed to an extension. An investment of over $1  billion is needed for both the initial and finishing processes  to develop to an appropriate scale. At present, the first phase  of construction has entered the contract-signing stage and the  foreign partner is a first class major European integrated  circuit company.    Both the Chinese and foreign parties have agreed to examine  and approve the Chinese and English versions of three contracts  in early February; examine memorandums and the constitution of  the joint venture; and sign the three formal contracts upon the  approval of the boards of directors on both sides. According to  relevant plans, after the factory for the finishing process is  set up in Shenzhen's Futian Bonded Zone, it will first engage  itself in processing materials supplied by clients to gain  initial economic results; it will then expand the production  scale according to market changes and attain rollover  development relying mainly on the efficiency of the joint  venture. The finishing process is expected to be put into  production next year.</p>

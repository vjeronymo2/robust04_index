			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRILLS PUT COMPANY BACK IN BLACK;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: ONCE-AILING AMERICAN RESTAURANTS IS TURNING A PROFIT AFTER BUYING  HUDSON'S CHAIN.  </P> <P> At a Hudson's Grill restaurant, a hamburger costs about $4. The same $4 can buy  two shares of stock in American Restaurants Corp., which owns the Hudson's  Grill chain. And that speaks volumes about the problems ARC is trying to  overcome.  </P> <P> ARC, based in Ventura, was on its back two years ago. At that time it mainly  operated 35 Wendy's fast-food franchises, but some sat on expensive real estate  leases that ate up profits and others lacked strong management. As a result,  ARC lost $7 million from 1985 through 1988 on sales of roughly $20 million a  year.  </P> <P> But in 1988, the company hired Charles L. Boppell as president and chief  executive. A veteran of the fast-food wars, Boppell was a former executive of  Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Godfather's Pizza.  </P> <P> Once he arrived at American Restaurants, Boppell directed the sale of  two-thirds of its Wendy's restaurants to eliminate the struggling ones. He also  arranged the purchase of a company that owned several Hudson's Grills, a  Southern California restaurant chain with a mild 1950s diner theme, sit-down  service and moderate prices.  </P> <P> Hudson's appealed to Boppell because it gave him an opportunity to run his own  business, rather than heading a division or a franchise, and for ARC itself to  expand the Hudson's concept.  </P> <P> And after shuffling the lineup, Boppell has ARC making money again, its balance  sheet is healthier and he has big expansion plans. The company -- which owns 12  Hudson's, 11 Wendy's and four specialty restaurants such as the State &amp; A,  a sandwiches/bar restaurant in Santa Barbara -- earned $442,000 on sales of $23  million in the 48 weeks ended Dec. 31. (ARC changed its fiscal year-end to Dec.  31 from Jan. 31 last year.) In this year's first quarter, it had a $93,616  profit.  </P> <P> "I call it a phoenix company, rising out of the ashes," said Roy J. Millender  Jr., an ARC director and its biggest stockholder with a 40% stake.  </P> <P> The 13-year-old company also has decided its future is Hudson's, which it owns  outright, and not in being a Wendy's franchisee, even though its remaining  Wendy's are profitable. (Among other things, ARC must pay Wendy's 4% of its  gross sales for extending ARC the franchise.) ARC expects to open 25 more  Hudson's over the next three years, and it has begun to market franchises.  </P> <P> ARC executives bristle at the suggestion that Hudson's Grills are 1950s diners,  preferring to say the restaurants "flirt with the 1950s." Why be so  persnickety? Because ARC does not want to be pigeonholed as a '50s diner.  Instead, it plans to regularly and subtly change its identity as the years go  by to stay fresh.  </P> <P> But change or not, Hudson's market is chock-full of competitors anxious to curb  its growth. They include Chili's, Fuddrucker's, Marie Callender's, Coco's and  Red Robin, to name just a few rival mid-priced restaurant chains.  </P> <P> Indeed, Red Robin doesn't even keep close track of Hudson's Grill because  "they're too small," said Madison Jobe, vice president of Irvine-based Red  Robin, which has 61 outlets in 11 states and Canada.  </P> <P> Then there's the prospect of an economic recession, which could crimp ARC's  growth plans if consumers eat at home more often to save money. Boppell isn't  worried. "We're going to benefit from people coming down from the expensive"  restaurants when they choose to dine out, he said.  </P> <P> It's also likely that ARC will soon need a cash infusion to help pay for its  growth plans, considering a typical Hudson's costs $400,000 to build and  $275,000 to furnish. The company had $539,000 in cash reserves as of July 1,  but Boppell conceded ARC "could use some more money."  </P> <P> He's mulling whether to get another bank loan, sell additional shares of stock  or otherwise raise funds. But Boppell probably will have to wait until he can  show a longer string of profits before lenders or investors will provide more  cash.  </P> <P> "It's not a crisis, so we're not out beating the bushes" for funds, he said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, those potentially negative factors have investors wary. Despite  ARC's improvement, its stock is trading at $1.50 a share, the same price it  fetched 18 months ago. Then again, only about 10% of ARC's stock is owned by  the general public, so it's a thinly traded "pink sheet" issue. Boppell,  Millender and other insiders own most of it.  </P> <P> The question is whether Hudson's Grills can keep generating steady profits. "By  saying we flirt with the '50s, we think we can attract people that like that,  but not be in that niche when it overheats," Boppell said. "The authentic '50s  cafe, I think, may be doomed to what happened to the fern bars, that is, they  get overbuilt and people get tired of them. We're going to move 15-20% a year  in our concept."  </P> <P> There's no denying the '50s flavor at a Hudson's Grill, however. The chain's  name is a play on the front grille of the Hudson automobile, which was built  from 1909 until 1957 when, after merging with Nash to form American Motors  Corp., it was discontinued.  </P> <P> The restaurants feature thick hamburgers and thicker milkshakes on the menu, a  jukebox on the floor and other '50s paraphernalia on the walls including an  actual Hudson car's front grille that appears to be smashing through the wall  above -- what else -- the restaurant's cooking grill.  </P> <P> But the restaurants also feature chicken dishes, fajitas, appetizers and other  '90s dishes. Waitresses don't wear poodle skirts, they wear polo shirts, and  none are on roller skates.  </P> <P> This "moving concept" strategy was devised by Boppell, 48, a Santa Cruz native  who before joining ARC had already retired because he received stock and other  severance pay from PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell unit and Godfather's that "allowed  me the financial flexibility not to have to work," he said.  </P> <P> He said he left those companies mainly because he didn't enjoy being head of  someone else's division. As a "retiree" between 1985 and 1988, he bought  Ventura Toyota, a car dealership of which he still owns 51%, and dabbled in  real estate.  </P> <P> In 1988, Millender and other ARC directors asked him to help divest the  company's loss-ridden Wendy's outlets. He also arranged ARC's purchase of  International Eateries Corp., which owned the Hudson's Grills, from Travis L.  Bryant for $4.8 million and warrants that give him the right to purchase 1.7  million shares, or about 24% of ARC, at a certain price within a specified  period.  </P> <P> As part of the purchase, Boppell came with it to head ARC. "I was antsy to get  back into business," he said. He also got about 6% of ARC's stock, a holding he  has since raised to about 12%.  </P> <P> It's people in Boppell's age group, 35-55, who are making Hudson's market  potentially lucrative, he said. Those people have by and large "moved past the  fast-food experience" and want sit-down service, but "don't want to make a  large commitment of time or funds," he said. The company's future will depend  on how many move past Hudson's Grill on their way.  </P></p>

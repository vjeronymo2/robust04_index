			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz ready to name next chairman Months of speculation over the top job in German industry is set to end tomorrow with the appointment of Mr Jurgen Schrempp as the next chairman of the management board of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicle, aerospace and technology group. Daimler refused to comment yesterday ahead of the meeting of the company's supervisory board, but it is understood that Mr Schrempp, 49, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler's loss-making aerospace arm, will be appointed to succeed Mr Edzard Reuter from May next year. Mr Reuter, 66, architect of an ambitious strategy to expand Daimler into a global technology group, will step down before his contract runs out at the end of next year. He is expected to be appointed to the Daimler supervisory board although it has not been decided whether he should succeed Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, as chairman of that body. Mr Schrempp is seen in Germany as Mr Reuter's favoured candidate for the succession and is thought unlikely to break radically with the strategy established by his mentor. The other main contender was Mr Helmut Werner, 57, chief executive of Mercedes Benz, the luxury car company which accounted for 70 per cent of Daimler's DM97.7bn (Dollars 59.9bn) turnover last year and usually accounts for the bulk of the group's profits. The appointment of Mr Schrempp is due to take effect at the shareholder meeting in May next year, allowing Mr Reuter to take credit for the expected recovery in Daimler's profits this year. Last year the group made a loss of DM1.8bn. The Daimler supervisory board is likely to discuss the question of Mr Reuter's appointment to the chairmanship of that body in November this year. Should Mr Kopper step down from this position, it would be a break with the past as a representative of the Deutsche Bank has occupied the position since the 1920s.</p>

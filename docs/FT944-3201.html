			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fokker forecast lowered Fokker Aircraft, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, has been forced to lower profit forecasts for the full year. It blames a further deterioration in industry conditions and a weak US dollar in the second half of 1994, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. Fokker said it now expected the net result to be close to that of 1993, when it reported a loss of Fl 460m (Dollars 261.4m). It said a financial package agreed with its parent company, Deutsche Aerospace, and with the Dutch government, became effective last month. The company said a non-interest bearing, subordinated loan of Fl 600m had been made available through Deutsche Aerospace. The loan can only be repaid out of the proceeds of future rights issues, to which Fokker Holding is committed to subscribe 51 per cent. After 15 years, anything remaining of the loan will be converted into common shares at the stock price then prevailing. Fokker said that with the sale and lease-back of its technological 'know-how', the subordinated loan would help strengthen its capital base.</p>

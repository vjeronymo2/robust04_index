			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the correspondent of the Voice  and Vision, Brigadier General Afshar, commander of the Basij  force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, spoke of the  expression of readiness by the Islamic Republic of Iran to  dispatch peacekeeping forces to Bosnia. He added:    [Begin recording] [Afshar] Since the beginning of the  atrocity against the Muslims of Bosnia, sorrow has entered the  hearts of our popular and Hezbollah forces -- in particular our  Basij forces -- who have been awaiting the right opportunity to  be present on the scene of defending the Muslims.    The present situation in Gorazde is rather strange  considering that the United Nations declared the town as a safe  haven, and we know that if global arrogance wishes, it is  capable of stopping the Serbs, especially when one considers  what happened after Iraq's attack on Kuwait. Under the present  circumstances, that is after the attack by Serbian froces on  Gorazde, there is increasing pressure on the minds of Muslims,  in particular on our Basij forces. There have been numerous  phone calls from our Basij personnel to our barracks and  headquarters, urging the officials to facilitate their dispatch  to the area.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many personnel can the  Basij force dispatch to Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping  forces?    [Afshar] We can meet the demand for any number of forces,  such as say 10,000 or 20,000, or in fact any number which is  necessary for Goradze in particular or Bosnia-Herzegovina in  general. All these forces are of course volunteers. We are,  moreover, prepared to send these volunteers without expecting to  receive any payment from international organizations. [end  recording]</p>

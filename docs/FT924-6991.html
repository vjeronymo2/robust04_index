			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Staff cuts behind National Power rise HIGHER THAN expected job cuts helped National Power, the electricity generator, to increase pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 182m to Pounds 201m in the six months to September 27. The improvement was achieved in a total market that was down by half of a percentage point, the company said. Demand from the industrial and domestic sectors fell by 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, whereas the commercial side rose by 2 per cent. Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 1.97bn, partly because of lower sales volumes but principally through a reduction of Pounds 97m in contributions recovered from consumers and passed on in the form of support payments to British Coal. The number of people employed has fallen by 17 per cent to 9,500 since the end of March and 28 per cent since September. Productivity, as measured by output per employee, was 24 per cent up year on year. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the employed number was likely to be about 8,000 by the end of March. He also disclosed that a tentative agreement had been reached with unions for a 15-month pay deal with employees which will provide a lump sum of up to Pounds 2,000 together with wage rises of 3.95 per cent. The deal is conditional on employees of acceptance of performance-related pay and flexible working. In the half year fuel costs of Pounds 975m were down 1 per cent, mainly as a result of lower sales volumes. Fuel costs per unit rose 4 per cent. Net borrowings at Pounds 283m compared with Pounds 226m at the year end. The debt equity ratio was 13.3 per cent. The interim dividend is increased from 3p to 3.3p. Earnings per share were 11.53p (10.12p). Mr Baker said trading in the opening weeks of the second half of the year was broadly in line with expectations. See Lex</p>

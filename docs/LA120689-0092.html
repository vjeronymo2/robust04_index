			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> FIRST LADY BACKS SALVATION ARMY  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush urged shopping malls not to bar holiday Salvation Army  solicitors, as she dropped $10 into the kettle at a Washington, D.C., mall  where she was Christmas shopping. Mrs. Bush cited the group's work to help the  needy and victims of natural disasters and said: "It just wouldn't be Christmas  without that bell ringing." A comparatively high number of Washington malls are  excluding the annual solicitation on the grounds that they do not allow any  other groups to solicit. A Salvation Army officer said that the bans will cost  the group about $100,000 this year.  </P></p>

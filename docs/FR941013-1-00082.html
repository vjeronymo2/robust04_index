			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed rule, each individual owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would establish on a site-specific basis minimum or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum operating parameter values, as appropriate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of parameter monitored, that the control device must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exceed to remain in compliance with the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. These site-specific operating parameter values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be established through either performance tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device design analysis, or manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations. The established operating parameter values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each control device would be incorporated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating permit issued for a facility (or, in the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an operating permit, the established levels would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly enforceable) and would be used to determine a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's compliance status. Excursions outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established operating parameter values would be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of the applicable emission standard except when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the excursion is caused by a startup, shutdown, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> malfunction that meets the criteria specified in the Part 63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed NESHAP does not require monitoring of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the following boilers or process heaters when used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device to comply with the requirements of the rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Boilers and process heaters with a heat capacity equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to or greater than 44 megawatts (approximately 150 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Btu/hr); (2) boilers or process heaters with a heat capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 44 MW that introduces the vent stream as a primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel or mixes it with the primary fuel; or (3) boilers or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process heaters with a heat capacity less than 44 MW that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduces the vent stream through the same burner. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the specific range of temperatures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residence times for these types of combustion units which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility operators must continuously maintain to meet their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility process heat or steam demands will ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the control device standards without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous monitoring is not feasible for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission points required to comply with certain equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and work practice standards ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , tanks equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with only covers, pumps and valves subject to LDAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs). In such cases, failure to install and maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required equipment or properly implement the LDAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program would constitute a violation of the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment or work practice standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA request comments on the proposed approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of control device compliance based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous operating parameter monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Treatment Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations NESHAP, wastes or recoverable materials having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOHAP concentrations of 100 ppmw or more must be treated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the rule before the material can be placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain management units. Like the control devices used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP emission control, the treatment processes used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with these standards (i.e., minimum percent HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction, VOHAP concentration limits, required HAP mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal levels) need to be properly operated and maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the standards are to be achieved on a long-term basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the EPA is proposing to require monitoring of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating parameters for the treatment processes used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the rule requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analogous to the monitoring approach that the EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing for control devices, the EPA would prefer that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each owner or operator establish on a site-specific basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum or maximum operating parameter values, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, for the treatment process that the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator must not exceed to remain in compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. To implement this approach for treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes, monitoring methods are needed that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently representative, accurate, precise, reliable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent, and timely to determine whether a deviation occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and therefore to certify whether compliance is continuous or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermittent. The EPA has identified for some types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment process, such as steam stripping, operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters that can be continuously monitored and recorded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which directly relate to the treatment process performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA requests comments on establishing monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for treatment processes that can be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine compliance with the proposed standards based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous operating parameter monitoring. The EPA further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on establishing an option within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation for specific default values for treatment process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating parameters, in the event that owners or operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would rather not establish their own minimum or maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating parameter values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

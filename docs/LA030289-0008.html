			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING EXPANDS INTO NORTH CITY WEST  </P> <P> San Diego's voluntary recycling program will expand Saturday to include North  City West residents, authorities said.  </P> <P> About 2,100 households that separate newspaper, aluminum, steel and glass into  different containers will have their disposables picked up once a week along  with regular trash collection.  </P> <P> The program has been particularly effective in University City, where it began  as a pilot project in October, 1988, according to Waste Management Department  spokeswoman Marlene Mariani. Residents there have a 90% participation rate, the  highest of any voluntary program in the nation, Mariani said.  </P> <P> About 80 tons of recycling material are collected from University City each  month.  </P> <P> Because North City West has similar demographics, authorities expect the  program to be equally successful there. The recycling program was expanded in  January to include College Grove, which also generates about 80 tons of  recycling material a month.  </P> <P> "Residents are extremely supportive of the program. We are getting positive  feedback from the participants as well as other residents requesting curb-side  recycling in their communities," said Ernie Anderson, deputy director of the  city's Waste Management Department.  </P></p>

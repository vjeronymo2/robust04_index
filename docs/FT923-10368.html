			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / More people out of work in France FRENCH unemployment, the main black spot in an otherwise healthy economy, continued to rise last month, to a seasonally adjusted 2.92m, the Labour Ministry said, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The number out of work rose by 0.4 per cent between May and June, or by 8.9 per cent over the year, giving an unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent of the active population. There is a glimmer of hope that long-term unemployment might be on the retreat. The number out of work for more than 12 months fell by 0.4 per cent from May to June, to 934,600.</p>

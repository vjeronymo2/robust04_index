			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Why statistics on pay slip away between the figures: The wide gap between settlements and average earnings OFFICIAL figures to be released today will show that average earnings continued to rise at an annual rate of 7 per cent-plus in April. The Department of Employment's earnings figure, together with more gloomy unemployment news, has remained obstinately high in spite of the recession and the gradual reduction in inflation. Behind the scenes in the Treasury, the Department of Employment and the City, questions are being asked about why the increase in average earnings is not falling more swiftly to the level of today's more modest pay settlements - about 4 per cent. The first answer is that such settlement figures go back only a month or two, whereas the underlying rate of increase in average earnings is an annualised figure that includes settlements of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent from the first half of last year. Soon the recent settlements will edge out the older statistics and the earnings figure will fall below 7 per cent later this year, possibly even below 6 per cent if the recovery remains fragile. Nevertheless, 7 per cent-plus has been a worryingly tenacious floor. Inflation fell below 5 per cent in August 1991 and average earnings first fell below 8 per cent in July of that year, having been on 9 per cent in March. Some analysts are even dusting down the old 'wages drift' concept to help explain the high level of average earnings, while others are asking whether the way the earnings statistics are collected might overstate real pay levels. Wages drift - the difference between reported settlements and earnings per head - has usually been explained by increases in overtime and one-off bonuses, and is usually associated with periods of rapid growth. The Engineering Employers Federation calculates that at the height of the boom in 1988 nearly 40 per cent of the annual rate of pay rises - 3.5 per cent on top of settlements of 5.2 per cent - came from 'drift'. By 1991, that had fallen to 1 per cent, accounting for only 10 per cent of the annual rise. At present, overtime is not picking up, so if there is a drift between settlements and wages not accounted for by the lag in the earnings index it must have another cause. Mr Alistair Hatchett of pay research group Incomes Data Services, who describes current drift as 'labour market pull' rather than 'union push', points to the continuing popularity of one-off bonuses, often as a way of sweetening low percentage increases. Like other analysts, he emphasises the 'employment effect', which results in average pay per head rising in a company as a result of lower-paid jobs being abolished. That may be compatible with holding pay to the rate of inflation at plant level but, overall, creates an impression of upward drift. Department of Employment research suggests that that effect is more than offset by increased use of part-time workers, mainly women, whose pay depresses earnings per head. But is there a drift problem at all? Mr Don Smith, economist at investment bank Midland Montagu, argues that the statistical lag between between earnings and settlements is a sufficient explanation for the present earnings level. He also questions whether the Department of Employment figures may be biased towards better-paying larger employers and the public sector. Companies employing fewer than 25 people are not counted, but anyway they do not account for a large proportion of the workforce. He may be over-optimistic about wages drift, but there is one short-term reason for earnings to be high that will soon work their way out. The March figure was so high because of the number of companies bringing forward payments to staff who would have had to pay more tax if Labour had won the election. Unemployment in the UK will rise faster than anywhere else in Europe this year for the second year running and may reach 3m, according to a Labour party study based on the latest European Community statistics. The unemployment total for May, announced today, is expected to jump another 30,000 to more than 2.7m.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Aluminium price rise boils over Some of the froth was blown off the recent aluminium price rally yesterday after a Russian industry official cast doubt on his country's ability to deliver promised production cuts in full this year. At multilateral talks in Brussels last month - called to tackle the world supply glut caused by a flood of Russian aluminium into the west - the Russians agreed to institute over the next six months output cuts amounting to 500,000 tonnes in a full year. But yesterday Mr Andrei Yefimov, head of DEAL, the Russian association of aluminium and titanium plants, estimated that his government would be able to cut production by no more than 300,000 tonnes in 1994. He said there was strong resistance to cuts from the 850,000-tonnes-a-year Bratsk smelter in eastern Siberia, while smaller smelters in Sayansk and Irkutsk had also refused to sign the deal, Reuter reported from Moscow. However, Mr Lev Lubensky, commercial director of the small Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter in northern Russia, took issue with Mr Yefimov, saying his statement was premature and caused unnecessary panic in trading circles. 'Yefimov's statements go too far,' he declared. 'It is a very rash thing to say.' Nevertheless, Mr Yefimov's remarks fuelled profit-taking at the London Metal Exchange, where aluminium prices had been pushed to 17-month highs following the announcement of cuts by Southwire and Alumax of the US (40,000 and 17,000 tonnes), Comalco of Australia (36,000 tonnes) and Norsk Hydro of Norway (70,000 tonnes). Three months metal closed yesterday at Dollars 1,295.50 a tonne, Dollars 22.50 below the peak reached earlier in the day, but still Dollars 18.50 up on the week. US investment funds had been important contributors to aluminium's earlier strength and were similarly influential in driving copper prices to five-month highs - at any rate London analysts could offer no other explanation. Mr Ted Arnold of the Merrill Lynch financial services group pointed out that the US funds, which had some Dollars 25bn under their management, operated on an almost purely technical basis. When the copper market's fundamental weakness (based on an adverse supply/demand balance) reasserted itself the three months price was likely to dip by about Dollars 125 a tonne from the present level. Three months copper touched Dollars 1,936 a tonne on Thursday before subsiding by yesterday's close to Dollars 1,888.50 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on the week. The fundamental problems of the zinc market were underlined this week when LME warehouse stocks of the metal topped 1m tonnes for the first time. But traders seemed to see that as strengthening the probability of substantial capacity cuts being announced soon by European Union producers under a co-operative plan worked out at recent meetings. This view was reinforced yesterday when one of the producers told Reuter that the European Commission was likely to be notified of plans for a 10 per cent cut (about 250,000 tonnes) within a few days. Accordingly, the three months zinc price ended the week Dollars 17 higher at Dollars 1,033.50 a tonne. Precious metals prices were towed higher this week by an indomitably buoyant silver market, which put on another 39 cents to a four-year high of Dollars 5.42 1/2 a troy ounce. Once again the power of the US funds was behind rise, although traders thought even they might have difficulty pushing through resistance between Dollars 5.50 and Dollars 5.60.  ---------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium             +9,625    to    2,528,225 Aluminium alloy         -380    to       46,920 Copper                -2,575    to      594,950 Lead                  -2,450    to      321,000 Nickel                +1,110    to      129,972 Zinc                  +3,325    to    1,007,700 Tin                     +530    to       21,315  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

It would be possible to reduce technological dependence only  if changes were made to the structure of production, which would  require time and funds.    Faced with the threat of fuel famine, the government has  begun to involve itself in these matters on an empirical level,  reacting with great delay to the consequences, but not to the  reasons behind it.    Whereas in Russia and Ukraine the coefficient of dependence  of end product volume on external relations amounts to 0.31 and  0.41, respectively, in Moldova this figure is 0.995. That is,  for Moldova a one-percent fluctuation in external relations  yields practically the same degree of change in end product  volume. In other words, Moldova's technological dependence  amounts to almost 100 percent.    Among the republics of the former USSR, Moldova has one of  the highest shares of interrepublic imports in production (27  percent) and exports (24.1 percent) in output consumption. The  index of production share in the heavy industry sectors in  interrepublic imports in the republic is quite high (72.8  percent), and in exports it is the lowest (25.5 percent).    The indices presented here are averaged. The technological  dependence of certain plants of Moldova upon republics of the  former USSR and other countries is greater still. We import all  television set components from Russia, Belarus, Bulgaria, and  Romania. Many enterprises, chiefly those that used to be under  Union jurisdiction, have been obtaining absolutely every single  component part from other republics.    In international practice, the coefficient 0.25 is  considered  to be the critical level with respect to technological  dependence. The following example shows what this means in  practice.    Germany will never permit Russian oil and gas to constitute  more than 20-22 percent of its trade and energy balance. To make  up for its energy shortages, it will acquire energy from the  Near East and Africa, and will do so in such a manner that no  single country supplies more than 20-22 percent of Germany's  energy needs.    The economy of Moldova today and in the near future will be  unable to function normally without relations with the republics  of the former USSR. This is objectively conditioned by Moldova's  level of specialization and its role in the all-Union division  of labor that used to exist. About 82 percent of Moldova's  exports and more than 75 percent of its imports are attributable  to the CIS countries.    For trade turnover with the republics of the former USSR,  exports and imports for 1992 amounted to: 55.7 percent with  Russia; 22.1 percent with Ukraine; 10.1 percent with Belarus;  2.0 percent with Uzbekistan; and 2.8 percent with Turkmenistan.    We see approximately the same picture being maintained for  the first half of 1993. The greatest percentage of materials,  raw materials, equipment, and other output imported into Moldova  comes from Russia. Next in line are Ukraine and Belarus.    It must be noted that we have already lost a portion of the  CIS market. This is partly our own fault and partly due to the  fact that Russia has introduced extremely high excise and other  taxes on our traditional export products--champagne, wines, and  cognacs. This has resulted in decreased export volumes of these  products--by 20, 47, and 64 percent, respectively.    The press service of the Ministry of Economics reports that  over the first nine months of 1993, wine exports from Moldova to  Russia decreased by 47.1 percent, cognac by 64 percent, and  champagne by 20 percent. Moldova is losing one of its most  important sales markets, its place being occupied by Germany,  Poland, Italy, Finland, and other countries that are shipping  production output at intentionally understated prices. Moldova  may find itself squeezed out of this market precisely at a time  when the Western market is not accessible to it. This has  already significantly diminished our opportunities to acquire  the resources and fuel so necessary for the normal functioning  of the economy.    It should also be noted that Russia has in no way always  observed principles of fairness in its economic relations with  republics of the former Union. However, neither has Moldova  always adhered to civilized principles in its relations with  Russia (we recall the recent incident involving clandestine  reexport of oil).    Therefore, the question of integrating Moldova into CIS  structures and of utilizing the internal market of the  Commonwealth acquires not just an economic aspect, but an  ethical one as well.    The technological dependence of Moldova is intensified by  three circumstances: It is impossible in the present stage to  resolve the republic's urgent problems without foreign  assistance, which must amount to about $500 million.    In the opinion of specialists, the state debt of Moldova may  reach a level greater than $300 million by the end of this year.  And it is felt this assumption is justified, insofar as the  republic's production structure is reproducing a hard currency  deficit since noncompetitive output is being produced. This debt  will constitute a heavy burden on the shoulders of future  generations.    The press service of the Ministry of Economics asserts that  the total amount of credits, without interest, will not exceed  $131.3 million, but the balance of assets and liabilities with  respect to Moldova's foreign debt is tentatively expected to  amount to $191.3 million by the end of this year.    At the same time, the leadership of Moldova's trade unions  declares that we are already indebted to foreign banks in an  amount on the order of $450 million. In addition, on the eve of  the introduction of our national currency we will receive  rehabilitation credit in the amount of about $300 million to  provide support for the national currency rate and cover certain  expenses for the purchase of energy, etc.    Still one more aspect capable of intensifying Moldova's  technological dependence is the incorrect selection of  priorities. In the process of privatization, rural residents  obtain advantages: In addition to national-wealth certificates,  the property and land of kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and sections of  processing enterprises are transferred to them for their free  use and possession, as well as preferential-term credits, which  are not always returned. With such a distortion, Moldova may  become a purely agrarian country with a backward economy.  Everyone understands the importance of agriculture and the need  to provide it assistance. But if we do not become seriously  involved in research-intensive, resource-economizing, and  labor-conserving technology, the republic will never raise  itself to the level of the developed countries.    Here it is necessary to accomplish several tasks: First of  all, determine priorities in the agro-industrial complex itself  and provide it with state support; second, we must attract  foreign capital in order to develop agriculture. An example of  this is the establishment, based on the Orkhey Pig Farm, of a  joint enterprise with the participation of Italian and American  livestock output-processing firms. Third, we must effect state  stimulation of the development of research-intensive production  output on the islands of scientific and technological progress  that still remain in Moldova. In the opinion of the trade union  leadership, prices for sugar, sausage, and other food products  will be two or three times the level of world prices in the very  near future due to regular increases in energy costs. This may  lead to a situation where agriculture finds itself bankrupt and  Moldova gradually turns into a raw material appendage and a  supplier of cheap manpower. In other words, we need to resolve a  twofold problem: the attraction of foreign capital and entry  into the world market, on the one hand, and the protection of  our domestic market, on the other. A glut on the market takes  place not because society does not need the production output in  question, but because production costs are so high that there is  no demand for the output. In Moldova, where price increases are  significantly out pacing wage increases, such a situation is  turning into the norm.    Priority is given to intermediary trade activity when the  majority of businessmen (about 80 percent) are engaged not in  production, but in trade. This affects the state sector of the  economy as well. Thus, of the proceeds from every bottle of  wine, wine growers get only 7-10 percent, while trade gets 20  percent. One can borrow accordingly, but the debt has to be  commensurate with the national income, using hard currency to  produce competitive output. Simply put, one must not buy fish,  but rather buy a fishing rod and learn how to catch fish.    How can we reduce the technological dependence of Moldova  and  bring it in line with the normal, average level (there is no  such thing as absolute independence from other countries or from  the world market)?    First of all, production relations must be strengthened. The  most effective way to reduce the technological dependence of the  republic is to effect integration into the CIS production  structures through acquisition of a package of shares--of  Russian oil-production, oil-refining, and other enterprises, let  us say, which will gradually be transformed into transnational  corporations.    As far as the sale of wine base is concerned, first of all,  the export of unprocessed product is a sign of backwardness of  the republic; second, the wine base itself is many times less  expensive than ready wine; third, in selling base wine to the  CIS countries we provide work for the citizens of these states,  while unemployment in our own republic is reaching threatening  proportions.    The penetration of Moldova into Western markets is a matter  of no small importance. But by virtue of the existing division  of labor, all positions are filled there. Competitive production  output is therefore required, which we simply do not have.    Thus in order to resolve the problems of technological  dependence, we must reorient the economy of Moldova not only  towards the markets of countries of the East, but on those of  the West as well.</p>

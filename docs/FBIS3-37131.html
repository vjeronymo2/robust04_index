Any center and region are out of the question, since Georgia  and Abkhazia will be equal partners, head of the Abkhazian  delegation Andrey Dzhirgenia told ITAR-TASS.    The Abkhazian side insists on greater autonomy in many  aspects of state life. It has offered to create a special body  in charge of joint competence in foreign policy, trade, customs  and border services, power engineering, transport and  credit-financial policy. In the opinion of the Abkhazian side,  the rest should be in the exclusive competence of Georgian and  Abkhazian power structures.    The Abkhazian delegation does not agree to make its republic  a Georgian land, whose powers will not exceed social issues,  culture and fishing.    Sources at the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet's press service told  ITAR-TASS, the sides are to submit more detailed proposals by  the next round of Geneva negotiations scheduled for February 23.</p>

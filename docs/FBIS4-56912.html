			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kang Yu-feng in San Jose on 7 May; </F> from the "Hookup" program]    [Text] Jose Maria Figueres, who is to become the next  president of Costa Rica, announced his policy on the ROC at a  joint news conference with President Li Teng-hui. Through an  interpreter, he stressed that Costa Rica will continue its  efforts to help the ROC gain deserving status in the  international community. He also pointed out that it is  appropriate for the ROC to join the UN and that at every  occasion Costa Rica will support the ROC, which firmly defends  democracy and has traditional ties of friendship with Costa Rica.    [Begin Figueres recording] We will always stand on the side  of the ROC and continue to fight for the ROC when necessary, so  that the ROC will gain deserving status in the international  community. We will not only continue our support for our  traditional friend, but also render support, at every  international occasion, to a country that defends democracy  consistently. [end recording]    President Jose Maria Figueres also expressed his wish to  visit the ROC after he is sworn in and state affairs are in  order, so as to draw on the ROC's experiences in every field.  President Li Teng-hui expressed heartfelt thanks for the  promise by the new Costa Rican Government. Besides, he  stressed, as a sovereign state, the ROC is currently practicing  pragmatic diplomacy and promoting cross-strait relations. There  is no controversy in doing these simultaneously. He hoped the  two sides of the strait would achieve mutual understanding.  There is nothing inappropriate in the ROC trying to find a way  to practice diplomacy and join the UN.    [Begin President Li recording] It is very important for the  two sides to foster mutual understanding. The ROC, however,  needs to find a way to practice diplomacy as a sovereign state.  In my opinion, these activities should proceed simultaneously.  Since the ROC meets the requirement that a UN member state be  peace-loving, it is very appropriate for the ROC to join the UN.  [end recording]    When answering a question at the news conference about  solving the issue of Costa Rica's agricultural development,  President Li Teng-hui, an agricultural expert, modestly said  that President Jose Maria Figueres, a former agricultural  minister, knows more about agriculture than he and surely has  concrete plans. Li said the ROC Government and the private  sector will help him fulfill these plans.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Statute change makes sale of Ascom stake likely Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment group, was effectively put up for sale yesterday. The Swiss government approved a change in the statutes of the Hasler Works Foundation, enabling it to sell any or all of its 54 per cent voting stake in the group. Mr Heinz Frey, chairman, said there was now nothing preventing anyone from taking over the troubled group, although he doubted that the foundation would sell part or all of its shares without the approval of the Ascom board. Ascom has a number of successful product lines, including payphones, cordless telephones and corporate network systems, but it has been unable to develop a successful overall strategy or unified management since its creation through the merger of three Swiss telecoms companies in 1987. In 1992, it fell into the red, losing SFr46.4m (Dollars 32m) on sales of SFr3.37bn. Last year, it is believed the group lost over SFr300m. Mr Leonardo Vannotti, former chief executive, was sacked in December, Mr Klaus Rutschi, finance director, resigned in January and Mr Frey said he and two more of the 12 directors would stand down in May. Mr Frey said that the change in the Hasler Foundation statutes also made possible equity-supported joint ventures with other companies in specific sectors. Yesterday, the group announced an intensification of Ascom's existing co-operation with Ericsson of Sweden. The two have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up an Ericsson-controlled venture in public telecom equipment in Switzerland. Mr Fred Sutter, Ascom's new chief executive, outlined a new group strategy, concentrating on three core business areas: telecom terminals, corporate networks and service automation. Peripheral activities, such as cable television, hearing aids and microelectronic components, would be sold off or put into joint ventures. He said the group would break even this year and return to profit in 1995.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Travel Focus - Africa: On the trail of small game in The Gambia - Nicholas Woodsworth watches drongos, bar-tailed godwits, malachite kingfishers and other flamboyant inhabitants of the land of 507 species of bird 'THERE, Roger, There] Ooooohhh, Yeesss]' I was sitting in a bright green and yellow six-wheeled truck with buffalo horns wired to the bonnet and rows of old cinema seats in the back, and beside me was a girl so excited she was almost dribbling in my ear. It was irritating. My name is not Roger. There are moments when I wonder why I like travel. There were about a dozen of us in the truck, an old Swedish army vehicle that had seen more African miles than a truck deserves to. Currently it was in the service of a tour company that takes prawn-pink European tourists into the dusty countryside of southern Gambia and shows them the sights. The excited squeaks and coos had begun early in the morning, before we had even left the strip of Atlantic coast where the tourist hotels range the beach. Roger was sitting on one side of the truck, Jane on the other. Both had binoculars to their eyes, cameras around their necks. Never had two more enthusiastic discoverers set foot in Africa. It took me some time to work out what it was they were discovering. 'Yaaaah]', Jane would let loose a barely restrained shriek, rocking the seat beside me. 'Its a drongo]' But what was a drongo? I would gaze in the direction that Jane was training her binoculars, and try to imagine what one looked like. Was it the little anthill-looking thing off to the left? Or the spiky tree behind the anthill? Or maybe the little tin shack just behind the spiky tree? I could see nothing at all. This inexplicable behaviour began to get on my nerves. It was some time after we had visited Uncle John's country palm wine bar, but a few minutes before being held up for sweets and pens at the Jambur primary school, that I borrowed a pair of binoculars from a fellow tourist and realised what Jane and Roger were getting so excited about. It was birds. Take a pair of binoculars outdoors in The Gambia - anywhere: hotel gardens, the potholed streets of Serrekunda town, into the peanut fields or mangrove swamps along the Gambia River - and suddenly what can at times appear to be a miserably poor and tourist-ridden country is transformed into a series of vignettes of astonishing wealth and beauty. I arrived in the Gambia knowing and caring nothing about birds. When I left I was well on the way to becoming one of that most hopeless of species, the addicted birdwatcher. The Gambia has had few fair shakes since it became a British slave-trading entrepot in the 18th century. An historical and geographical aberration, it is the result of commercial conflict between British and French colonial trading interests. While France, master of much of north and west Africa, laid effective claim to the huge territory of Senegal, the British were able to hang on to the Gambia River, the sluggish, mangrove-bordered waterway which flows through its heart. The result, today, is a country which, while some 300 miles long, posesses land only 15-to-30 miles wide on either side of the river. With no hinterland, The Gambia's options are few. Ninety per cent of its meagre wealth comes from peanut exports. Its population is one of the densest, fastest expanding and poorest in Africa. Tourism is one of its brighter hopes. Just five hours' flight from London and with six months' guaranteed sunshine during the northern hemisphere winter, it is an increasingly popular package destination. If The Gambia's history and geography have made it a place where North and South collide, its river has also incited a more gentle kind of meeting. One of the few waterways to flow through this vast semi-arid region of west Africa, The Gambia attracts millions of birds every year. Each dry season hundreds of species, most African, some European migrants, congregate on the country's riverbanks, beaches, mudflats, forests and grasslands. Does an annual winter colloquium of birds sound slightly tedious? Perhaps, in England, it might. But this is no dull, grey-brown meeting of humble nuthatches and self-effacing finches. This is Africa, and its penchant for flamboyance, oddity, excess and gaudy allure has been passed on to its feathered inhabitants. The birds of The Gambia are, quite simply, outrageous, and make the country one of the premier birdwatching areas in the world. One early morning a few days after my south Gambia tour I set out with Lamin Sidibeh, a Gambian who at 29 is fast building a reputation as a professional bird guide. He is known far away in England to the BBC - the Bedfordshire Bird Club - two of whose members I had met walking goggle-eyed about the lush gardens of the Senegambia Hotel. Hard-core birdwatchers have a habit of drifting away in mid-sentence, their eyes suddenly fixed on some object above your left shoulder, but I did manage to hold them long enough to find out that Lamin is one of the best in the business. Among old Africa hands it is common to find that an early interest in big game watching is replaced by a deep and long-lasting enthusiasm for birds. There is greater variety, often more technical skill and personal knowledge needed in spotting them, and a great deal less preparation and money involved. To sight a white rhino requires a costly expedition into a game park. To spot the much smaller but equally spectacular malachite kingfisher - a brilliant jewel of a creature - you might only have to gaze up at a telephone line while ambling over to a restaurant for lunch. Lamin and I, for example, began that morning in a not terribly auspicious sounding place close to the hotel area, the Kotu sewage ponds. It sounds ghastly, but there we saw a whole series of delicate waders, birds like the blackwing stilt that mince around perched on thin pink legs that make up two-thirds of their height. We saw the cormorant-like African darter drying its wings after diving, and an English visitor, the grey heron, spearing its sharp bill into schools of little fish. From that point on, the morning was an unending succession of discoveries and surprises. In a spiky, harvested millet field, where peasant women were collecting stalks to feed their cattle, we came across a Senegal coucal with green tail, white breast, black head and red wings and eyes, scuttling through the stubble catching lizards. In an irrigated rice field we watched a snowy white cattle egret wrestling with a frog almost too big to get down its narrow throat. On a mud flat by a small estuary we watched a bar-tailed godwit, a bird with a beak almost as long as its body, poking around the mangrove roots catching fiddler crabs for breakfast. I had passed the Fajara golf club any number of times without thinking much of it. Its fairways are yellowed, its greens brown. That morning it became an entrancing place: all you have to do is look up. There we saw a giant kingfisher, a full 18 inches long from beak to tail, flash by in a brilliant blue streak. Not far away, in that strangest of African trees, the baobab, we watched bright green long-tailed parakeets peck at the fruit that is used to make cream of tartar. Standing by the hollow of a neem tree - West Africans use its leaves as a malaria remedy - Lamin whistled a scale of liquid, ascending notes; they were similarly answered from inside the hollow, and in a minute or two a pearl-spotted owlet emerged to blink sleepily at us. One of the aerial wonders we spotted up a tall palm tree was not a bird at all, but a palm wine tapper doing his morning rounds, shinnying up and down collecting gourds of sweet fermented sap. I shall not go on. Suffice it to say that in one morning I saw 55 different kinds of birds, each new one as exciting and different as the last. I cannot decide which I like best, but I think I would plump for the tiny nectar-drinking sunbirds, impossibly bright creatures in yellow, scarlet and ruby. I did not quite see the full range, though: there are said to be 507 species of birds in The Gambia. Even Lamin has seen only 378. But I have not given up. If, in the future, you come across a wild-eyed twitcher crouched in some distant palm grove muttering 'Yeesss] It's a drongo]', it might be me.

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Losses continue to mount at Texas Instruments TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, reported continuing losses for the fourth quarter and its second consecutive annual net loss, but said it expects to return to profitability this year. TI said 1991 was one of the most difficult years in its history. Charges taken for cost cuts, lower semiconductor prices and start-up expenses for new semiconductor manufacturing facilities were the primary causes of TI's increased losses. Fourth-quarter net revenue was flat at Dollars 1.75bn, compared with Dollars 1.76bn in the same period of 1990. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 85m or Dollars 1.18 a share, against net losses of Dollars 56m or 80 cents in 1990. The figures include a charge of Dollars 55m for job cuts and the closure of older semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The charges cover a planned workforce reduction of 1,000 in addition to earlier cuts. Net revenues for the year were Dollars 6.8bn, up from Dollars 6.6bn in 1990. Net losses for the year were Dollars 409m, or Dollars 5.40 a share, following losses of Dollars 39m or 92 cents a share in 1990. The company took charges totalling Dollars 240m during the year as it phased out older, unprofitable semiconductor plants and reduced its workforce. The cuts will result in annual cost savings of Dollars 220m, TI said. 'We are planning to return TI to profitability in 1992 through cost reductions, business process and productivity improvements, and emphasis on new products,' said Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman and chief executive. Capital spending will be reduced to about Dollars 425m, from Dollars 504m in 1991 and Dollars 909m in 1990, the company added.</p>

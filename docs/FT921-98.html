			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Brazilian ministers offer resignations: Collor given chance for clean sweep after series of corruption scandals THE Brazilian government and presidential staff resigned en masse yesterday amid a wave of corruption scandals, to offer President Fernando Collor the chance of a clean sweep of his administration. In a note to the president the ministers, many only recently appointed, said they were placing their jobs at his disposal 'as an act of loyalty' to allow him to 'rethink the composition of his government in view of political imperatives and important decisions ahead'. But Mr Jarbas Passarinho, the law minister, who co-ordinated the mass resignation, said it was in reaction to Mr Collor's complaints over allegations of corruption in his government. Mr Marcos Coimbra, secretary general of the presidency, said Mr Collor had decided to retain the three military ministers and Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, economy minister, Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, and Mr Adib Jatene, health minister. However, none of the other six ministers, 24 federal secretaries and seven presidential advisers have so far been confirmed in their posts. Last night the foreign minister was flying back from New York where he had been defending Brazil's position for the Earth Summit, to be held in Rio in June, to see if he was still in office. The news comes after a flood of corruption allegations involving senior figures in the administration. Three ministers sacked in January are under police investigation. Mr Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos, secretary for strategic affairs and head of domestic intelligence, is being investigated for allegedly having friends appointed as directors of state pension funds and of Petrobras, the state oil monopoly, and using them to secure contracts. Mr Luis Themudo, the co-ordinator of the Earth Summit, resigned last week after allegations of irregularities. News stories have implicated the agriculture and law ministers in scandals. Mr Romeu Tuma, the police chief, said at the weekend that there were not enough police to investigate all the allegations. Yesterday Mr Passarinho said he had asked the army to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Mr Tuma. Mr Carlos Garcia, federal administration secretary and organiser of the Earth Summit, said the decision to resign had been reached unanimously in a meeting yesterday morning. Mr Collor last week told reporters of his frustration with the scandals. Talking emotionally of corruption, he said: 'It is lamentable that ministers were involved.' Referring to the case of the sacked labour minister who had been recorded boasting of a Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 17,300) bribe he had received, Mr Collor said: 'Just to have heard that conversation is enough to shake the strongest emotional structure.' Although Mr Collor had already sacked 11 ministers in his two years of office yesterday's news was the biggest cabinet shakeup to date. The effect of the resignations on the financial markets was tempered by Mr Collor's immediate decision to retain Mr Moreira as economy minister and Mr Francisco Gros as governor of the central bank.</p>

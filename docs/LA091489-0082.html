			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> WOMAN PLANS TO WED SALCIDO  </P> <P> A Los Angeles woman said she and accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido plan to  wed and hope they can care for his remaining child, Carmina. Barbara Pater, 28,  an investigator of missing persons, told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat that  Salcido "wants people to know that it was not 'him' that did this; that it was  something else that did it." Salcido is charged with slaying his wife, two  children, his mother-in-law, two of her other daughters, and a co-worker during  a bloody rampage in the Sonoma County wine country last April. Pater said she  and Salcido often speak about living with Carmina, his remaining daughter, 3,  who was found in a garbage dump with her throat slashed, her two sisters dead  beside her.  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Guinness juror argues that fraud trials not too complex for juries Sir, As the chairperson of the jury in the recently collapsed second Guinness trial, I am taking the unusual step of writing to you following the article by Justinian ('How to avoid trial by ordeal', February 24), when he refers to the need to reconsider the use of a jury in fraud cases. This has been argued a number of times of late, on the grounds that juries find such cases hard to understand and force the trials to become unreasonably long. In fact, the Guinness jury did not find it unduly difficult to understand the material, and their chief frustration was the very slow rate of progress, caused chiefly by the way in which Mr Roger Seelig conducted his own defence. They were disappointed and angry when the trial ended with justice neither done nor seen to be done, and many of them wondered whether the consideration extended to Mr Seelig would have been forthcoming for a defendant in humbler circumstances. This is not, of course, to imply anything on the issue of his innocence or guilt. Members of the legal profession have a way of writing about juries as if it were universally recognised that they are composed of people vastly inferior in understanding to their august selves. This seems to bear no relation to reality, at least as far as Guinness II is concerned. It deflects attention from the real problems which need to be tackled in the handling of fraud cases. It seems particularly necessary to make these points when some are arguing that the problems of trying fraud cases by jury are such that it would be better to take them out of the criminal law altogether. Surely the legal profession will have failed society if a thief ceases to be considered a thief, or a cheat a cheat, provided he operates with sufficient sophistication.

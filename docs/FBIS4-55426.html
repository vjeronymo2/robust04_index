			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "World Clock" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There are several examples in  the history of the post-communist countries of national parties  and movements breaking up. Something similar is now taking  place in Zagreb, where a new political formation has split off  from the party of President Tudjman. Gyorgyi Orban has spoken  to its leader, Stipe Mesic, who was, incidentally, the last head  of state of the former Yugoslavia.    [Begin recording] [Orban] Why did the founders of the ruling  Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] leave the party? What were  you dissatisfied with?    [Mesic speaking in Croatian, with superimposed translation]  The HDZ has fulfilled its historical task. We, the founders of  the party, together with the HDZ, led the country out of  communism and laid the foundations of the democratic system.  But the present-day structure of the HDZ is no longer suited to  today's challenges, which need answers to the problems of  creating the new Croatian state.    First, the party is becoming more and more bureaucratic in  its organization and structure, and the party is directed from a  center, to be more precise, from the office of the president of  the republic.    Second, Croatia's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina is two-faced.  For public opinion they pretend to favor a united  Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas in fact those forces within the  party which support a splinter state, the so-called  Herzeg-Bosna, are becoming stronger. Gojko Susak, who is the  defense minister and the party's deputy chairman, is in daily  telephone contact with those in Herzeg-Bosna who sparked off the  Croatian-Muslim battles. What all this means in practice is  that we are playing an active part in doing ourselves harm. For  if the breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina does come about, then the  probability of Croatia's territorial integrity ever being  attained will diminish.    We are also critical of the way the president of the  republic  directs the bodies of authority. From his office he tries  simultaneously to influence the work of parliament, the  government, the courts, and other important institutions.    [Orban] What are the chances of maintaining the balance in  parliament in the wake of your departure from the government  party? Can we expect an opposition majority?    [Mesic] There is a hard campaign going on against us, of the  kind that has not been experienced since the darkest period of  Bolshevism. Those who want to go over to the Independent  Democrats are exposed to great pressure. One by one they are  being forced, virtually daily, to withdraw or even not to leave  the government party. It is not only civil servants surrounding  the president of the republic, but also the president himself,  who try to talk these deputies out of joining us.    As for what kind of power balance emerges in parliament,  that  is difficult to predict. Anything could happen. But it is  impossible to alter the facts which led to the departure of the  Independent Democrats. It is my conviction that opinions can  only be influenced for a short time with methods such as these.    [Orban] You are the chairman of the [Croatian] Assembly,  that  is to say parliament. Josip Manolic, who likewise left the  ruling party, is chairman of the upper house. What will happen  now with your functions? Can you keep them, and could this  crisis lead to the calling of early parliamentary elections?    [Mesic] Your question goes to the heart of the problem. The  head of state is constantly alluding to democracy, but I feel  that he does not understand its essence [words indistinct].  Because to take steps, with telephone calls, to ensure the  dismissal of the speaker of the upper house cannot really be  described as a democratic method. The question is not whether  the speakers of the lower and upper houses of parliament remain  in their posts, but what kind of power relations will develop in  parliament. Parliamentary statuses cannot be changed from the  presidential office. One has to sit around the table and state  that the power relations have changed since the last  parliamentary elections and that the functions have to be  redistributed.    It is not only the Independent Democrats that have been set  up since the elections of two years ago; other parliamentary  parties, such as the Peasant Party, or the Istrian Democratic  Alliance, have also split into several factions. So, it is not  a question of dismissals but of a redistribution of roles.    [Orban] What kind of future are the Independent Democrats  offering to the Croatians? What would you do differently? For  example, what kind of policy would the new party conduct  vis-a-vis Bosnia-Herzegovina or the Croatian Serbs?    [Mesic] I believe that a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  unthinkable, because then it would be impossible ever again to  restore the territorial integrity of Croatia. The Croatian  Independent Democratic Party wishes to conduct open politics in  the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its view is that the Bosnian  Serbs must at all events be involved in the talks aimed at  reaching a settlement. We want a Croatia that is a democratic  civic state, which protects all its citizens, respects human  rights, and guarantees the rights of the nationalities living on  its territory. Croatia wishes to cooperate with its neighbors;  it will not erect a Berlin wall along its borders. So, we would  like to create a Croatia which fully accords with democratic  norms.

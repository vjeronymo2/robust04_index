			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Uruguay's voters block sell-off URUGUAYANS blocked President Luis Alberto Lacalle's most ambitious privatisation projects by an overwhelming majority in a referendum on Sunday, according to yesterday's official results, writes Our Correspondent in Montevideo. The official count showed that 71.2 per cent of the 2m electoratehad voted against five articles of Uruguay's public sector companies law. The law was passed in March but the president was forced by opposition pressure to call the referendum. The vote will prevent the government selling off 51 per cent of the Antel Telephone Company to foreign and local investors. Mr Lacalle's Blanco party administration had hoped to raise Dollars 500m by entrusting the profitable but overmanned Antel to a foreign operator. It had even picked seven telecommunication companies for a tender to find a partner for Antel. The president, a conservative who before the referendum had refused to consider other formulas for Antel's privatisation, seemed undeterred. In a televised message he said he would seek agreements with the opposition, insisting that he intended to push ahead with reforms in the two years left of his five-year tenure. Opposition politicians, however, saw the referendum vote as a victory, with voters crossing party lines over an issue that has pitted free market supporters against nationalists of all hues. Former President Julio Maria Santuinetti, a leader of the Colorado party, who criticised Mr Lacalle's privatisation plans, said the referendum proved that his own party and the left-wing Frente Amplio coalition were now the dominant forces in Uruguayan politics. Senator Alberto Zumaran, a rebel of Mr Lacalle's party who sided with the president's critics, called for a reform of Uruguay's winner-take-all electoral laws. 'Party lines were torn apart. There were factions on each side of the issue, especially among traditional parties. The referendum was the straw that broke the camel's back,' he said. The PIT-CNT labour leaders who spearheaded the campaign against Mr Lacalle's plan said the vote was a clear rejection of the government's unpopular economic policies. However, the financial daily, El Observador said that people had simply postponed the painful need to overhaul the state by rejecting Mr Lacalle's timid privatisation plan. Mr Lacalle has floated the public sector's deficit and eased inflation down to 60 per cent from over 100 per cent. But his policy of keeping public sector pay increases below inflation, coupled with plans to reduce the state presence in the economy, has caused innumerable strikes and widespread discontent. One in 10 Uruguayan adults work for the state. Mr Lacalle also ran into trouble last month when he granted the armed and security forces substantial awards after policemen staged a four-day strike and military officers demanded higher wages. Urugay's central bank officials acknowledged that those pay rises would spark more problems.</p>

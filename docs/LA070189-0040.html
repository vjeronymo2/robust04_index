			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF RIDE-SHARING  </P> <P> Warner Center's innovative ride-sharing incentive package is great news for  Warner Center employees and local residents alike. It should significantly  reduce the number of cars in and around Warner Center. I'm glad The Times  featured this new program so prominently (June 16).  </P> <P> The ride-sharing program and incentives are part of a comprehensive plan to  relieve traffic congestion in Warner Center. I created the city's Warner Center  Trust Fund to finance this plan, using $5.5 million assessed of local developer  Robert Voit. My office is developing the traffic improvement plan with the city  Department of Transportation and Warner Center businesses.  </P> <P> The city already requires future developers to be responsible for easing  traffic. The trust fund is a first because it also targets developers of  existing projects.  </P> <P> We're making ride-sharing as easy, stress-free and financially attractive as  possible. The incentive package includes fare subsidies for the first three  months, and a free month's fare after 11 months participation in a van pool or  bus pool. The "Guaranteed Ride Home" service provides a free ride home for  ride-sharing employees who have unexpected work or family emergencies during  the workday. With the hot weather and smog upon us, now's the time to jump into  the pool: the car, bus or van pool!  </P> <P> JOY PICUS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Picus is city councilwoman for the 3rd District.  </P> <P> </P></p>

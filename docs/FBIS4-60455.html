			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 25 May (MENA) -- Current OAU Chairman  President Husni Mubarak has stated that if the African  continent's struggle was designed to resist foreign powers that  occupied the continent, the crucial issue that imposes itself  today is to seek solutions for the inherent economic and social  problems that hamper the continent's march toward a better  future.    In a message he gave today to mark the 31st anniversary of  the OAU's establishment in 1963, President Mubarak pointed to  the achievements, particularly the Abuja agreement on setting up  the African Economic Group, which guided Africa's first step  toward economic integration.    The president affirmed that this achievement will leave its  mark on economic activity on both the regional and global levels.    In his message, President Mubarak emphasized that the  political achievement was made during the recent African summit  in Cairo in 1993, which ratified the Cairo Declaration on  setting up a mechanism to resolve African disputes within the  framework of the OAU through dialogue and reconciliation.    He added that the third achievement was represented in the  triumph of wisdom and political will in South Africa; a triumph  that resulted in the establishment of the first democratic,  nonracist government. He remarked that this government came to  reflect the will of most South Africans after three centuries of  struggle.    Mubarak referred to other African achievements, represented  in the pursuit of democracy and pluralism in most African  states. He remarked that these two things are bound to enhance  stability and create a favorable climate for the continent's  economic development.    As current OAU chairman, President Mubarak said that in  spite  of the political and economic achievements in 1994, some African  inhabitants persist in the obstinacy they developed as a result  of bloody domestic wars and disputes. He referred in that  context to deteriorating conditions in Somalia, Rwanda, and  Burundi in addition to other problems facing Angola, Liberia,  and other states.</p>

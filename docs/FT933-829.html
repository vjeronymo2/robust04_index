			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goodwin drops to Pounds 208,000 GOODWIN, the mechanical and refractory engineering group, attributed a sharp setback in annual profits to costs of streamlining its workforce and of development in overseas markets to combat the lack of domestic contracts. Despite increased exports, turnover for the 12 months to April 30 dipped to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 14.2m) and pre-tax profits tumbled from Pounds 402,000 to Pounds 208,000. Earnings per share were halved at 1.8p but the single dividend is held at 0.655p.</p>

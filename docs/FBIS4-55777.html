			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/5/1994 -- A return to  communist regime "is no longer possible. The old totalitarian  regime has been demolished. It is a dialectical process and it  is our duty to adjust to other rules, the rules of the end of  the 20th century, when the tendency to integrate all national  economies into the world economy is a dominant," President Ion  Iliescu stated during a meeting at the Oradea Municipality City  Hall.    President Iliescu admitted that adjustment to the new  situation has generated severe social issues, but pointed out  that the causes of such phenomenon must be traced down and  eliminated, rejecting the wish of some to return to the old  totalitarian rule. President Iliescu pleaded for dialogue as a  means to solve most of the social issues: "It is good to listen  to each other and to learn from the experience of each other.  This is the fundamental element that rules our democracy, for a  society keeps developing when all human potentials are being  capitalised," Iliescu said.    The meeting at Oradea City Hall took place after a visit  paid  by President Ion Iliescu to the Bihor County. "It has been a day  of fruitful contacts and dialogues that were beneficial for me,  for I had the possibility to directly get acquainted with the  issues confronting people and with their thoughts," President  Iliescu told a ROMPRES editor. "As a general feature, I would  mention the people's concern for the really big issues  confronting our economy, such as the financial blockage,  inflation and unemployment, as well as their wish for an  economic revival."    President Ion Iliescu's fact-finding trip is to include on  Thursday the Satu Mare County.</p>

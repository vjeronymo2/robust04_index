			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the French Prime Minister's Office on 22 </F> February on "the conditions of the restart of the Superphenix,  which will become a prototype reactor dedicated to research and  demonstration purposes"]    [Text] Creys-Malville, 22 Feb (LOGOS) -- The government  decided that Superphenix will no longer be operated as a nuclear  power station, but will become a reactor dedicated to research  and demonstration purposes. Renewed operation of the reactor  will constitute part of the effort to get control of the nuclear  network. The two main objectives are to carry out research into  the use of plutonium and to reduce the amount of long-term  radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel from nuclear  reactors, within the framework of the law on radioactive waste  management, dating from 30 December 1991. Moreover, Superphenix  will make a key contribution towards defining the reactors of  the future, destined to burn a higher proportion of natural  uranium, which today is only used in a proportion of 1 percent.  The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible towards  under-production, so as to limit the amount of plutonium  produced. With regard to safety, the government has taken note  of the conclusions reached by the safety authority, which  concluded that the renewed start-up of Superphenix could be  authorized on the following conditions: The work aimed at  combatting sodium fires must be concluded in a satisfactory way;  the start-up must be gradual, progressing in stages; the  production of electricity cannot be a primary goal; and, in view  of its prototype status, the operation of the reactor can be  suspended [at any time].  <H5>  Research Program Subject To High-Level Scientific Control </H5>   A steering committee comprising NERSA [European Rapid  Neutron  Nuclear Center], EDF [French Electricity Company], and the CEA  [Atomic Energy Commission] will have to present a knowledge  acquisition program taking account of the new guidelines imposed  on Superphenix. At the suggestion of the minister of research,  this program will be assessed by two scientists, Mr. Dautray and  Mr. Detraz. The implementation of the program will be followed  by a special scientific committee. Each year, this scientific  committee will submit a report on the experiments conducted in  reducing long-term waste to the National Assessment Committee,  which was set up under the terms of the law dated 30 December  1991. The experiments will have to be authorized in advance by  the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate. Every six months,  the steering committee will report to the ministers responsible  for research, industry, and the environment on the planned  progress and on potential difficulties foreseen in the  implementation of the knowledge acquisition program. EDF will  not be authorized to issue any orders concerning the level of  power at which Superphenix will operate, thereby allowing  maximum leeway for the knowledge acquisition program. Taking  account of the new guidelines for Superphenix, which will be  listed in the authorizing decree, the government will decide  whether to go ahead with the administrative procedure. The  actual renewed start-up will only be authorized when the  knowledge acquisition program has been approved. A statement on  this decision will be made by the ministers of industry, the  environment, and research on Wednesday, 23 February, at 1130  [1030 GMT].</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Burton report: "North Korea in Nuclear Warning to </F> Tokyo"]    [Text] A North Korean official warned yesterday that if his  country was to develop nuclear weapons, they would be primarily  aimed at Japan, rather than at South Korea or the US.    The warning, one of the most explicit made by North Korea  about the intent of its possible nuclear weapons programme, is  likely to heighten concern in Tokyo that Pyongyang poses a  serious military challenge. However, North Korean officials  claim they suspect Japan's nuclear motives, and the statement  yesterday came a day after the start-up of Japan's first  fastbreeder nuclear reactor, which began a self-sustaining chain  reaction.    Mr Cha Bongju, the North Korean ambassador to India, again  said his country did not intend to develop nuclear weapons, but  told the South Korean news agency YONHAP the North feared that  Japan would eventually become a nuclear power.    "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed  to contain Japan," Mr Cha said.    He added that a North Korean nuclear weapon would never be  used against South Korea or the US.    The statements could increase pressure on the Japanese  government to take a tougher line against North Korea over the  issue of nuclear site inspections. They will also provide  support for Japanese officials arguing that the country must  boost its defence capability.    North Korea has already developed a missile, the Rodong-I  [Nodong-1], that can reach most of Japan, although military  analysts believe that Pyongyang does not yet have the capability  of building a sophisticated nuclear warhead small enough to fit  on the missile.    But the ambassador's comments appear to confirm some  analysts' fears that North Korea might use the Japanese  fast-breeder reactor, which generates plutonium, as a pretext  for proceeding with its own production of plutonium, used in the  making of nuclear weapons.    It was the second North Korean warning this week that it  might be ready to resume plutonium production.    Some analysts in Seoul believe Mr Cha's comments might be an  attempt to allay South Korea's fears about the development of a  North Korean nuclear weapon by appealing to the traditional  Korean dislike of Japan.    North Korea has come under growing pressure to open up its  nuclear facilities to full international nuclear inspections to  dispel suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons.    Pyongyang rejected a request by the UN Security Council last  week that it accept new inspections of nuclear sites by the  International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

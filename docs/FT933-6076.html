			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Exhibitions away from the festival - Art at Edinburgh For all that the festival proper would rather have nothing to do with such things, Edinburgh is currently full of worthwhile exhibitions, with the National Galleries of Scotland offering a substantial quiverfull. The Queen's Holbeins at the National Gallery apart, the most important is the show of early-modern Russian painting put together by the Musee des Beaux Arts de Nantes, which has come to the Museum of Modern Art for its sole British showing. Its subject is the heroic period of Russian modernism from the turn of the century to the first years of the Communist state. The subject has been thoroughly investigated since the spirit of glasnost threw open Russian collections locked away these 60 years. Even so, drawn as it is for the most part from regional museums from Samara to Novgorod, this remarkable show brings us many works for the first time, fresh and fascinating. Not that it breaks new ground exactly: the expected names are here and no new reputations are made, no accepted critical analysis overturned. It is but an open celebration of the work as it is, in all its variety, and a poignant memorial to an historic moment and opportunity lost. For here was a national school of such vigour and originality that, had it remained within the mainstream of modernist development, might have profoundly moderated its course. Would the assumed authority of the Paris school have remained so persuasive for so long? Would the habit, now ingrained, of assuming there to be at any moment a single significant centre of activity, have taken such a hold? The questions hang in the air. As it was the Russians had influence enough, on the course of abstraction and constructivism especially, through such as Kandinsky and Malevich, and such work as remained in the west. The greater loss was to expressionism, which in its Russian manifestation - alive to developments elsewhere, in Germany especially, in the years before 1914  - brought to it a zest and geniality, wonderfully angst-free, derived from its alternative sources in the profound folk tradition. Goncharova, Popova, Rozanova, Stepanova - how important the women are - Falk, Filanov, Kravchenko, Larianov, Shevchenko, and Chagall, Malevich, Kandinsky and so many more besides: Cubist still-lifes, suprematist abstraction, streets in the snow, country villages, men talking, women working - it is a lovely show. * The National Galleries have also taken over the Royal Scottish Academy, filling its ample spaces with an ambitious historical survey of drawings, water-colours and prints by Scottish artists from 1700 to 1990. It is a dense and constantly intriguing show that holds many beautiful and remarkable things, yet it has to be said that it over-reaches itself. Set up under such a heading as The Line of Tradition,it invites an expectation of continuity and thematic consistency that in the event is simply not sustained. The landscape, the portrait and the figure, the colourist instinct, objectivity, romanticism - any one of these would have supplied a proper theme for a smaller, more concentrated and particular show. I am all for a miscellany, openly acknowledged, but even that would have been better for a shorter historical span. In this respect this show simply tails off into a token presentation of a few currently fashionable names allowed a disproportionate amount of space. None of this should put off the visitor prepared to immerse himself in the material and indulge his own interests and enjoyments. Scottish painting and graphic art from the 1880s well into the 1960s was especially strong and too readily disregarded by the world at large. There are many fine examples here - James Cowie's studies of his students, William Gillies' landscapes, James MacBey's first world war etchings, Walton's Black Bull beneath its tree. The large and so deceptively free water-colours of Arthur Melville alone are worth the visit. Much the same ground is covered by the Scottish Gallery in its truly miscellaneous survey of work by artists associated, as teachers or students, with the Edinburgh College of Art, since its foundation in 1909. In recent years especially the college has been a bastion of the painterly and graphic disciplines too lightly abandoned in the name of creative liberality south of the border some 30 years ago. With such mentors to hand as Gillies, Anne Redpath, Robin Philipson, John Houston, David Michie and Elizabeth Blackadder, it has remained a policy of creative conservatism beyond price. * Back at the Academy, the RSA itself has given over its basement gallery to the Imperial War Museum, to put up a small display of works commissioned lately from contemporary artists. The point it makes is important but could all too easily go by default. War remains a legitimate subject for the artist, whether we are engaged in any formal war or not. Without engaging in the artist's own particular polemic or moral debate, the museum is surely right to monitor the currency of such response on our behalf. Finally I have room only to recommend Phoebe Anna Traquair - Scottish decorative artist within the arts &amp; crafts movement and Celtic revival at the turn of the century - at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery until November 7, (sponsored by Baillie Gifford &amp; Co., General Accident, and Mobil). Russian Painting of the Avant-garde 1906-1924: Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Belford Rd, until September 5, sponsored by Scottish Power and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. The Line of Tradition: Royal Scottish Academy, The Mound, until September 12, sponsored by Dawson International, BSIS, Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise, and the Esmee Fairburn and Hope Scott Trusts. The Edinburgh School: The Scottish Gallery, 16 Dundas Street, until September 8. No More Heroes Anymore: Royal Scottish Academy, until September 12.</p>

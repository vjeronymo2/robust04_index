			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: More life bonuses announced NPI and Royal Life announced their bonuses on life assurance policies this week. Both followed the trend of cutting pay-outs on ten-year policies while leaving 25-year pay-outs relatively unscathed. Using the standard assumption of a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 monthly premiums, NPI left its 25-year pay-out unchanged at Pounds 51,989, while 10-year pay-outs dipped 8.8 per cent to Pounds 6,003. Royal Life's 25-year pay-out increased 12 per cent to Pounds 55,052, but 10-year pay-outs fell 5 per cent to Pounds 6,443. Neither office is likely to feature among the strongest performers for the year - for example Commercial Union is paying out Pounds 65,596 and Pounds 7,484.</p>

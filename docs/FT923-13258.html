			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (5): MasterCard gets a brighter image / Profile of Alex 'Pete' Hart WHEN MR Alex 'Pete' Hart, president and chief executive officer of MasterCard, left Harvard he wanted to be a footballer. It turned out, he says, that professional football was a great deal more exacting than playing in Ivy League games. So the young Mr Hart, born in 1940 and one of five children from Lancaster, Ohio, dropped his original career plans and set about selling lumber for commission. After six years, a chance meeting with a bank chairman produced a surprise invitation in 1968 to become a banker at BancOhio. Twenty years on, Mr Hart, by then executive vice-president of First Interstate Bancorp, was elected head of MasterCard, the world's second largest plastic card payments system. At the time he took over MasterCard, there was little secret that it was in the doldrums. Visa International, its West Coast-based rival, dominated the market. MasterCard had suffered a run of senior resignations. Its brand had a lacklustre image and outside the US, MasterCard seemed to have allowed itself to be eclipsed by local partners, especially in Europe where its branding was obscured by those of its affiliates, Access and Eurocard. Since then Mr Hart has worked hard to put MasterCard on an even keel. He says the main difference between it and Visa is that Visa is more of a glitzy card, and he has no aspirations to offer glitz. But he has made some significant cosmetic improvements to MasterCard's image. The branding marks on the face of the cards have been brightened up. A new debit card mark, Maestro, is being launched this year after a careful gestation. It is based on the assumption that debit cards are fundamentally different from credit cards: most consumers will have room for only one debit card in their wallets. Using Cirrus, the national network of automated teller machines which Mr Hart helped to found, MasterCard's cash machine facilities have been greatly enhanced. The MasterCard/Cirrus cash machine network now includes 77,000 cash machines in 31 countries, still some way behind Visa. He has also set up a network of regional offices for MasterCard which have given it greater parity with Visa outside the US. Its fastest-growing region is now Latin America. His most delicate diplomatic task has been to manage the relationship between MasterCard and the German and other north European banks which dominate Eurocard. There is still no sign of the north Europeans (other than the British) abandoning their cherished regional branding, but the working relationship between them and MasterCard has improved during Mr Hart's tenure of office. Does the international banking system really need two different brands of card payment system offering services which in the last resort are mostly more or less identical? Mr Hart believes that two networks create opportunities for choice and broader market appeal than would otherwise exist. In the short term, his goal is to reverse two decades of steady loss of market share to Visa. In the 1980s, such a hope would have seemed fairly forlorn. But Mr Hart has evolved a strategy. It is based on several assumptions. One is that MasterCard must distinguish itself through quality of its services and their profitability. Another is that MasterCard will displace Visa only if banks find it advantageous to push its products first. MasterCard claims to have a slightly better yield than Visa on its cards: in the long term, Mr Hart wants to raise the difference to around 30 basis points. By the time that point is reached, Mr Hart expects that some of the larger banks will be promoting MasterCard products rather than Visa. Since his membership overlaps almost exactly with that of Visa, the rivalry cannot be pushed too far. Anything that one system does is immediately demanded by its members from the other system. 'Duality (bank membership of both Visa and MasterCard) has been something of a curse which has spread across the earth,' he told MasterCard members at the organisation's annual conference in Vancouver in April. However, Mr Hart's third assumption is that with Maestro and the debit card, the era of look-alike matching products in the payment card world is probably drawing to a close.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister,  arrived in Abu-Dhabi today from Cairo after a two-day visit to  Egypt. Mr. al-'Attas had met in Cairo with the Egyptian  president, Muhammad Husni Mubarak, and held talks with the  Egyptian officials on the current situation in Yemen.    In a press conference, the prime minister said that while  democratic Yemen announced its preparedness to receive the  fact-finding commission and to cooperate with it and facilitate  its mission in order to achieve peace in Yemen and resort to  dialogue, the Sanaa regime refused to comply with the Security  Council [resolution] and the advice of the Arab leaders, among  them President Muhammad Husni Mubarak of Egypt, Shaykh Zayid Bin  Sultan Al Nuhayyan of the United Arab Emirates, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, king of Saudi Arabia, and the Syrian  president, Hafiz al-Asad. He added that the Sanaa regime had  (?accepted) conditional agreement on cease-fire and then broke  it up on weak excuses. This proves that there is open  contradiction in the decision making circle there.    He affirmed that the situation in the last 48 hours had  witnessed a dangerous escalation. The Sanaa regime used in its  attacks all destructive weapons, including rockets and  long-range heavy artillery. He indicated that the residential  quarters and utilities had been the targets of the rockets and  warplane missiles. Al-'Attas described the shelling of Aden  refinery as a sign of the times. He said that this operation  had shocked the Arab and world public opinion.</p>

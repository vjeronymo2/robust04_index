			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: All change on the Weston front - Maggie Urry looks at the reorganisation plans for AB Foods The complexity of the rearrangement of Associated British Foods' ownership belies the simplicity behind the plan. The need of the majority owners - the 40 or so members of the Weston family  -is to make their tax planning easier, while the minority shareholders of AB Foods, with 37.3 per cent of the company, need to be assured that they are not being disadvantaged in any way. The answer will be to transform George Weston Holdings, the current immediate parent of AB Foods, into an exact replica of its subsidiary, get a listing for its shares and change its name to Associated British Foods. Minority shareholders will end up with exactly the same number of shares in a company with exactly the same assets, and exactly the same board of directors. One layer of the hierarchy of ownership will have been removed. The deal requires approval from 75 per cent of those minority shareholders who vote at a special meeting on June 20. For their trouble, shareholders will receive a 10p a share special dividend, which compares with AB Foods 15p total payment last year. The entire cost of the exercise, which runs into millions of pounds, will be borne by the family. Lazard Brothers is advising the Weston family and Robert Fleming is advising AB Foods and its minority shareholders. Fleming said yesterday it was sure that these shareholders would be no worse off through the deal. One difference that the rearrangement may make, though, is that trading in the shares could become more liquid. Part of the Weston family's holding will in future be a direct 11.8 per cent stake in the quoted company. Another is that AB Foods will in future comply with the Cadbury code on corporate governance. Two non-executive directors are to be appointed and audit and remuneration committees set up. This suggests at least a formal bow to institutions' desire to see a board shaped more in the 'normal' public company mould. However, Mr Garry Weston, chairman of AB Foods, appears to have a dim view of the Cadbury guidelines. He says the two non-executives would 'do the job the institutions want done. The KGB job'. He says that AB Foods 'has been run for the benefit of shareholders because the family are the shareholders. There are no Rolls Royces, no chauffeurs. I don't think we need to be taught anything about corporate governance.' And he insists the family intends to retain control of the quoted company. He believes that family ownership has given AB Foods a long-term investment timescale, and allowed it to grow organically from a market capitalisation of Pounds 91m when he took the chair in 1967 to Pounds 2.7bn now. Over the same period the family has increased rather than cut its stake, and no new shares have been issued. But the reorganisation could be a small step on the road to an eventual reduction in the family stake below 50 per cent. If that happens, AB Foods could lose the advantages Mr Weston sees in family control for the sake of a becoming a company with which institutional investors feel happier. The reorganisation will make the ownership structure slightly less complex than the one set up by Mr Weston's father. At present, GWH holds a 62.7 per cent stake in AB Foods, and holds other assets worth about Pounds 300m. These comprise Pounds 230m of cash, mainly dividends accumulated from AB Foods over the years, plus a controlling stake in Fortnum and Mason, the Piccadilly department store, and some property investments. This company has been regarded as the 'family money box' but the family has been unable to get its hands on the cash. The plan is for GWH to sell the non-AB Foods investments mainly to its parent, Wittington Investments, and buy in 10 per cent of its share capital, paying Pounds 100m in cash to family members in the process and increasing the stake in GWH held by Wittington and by the Garfiel Weston Foundation, a charity. GWH will also pay a dividend to its shareholders and sell its non-AB Foods assets to Wittington. That will leave GWH with its stake in AB Foods and about Pounds 60m in cash, which will cover the Pounds 45m cost of a 10p special dividend to shareholders, and the costs of the reorganisation, including stamp duty. The share capital of GWH will then be reorganised to replicate that of AB Foods, and GWH will make its 1-for-1 share offer to AB Foods shareholders. AB Foods listing will terminate on Friday July 29 and the renamed GWH will obtain a listing with the shares due to start trading the following Monday, August 1. The special dividend will be paid on October 14.</p>

The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward a proposal  for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, a  proposal of reunification in the form of confederation based on  one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, as the  most realistic and reasonable way of achieving the independent  and peaceful reunification of the country on the three  principles of national reunification, the article notes, and  goes on:    The proposal of reunification through confederacy based on  one nation, one state, two systems and two governments is to  reunify the country by founding a unified one national state  while leaving the different systems and governments existing in  the North and the South as they are.    The DPRK's proposal for reunification in the form of  confederation is one based on national unity, placing the  interests of the nation above anything else.    It is also based on the fact that two different systems and  governments may co-exist within one national state. The  difference in systems and ideas cannot be a condition for  keeping one nation divided into two forever, nor can it be an  insurmountable obstacle in reunifying the North and the South.  The two systems can co-exist within one nation, unified one  state when they are based on the national commonness which has  been carried down through a five thousand year long history.    The DPRK's proposal for reunification through confederacy  indicates the way of reunification on the basis of the national  idea placing the nation above the system, and it is the most  reasonable proposal to realise the national reunification by  means of forming one confederal state, taking into consideration  the unanimous demand of the people who aspire after  reunification and the national commonness which has been formed  for a long period, under the present conditions in which the two  different systems exist in the North and the South.    No matter how the situation may change, we will make all  efforts in the future, too, to reunify the country through  confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful  reunification and great national unity in conformity with the  will and desire of the whole nation.</p>

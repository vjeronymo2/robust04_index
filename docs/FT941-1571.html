			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: KNP slides to Fl 343m net loss KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, expects to see a strong return to profit in 1994 after falling deeply into the red in 1993 as a result of heavy restructuring costs and difficult trading conditions in Europe, the company's main market. Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, said net profit would bounce back to at least Fl 100m (Dollars 52.6m) in 1994 from a net loss of Fl 343m in 1993, when results were influenced by extraordinary charges of Fl 320m. In 1992, KNP BT posted a pro forma net profit of Fl 116m. The company, created in March 1993 out of a merger between the Netherlands' three leading paper and packaging companies, was confronted with declining demand, overcapacity and lower sales prices in Europe last year at a time when it was trying to integrate its operations. The merger took place against the backdrop of the 'deepest and most prolonged' decline in paper prices in 20 years, Mr van Oordt said. The dividend is cut by Fl 0.10 to Fl 0.45. The company attributed the limited decline in the pay-out to its expectations of a strong improvement ahead. At the operating level, profit fell sharply to Fl 294m last year from Fl 538m in 1992. Of the group's four main businesses, only the paper merchandising and office products sector managed to hold operating results at 1992 levels. The paper sector and the graphic and information systems sector reversed into operating losses, while operating profits in packaging fell to Fl 295m from Fl 366m. Mr van Oordt said he was encouraged by increases in paper prices in late 1993.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE NEWSLETTER CREATES STIR WITH SCHOOL ITEM  </P> <P> Some parents, students and administrators from the Centinela Valley Union High  School District have attacked a Lawndale neighborhood-watch newsletter, saying  the city-financed publication was used to promote a candidate for the upcoming  school board election.  </P> <P> The Burin Avenue Neighborhood Watch Newsletter, which was printed at City Hall  by the city's neighborhood watch coordinator, was "immoral, unethical and  reprehensible," said Leuzinger High School Principal Sonja Davis.  </P> <P> She, along with others, criticized the newsletter during last month's school  board meeting, saying it represented a misuse of city funds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Appalled' by Politics  </P> <P> Virginia Rhodes, whose two sons graduated from Leuzinger, told the board: "I am  appalled that politics have become part of the city of Lawndale's Neighborhood  Watch Program."  </P> <P> The criticisms refer to an item in the September newsletter that said: "Many  members of the Lawndale Neighborhood Watch have expressed concern about gang  activity on the campus of Leuzinger High School. Some members have also  expressed their feelings that the present board does not admit the problem and  has not taken steps to deal with gang activity at Leuzinger.  </P> <P> "There will be an election for school board members on Nov. 7. Pam Sturgeon is  a candidate for the board. Her telephone number is . . . and she would like to  talk to anyone who has questions or concerns."  </P> <P> An estimated 150 copies of the newsletter were printed, and about 80 have been  distributed throughout the Burin Avenue area in downtown Lawndale, according to  members of the neighborhood group.  </P> <P> Nancy McKee, the city's neighborhood watch coordinator, said, "I don't see what  the big deal is."  </P> <P> The newsletter was written by Jane Cushman, the Burin Avenue watch captain, and  was not reviewed before publication, McKee said. "I don't feel I was hired to  be a censor for my block captains," she said.  </P> <P> After discussing the matter with the assistant city manager, McKee said, she  has advised all watch captains that newsletters funded by the city cannot  promote candidates running for public office. "I'll be looking at (the  newsletters) from now on," she said.  </P> <P> In an interview this week, Cushman defended the newsletter, saying that it was  impartial and did not promote Sturgeon's candidacy. "I am not aware that a law  was violated," she said.  </P> <P> Cushman, who has written the monthly publication for more than a year, said the  newsletter was only a report of what other watch captains told her during a  neighborhood watch meeting.  </P> <P> She called the controversy "a tempest in a teapot."  </P> <P> Sturgeon, who chairs the city Planning Commission and is president of the  Lawndale Chamber of Commerce, said she knew before its publication that the  newsletter would mention her candidacy but did not realize that it was funded  by the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incumbent Not Mentioned  </P> <P> She acknowledged that the newsletter should have mentioned the names of the  other candidates but added: "I have no problems with it."  </P> <P> The letter does not mention Ann Birdsall, the incumbent whose District 1 seat  Sturgeon is seeking. There are no other candidates for the District 1 seat.  </P> <P> Referring to the comments in the newsletter, Birdsall said: "I try to stay out  of politics as much as possible . . . (but) I don't like it, and I'm very  upset."  </P> <P> She said city funds should not have been used to pay for a newsletter that  mentioned only one candidate. In addition, Birdsall said gang problems at  Leuzinger were exaggerated in the newsletter. "I'm very angry that Leuzinger  has been slandered again," she said.  </P> <P> Nancy Marthens a Lawndale resident and community activist, has asked the Los  Angeles County district attorney's office to investigate.  </P> <P> Herbert Lapin, the district attorney's acting head of special investigations,  said he was notified about the newsletter last week. Lapin said his office will  review the allegations and will decide within two weeks whether to order a full  investigation.  </P> <P> Lawndale City Atty. David Aleshire said the newsletter may represent a  violation of Proposition 73, a campaign reform initiative passed by voters in  November, 1988. The law prohibits the use of public funds to pay for  newsletters or mass mailings for candidates running for elected offices.  </P> <P> The penalties for violating Proposition 73 include a fine of up to $2,000,  levied by the state Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> "Clearly, if (a newsletter) is put out at city expense it cannot be an election  vehicle for a school board election or city election," Aleshire said.  </P> <P> He said that he read the newsletter and it "did not make me happy," but that he  does not intend to pursue the matter unless the City Council requests an  investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cast in Bad Light  </P> <P> Some people are troubled by the newsletter because, they said, it painted the  school in a bad light.  </P> <P> Mike O'Hara a deputy with the Lennox Sheriff's Department gang detail, said  there are very few gang problems at Leuzinger because of vigilant school  security officers and routine patrols by sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> "We rarely get major incidents" such as shootings or robberies at Leuzinger, he  said.  </P> <P> O'Hara said the school may be relatively free of gang problems because gangs  consider the campus neutral territory.  </P> <P> Cushman said she wrote the newsletter without personal knowledge of a gang  problems at the school but was simply reporting what she had been told by other  watch captains.  </P> <P> "If someone wants to say there is no gang activity at Leuzinger, then I will  print that," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under Control  </P> <P> Davis said there are gang members who attend Leuzinger but insists that  administrators have been able to keep violence off the campus.  </P> <P> "We are very careful to secure the campus to keep outsiders outside. . . . We  have not had a knifing. We have not had any shootings on the campus," she said.  </P> <P> Jan Johnson, a 14-year-old sophomore at Leuzinger, said students and  administrators there have long been fighting the image that Leuzinger is  plagued by gangs.  </P> <P> "I'm upset because I have been fighting this battle too," she said.  </P> <P> Johnson, who spoke during the school board meeting, said in an interview: "As  far as I can see, there is no gang-related activity."  </P></p>

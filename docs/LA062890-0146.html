			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUARTE MAKING 'LEMONADE' OUT OF AUTOPLEX  </P> <P> The saying goes "if it rains lemons, make lemonade." The city of Duarte and the  Duarte Redevelopment Agency are definitely making lemonade. Unfortunately, the  Los Angeles Times focused on the "lemons."  </P> <P> On Sunday, June 17, the San Gabriel Valley section ran an article titled  "Duarte Ends Up With Lemon in Autoplex." The article highlighted the negative  aspects of the Duarte Autoplex/Educational Park Project, without giving fair  coverage to the positive prospects.  </P> <P> In terms of the closure of Duarte Nissan, Suzuki and Isuzu, The Times failed to  indicate the setback is only temporary and that five serious, qualified dealers  are bidding on this, the premier auto sales site along the 210 Freeway. We are  confident a new dealer will make the site profitable soon. In fact, Toyota of  Duarte and Duarte Mitsubishi are exceeding expectations in their nearby  locations.  </P> <P> With respect to the indefinite postponement of the Subaru and Volkswagen  dealerships, the development agreements very specifically protect Duarte to  ensure the development of auto dealerships on that site. A number of  dealerships have expressed strong interest, indicating that the Duarte Autoplex  continues to be an attractive location for the auto industry.  </P> <P> The Times article also pointed to the fact that Ford, Acura and Infiniti  dealerships canceled plans to build at the old Northview Middle School.  Although this is true, better opportunities and alternatives have come along.  </P> <P> Negotiations are under way for a regional commercial development which will  include a dinner-style restaurant and preservation of the historic School  District Administration building. This retail/commercial approach makes more  sense because the city will be able to recoup its investment twice as fast, our  revenue base will be diversified and convenient shopping opportunities will be  provided.  </P> <P> Rather than magnify the "lemons," The Times article should have focused on the  sweetest ingredient in the lemonade: the Duarte Autoplex/Duarte Educational  Park Project.  </P> <P> In the last three years, the city of Duarte has worked diligently with the  Duarte Unified School District to complete an ambitious, innovative  $15.5-million Duarte Educational Park Project, composed of a new School  Administration Center, a new maintenance facility, a new warehouse facility, a  state-of-the-art Intermediate School and nearly completed 500-seat Civic  Auditorium. This project has been made possible by the success of the Duarte  Autoplex.  </P> <P> Instead of comparing Duarte to Monrovia, The Times should fairly view the  current situation. We are happy for Monrovia's success but we are also very  happy with our own prospects.  </P> <P> JOHN FASANA, Duarte mayor  </P> <P> JOHN C. VAN DOREN, chairman,  </P> <P> Duarte Redevelopment Agency  </P></p>

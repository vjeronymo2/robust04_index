			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Mexico gives approval to finance groups Mexico has given preliminary approval to almost all the international banks, brokerages and insurance companies that applied earlier this year to open up subsidiaries. The finance ministry announced on Monday night that 18 of 20 banks seeking authorisation will be given licences, 16 of 17 brokerages, and 12 of 13 insurance companies. No decisions were announced for applications for factory companies, exchange houses, non-bank banks, and investment funds. Approval for one leasing company was given, although 12 originally applied. The government expected the new institutions to invest about Dollars 1.2bn after final authorisation. The finance ministry said foreign banks' capital will initially account for 6.25 per cent of domestic banking capital, against the 8 per cent limit set for 1994 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Brokerages will take up the maximum 10 per cent limit, with individual capital requests of applicants scaled back. Under the trade agreement, limits on foreign capital in the banking and brokerage sector are gradually increased until finally scrapped at the end of the decade. Non-US and Canadian banks applied for licences from their North American subsidiaries. The two institutions that were either denied or dropped their request were the International Bank of Commerce and Morgan Stanley (which received a licence to open a brokerage). With some institutions - such as Citibank, J. P. Morgan, Chemical bank  - making applications for banks and brokerages, the total number of foreign institutions that are to receive authorisations reached 40. With the exception of Citibank, the banks that received preliminary authorisation are expected to concentrate on corporate lending, leaving the retail market to Mexican counterparts.</p>

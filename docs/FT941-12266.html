			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Risk and Reward: Exploding warrants exploit volatility of emerging markets In the innovative field of emerging markets derivatives, Swiss Bank Corporation has come up with a new twist, designed to allow investors to benefit, rather than suffer, from the volatile price swings which typify emerging markets. SBC has launched a series of call warrants on a basket of Eastern European debt with a novel feature: they are exploding warrants. This means that if the price of the underlying basket rises to a certain level above the strike price, the warrant is automatically exercised. This structure, developed in the currency options market, has not been used before on a public emerging markets transaction. For the investor, the structure has several distinct advantages - and one clear disadvantage. The disadvantage is that the potential gain on the warrant is capped. But this allows the warrants to be priced much more cheaply. In fact, the cost may be as much as 60 per cent lower. This is important as emerging market derivatives are often prohibitively expensive as a result of of the volatility of the underlying markets. More importantly, even though they are European-style warrants (that is, can be exercised only on the day they expire), if the 'exploding' strike price is reached, cash payment to investors is triggered automatically. Not only does this remove the onus of tracking prices from the investor, it also means that investors will not have to watch their warrants rally for several months and then be caught by a sudden sell-off, which leaves the warrants to expire worthless. The basket consists of Eastern European commercial bank debt, which SBC believes will rally further if debt restructuring agreements are reached. The basket contains 25 per cent each of Bulgarian syndicated loans and Poland's trade-related debt, with the remaining 50 per cent made up of loans for Russia's Vnesheconombank. SBC has set the strike price at 47.5 per cent of the face value of the debt, and the explosion strike at 59.5 per cent. It the warrants explode, investors will have earned a 100 per cent return. The warrants cost Dollars 600, a 6 per cent premium. SBC will hedge its own exposure by using delta-hedging techniques, which require it to hold a proportion of the underlying assets. While the exploding structure is a new one, previous issues of emerging market warrants have been structured as knock-out options - that is, if the value of the underlying basket falls below a certain level, the warrants 'disappear'. These are even cheaper than exploding options, and they appeal to investors with a strong view on the market - in a volatile market they can be dangerous. Investors in two recent warrant issues by Societe Generale discovered this to their cost last week, when two knock-out warrant issues - one on Vnesheconombank debt and one on a basket of Polish and Vnesheconombank debt  -disappeared, because the down-limits on the long-dated warrants were hit. Consequently, Societe Generale decided to issue a further two tranches of warrants - also totalling Dollars 200m - on Thursday. The first are European call warrants with a down limit set at 32 7/8 per cent of face value, 5 1/2 per cent below the strike price of 38 3/8 per cent (the mid-price of Vnesheconombank debt at pricing). The second consists of European call warrants with the same strike price but without a knock-out feature. However, the second tranche is therefore more expensive, with an 8.4 per cent premium, compared with a 5 per cent premium for the first tranche.</p>

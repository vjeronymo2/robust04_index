This  announcement was made here today by the commander of the gulf  and Caribbean Sea Naval Force, Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza.    He reported that three of these four units (manufactured in  New Orleans) are currently operating in the gulf and Caribbean  area for a training phase. In March, they will initiate the  permanent surveillance.    Saynez Mendoza revealed that, in the surveillance operations  conducted in the Caribbean zone, an abandoned ship carrying 1.5  tons of cocaine was detected. As a result, the vessel was turned  over to the Cozumel Island sector, to be consigned to the  pertinent authorities.    He claimed that drug trafficking by sea has declined  considerably, although the Caribbean area is, of course, still a  troubled area. It is considered a traditional route for the drug  traffic from Central and South American countries to the United  States.    Stressing that the majority of vessels come from Colombia,  Venezuela, and the Grand Cayman Islands, where these boats are  detected while attempting to transport the drugs to the border,  he admitted that there are, of course, some of other  nationalities.    He concluded by noting that, at present, the No. 51 patrol  boat, Isla Coronado, the No. 52, Isla Lobos, and the No. 53,  Isla Guadalupe, are in this port for a training period. It will  be the No. 54 patrol boat, Isla Cozumel, that will be  commissioned in March.</p>

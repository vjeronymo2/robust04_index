			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking deletes section 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11) (Cross sections, maps, and plans) requiring slope measurements. OSM recognizes that premining slope measurements are needed to ensure that restored contours meet approximate original contour (AOC) conditions. The former rule was, however, redundant as it provided no additional information beyond that already available to the regulatory authority under 30 CFR 777.14(a) and OSM's technical information processing system (TIPS). In the 1979 preamble to &sect;779.25, OSM acknowledged that the required slope measurements could be derived from existing topographic maps or from measurements taken in the field (44 FR 15045, March 13, 1979). Since that time, OSM has found that most permit applicants derive the required measurements from a topographic map rather than from field measurements. Section 777.14(a) requires a permit applicant to submit a topographic map of the permit area which includes U.S. Geological Survey topographic features. Therefore, it makes no difference whether the applicant measures the slope from a topographic map, in fulfillment of the requirements under &sect;779.25(a)(11), or the regulatory authority measures the slope from the same or similar topographic map submitted under &sect;777.14(a) so long as the regulatory authority has adequate information on the slope of the proposed permit area to assure that approximate original contour will be achieved. Subsequent to the 1979 promulgation and issuance of &sect;779.25(a)(11), OSM has also made available to regulatory authorities the TIPS software and data analysis capabilities which allows both premining slopes and cross sections to be computed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters agreed with the proposal to delete &sect;779.25(a)(11) as they felt that the information is already available to the regulatory authority independent of any submission by the applicant. One commenter opposed the proposal on the basis that it is the operator's responsibility to supply the baseline slope measurement data. However, as discussed above, the operator is already required by &sect;777.14(a) to supply the appropriate topographic maps of the permit area which represent the baseline information for slope measurement calculations. All regulatory authorities also have access to TIPS systems and have the capability to calculate premining slopes and cross sections from the topographic maps provided. This same commenter alleged that the operator may not be able to demonstrate AOC if the regulatory authority is the only party with the slope data. OSM does not agree. Irrespective of the deletion of &sect;779.25(a)(11), the permit applicant must demonstrate in the plan, under the requirement of &sect;816.102, the ability to meet the performance standards for AOC. Thus, the deletion of this section does not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to demonstrate how AOC is achieved in the reclamation plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

The final rule consolidates requirements for premining and postmining land use and thereby eliminates redundancies in the regulations with a resulting reduction in the reporting burden on the public. This should result in a cost savings to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM has prepared an environmental assessment (EA), and has made a finding that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Balladur visits French troops in Bosnia French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid an unannounced visit to French troops serving with United Nations peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Balladur went first to Zagreb, Croatia, and was due to visit the Bihac pocket in northern Bosnia, aides said. He was accompanied by Defence Minister Francois Leotard on his visit to units which came under Serb fire last week, when artillery rounds hit French positions and a 22-year-old soldier was killed by a sniper. French commanders are reported to be irate since a request they made for Nato aircraft to strike back at the Serbs was turned down by UN commanders. The Bihac pocket, where about 1,300 French troops are stationed, is a Moslem-inhabited enclave surrounded by Serb troops.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN CALLS POLICE TO SAY HE JUST 'KILLED A BABY';  </P> <P> CRIME: HE LEADS OFFICERS TO BODY OF 3-YEAR-OLD GIRL FOUND WITH UNHARMED INFANT.  THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER, AN ACQUAINTANCE, IS MISSING.  </P> <P> Led to the scene by a man calling from a pay phone to say he had just "killed a  baby," officers broke into an apartment early Saturday and found a 3-year-old  girl dead, apparently stabbed repeatedly.  </P> <P> They also found a 9-month-old boy unharmed and took him into protective  custody.  </P> <P> Police arrested Michael Robert Pacewitz, 21, a church acquaintance of the  children's mother who reportedly had recently lost his job and reverted to  using methamphetamine. Police said Pacewitz called police at 5:54 a.m., then  waited to be arrested at a public telephone at Gilbert Street and Commonwealth  Avenue, about a mile from the mother's apartment.  </P> <P> Upon taking Pacewitz into custody, police said they found a kitchen knife in  one of his pants pockets. The suspect is being held in the city jail without  bail, police said, and murder charges against him are expected to be filed  Monday, with an arraignment to follow on Tuesday in Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Late Saturday, police still had been unable to locate the mother, Joanne  Boydston. Friends said Boydston, in her mid-20s and unemployed, had gone the  previous night to visit a friend, leaving the children in Pacewitz's care.  </P> <P> Investigators said that they had not clarified the relationship between  Pacewitz and Boydston. Acquaintances of both said they did not know whether the  two were romantically involved.  </P> <P> According to one neighbor, Pacewitz "seemed to be one of those 'born-again'  Christians. They (Pacewitz and Boydston) would be in the back talking gospel."  </P> <P> Both are members of Jacob's Well Christian Centre, a Fullerton church that  ministers to street people.  </P> <P> Robert Town, pastor of the church, said Pacewitz was drawn into the  congregation about a year ago when the church's outreach program encountered  him and his mother living in a low-rent motel in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "He and his mother came to the church one evening," Town said. "It was either  that night or shortly after that he became saved."  </P> <P> Pacewitz had had a history of frequent drug use, but he embraced religion, got  a job and appeared to have stopped using drugs, Town said.  </P> <P> But Pacewitz lost his job at a T-shirt store about three weeks ago, became  depressed and began acting oddly, Town said.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, he exposed himself before the congregation during a revival  meeting and later explained that he had resumed taking methamphetamines,  popularly known as "crystal," Town said.  </P> <P> "He was really into drugs, and we were just trying to get him to cope with  life," Town said. "It all just blows my mind that this all came down, because  he was doing so well. And then Thursday, he just flipped out and then went on  down the road."  </P> <P> Scott East, 27, whose apartment faces Boydston's, said he was awakened at 3:15  a.m. Saturday by "a thumping sound -- boom, boom, boom. That's when somebody  started yelling."  </P> <P> He said he opened his front door and saw men who live below Boydston's  apartment knocking on her door to check on the noise, but no one answered.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the little girl's name was Marcelin and described her as  blue-eyed with brownish-blond hair, usually unkempt, whose soles had turned  black from constantly going barefoot.  </P> <P> "She was always playing in the middle of the street," said one neighbor,  Yolanda Velez. "She just wandered around like she didn't know where she was  going." The girl seemed to be healthy, but "it looked like they didn't give her  a bath," Velez said. Another neighbor, Ron Whitacre, 30, described her as "the  sweetest little girl. She didn't shy away from people."  </P> <P> Gwen Armstrong, 25, said she occasionally baby-sat for Boydston. She said  Boydston always left the children with baby-sitters when she left but had never  before stayed away from home so long. The girl would have crying fits when  separated from her mother, Armstrong said.  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael Ashcraft contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike threatened at Russian gold mine A MAJOR Russian gold producing company is threatening to strike unless the government raises the price it pays for gold and meets other demands, according to Tass news agency, reports Reuter from Moscow. The independent Interfax news agency said the far eastern company, Yakutia Gold, had already decided to hold a two-week-warning strike on January 28 and planned further industrial action on February 10. Tass did not mention the warning strike at the state-owned company, which it said accounted for about 15 per cent of Russian gold output, officially estimated at about 150 tonnes in 1991. Yakutia Gold, which has three refineries, will strike from February 9 if urgent measures are not taken to haul the industry out of crisis, Tass quoted Mr Taras Desyatkin, the general director, as saying. He said Yakutia's gold producers were 'on the brink of catastrophe' as a result of heavy taxes, low gold prices and sharply rising prices for equipment and other goods. 'Closing the enterprises in February, in his opinion, is the only way to influence the government,' Tass said. Mr Desyatkin called on the government to review the producer price for gold, bring it up to world market levels, change existing tax policies and fulfil other obligations to workers.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U. OF MARYLAND CONSIDERS EX-LAKER COACH WESTHEAD  </P> <P> Ex-Lakers Coach Paul Westhead of Loyola Marymount College is the latest  addition to a list of basketball coaching candidates under consideration for  the opening at the University of Maryland, sources familiar with the search  process said.  </P> <P> Though it is not known whether Westhead was on the original list of candidates  given to the search committee, sources said he has since received a number of  strong recommendations, including one from University of North Carolina Coach  Dean Smith.  </P> <P> Westhead, 50, said Tuesday from Los Angeles that he had not been contacted by  anyone about the job, but he said he would be interested in talking with  Maryland Athletic Director Lew Perkins if he is called.  </P> <P> "I'd be interested to see what was going on," Westhead said. "Beyond that, I  won't make any decisions (about interviewing) until I see how serious the  university was."  </P> <P> Asked about a possible recommendation from Smith, Westhead said that he had not  heard of one but added that the two have been friends since his years at  LaSalle during the 1970s. Smith was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> After leaving LaSalle, where he had been a head coach for nine years, Westhead  became a Lakers assistant and took over for ailing Jack McKinney early in the  1979-80 season and coached the team to an NBA championship. Westhead was fired  a little more than a year later after a difference in philosophy with Lakers  star Magic Johnson.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / BSkyB plans pay-per-view football BRITISH Sky Broadcasting plans to introduce a pay-per-view system for Premier League football matches in two years - in time for the 1994-95 season. From next month the Sky sports channel will move to monthly subscription to start paying for the Pounds 304m Sky/BBC five-year deal with the Premier League. But it is now clear that Sky plans to start charging for individual matches in two years' time. A summary of the potential of pay-per-view football was set out in a report to the Premier League as part of the successful bid to take top-league football away from ITV. In the document Sky looks at the financial impact of charges running from Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 5 a match. The net revenues, given expected growth in the number of UK satellite dishes, range from Pounds 8.9m in 1994 for 30 games at Pounds 1.50 with a take-up of 10 per cent of subscribers to Pounds 697.4m in the year 2001 given a 30 per cent take-up, 60 games and a Pounds 5-a-match charge. BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - will develop pay-per-view as a 50-50 joint venture with the Premier League. The league will have to agree the number of games and the price structure. Sky has decided to introduce pay-per-view gradually. As the number of games covered by individual payments increases, the monthly charge for the Sports Channel will fall. From August 1 a Pounds 5.99-a-month charge for the channel will be introduced. BBC Enterprises plans to be involved in as many as five satellite television channels within three years. Announcing a fall in pre-tax profits for 1991-92 to Pounds 5.4m from Pounds 6.1m, Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of BBC Enterprises, the BBC's commercial arm, said talks had begun with a number of potential investors.

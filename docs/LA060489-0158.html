			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: 'DAUGHTER OF THE BALTIC' IS WORTH A SECOND LOOK  </P> <P> They call this city the "Daughter of the Baltic." Like many daughters she is  often stylish, handsome and well-groomed. Sometimes she is notably expensive.  </P> <P> As for the Baltic, it seems to wash up at every turning. Even the market square  lies in the shadow of ships and ferries waiting to sail to Stockholm or  Leningrad or Tallinn.  </P> <P> Sea gulls fly a maze of sorties over the open-air fish market, where  specialties are offered as well as species more easily identified by wanderers  from the New World. Alongside are vendors selling mounds of strawberries from  Holland and kiwi fruit from Italy.  </P> <P> Helsinki is the city of furs. While serious shopping takes place along the  Esplanade, one also finds furs at stalls near the harbor edge, in sight of the  ice breakers turned out by Finnish shipyards.  </P> <P> The stroller can pick up a mink hat for $170, or one in fox for $130 or blue  fox for $110. Bargaining is in order here, although not along the Esplanade.  </P> <P> Clothing at Marimekko, odd wooden sheep sculptures at Aarikka, glassware at the  I-Shop, home of Iittalia crystal, housewares and ornaments at Arabia, are all  found on the Esplanade, Helsinki's Fifth Avenue.  </P> <P> Finnish architectural taste is evident in its railroad station, the work of  Eero Saarinen. It was Saarinen's son, Eliel, who designed the TWA terminal at  John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, as well as the severe black headquarters  of CBS in Manhattan known as "Black Rock."  </P> <P> Architectural taste is also evident in the majestic Lutheran Cathedral  dominating Senate Square. Completed in 1852 after 30 years' work, the  cathedral's grand stairway is a popular place for Finns in search of a tan.  </P> <P> A statue of Alexander II, the Russian czar, stands in the square, a memorial to  his liberal attitude toward the Finns.  </P> <P> Surely one of the world's most unusual places of worship is Helsinki's  Temppeliaukio Church, which was hewn out of rock, then surrounded with quarried  stone and bound together with steel.  </P> <P> About 750 souls gather on purple-cushioned pews under a domed skylight to hear  a sermon, to see the candles flickering against the rock walls and to hear the  organ music filtering out of the pipes set into the stone.  </P> <P> Not a sound comes from the cluster of pipes that form the monument to Jean  Sibelius, however. They make up a sculpture by Eila Hiltunen that sits in a  small park near a sculpted bust of the famed composer.  </P></p>

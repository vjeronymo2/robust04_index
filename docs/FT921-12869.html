			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Swiss banks do their own thing - Different approaches to insurance marketing SWITZERLAND'S big three banks, known for following virtually identical marketing strategies, have shown a refreshing streak of independence in their recent advance into the insurance business in the plush Swiss market. All three are taking advantage of the deregulation of the Swiss financial industry two years ago, which has enabled insurance companies and banks to tread on each other's turf. They are also following the popular 'Allfinanz' or 'bancassurance' trends to seek synergies in insurance and banking activities established elsewhere in Europe. Yesterday, it was the turn of Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) to unveil its approach to Allfinanz, which is to form a joint venture with Zurich Insurance. Each company will sell products and services of the other through their existing branches and offices. By contrast, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, have decided to go it alone. CS, generally acknowledged to be the most adventurous of the big three, began operating its life insurance subsidiary, CS Life, in October, 1990, and UBS followed last month, setting up SBG Leben (UBS Life). The marketing strategies of the three differ considerably. The SBC-Zurich venture, which still does not have a name, will target high-earning individuals seeking to supplement their state pensions. SBC branches will offer them various insurance policies and pension plans from Zurich's Vita life insurance subsidiary, while Vita salesmen will push SBC investment trusts. SBG Leben is going after small company pension funds, following implementation of a Swiss law which forces companies with fewer than 100 employees to put its pension fund under the management of a life insurance company. CS Life, on the other hand, has focused strictly on its high net worth private clients, offering them big single premium policies that come with a useful tax break. 'I am happy we are not all taking the same approach,' Mr Walter Frehner, president of the executive board of SBC, said yesterday. It will be interesting to see which of these strategies proves successful. CS Holding said last autumn that CS Life had greatly exceeded its target since it began operations, and the other two are optimistic about the market potential. It will also be interesting to see how much the new arrangements ruffle traditional relationships between the big Swiss banks and insurance companies. SBC, for example, has an 18 per cent stake in La Baloise, but its Basle neighbour apparently was not interested in a partnership. Credit Suisse has close ties with Zurich, and Zurich officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, would leave the CS Holding board.</p>

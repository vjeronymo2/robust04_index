			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE REVIEW, SOMETIMES A DELUGE  </P> <P> "It's something you need -- the biggest advertisement you'll ever get. But you  only get it once and you've got to be ready."  </P> <P>  -- Duplex chef/owner Mark Carter  </P> <P> An empty restaurant is the single most feared disaster of every restaurateur.  But the alternative -- customers eager, even desperate to eat your food -- can  cripple newly opened restaurants, too.  </P> <P> Restaurant reviews pack restaurants, but a spread in a fashion magazine or a  blurb in a tip sheet often has the same effect.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful, but it's a nightmare, too," Cha Cha Cha's Toribio Prado said  recently. Shortly after it opened four years ago, the tiny Caribbean restaurant  was featured in three different articles within four days. "We'd been serving  about 20 or 30 dinners a night, and suddenly that Saturday, we were up to 180.  It was so crazy that night -- we only had one waiter, so Mario (Tamayo, Prado's  former partner in the restaurant) had to run around serving the food. I  remember he was wearing a white suit -- by the end of the night his suit was  gray. And we'd run out of food for the following day."  </P> <P> The Daily Grill in Brentwood was so overwhelmed by crowds during its first  weeks in business it had to stop serving breakfast. Customers had started  lining up at 6 in the morning.  </P> <P> And the phenomenon isn't new: Valentino was hit hard and fast by crowds  responding to a small mention in The Times years ago which praised Piero  Selvaggio's establishment. "You're talking to someone who literally went from  11 dinners on Saturday night, Dec. 23, 1972," Selvaggio says, "to 110 dinners  on Dec. 25."  </P> <P> The difference between Valentino and Cha Cha Cha is a matter of timing. When  Cha Cha Cha suddenly became hot, it had been open just a few weeks. Valentino  had been open several months. The extra time gave Valentino's staff the  seasoning it needed to handle the unexpected deluge of new customers without  disaster.  </P> <P> "The process of opening a restaurant these days is rather strange," Trattoria  Angeli co-owner John Strobel says. "You hire a lot of people who've never  worked together before and put them to work on equipment that may be totally  unfamiliar to them. Waiters have to learn to place orders, the kitchen staff  has to get to know each other's quirks, and the front door has to learn how to  book the restaurant.  </P> <P> "Then, let's say, three or four weeks after you open, you get a review -- it  doesn't even have to be a good review -- suddenly, you're doing 50% more  business and nobody's ready for it. And so instead of working on developing a  strong staff, you're working on dealing with the volume of people walking in  the door. The staff, instead of continuing to improve, actually goes downhill.  They get confused, they get anxious, they get overworked and tired. And you can  never recover from that."  </P> <P> "Now, it's more difficult than ever," Selvaggio says. "There's an explosion, or  exaggeration of restaurants. Most are somehow hyped out from the beginning,  because of a famous chef, because a famous group of investors -- these days, a  good review might be the icing on the cake."  </P> <P> A lot of restaurants, aware of the problems crowds cause, try to combat the  anticipated chaos with a tactical counterassault. They're rarely successful.  </P> <P> Joachim and Christine Splichal, for instance, tried to maintain control over  their new restaurant, Patina, by underbooking. But when a tiny, 200-word story  in The Times announced the restaurant's opening, crowds clamored to be fed as  at every other hot restaurant. Long waits for tables and short tempers  resulted. "We fill the restaurant to capacity, but the phone keeps ringing off  the hook," Christine said at the time. "You know, it's the hardest thing in the  world to tell someone: 'No, you can't come to my restaurant.' "  </P> <P> Certain restaurant staffers (usually not owners) don't exactly torture  themselves over dispensing rejection. When Santa Monica's DC 3 had been open  just two weeks, a caller seeking a reservation for the following week was  greeted with hysterical laughter, followed by a "You've got to be kidding!"  </P> <P> "The one thing I've learned about opening restaurants," says Trattoria Angeli's  Strobel, "is that they never turn out the way you think they're going to before  you open, never. No matter how much you prepare and research," Strobel says. "I  think it takes a restaurant a good year and a half to come into its own.  Unfortunately, a lot of restaurants aren't given that much time."  </P></p>

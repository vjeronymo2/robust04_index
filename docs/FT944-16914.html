			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Group sheds 450 jobs in restructure Eastern Group, the biggest of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, is cutting 450 jobs and investing Pounds 500m in its distribution network as part of a wide-ranging reorganisation revealed yesterday. The announcement brings to more than 4,000 the number of planned job cuts in the sector since the electricity regulator called for a reduction in distribution prices in an industry review in August. The job cuts and reorganisation are expected to bring annual savings of about Pounds 25m by 1996-97. Mr John Devaney, Eastern's chief executive, said this latest round of cost cutting would be the company's 'last major announcement for a little while'. Since privatisation, Eastern has shed about 30 per cent of its electricity workforce, which will total about 4,800 after the latest cuts. These will be spread over two years and are expected to occur through early retirement and voluntary redundancy. The cuts will be accompanied by a 30 per cent jump in capital spending over five years. Instead of maintaining the existing network, Eastern intends to invest Pounds 500m between 1995 and 2000 in technologically advanced equipment. 'We will have a company which is more capital intensive,' said Mr Devaney, 'but it will cost less to run.' Some 650 jobs will be transferred from the day to day operations of the core electricity business to implement the increased capital spending programme. Eastern is also reorganising the engineering operation of its electricity division, which will be operated through business units instead of regionally. All the associated costs have been provided for in last year's Pounds 38m charge. The market welcomed Eastern's announcement with some reservations. The cost cutting would improve profits but higher capital spending would soak up any cash flow gains. Furthermore, many had expected Eastern to announce further share buy-backs before its closed period begins on Wednesday. 'The market was looking for more excitement,' said one analyst. 'Yesterday's announcement was not a huge surprise to anyone.' The shares closed 1p down at 760p.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Reprieved pits will have 'no market' NONE OF the 12 pits reprieved by British Coal last month will find the markets on which their future depends, a conference will hear today. And only a couple of the 20 pits the corporation is offering for sale or lease will be taken up by private companies. Mr Gerard McCloskey, editor of the Financial Times International Coal Report, says in a paper prepared for presentation to the London conference on the coal industry that the 19 core British Coal pits will be able to provide all the additional coal that the electricity generators and other potential buyers need. If any of the 12 pits remain open, he says, it will be at the expense of the core pits, some of which may close as a result. Mr McCloskey's analysis is the most pessimistic to have emerged since the coal white paper, although British Coal executives say privately that they expect to start closing some of the 12 reprieved pits by the end of next March. The predictions provide a gloomy background for talks between British Coal and the electricity generators for additional coal sales. These are expected to start in the next month but few at British Coal believe they will yield more than 8m tonnes, less than is needed to save all 12 pits. Mr McCloskey says the squeeze on coal will be greater than previously expected because more gas-fired power is likely to come on stream than analysts had thought, and the government is unlikely to force the generators to keep stocks high. His analysis is based on generators taking an extra 10m tonnes of coal this year and 8m next. British Coal will provide the bulk of this. Pit managers, Page 15</p>

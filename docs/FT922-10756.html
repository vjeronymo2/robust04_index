			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Volkswagen chief seeks change in employer attitudes DRASTIC CHANGES will be required in long-standing attitudes governing industrial relations if European economies are to prosper, Dr Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen, told the conference. Dr Hahn, whose company this week faces the prospect of strikes, said the Marxist concept of a fundamental gulf between labour and capital had been consigned to 'the dustbin of history'. But employers had yet to dismantle the old demarcations and divisions which still characterised the workforce. He said the internal world of the company could no longer be one of 'upstairs and downstairs'. In all divisions and at all levels of corporate life, entirely new attitudes and qualifications were needed if businesses were to meet successfully the increasingly complex challenges confronting them. Employers, Dr Hahn stressed, had to create a climate in their companies which permitted all staff to contribute to the success of the business. The best solution to harmonious progress was to bring all workers closer to the creation and management of resources and to imbue them with a sense of ownership through increased participation and responsibility. Dr Hahn said the biggest challenge facing Europe was to spread capitalist principles across the continent. The liberated peoples of central and eastern Europe had to be given hope and must not be allowed to begin to yearn for a return to the old days of communism. It was politically essential that examples demonstrating the benefits of the western system were established in formerly communist central Europe without delay. It was 'the perfect place to build bridges, across which knowhow and capital can flow still further eastwards'.</p>

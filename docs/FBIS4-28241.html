			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Moresby, June 6 (AFP) -- Papua New Guinea's  opposition has lodged a no-confidence motion against Prime  Minister Paias Wingti's ruling coalition.    Opposition leader Chris Haiveta said Sunday that  parliamentary speaker Bill Skate was given notice of the the  motion on Thursday.    The motion, which nominates Haiveta as prime minister, was  filed by Bougainville MP John Momis and was signed by senior  opposition MPs, including two former prime ministers, Sir  Michael Somare and Rabbie Namaliu.    It was expected that it will be formally read out in the  house by the parliament's clerk this week. Under parliamentary  rules, the house can then wait seven days before taking a vote  on the motion.    Haiveta said in a statement that a change of government was  warranted because of what he described as mismanagement of the  economy together with the undermining of PNG's traditionally  good relations with neighbours and scandals among the leadership.    "Our cities are fast becoming the hell-holes of the South  Pacific, their infrastructure collapsing, their people living in  fear," Haiveta said.    Wingti, who seems to have a solid majority, has described  the  opposition move as unne@essary, labelling it "a cynical and  destabilising grab for power."    "If they are serious about this vote, where are their  alternate policies?" he said Sunday.    Wingti has the support of 70 of the 109 MPs in parliament.  To  get the motion through, the opposition needs at least a simple  majority of 55 votes.    For the motion to go through, one of the four coalition  parties would have to cross the floor when the vote is taken,  observers said.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FIRE DAMAGES HISTORIC BOURSE  </P> <P> Fire swept through the Brussels stock exchange early today, causing extensive  damage to the ornate 19th-Century building but no injuries, police said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said smoke was billowing out of broken windows two hours after the  fire started at around 6 a.m., apparently after an electrical main junction box  blew up.  </P> <P> The Belgian news agency Belga quoted a fire spokesman as saying the exchange  would remain closed all day.  </P> <P> Police said the trading floor and brokers' offices had been seriously damaged.  Electricity supplies to the building, built in the 1870s and housing several  works by 19th-Century French sculptor Auguste Rodin, had been cut as a  precaution.  </P> <P> Dealers' computer terminals melted in the fire, but the main computer, which is  in the cellar, appeared to be undamaged.  </P></p>

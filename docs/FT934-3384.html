			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Treasury confident about recovery The economic recovery looks set to continue with inflationary pressures staying muted, according to the UK Treasury's latest monthly monetary report. The document, prepared for yesterday's monthly discussion of monetary conditions between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, notes that 'recent monthly indicators confirm the picture of recovery continuing'. It adds that UK producer price inflation 'suggests inflationary pressures remain subdued'. Although the 40-page report does not discuss policy, avoids analysis and is generally little more than a description of all the money, inflation and activity indicators published over the past month, it strikes one or two upbeat notes. It judges that the trend in retail sales, as measured by the Central Statistical Office and the Confederation of British Industry, 'remains firmly upward'. Its overall view of the CBI's monthly industrial trends survey is that it implies 'total demand is holding up well following significant improvements earlier in the year'. It warns that official statistics showing that manufacturing output in volume terms was broadly flat in the third quarter might be 'slightly distorted' by the introduction of the European Union's Intrastat figures for export prices. These are used to construct the manufacturing output index. The report notes that the fall in the annual rate of underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, to 2.8 per cent in October from 3.3 per cent in September, has fully reversed the autumn rises from the summer's 25-year low. 'Most significantly, food and petrol prices fell between September and October having risen over the same period last year'. It adds that the fall in food prices preceded the latest announcements of price reductions by large supermarkets. The report points to only a very slight increase in producer price inflation between September and October, although it says 'anecdotal evidence suggests some businesses are still waiting for markets to strengthen before passing on input-related costs'.</p>

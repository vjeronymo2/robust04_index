			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Asdrubal Batista, Reform of the National Economy  minister, on the night of 30 May submitted his irrevocable  resignation from the post he occupies, because he disagrees with  some changes in the economic policies that are being analyzed.  Vicente Briceno has the story:    [Begin Briceno recording] It seems the resignation of  Batista, who was responsible for devising short-, mid-, and  long-term economic strategies, is because of alleged  disagreements with Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, who  has steered the economic path toward positions Batista refuses  to accept.    It was known the Executive Branch will not replace Dr.  Batista, because it is believed he achieved most of the tasks  President Rafael Caldera assigned to him. One such task was to  draft a report on the prospects of the Venezuelan Corporation of  Guayana.    Due to this situation, the economic expert reportedly  refused  to attend the questioning session scheduled for 1 June at the  National Congress. The Miraflores Palace could not confirm the  official report on Minister Batista's resignation. However,  unofficial spokesmen reported it as fact. [end recording]</p>

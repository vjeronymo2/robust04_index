			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Texas to make UK-designed chip A UK-designed microprocessor chip chosen to power an innovative electronics product has also won the endorsement of a leading US electronics manufacturer. The endorsement by Texas Instruments, the world's sixth largest semiconductor maker, means the chip will be used in cars and portable telephones and could give Europe its first significant success in microprocessors. Texas Instruments said it had agreed to manufacture and market chips designed by Acorn RISC Machines (Arm), a Cambridge-based joint venture owned by Acorn of the UK together with Apple Computer and VLSI Technology of the US. Olivetti, the Italian office equipment supplier, has a majority stake in publicly quoted Acorn, which supplies most computers used in UK schools. The world microprocessor market is dominated by US manufacturers, notably Intel and Motorola. The Arm chip is one of only two European microprocessors, both designed in the UK, to have made any impact on the market. The other, the transputer, developed by Inmos (now part of French Italian group SGS Thomson), has been used chiefly for high-power applications including supercomputers. The Arm chip has been selected by Apple as the heart of its 'Newton' personal digital assistant to be launched later this year, an innovative computer which is said to accept handwritten input. The chip is physically smaller than others but powerful and consumes little power. This makes it ideal for consumer electronics products such as mobile telephones or 'smart' cards. Texas Instruments intends to build it into systems for controlling car engines. The success of a new microprocessor design depends on the number of manufacturers who will licence the design. Arm has already licensed its design to GEC Plessey of the UK and Sharp of Japan in addition to VLSI Technology and Texas Instruments.</p>

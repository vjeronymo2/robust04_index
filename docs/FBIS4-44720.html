			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The European NH-90 Helicopter </F> Program is Judged Essential by Mr.  Leotard"]    [text] In a letter to 0livier Darrason, the  Bouches-du-Rhone UDF (French Democratic Union) representative in  charge of a ministerial committee for the European NH-90  logistic (support) helicopter program, the minister of defense,  Francois Leotard, evaluated the NH-90 "as being essential for  our (France's) (armed) forces and for the future of the  Eurocopter group." "Moreover," the minister continued, "the  Government considers the aerospace programs to be real  priorities. In spite of the difficult budgetary and financial  context, according to the prime minister's first evaluation of  defense programs, our defense modernization is allowed to  continue."    Before the National Assembly's Defense Committee, the  Eurocopter group's president, Jean-Francois Bigay, stated that  "the cost of the NH-90 program has been 1.376 billion ECU," that  is, more than 1.3 billion French francs [Fr]. The French  participation stands at 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion for  Eurocopter France and Fr3.9 billion for the French Government).  Then Mr. Bigay added: "The cost per unit of an NH-90 is Fr85  million" for the army, "and Fr135 million" for the navy models.    The four countries participating in the program (France,  Germany, The Netherlands, Italy) ordered a total of 726 crafts,  while the export market, outside Europe, has been estimated at  approximately 500 "machines." Today this program is very much  endangered by reductions of the defense budgets in the four  participating countries.</p>

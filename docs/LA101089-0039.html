			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A real estate investment firm will close and absorb a $675,000 loss rather than  continue an association with its manager -- a former federal housing official  linked to recent scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  New York Newsday reported. Eagle Capital Ltd. is shutting down, but Joseph  Monticciolo, former New York regional administrator for HUD, will go to work at  other companies of the firm's founder, the newspaper quoted Eagle's lawyer as  saying. Monticciolo, HUD regional administrator from 1981 to 1988, testified in  July before a House subcommittee that he earmarked large sums of HUD money for  developers who later became partners at Eagle Capital.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] wants to capture the capital of Huila Province's  Jamba Mineira District. Jonas Savimbi's men are applying  pressure on the area and have already carried out a number of  attacks, which have all met with a prompt response from the  government forces.    Over the last few days, UNITA moved and deployed three  battalions over a radius of 15 km north and east of Jamba  Mineira District. (?The next) will be UNITA's fourth attack on  the area this month and its aim is to occupy it. The UNITA  forces were repelled in the first three clashes, leaving 38  soldiers killed on the ground, along with the equipment they  were carrying.    On 14 April one UNITA battalion attacked Jamba Commune in  Lubango District, but Savimbi's men met with stiff resistance  and were put to flight. They left 17 soldiers killed on the  ground and our forces also took three prisoners. [passage  omitted]    The precarious calm that has prevailed over Cuito was broken  yet again yesterday. Jonas Savimbi's men and their weapons made  it clear that the city and its residents could once again  experience the horrors of war at any time.    Yesterday morning the UNITA [word indistinct] troops  attacked  government positions in the northern part of Cuito. The  10-minute attack occurred at about 0700 and resulted in the  death of one child. Sources in the Angolan Armed Forces  Operational Command have disclosed that the UNITA forces are  continuing to carry out provocative operations to try and find a  pretext that would allow them to fulfill their plans to attack  Cuito. That source added that, as part of their provocative  ploys, on 23 April they fired a shell at the government position  in the north of Cuito.</p>

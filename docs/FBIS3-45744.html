The remarks by the  89-year-old senior leader were published in a commentary by the  People's Daily under the headline of "Three Major Questions  Concerning the Building of Spiritual Civilisation in a Market  Economy". The leader said that China's goal of "common  prosperity" would be doomed to failure if the ruling party  failed in maintaining the "spiritual purity" of its people and  combatting negative influence from the capitalist world.    The article says that according to the senior leader  ideological and cultural progress is designed to train a new  generation of people to have lofty ideals, moral integrity, a  good education and a high sense of discipline.    The newspaper also maintained that a patriot must be loyal  to  the Chinese Government led by the Communist Party. "Some people  say that patriotism does not mean love for the Communist Party,"  the article says. "But Comrade Xiaoping rejected that and asked  if motherland was an abstract concept. If a person does not  love the socialist New China under the leadership of the Chinese  Communist Party, what else can he love?" Mr Deng was quoted as  asking.    In his view, the promotion of patriotism is essential to  enhancing national self-esteem and self-confidence in the  current reform and opening of the country to the rest of the  world.    The article quoted the senior leader as attacking artists  who  have become increasingly "commercialised" and lost in the  pursuit of personal wealth. "Ideological and cultural  departments must produce more spiritual fruits for the people  and resolutely stop the production, import and circulation of  poor quality products," Mr Deng said.    Although the patriarch retired from all official posts in  1991. Mr Deng is still regarded as the final decision maker in  national politics.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS NO MATCH FOR MAGRANE, 2-1;  </P> <P> CARDINAL PITCHER WINS ON 5-HITTER  </P> <P> Joe Magrane seems to be gaining an appreciation for his teammates.  </P> <P> Magrane pitched a five-hitter for his third straight victory as the St. Louis  Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 2-1, Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "It keeps everybody in the game," Ozzie Smith said of Magrane's effort. "His  last two outings have been very indicative of what can happen if he allows the  guys behind him to play."  </P> <P> Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said Magrane needed only 76 pitches to get  through the first eight innings of the game, which was played in two hours and  12 minutes.  </P> <P> "He threw 12 in the ninth. He threw 10 of them to (Mike) Marshall," Herzog  said. "He's capable of going out there and throwing that kind of game every  time."  </P> <P> Magrane, who has been bothered intermittenly by tender elbow, relied heavily on  his fastball to beat Los Angeles for the second time this season.  </P> <P> "He proved you don't have to strike everybody out to win; you've just got to  get them out," Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said. "Magrane kept the ball down  and got ahead of the hitters."  </P> <P> The Cardinals scored two runs in the first inning off Fernando Valenzuela, 4-7.  Jose Oquendo followed Vince Coleman's double and 44th consecutive successful  stolen base with a sacrifice fly. Ozzie Smith then doubled and scored on Pedro  Guerrero's single.  </P> <P> Magrane, while lowering his earned-run average to 3.24, struck out one and  walked two en route to his fourth complete game in his last six starts.  </P> <P> Since coming off the disabled list on April 30, Magrane has a 7-4 record and a  1.85 ERA. Overall, he is 8-6.  </P> <P> "If there's one thing I really want to do it's be able to win all the close  games," Magrane said. "That can't happen all the time, but I can do a better  job than I was before."  </P> <P> Mickey Hatcher tripled with two outs in the first inning on a drive that got  past Milt Thompson in right-center and scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> It was the Cardinals' fourth victory in five games. The Dodgers lost for the  fifth time in seven games.  </P> <P> Guerrero's RBI was only his third in 17 games. Coleman, who was last caught  stealing on a pickoff play last Sept. 15, has stolen 38 bases -- tops in the  major leagues -- this season.  </P> <P> Valenzuela allowed four hits and struck out six before leaving for a  pinch-hitter in the seventh.  </P> <P> "The only way we can win games , since we're not hitting, is to pitch a  shutout," Lasorda said in describing Los Angeles' biggest problem. "Fernando  pitched a good game, but we're not hitting."  </P></p>

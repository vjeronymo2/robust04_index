			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TURMOIL IN NICARAGUA  </P> <P> After reading Pat Buchanan's piece on President Bush ("We'll All Soon Know What  Bush Is Made Of," Op-Ed Page, Nov. 5), my immediate response is: Doesn't  Buchanan know the difference between a fascist and a Marxist? How can a  Marxist-Leninist like Daniel Ortega also be a fascist? That is like Ronald  Reagan advocating total government intervention for all problems.  </P> <P> HOWARD COHEN, Sepulveda  </P></p>

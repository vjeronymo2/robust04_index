			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rebecca Maer, PA News] </F>   [Text] A British Army officer was forced at gunpoint by  Bosnian Serbs to read a filmed confession which was shown on  local television, a United Nations spokesman said today. The  Ministry of Defence [MoD] tonight confirmed details of the  incident at the notorious Rogatica checkpoint near the Muslim  town of Gorazde, but said it was not officially releasing the  name of the officer involved. The UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] in former Yugoslavia said the incident happened a  week ago when Major Tony Randall of the Royal Engineers and five  soldiers were detained at the checkpoint for 10 hours by 40  Bosnian Serb troops.    Their weapons were taken and they were forced to sit with  hands on head at gunpoint. Then Major Randall was forced to  read an apology to the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic of  Srpska after local troops alleged his convoy failed to stop at  the checkpoint. They were eventually released unharmed but the  only confiscated weapon to be returned was the Major's pistol,  minus ammunition. The confession was screened on local  Serb-controlled television near Sarajevo on Thursday night and  was video taped by REUTERS Television.    The MoD added that UNPROFOR made an official complaint to  the  Bosnian Serb Army and asked for the weapons back. A Ministry  spokesman said the British convoy, a Land Rover and two lorries,  passed through an unmanned checkpoint as they left Gorazde  having obtained prior clearance.    The soldiers attempted to make contact with local forces and  waited 20 minutes but received no response. They then moved on  to a second point where they were stopped, searched and  disarmed. The Major was forced to write a statement of apology  but when this failed to satisfy the Serbs he was made to rewrite  it and read it out in front of a camera.    Reuters quoted Major's "statement" as saying: "I realise by  my actions I have insulted the Rogatica Brigade, the army of the  Republic of Srpska and the state of the republic of Srpska." He  added that "in my rush to get through the checkpoints I was both  rude and incautious".    UNPROFOR spokesman Major Dacre Holloway dismissed the  dictated apology and said there had been many problems at this  checkpoint, including the hold-up for almost a week of a convoy  from French charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. "Our  understanding is that the Major believed he and his men were in  danger and the price to pay by writing this statement was  relatively small," Major Holloway said, adding that it was not  the first time this had happened to UN forces at checkpoints in  Bosnia.    -- Earlier this month 168 soldiers in the Duke of  Wellington's Regiment were delayed at the Rogatica checkpoint  while trying to make their way to Gorazde.</p>

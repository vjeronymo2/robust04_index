			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Russian Federation Council decided to  appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to examine the  anti-crime decree issued by President Boris Yeltsin.    A total of 64 deputies (36 percent of the total number)  voted  for this decision. In accordance with provision 125 of the  Constitution, at least one fifth of the Federation Council  deputies must back an appeal to the Constitutional Court.    The appeal was initiated by deputies Aleksandr Belyayev,  Yuriy Boldyrev and Aleksey Manannikov.    Belyayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that the  Constitutional Court could consider the appeal this autumn after  the State Duma adopted the law on Constitutional Court at second  reading.</p>

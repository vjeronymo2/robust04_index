			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / InterCity wants targets eased BRITISH Rail's InterCity sector has told the government that it cannot meet punctuality targets on some routes because lack of investment is making services unreliable. It has asked for changes in the Passenger's Charter to allow for lower standards on routes such as the west coast main line between London Euston, the West Midlands and the north-west. However, it may also accept tougher standards for services on the east coast main line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh, which has recently been modernised at a cost of Pounds 700m. The performance targets require InterCity to get 90 per cent of its trains to their destinations within 10 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. In the year to March, it managed only 84.1 per cent. Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, said it was unrealistic to expect all lines to perform to the same standard because they had widely differing characteristics. He wants to switch to the system used by Network SouthEast which has different targets for each of 15 different routes depending on the amount of modernisation they have undergone. Mr Green singled out the west coast main line which he said was deteriorating badly because the government had yet to approve a Pounds 350m programme of spending on urgently needed track works. An announcement on the targets for next year is expected next month. The Department of Transport said punctuality targets would remain as demanding as possible and be raised where realistic.</p>

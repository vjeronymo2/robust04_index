			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Monk's order inspires followers Columns of accountants are converging on Edinburgh today to pay homage to the author of the first manual of double-entry bookkeeping published 500 years ago. More than 100 accounting historians will be gathering in the city as guests of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which says it is the world's oldest professional body for accountants. The two-day festival of accounting - renamed the siesta of accounting by unkind observers - is designed to celebrate the life and works of Friar Luca Pacioli, an Italian monk. Among his many contributions to learning was documentation of the principles of accountancy known as 'the Italian method' - for every credit there is a corresponding debit. These have remained unchanged ever since. The festivities began yesterday with the planting of a red oak in Queen Street Gardens in memory of Pacioli. This delayed the start of the institute's council meeting. There will be a Pacioli seminar today and an ambitiously-named session, 'A torch for the future', tomorrow to consider how the profession may change. Rival professional bodies have recently been battling to come up with a range of events to praise Pacioli during 1994. Events are planned later this year by Italian, US and international accounting bodies. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week unveiled an exhibition on Pacioli called 'Figures in proportion', which displays an original copy of his 1494 book, Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni and Proportionalita. As Pacioli concluded in his book: 'Accounts are nothing else than the expression in writing of the proper order of your affairs.' The Scottish institute will also have its version of the book on display, although its attempts to launch a similar exhibition failed through lack of sponsorship. The English institute said proudly that 83 people had visited the exhibition since it opened last Thursday, which was 'above expectations'. These included the provincial curator of the Franciscan Order in London, the order of which Pacioli was a member. The Scottish accountants are expected to turn up in larger numbers, though they have shown that they also have a sense of proportion. Some 125 are expected for the Pacioli seminar today, and 215 for the conference on Friday. However 232 are booked in for the final event tomorrow evening - a celebration dinner to close the festival.</p>

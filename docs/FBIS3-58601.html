			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Franco Vernice: "Bossi Winds Up the Loser in TV </F> Trial"]    [Text] The Lega under attack. The verdict of six  "jurors" in the duel between Di Pietro and the senatur.    Mannheimer: "It was a serious blow for the Lega."  Pontiggia: "It damaged their image."    Milan--Who was the victor in the televised Cusani trial? the  solid Antonio Di Pietro from Montenero di Bisaccia or the lively  Umberto Bossi from Cassano Magnago? Or wouldn't it be fairer to  declare it a tie? No, says our ideal jury. Once the televisions  were turned off and the newspapers set aside, this was no tie:  Bossi was defeated, even on technicalities. He limited the  damage, but he still lost. Let us hear from our first juror,  sociologist and Lega expert Renato Mannheimer: "During the  trial, each played their own role, but Bossi is in serious  trouble politically because he will now be lumped together with  all the others. This event will cause him great harm in his  field."    Who could profit from the Lega leader problems? Mannheimer  immediately names two of his most direct competitors among the  moderates: "Berlusconi and Segni, but...." But what? "But we  will have to see if they are able to capitalize on the  situation." And how did the fighter Bossi do in the courtroom?  According to Mannheimer: "He tried to act like someone who does  not know the law in order to escape from it." Did he succeed? "  It would be interesting to determine what impact his deposition  had on the Leghists, but unfortunately I have no data." And what  does the sociologist Mannheimer think of this televised trial,  which was able to draw as many viewers as the music festival of  Sanremo? "The trial reflects the transition from the First to  the Second Republic. It is history as it happens, and that is  the way it should be, without the intervention of either the  professors or the journalists."    Even the architect Gae Aulenti thinks Wednesday "was not a  very good day for leader Umberto Bossi. It came out that the  Lega definitely did take money. However, someone who is unable  to form a subtle opinion of Bossi may very well continue to  follow him through thick and thin." Ornella Vanoni, who is busy  on tour these days, was unable to watch the Cusani trial on  television. However, she also sees clouds forming on the horizon  for the Lega and the senatur:: "They admitted talking  the money, right? I think their reputation will be damaged  because people used to think they were angels. Not me, because I  have never believed in angels."    The writer Giuseppe Pontiggia says he was made uneasy by  what  he saw on television: "I felt embarrassed. The Lega's good name  was muddied because they were unable to avoid committing  wrongful deeds, although they are hardly to be compared to those  committed by the others. The problem is that if someone wants to  offer an alternative model, then they have to know how to behave  coherently." However, the novelist feels that Umberto Bossi may  have to pay a dearer price to the voters for his political  vacillations and awful language than for the 200 million lire  received from Montedison. But is it a good thing or a bad thing  to gather round to watch a trial as if it were a theatrical  production, or even a boxing match? Pontiggia says: "Drama is  part of the particular period we are in, and I believe it is  almost inevitable that this is the way it should be, even though  from a strictly judicial point of view, we may have gone too  far."    The painter Enrico Baj, cultural councilor on the Lega town  council of Varese for a few days, until he resigned amidst  controversy, is adamantly against televised justice: "In Italy,  there used to be the commedia dell'arte, or comedy of art, but  today we have the comedy of justice, with everyone up there  trying to look good." Did Bossi achieve his goal? "He played the  populist, as always, which will eventually weaken Bossi the  politician. At first he gathered the protest vote, but now the  people want more. The Lega has either not known how, nor been  able, to create a valid base for itself that was independent of  the impromptu brainstorms of its leader. Also, when these same  Leghists went to Rome, they started acting like the Romans." But  Bossi did earn some points in court, didn't he? "Bossi should  have limited himself to admitting his guilt and then kept  silent. Instead, he behaved like a driver who, when he is caught  redhanded by a policeman in a strictly no parking zone, still  finds something to argue about. I do not understand why he  agreed to play this part."    Mario Rodriguez, campaign expert and authority on political  communications, offers another interpretation of the  confrontation between Di Pietro and Bossi: "The public  prosecutor looked straight at the camera, totally aware of the  dramatic role he was playing. Instead, I thought Bossi was more  spontaneous, but also more uncouth. In the end, I think I  understood that certain things--certain behaviors--which today  we all think are illegal, were standard procedure in 1992, which  no one could escape, not even--although to a very small  degree--the Lega. And I also realized that, deep down, the new  Bossi has an old face. In any event, I believe that this  demonstration will not affect his showing in the elections by  more than 5 percent. On the other hand, we still have to see  what influence the presence of Mario Segni and Silvio Berlusconi  will have on him.</p>

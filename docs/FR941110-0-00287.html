Undocumented observations of this taxon have been reported from Lihue and Olokele Canyon on Kauai (Bates 1990). On Oahu,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hibiscus brackenridgei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> mokuleianus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was known historically from scattered locations in the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1992e18, 1992e21, 1992e22, 1992e24). Within a 12 by 5 km (7.5 by 3 mi) area extending from Puu Pane to Kealia-Kawaihapai are three current populations (1992e19, 1992e20, 1992e23, 1992e25; HPCC 1990d). The northernmost population, consisting of three individuals and occupying an area of 10 to 100 sq m (110 to 1,080 sq ft), is in the mountains south of the Dillingham Military Reservation at an elevation of 170 m (560 ft) on privately owned land (HHP 1992e25, HPCC 1990d). Another population is known from two adjacent gulches between the Dupont Trail and Puu Iki at elevations between 120 and 240 m (400 and 800 ft) (HHP 1992e19, 1992e23). This population on privately owned land consists of three to five individuals in an area measuring not more than 0.25 sq km (0.1 sq mi) (HHP 1992e19, 1992e23). A population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hibiscus brackenridgei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> mokuleianus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> reported from the Puu Pane area has not been seen for more than 40 years (HHP 1992e20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hibiscus brackenridgei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occurs in lowland dry to mesic forest and shrubland from 130 to 800 m (425 to 2,625 ft) in elevation (Geesink  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990; HHP 1992e1, 1992e4, 1992e5, 1992e8, 1992e14, 1992e19, 1992e25). Associated plant species include `a`ali`i, alahe`e,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Erythrina sandwicensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (wiliwili),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reynoldsia sandwicensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (`ohe), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sida fallax  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (`ilima) (HHP 1992e1 to 1992e3, 1992e6, 1992e8, 1992e20, 1992e23, 1992e25). The primary threats to this species are habitat degradation and possible predation by pigs, goats, axis deer, and cattle; competition with alien plant species; road construction; and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1931, the name  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyperus pennatiformis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was published by Georg Kukenthal based on a specimen collected from Hana on Maui (Christophersen and Caum 1931). He also described a variety of the species, variety  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bryanii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , for plants collected from the Northwestern Hawaiian Island of Laysan. Tetsuo Koyama recombined the species under the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mariscus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and maintained the two subspecific taxa as subspecies (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mariscus pennatiformis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (NCN), a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), is a perennial plant with a woody root system covered with brown scales. The stout, smooth, three-angled stems are between 0.4 and 1.2 m (1.3 and 4 ft) long, slightly concave and 3 to 7 mm (0.1 to 0.3 in) in diameter in the lower part. The three to five linear, somewhat leathery leaves are 8 to 17 mm (0.3 to 0.7 in) wide and at least as long as the stem. Each flower cluster, umbrella-shaped and moderately dense, is 4 to 15 cm (1.5 to 6 in) long and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in) wide. About 5 to 18 spikes, comprised of numerous spikelets, form each cluster. Each spikelet, measuring about 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in) in length, is yellowish brown or grayish brown and is comprised of 8 to 25 densely arranged flowers. The glumes (bracts beneath each flower), which are less than twice as long as wide, are spreading and overlap tightly. The lowest glume does not overlap the base of the uppermost glume. This species differs from other members of the genus by its three-sided, slightly concave, smooth stems; the length and number of spikelets; the leaf width; and the length and diameter of stems. The two subspecies are distinguished primarily by larger and more numerous spikelets, larger achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits), and more overlapping and yellower glumes in ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pennatiformis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as compared with ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bryanii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Koyama 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

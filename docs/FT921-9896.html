			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Scottish American 16% rise over year Over the 1991 year, net asset value of Scottish American Investment increased by 16.4 per cent, from 113.1p to 131.7p. The trust's principal markets had shown good increases, said Mr Jack Shaw, chairman, and the company benefited from being fully invested in the first half and taking a more cautious view in the second. 'The cautious disposition of the portfolio at the end of the year reflects our belief that the next few months will be difficult for equity markets,' the chairman stated. In the year total revenue was little changed at Pounds 18.4m and earnings per share were 4.34p (4.42p). The final dividend is 1.06p for a total of 4.12p (3.8p), and indicates at least 4.24p for the current year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Re'uven Shapira] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved in  principle the establishment of a new police district, which will  be the sixth, and which will serve as the unified command of the  police units in the territories. Rabin has thus accepted a plan  put forth by Police Minister Moshe Shahal.    The establishment of the new district means, among other  things, that some 1,000 policemen and border policemen will be  drafted to the force. According to the plan, the Israel Police  and Border Police units will assume responsibility for security  and order in the territories under the command of the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] and will perform many of the tasks  currently preformed by the Army.    The new district will be commanded by a ranking police  commander and will be called the Autonomy District. It will  unite the three currently operating subdistricts of Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza. [passage omitted]    In the framework of the new police deployment in the  territories, a unit of 300 border policemen will be set up. It  will perform guard duties on the roads and crossings between the  areas of the autonomy and Israel. The new unit has begun  organizing and drafting men.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts rise on expectations of smooth auction Long-dated UK government bonds rose about  1/4 point in quiet trading yesterday in anticipation that tomorrow's Pounds 2.75bn auction of 15-year stock by the Bank of England would proceed smoothly. By contrast, gains at the shorter end were limited to about  1/8 point. The March long gilt future on Liffe traded at 119 13/32 in late trading, just below the day's best level of 119 27/32 but up  3/16 on the day. Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said he expected the new stock to yield around 6.35 per cent, in line with current market levels. He expected the cover - the amount by which demand exceeds supply - would be around 1 1/2 times, below the record 2.2 times recorded at the last auction. He said that the cover was likely to be more modest this time round because market conditions were stable and because traders had already adjusted their positions ahead of the fresh supply of gilts. He also expected a very small 'tail' - the difference between the average accepted price and the lowest accepted price. There was little obvious reaction in the market to the latest survey of industrial opinion by the Confederation of British Industry despite its encouraging conclusions on the state of the UK economy. Better-than-expected January data for January from the German state of North-Rhein Westphalia sparked an intra-day recovery in German government bond futures yesterday. The March bund future on Liffe had dropped as low as 99.77 before the data were released but rose as high as 100.18 by mid-afternoon in good volume. By contrast the cash market was mostly unchanged in quiet trading, traders said. Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, German economist at UBS in Frankfurt, said while the NRW data were encouraging, fears of a poor money supply number for December, which could be published at the end of this week or early next week, were dampening market sentiment. The market expects a figure of 7 per cent. Italian bond futures rallied more than a half-point on news yesterday that Italy's finance minister, Mr Franco Gallo, had signed a decree to speed up the refund of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on bond coupon payments to eligible foreigners. The March Italian government bond future on Liffe was trading near the day's high of 118.96 in late trading, well up on the day's low of 117.93. Some traders believed that the market would test its previous record high of 119.12 today. Japanese government bonds showed unexpected resilience in the face of the current political uncertainty in Tokyo and the slide in the Japanese stock market yesterday. The March future went as high as 116.29 before closing at 115.95, the day's low, but 0.27 points higher than Friday's close. The future then drifted to just below 116 in London trading. Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe in London, said the future was likely to trade between 115.50 and 116.40 in the short term, in the light of the support shown at 114.50 last week. He added that some investors were switching out of the benchmark No 157 10-year government bond into other 10-year bonds, following No 157's outperformance of 10 basis points last week. US bond prices showed little change yesterday morning in a quiet session ahead of today's Treasury auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/32 at 99 19/32, yielding 6.292 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.045 per cent. The market opened on a weak note after overnight selling by Japanese traders rattled by the failure of a political reform package to win parliamentary approval. But prices soon found support in light technical trading, despite underlying concern over today's influx of supply. The auction is to be followed by the sale of Dollars 12bn in five-year securities tomorrow. As the afternoon progresses, the long bond slumped, with uneasiness over Friday's report on fourth-quarter domestic product beginning to surface. Traders are concerned that a robust growth rate could carry over into the first quarter and trigger an early tightening of monetary policy.</p>

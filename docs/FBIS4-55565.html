			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by </F> Antonia Vymazalova; place and date not given: "Bilingual Names  According to a List"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vymazalova] Which name of the  community in the minority language will it be possible to use  [under the law on the use of bilingual signs in regions with  ethnically mixed populations]?    [Pittner] The names of communities in the language of the  minority are set down in a list that constitutes a separate  supplement to the government-sponsored bill. This list includes  the official name of the community--that is, its name in the  Slovak language--and its designation in the language of the  ethnic minority. Under the law, it will only be possible to use  names that are on this list. This applies to the Hungarian as  well as the Ukrainian and Ruthenian minorities. Those names  have been studied by experts from the fields of history,  geography, linguistics, and other disciplines, whom we assembled  at the Ministry of the Interior. The names had first been  discussed with all of the partners in the coalition.    [Vymazalova] Does the government recommend in its own bill  the incorporation of some ideas from the deputies' bill on  bilingual signs, which it turned down?    [Pittner] Not at all, because the deputies' bill only  repeats the previous government's proposal of November 1993,  under which the name of the community was to be translated into  the language of the minority or transcribed according to its  rules of orthography. The translated or transcribed names are  not identical to the names used--for example, by Hungarian  fellow citizens when referring to their community in their own  language. The names of communities as they evolved in the  entire historical period until the early 19th century and as  they are recorded in Jan Lipsky's work Repertorium of  1808 were used as a point of departure. The names on the list  are names that have taken shape in the course of historical  development and that are used by the local population.    [Vymazalova] You said at a news conference that the law  would apply to about 560 names of towns and villages and that  the signs ought to be financed by the state. A sum of  approximately 6.6 million korunas is to be set aside for this  purpose. Who will make and install those signs?    [Pittner] This is the responsibility of the district road  administrations. This obligation arises from the law on the  designation of communities, and there is a decree that  stipulates where exactly at the community's entry and exit the  signs must be installed. The name of the community in the  language of the ethnic minority will be placed on the  appropriate traffic sign.    [Vymazalova] What impact will this law have on citizens'  everyday lives? Can the second name be used in the address, for  example?    [Pittner] No. Only the name in the Slovak language is the  official name. The second name is only for the designation of  the community in the mother tongue of the ethnic minority.</p>

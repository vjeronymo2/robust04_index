			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Support rattles out for Willis / Examining the unusual policies of the TUC's second-smallest affiliate THE Society of Shuttlemakers will visit the Trades Union Congress this week to back both Mr Norman Willis, the organisation's embattled general secretary, and the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran. The arrival of the shuttlemakers on their first visit to the annual congress in 50 years of TUC membership is unlikely to create more than the smallest ripple. With only 17 members, the union is the second-smallest in the TUC, but continues to guard its independence in an era of large-scale mergers. Mr Leslie Illingworth, general secretary of the 101-year-old organisation based in Colne, Lancs, has never heard of Mr John Monks, the TUC deputy general secretary widely tipped as a successor to Mr Willis. 'There is no reason for Willis to resign,' Mr Illingworth said. 'He's a decent bloke. He speaks his mind.' Shuttlemakers produce the wooden devices which drag weft through warp to weave cloth. The advent of shuttleless looms and the closure of local mills saw the market for shuttles decline and the union's membership dwindle from almost 600 in the 1940s to today's meagre total. The link with the Mujahideen arises because the support of small unions is sought at every TUC congress by the professionally oppressed. Groups such as the dissident People's Mujahideen offer small unions a morsel of kudos in exchange for a back door to possible support from the TUC in the form of a vote by delegates in favour of the dissidents' case. The Shuttlemakers were telephoned by the Mujahideen and agreed to add a clause to a motion submitted by the larger Bakers' Union criticising the Iranian government's record on human rights. The union is undeterred by its small size and sees nothing odd in its role. 'A lot of big unions would be quite envious of us,' said Mr Dennis Horsefield, the union's treasurer - who at 63 is the oldest working member of the Shuttlemakers. 'They are in over their heads whereas we have got about Pounds 25,000 in the bank - and we are sticking to our money.' The shuttlemakers say they do not want to be absorbed by one of the big unions that would like to swallow them up. They say they have already rejected advances from the TGWU and GMB general unions. 'What do they know about shuttlemaking anyway?' says Mr Horsefield. To sceptics who think the union is as dead as the industry which supports it, Mr Illingworth says: 'The comical part of it is that everyone has said such a small union can't last for long, yet over the last nine months we have been making shuttles at a rate I haven't seen since the 1950s.'</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CREDIBILITY AND LOST BOMB  </P> <P> That hydrogen bomb that the U.S. Navy lost off the shores of Okinawa and sunk  to a depth of 14,000 feet has alarmed the Japanese population and rightly so.  Not because of any imminent explosive disaster, not because of any radiation  hazard, not even because of pollution concerns.  </P> <P> What I believe the general population of Japan is really worried about is that  this scenario conjures up a myth no one has yet fathomed. Godzilla.  </P> <P> We all tend to brush off the fantasy of our environmental abuses generating new  and awful creatures to wreak havoc on us in the name of Mother Nature's  revenge. Let's just wait and see if Godzilla emerges from the deep, if the  Creature From the Exxon Black Lagoon slithers onto shore, and if The Thing  falls to the icy earth beneath the holes in our ozone layer.  </P> <P> Just wait and see.  </P> <P> IVAN LADIZINSKY  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

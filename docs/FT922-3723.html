			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Jobs: Spanish ensconced on high - Smaller companies' executive-pay league WHAT has 10 years of socialist government in Spain done to the country's top managers? Ensconced them on the heights of the European executive-pay league, that's what. Their prominence now stands confirmed by four successive salary studies from two different sources. The latest, just published, is by the European Remuneration Network, a consortium of nine consultancies and institutes, each doing separate pay surveys. Their combined exercise for 1992 covers 3,309 companies employing nearly 40,000 executives of various ranks in 11 countries. But anybody wanting data on all of them will need the full report (priced at Pounds 525 including postage and an up-date in the winter), obtainable from the network's British member: P-E International, Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; telephone 0784 434411, fax 0784 437828. My extracts, in the table to the right, are limited to eight of the countries, and to companies in two particular size-bands as measured by total numbers of employees. The first are those with up to 100 on the payroll, the second are those with between 250 and 1,000. While the separate surveys were made at different dates, their findings have all been up-dated in line with higher-level pay movements to the start of this month. I have converted the other currencies to sterling at the London market's closing rates on June 4. For each country and size-band, the table begins with managing directors. Then come heads of marketing-and-sales and of finance, together with heads of personnel except in the small companies of the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, where not enough of same were employed to furnish statistically respectable data. In every case the table shows both basic salary and total pay received in money including bonuses and suchlike. The lower quartile figures in light type relate to the executive who would be a quarter of the way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same country and type of job. The upper quartiles, again in light type, refer to the one a quarter way down from the top. The median figures in bold type give not only the salary and total cash pay of the executive mid-way in the ranking, but also a rough indication of buying power. It is calculated by taking the total pay, deducting the country's standard tax and so on for someone married with two dependent children, then adjusting the result in line with P-E's index of international differences in the costs of executive life. But please be warned that - although I've ranked the countries on the buying power of the M D of the bigger-sized companies - such living-cost comparisons are extremely sketchy. For one thing, they take no account of housing. For another, indices produced by different organisations can vary widely. Even on straightforward exchange-rate conversions, however, the Spanish managing directors of the 250-1,000 employee companies tower above all the rest (and in the up-to-100 bracket come second only to their counterparts in France). Spain's M Ds also have a bigger differential over their subordinate departmental heads than is generally the case elsewhere. As for the UK, it appears to be ex-ceptional along with Denmark in the valuation it places on heads of sales and marketing by comparison with heads of finance. In both countries those two departmental bosses have much the same median total pay. But everywhere else the sales and marketing head is several percentage points better off.</p>

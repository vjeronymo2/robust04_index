			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions fervour cools off - What could happen to personal plans FEBRUARY marks the start of the personal pensions season as life offices gear up for a marketing onslaught to persuade millions of employees to opt out of the state earnings related pension scheme and into a private plan by the end of the tax year. The success of personal pensions has been remarkable. Providers have notched up 4.5m new clients - a very favourable response to the government's bid to switch the burden of individual pension provision to the private sector. This year the revolutionary zeal seems to have cooled and providers are talking of consolidation and even retreat. Gone are the heady promises of 'something for nothing' which marked the advertising campaigns of 1988. The reasons for the uncertainty are threefold. First, the amount of rebate paid by the government to those who take out personal pensions will be cut from April. Providers are making contingency plans to cope with reduced business. Second, if Labour is elected there is evidence that the personal pensions market as we know it, would cease to exist. Third, the personal pension promise of portability without penalty is proving false. This does not mean that personal pensions have ceased to be attractive. There are considerable gains to be made for those who opt out of Serps and invest in a plan for the 1991/92 and 1992/93 tax years. But those opting for a personal pension should do so with their eyes open. If you opt out of Serps for the current tax year by April 5, the Department of Social Security (DSS) will pay up to Pounds 1,500 into a personal pension of your choice. This rebate of National Insurance Contributions is calculated at 8.47 per cent of 'band earnings' - that is earnings between Pounds 52 and Pounds 390 per week. The rebate will drop from April 1993. The actual figure is expected to published by the end of March but it is likely to be in the order of 5 per cent plus an element of tax relief. The effect of this cut will be to reduce the value of the rebate by one third. At this rate it is estimated that between 1m to 1.5m would be better off if they returned to Serps. It is doubtful if even a cut of this size would be sufficient to make personal pensions cost effective. The net cost of personal pensions to the National Insurance Fund for the period to 1993 is Pounds 6.7bn according to the National Audit Office (NAO) and the Public Accounts Committee. This figure was based on 4m people in personal pensions and was expressed in April 1988 cash terms so the real cost in today's terms would be substantially higher. Even after the proposed cut in the rebate, which is still being discussed, there would still be a net cost to the national insurance fund. Bryn Davies, executive director and actuary at UPS, who calculated the NAO figures, estimates that the net cost for the 1993-98 period would be Pounds 2.4bn in April 1992 cash terms. One of the prime intentions of personal pensions was to reduce the cost of Serps in the next century but, at this rate, it could create a substantial deficit in the NI fund. Further rebate cuts or restrictions on re-entry to Serps cannot be ruled out if the Government intends to balance the books. The other option is to make the rebate age-related - a measure proposed by the NAO. Labour intends to re-establish Serps and good (ie final salary) occupational pension schemes as the primary source of UK pensions. Personal pensions - and indeed any money purchase pension where the value of the fund is linked to investment performance - will be relegated to the role of top-up provision. Under Labour, personal pensions also would have to provide a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) to match the benefit given up in Serps and providers will be forced to make direct comparisons between the benefits of their plan and the benefits of the enhanced state earnings related scheme. On the whole, Labour would not provide a friendly environment for current products. But even without the charges which Labour proposes there is evidence that some plans contain the seeds of their own destruction. Where the plan is simply used to contract out of Serps and no extra contributions are paid, the overheads for life office charges and commission to salesmen are quite modest. But many providers insist on minimum extra contributions of up to Pounds 50 per month. These regular premium plans are subject to more substantial charges and due to early termination penalties the employee may have little to show for his or her investment after three or four years. A marketing feature of personal pensions is portability without penalty  - in other words you can take your pension from job to job without suffering any of the transfer problems associated with final salary pensions. This works - but only to a point. If the employee wants to join the new employer's pension scheme he or she would probably be forced to give up the personal pension. Even if the provider offered to convert the personal pension into a free standing additional voluntary contribution plan (FSAVC) few people saddled with a mortgage can afford to keep up two pension payments. In most cases the personal pension would be stopped, incurring a hefty penalty. One leading company said someone who contributed Pounds 100 monthly for 18 months would receive only Pounds 1,000 on transfer - 40 per cent less than the Pounds 1,800 invested. That highlights the attractions of single premium contributions which carry low overheads and pay commission to advisers of just 4 per cent. If you prefer monthly arrangements ask your adviser to select a plan which is genuinely flexible so that there are no high charges on regular contributions and no penalties if the contribution is reduced.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Partnership that will help develop UK tourism Sir, Nicholas Lander was right to draw attention to the importance of Britain's tourism industry ('British tourism and the faulty towers of policy', November 24). The devaluation of sterling against other currencies has created new opportunities by making this country a more affordable destination. We believe that 1993 could be a record year for overseas visits, earning us some Pounds 8bn in foreign exchange. It has also helped us in the domestic market by making many foreign holidays more expensive for UK citizens. The British Tourist Authority is running vigorous promotional campaigns in key markets such as the US, Germany, France, and Japan. We would like to do more, but it would be wrong to rely on government funding alone. The industry, which stands to reap the direct financial benefits, must also play an active role. We have developed a strong partnership with the private sector and I hope that we can persuade many more companies to join forces with us. William Davis, chairman, British Tourist Authority, 24 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0ET</p>

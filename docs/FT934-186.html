			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shield makes acquisition Shield Group, the holding company that owns Stickley Kent, the auctioneer and property insolvency specialist, has acquired Kamco Computer Systems, a leading maker of customised personal computers. Mr Norman Mazure, the chairman who owns 30 per cent of Shield, said yesterday that the company paid less than Pounds 50,000 cash for Kamco, which is expected to report turnover this year of Pounds 4m. Kamco, founded five years ago and based in Uxbridge, sells its products only through mail order and advertising. Mr Mazure said the mail order market for PCs was worth about Pounds 1.2bn a year in the UK and was shared between 600 companies. He believed Kamco to be about sixth or seventh biggest. Shield intends to keep Kamco's existing management team, including Mr Zygi Kamasa, the founder and managing director, and Mr Gary Russell, operations director.</p>

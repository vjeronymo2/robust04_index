			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study dents gold price hopes HOPES THAT a fall in production from the world's mines will help to stimulate a revival in the price of gold are dented by the latest study from the Gold Institute, an international trade association based in Washington. This shows the gold industry is forecasting that production world-wide will increase by nearly 5.5 per cent from 67.254m troy ounces last year to 70.929m in 1995. While a substantial fall in output in South Africa, the biggest gold producer, is predicted during this period - by 6.5 per cent from 19.224m ounces to 17.972m ounces - this is more than compensated for by dramatic growth in other countries such as Chile, China, Ghana, Guyana and the Philippines. The study, covering the 68 countries in which mine or expect to mine gold, was produced with the help of 235 mining entities which supplied the Institute with their reports and projections. The institute cautions, however, that 'earthquakes, floods, accidents, strikes or unexpected declines in market prices will cause the actual production to be less than the projections'. It also points out that countries outside the former eastern bloc expect annual gold output to rise by only 1.3 per cent a year on average for the next four years compared with an average of 8 per cent in the past ten years. One assumption made by the study that will cause some debate is that annual gold production from the Commonwealth of Industrial States, the world's third-largest producer, will remain constant until 1995 at 7.78m ounces. It suggests that China's gold output will rise by 21.5 per cent, from 3.537m ounces last year to 4.299m in 1995. Other predicted substantial increases over the period are in Chile, up 39 per cent to 1.286m ounces in 1995; the Philippines, up 38 per cent to 1.187m ounces and Ghana, up 97 per cent to 1.234m ounces.

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIA BORDER GUARDS OPEN FIRE ON PAKISTANI DEMONSTRATORS; 10 HURT  </P> <P> Indian border guards opened fire on Pakistani protesters who swarmed into  Indian territory in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday,  officials said.  </P> <P> At least 10 people were reported injured in the shooting, India's chief  spokesman said. Pakistani officials said that one protester was killed and 13  others were shot in the legs.  </P> <P> The episode occurred near Ranbirsinghpura in Jammu region, 310 miles north of  New Delhi.  </P> <P> The demonstrators, who shouted anti-India slogans, were protesting a recent  Indian government crackdown on Muslim separatists in the Kashmir region of  Jammu and Kashmir, said a Pakistani police official in Sialkot, about three  miles from the border.  </P> <P> The Indian spokesman said that about 4,000 demonstrators gathered on the  Pakistani side and tried to cross the border. "Despite efforts by the Pakistani  rangers, some people crossed over and the Indian security forces had to fire to  control the situation," he said without elaborating.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Rashid Babar, Pakistan's top diplomat in  India, was summoned to the Foreign Office and told of India's "concern and deep  regret" at the "unprovoked incident."  </P> <P> The Pakistan government did not immediately react to the incident.  </P> <P> In Jammu, a senior official of the Indian Border Security Force, which guards  the area, said the trouble started around noon when about 500 people gathered  near the border and shouted "provocative slogans."  </P> <P> He said the commander of the Border Security Force outpost then called  Pakistani officers into the Indian territory to discuss the situation, after  which the Pakistani forces dispersed the crowd.  </P> <P> But the crowd regrouped, and despite the Pakistani guards, many swarmed across  the border, he said. Pakistan's official TV said there were about 30,000  demonstrators.  </P> <P> The intrusion was an apparent fallout of a strike Monday in major Pakistani  cities in support of Kashmiri secession. At least 76 people have been killed in  Kashmir since Jan. 20 in clashes between curfew-breaking protesters and  security forces.  </P></p>

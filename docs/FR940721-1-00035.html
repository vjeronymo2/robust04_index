			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of the Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Clarification to the General Comments Section of Preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Several individuals have commented that the following sentence in the preamble has created confusion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Because the statute is broad, the payment practices described in these safe harbor provisions would be prohibited by the statute but for their inclusion here.'' (56 FR 35958)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This sentence was not meant to imply that,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in all instances irrespective of the parties intent,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the government could prosecute conduct described in the regulation, but for its inclusion in the regulation. Whether a particular payment practice violates the statute is a question that can only be resolved by an analysis of the elements of the statute as applied to that set of facts. Generally speaking, however, the original final rule did describe payment practices that would be prohibited, where the unlawful intent exists, but for the safe harbor protection that has been granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In discussing the space and equipment rental and personal services and management contracts, we stated that if a ``sham contract is entered into *&blank;*&blank;* we will look behind the contract'' to its substance in evaluating whether the arrangement qualifies for safe-harbor protection (56 FR 35972). We received numerous inquiries as to whether we would similarly look behind the form of other arrangements to determine whether the substance of the arrangement fits within a particular safe harbor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, such inquiries have led us to clarify particular safe harbors, as is illustrated by the following discussions of the safe harbors for investment interests, space and equipment rental, and personal services and management contracts. However, because of the broad variety of transactions subject to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute and the ability of individuals to manipulate the safe harbors in ways not contemplated, we believe that a general rule preventing sham arrangements from receiving safe harbor protection would be appropriate. Thus, we are proposing adding a new &sect;1001.954 to the regulations. Such an approach has several precedents. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with the concurrence of the Department of Justice promulgated &sect;801.90 of the FTC's rules implementing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (16 CFR 801.90), which disregards sham transactions entered into for the purpose of avoiding obligations under the Act. In addition, other Federal agencies (such as the Securities Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service) have promulgated regulations and policies that seek to protect the government from making enforcement decisions based on information that does not accurately reflect the substance of the transaction. (See, for example, 17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;20;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Estate of Korman  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comm. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , TC Memo 1987&hyph;120; and Rev. Rul. 81&hyph;149, 1981&hyph;1 CB 77.) Moreover, the courts have historically disregarded sham arrangements when examining the rights and obligations of the parties in tax cases. (See, for example,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Knetsch  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 364 U.S. 361 (1960); and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thompson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commissioner of Internal Revenue,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 631 F.2d 642 (9th Cir. 1981),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 452 U.S. 961 (1981).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Clarifications to Investment Interests Safe Harbor (&sect;1001.952(a)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Health Care Assets and Revenues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In qualifying for the ``large entity'' or ``small entity'' investment interest safe harbors, the monetary value or amount of certain assets and revenues must be determined. Specifically, the safe harbors include: (1) The $50,000,000 asset threshold in &sect;1001.952(a)(1); and (2) the gross revenues in the ``60&hyph;40 revenue rule'' in &sect;1001.952(a)(2)(vi). In these cases,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only the assets or revenues related to the furnishing of health care items or services will be counted for the purposes of qualifying for these safe harbor requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It would be an obvious sham, inconsistent with our original intent, if a joint venture could merge with a non-health care business and have those non-health care assets, and the revenues derived from that non-health care line of business counted for the purposes of qualifying for safe harbor protection. We are thus proposing to revise these safe harbor provisions to further clarify our original intent that only health care assets and revenues will be counted in determining these values and amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

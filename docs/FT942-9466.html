			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Organised crime reaps rewards of copying: Milan, Paris . . . Preston. Pirates are trying to broaden Armani's horizons The UK is home to hundreds of illegal operations filling fake perfume bottles, embroidering logos on accessories, screen-printing T-shirts and copying audio and video cassettes. Yet 10 years ago it was a net importer of counterfeit products, with the goods seized in Britain nearly always manufactured elsewhere. Companies and trading standards officers say illegal copying of goods is set to continue as an unchecked boom industry dominated by organised crime. This is in spite of two measures to combat it: the launch of a national intelligence and data service and the trademarks bill which is due to enter its parliamentary committee stage tomorrow. Industry estimates suggest counterfeiting is costing Britain Pounds 1bn a year through a combination of sales taken from legitimate producers and retailers, about 100,000 lost jobs and lost tax revenues. The record industry alone says that a quarter of tapes sold are illegal copies. The surge in domestic counterfeiting has been aided by technology, with sophisticated photocopiers used to imitate packaging and high-speed recorders to copy tapes. However, it has been the high returns and patchy law enforcement that have really fuelled the industry's growth. Costs are far lower for an unregulated producer. 'Counterfeiters are not renowned for paying taxes, registering for VAT or observing employment or health and safety regulations,' says Ms Anthea Worsdall, secretary of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, which represents more than 130 companies affected by illegal copying. The street price for copied goods reflects consumers' belief that they are obtaining something of a higher quality or value than is the case. 'If the quality were as good as was claimed, there would be no need to steal someone else's trademark,' says Ms Worsdall. The net effect is high earnings on minimal outlay. A raid last month on a mill in Preston, Lancashire, found children as young as 11 packing suspected fake Giorgio Armani and Paul Smith jeans. A week's production was seized, with a street value of Pounds 500,000. It was estimated that the haul would have cost just Pounds 8,000 to produce. Returns such as these have attracted organised crime. Last November police raided on one day seven video-counterfeiting factories in Northern Ireland, which it claimed were funding a paramilitary group, and seized Pounds 70,000-worth of copied audio and video tapes. Syndicates in Manchester and London have also moved into the mass production of counterfeit goods. The recession has provided a pool of workers willing to take the risk of selling pirated goods, providing ample street-trading networks. Meanwhile, the trade descriptions, copyright, trade mark and theft laws, which make copy-cat goods a criminal offence, are being enforced by council trading standards departments which say they are over-stretched. Britain's 1,500 trading standards officers cover a far wider remit than counterfeiting, and local authorities are anyway not obliged to enforce anti-counterfeiting legislation. As a result, the Institute of Trading Standards Administration recently reported that three-quarters of 98 trading standards departments surveyed spent less than 10 per cent of their time on anti-counterfeiting work, with many spending 2 per cent or less. When counterfeiters are convicted penalties are minimal, with prison sentences rarely passed and fines usually lower than the value of goods seized. Last year the Court of Appeal ruled that street traders who identified their goods as fakes were not in breach of the Trade Descriptions Act. This brought a rash of disclaimers on copied audio and video tapes, which left the consumer wiser, but music and film companies less protected. The trademarks bill is set to close the loophole on dis-claimers, make enforcement obligatory on local authorities, and increase penalties - moves which the government says could save British companies Pounds 60m in the first year and an annual Pounds 30m in later years. However, the resources available to enforce the new legislation remain the same. 'Having the legislation is only part of the story,' says Ms Worsdall. 'It needs to be effectively enforced and that needs more resources.' The ITSA national data and intelligence service is establishing links with enforcers in continental Europe through Interpol to try to track down cross-border trade. However, as part of the local government review, trading standards departments may be reorganised into smaller units which, they claim, will make national co-ordination and specialisation even harder.</p>

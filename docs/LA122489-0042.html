			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER HEATER SAFETY STRAPS, INSULATION OFFERED TO SENIORS  </P> <P> The city is expanding its Paint-Up and Fix-Up Program, a special service for  low-income senior citizens and handicapped homeowners.  </P> <P> According to Mayor John Chavez, qualified residents can have insulation  blankets and earthquake safety straps installed on their water heaters free of  charge.  </P> <P> City officials estimate that by wrapping a water heater with an insulated  blanket, residents can save about 20% on their water-heating bills. A strap can  keep the water heater from tipping over in an earthquake.  </P> <P> The Paint-Up and Fix-Up Program also includes installation of smoke detectors  and deadbolt locks, repair of broken windows and repainting of home exteriors.  The services are free. Eligible homeowners may contact the Pico Rivera Housing  Department at 942-2000, Ext. 276.  </P></p>

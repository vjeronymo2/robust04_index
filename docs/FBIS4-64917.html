			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Sereni: "The Treasury: A Fortress </F> Threatened"]    [Text] France's preeminent institution has been sullied by  the Credit Lyonnais scandal, one more setback at a time when its  power is inexorably crumbling. The Matignon [office of the prime  minister] now wants to split it into three parts.    Is the Treasury to be the scapegoat for the Credit Lyonnais  scandal? The French Government's most prestigious--and long most  powerful--directorate has been called on the carpet at the worst  possible moment. The country's leading bank was on its way to  the wall and the Treasury Directorate, which both oversees it  and represents the shareholder government on the board of  directors, either knew or said nothing. That is, unless--and at  no risk to himself--the then minister sat on detailed warnings,  an indication of what little real influence this much vaunted  power machine enjoys.    Actually, until the summer of 1992, the "memo for the  minister" concerning the Credit Lyonnais were as rare as they  were vague. Much was made of Jean-Yves Haberer's bold strategy,  the great risks taken, the wager that could win big. "The  Treasury is organized like a loose holding company," one  official says, springing to its defense. "It is concerned with  strategy, but its supervision depends on external systems,  auditors, the Banking Commission, headed by the governor of the  Bank of France, acting as its secretariat, followed by the  General Inspectorship of the aforementioned Bank of France."    The year 1991 was a decisive one. Credit Lyonnais was still  posting good profits (3.2 billion francs [Fr] in the black),  surpassing those of the BNP [National Bank of Paris]. Questions  were beginning to emerge here and there, however, even before  the gloom-and-doom predictions from Francois d'Aubert, UDF  [French Democratic Union] deputy from Mayenne, ENA [National  School of Administration] graduate, and adviser to the Audit  Office, who in late 1980 embarked upon a continuing crusade  against the Credit Lyonnais that was met with widespread  indifference.    "The Banking Commission and Treasury were somewhat timid," a  former member of Pierre Beregovoy's cabinet now admits. Bank of  France Governor Jacques de Larosiere, Haberer's predecessor as  head of the Treasury, did not get along with the boss of the  Credit Lyonnais, which detracted from the Banking Commission's  warnings. As for the Treasury, it is far more stringent with  poor people in need of money than it is with government finance  barons. Nor is it easy for a bureau chief to tweak a former  great who served as Treasury director 10 years previously.    By the summer of 1992, no doubters were left. Earnings for  the first half of the year were catastrophic. When the bank was  placed under close monitoring--and Treasury insiders now say it  "was high time"--the task was given to Haberer, who did not  conceal his anger. "What kind of daily control can be effective  enough to allow the minister to be warned in time?" the then  Economics and Finance Minister Michel Sapin now wonders. Until  the arrival of Jean-Pascal Beaufret at the head of the  Department of Monetary and Financial Affairs in the summer of  1992, the Treasury's representative on the Credit Lyonnais board  of directors was not the official in charge of the matter, which  certainly did not facilitate the monitoring task.    Beginning in December 1993, the recapitalization of the  Lyonnais, negotiated by its new president, Jean Peyrelevade, set  the stage for one more setback for the Treasury and its  minister. Beaufret intended to reduce the government's backing  to a minimum, forcing the bank to draw upon its reserves (Fr60  billion francs in shares, the best backed network in Europe).  The Matignon went to bat for the Lyonnais: The government,  Thomson SA, and the Deposit Fund would dole out funds. The  concern for not weakening the French economy as it emerged with  difficulty from the crisis won out over the traditional impulses  of the Treasury, ever anxious to limit government commitments.    A parliamentary commission of inquiry is to scrutinize the  Lyonnais matter. Selection of its members--a minimum of  nine--and definition of its task is providing fuel for a fierce  behind-the-scenes fight. The spokesman for the National  Assembly's Finance Committee, Philippe Auberger, a former Bercy  [Finance Ministry] official from the RPR [Rally for the  Republic], wants to challenge certain colleagues, who "failed to  execute their duties properly...and submitted accounts for a  number of years which were in error."    Centrist Jacques Barrot, chairman of the Finance Committee,  wants no witch hunt and is trying to "understand where things  went wrong between the oversight authorities and nationalized  businesses." In other words, he prefers to aim the spotlight at  the Treasury rather than the Credit Lyonnais, whose customers,  partners, and deposits must be handled with kid gloves.    Overnight, the Lyonnais affair and its parliamentary  aftereffects could speed up reform at Bercy, one of Edouard  Balladur's main secret plans.    Since the fall, 40 high-level Matignon officials have been  working under Jean Picq, adviser to the Audit Office and former  member of various Gaullist cabinets, to define "the government's  responsibilities and organization." The inquiries, hearings, and  studies have spared no sector, from Education to Economy. One of  the main points of the general 150-page report to be submitted  to the prime minister on 30 April deals with a redistribution of  power between the Matignon and Bercy.    Balladur, economics and and finance minister from 1986 to  1988, had the next five years--working from within the  opposition--to reflect on the redistribution of real power  between the government's two fortresses.    As prime minister, he worked hard to accentuate the split  between Finance and Budget ministries authored by Pierre  Beregovoy in April 1992. It was no accident that the three most  influential finance ministers of the Fifth Republic: Valery  Giscard d'Estaing, Pierre Beregovoy, and Edouard Balladur, each  tried to blow up the citadel once they were out of the ministry.  <H5>  Recommended Solution: One Grand Ministry of National </H5> Economy, Patterned After the German Model    Of the three, Balladur went the farthest. His was the first  government since the end of the Napoleonic wars to have no  minister of finance. Edmond Alphandery is only economics  minister. The preeminence tacitly recognized at that ministry  and by its top officials in the Treasury is now carefully  blurred. What is more, it is under attack from a Budget Ministry  that has been stimulated the influence of its young head,  Nicolas Sarkozy, who is also the government's spokesman and, in  fact, its number-two man. "What can you expect? The mayor of  Neuilly [Sarkozy] is more important than the mayor of  Longue-Jumelles [Alphandery]," one Bercy boss says with a sigh.    It is a well-designed arrangement, one that has heretofore  done all that its authors had hoped it would: Economic and  financial arbitration takes place at the Matignon rather than at  Bercy, which had been rapped on the knuckles for the Balladur  loan--which the Treasury did not want--as well as for the  abortive reform of the Deposit Fund.    Interministerial debate behind closed doors, settled by the  finance minister, has given way to interministerial meetings  dominated by the Matignon. The power to say "yes" has shifted  from the 12th district to the seventh. Unlike Michel Rocard or  Edith Cresson, the prime minister no longer has before him  packages neatly tied together at Bercy that he must either  accept as they are or reject, risking a political or monetary  crisis.    "Today, the Matignon intervenes in matters involving Fr50  million," observes one veteran of the "golden age" of the  Beregovoy-Trichet team, one a powerful minister and the other a  flashy Treasury director.    The last example to date of the recurring conflicts  separating the feuding brothers at Bercy is the struggle over  the pension fund and the income tax reduction. Alphandery  defends the former and Nicolas Sarkozy the latter. Both would  mean substantial losses in fiscal revenue and in slack times it  is not possible to do both. The decision will therefore be made  at the Matignon.    Based on early leaks, the Picq mission is tending toward a  German-type model: one grand Economics Ministry combining the  current responsibilities of [Economics Minister Edmond]  Alphandery and [Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet.    Such a rapprochement between Bercy and Avenue de Segur  [Industry Ministry] would be accompanied by a reorganization of  both administrations. Part of the Treasury administration, the  one that handles monetary and financial affairs and government  participation, would be merged with the General Industrial  Strategies Directorate (DGSI), which now monitors the  manufacturing sector.    The other part of the Treasury, international affairs, would  be grouped together with the Directorate of Foreign Economic  Relations (DREE), placing under the same ministerial and  administrative authority all foreign trade questions, foreign  loans, credit insurance, debt and development. "In the future,  with the creation of the World Trade Organization scheduled to  succeed GATT on 1 January 1995, matters relating to  international trade, foreign exchange, and global debt will be  inextricably combined. A single command unit is essential if  France wants to avoid the 1992-93 mess it had with the Uruguay  Round," one manufacturer argues.    Based on such a scenario, a Finance Ministry would remain at  Bercy, built around the Budget Directorate and the Tax  Directorate, along with an office in charge of financing  government deficits.    From the perspective of Pavillon Colbert, located at Bercy's  sixth pillar, headquarters of the Treasury Directorate, the plan  amounts to sacrilege. If reform there must be, there can be no  question of taking away Finance or of separating Budget, taxes,  and the Treasury.    "Right now, in spite of everything, we are trying to achieve  the successful separation of persons, ie., the existence of two  ministers, with the needs of a harmonious operation, but if that  were to become a real, permanent, final split, it would be a  very bad thing," says one of the Bercy barons, resolutely  arguing for the unity of the financial leadership of the  government. Furthermore, what would be the purpose of the  "little schemes" invented to safeguard the unity of the  institution, the common notes sent by the Budget Directorate and  Treasury Directorate to the two ministers?    And yet, the young mining engineer entrusted by the Picq  mission with the task of inventorying the responsibilities of  the Treasury Directorate has been forced to note the undeniable  and rapid shrinkage of its prerogatives in recent years.    As for the monetary mission, since February all action has  shifted to the Bank of France. The Council on Monetary Policy  establishes short-term interest rates, oversees rates day by  day, and buys and sells foreign exchange for the government with  complete freedom. The last straw: The Treasury director is  barred from meetings if the minister is present!    As for the mission of overseeing the banks, the Treasury  continues to share it with the Bank of France, which acts as the  general secretariat for the Banking Commission. Its independence  has buttressed the preponderance accorded it by its expertise:  Investigation of cases is done on Rue de La Vrilliere. "The Bank  of France is the only independent central bank to enjoy the  right of oversight over commercial banks," complains one former  head of the A1 office, long one of the most prestigious  directorates. "That throws everything off balance," he adds.    Nor is supervision of financial markets what it once was!  The  Stock Exchange Operations Commission (COB), which bears that  responsibility, has strengthened its position in recent years.  The law of 2 August 1989 drove out the government's  commissioner, the Treasury's oversight agent. Its budget no  longer depends on Bercy. A representative of the directorate may  participate in its work, but on the condition that he be asked  to do so and that he remain silent. A sign of the times, on 8  February 1993, the COB suspended the quotation of the  Businessman's Accounting Office, a specialized financial  institution under the Treasury, without even notifying the  latter.    Privatization is one of Treasury's few new missions, but a  naturally temporary one at that. Unlike under the first  cohabitation, it must now share the task with the Privatization  Commission. In addition to appraising the value of privatized  companies the latter will henceforth choose the members of the  "hard-core investors" itself.    Once the privatization program has been completed, the  number  of board seats occupied by Treasury officials will have  dwindled. In 1992, a third of the personnel in the financial  sector (banking and insurance) came under the government  shareholder and therefore under the Treasury. Treasury board  seats will comprise scarcely 5 percent in 1997 when the  privatization process has been completed and will essentially be  under the independent Bank of France.  <H5>  Decline of the G7 Regime; Paris Club Weakens Treasury's </H5> International Role    The Department of International Affairs, the most highly  esteemed of the three in the Treasury's unwritten hierarchy and  the source of two of the four last Treasury directors, has run  out of things to do. The G-7, a body which brings the seven  chiefs of state or heads of government from the seven richest  countries in the world together with their respective Treasury  directors, and which, according to Jean-Claude Trichet,  comprised "the World Directorate," is on stand-by. It may well  discuss employment, the environment, or Bosnia, but never  interest rates or exchange policy! "Monetary coordination  between great powers that led to the Plaza agreement and later  the Louvre agreement in 1986-87 flowed from one man, U.S.  Treasury Secretary Jim Baker. Since his departure, nothing  important happens there," one old Sherpa says.    The Department's other leading institution, the Club of  Paris, whose members since 1956 have been the world's main  creditor nations, experienced a spectacular run in the 1980's  with the Third World debt. International investors have now  returned alone to the road of exotic or emerging markets ($40  billion in 1992). Only subscribers now go to the Club and they  are often small, bankrupt countries sliding into the Fourth  World amidst an attitude of general indifference. The only  important matter on the horizon concerns Russia, once the  International Monetary Fund has uttered its final word.    Europe, which is inexorably nibbling away at national  prerogatives and which could have been a new frontier for the  entire Treasury, has taken on the look of an opportunity missed.  Trichet did indeed negotiate Economic and Monetary Union in  1991, but nothing has happened since. One office out of 25  follows European affairs and two more are interested in it as a  sideline.    Actually, that issue has already been taken over by the  General Secretariat for International Cooperation (SGCI), which  is under the Matignon. Made up of 140 persons, some 100 of whom  are A-ranking officials, it is, like the Treasury, "a miniature  France," housed in a discreet building on Boulevard Diderot  devoid of any plaque or flag. Operating between Brussels and  Paris, the SGCI plans European Council of Minister meetings and  referees interministerial disputes. For example, ever since  Bercy was split in two, the SGCI has served as an arbiter  between Budget and Economy when the ministers have to go to  meetings of EC economics and finance ministers in Brussels.    It is a formidable rival for the Treasury and not only for  European Affairs. Its boss, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who is as  blustering and extroverted as Christian Noyer is circumspect and  sugar-coated, is Balladur's adviser for European affairs. At his  prompting, the SGCI puts in overtime and provides the Matignon  with memorandums on practically every subject, including  financial, based on demand.    Maladept at seizing new responsibilities, outside of OPA's  [public offer to purchase], from the venerable Insurance  Directorate in 1989, the Treasury is in danger of losing its  power of influence, the rare and fragile commodity that, more  than regulations and procedures, was its real strength. This  dynamic PME [small- and medium-sized business] with just over 50  young managers: three department heads, nine deputy directors,  24 bureau chiefs and their assistants, the rest having no voice,  has been accustomed to winning interministerial arbitration much  like one wins market shares, with a winner's attitude and the  feeling--sometimes justified--of being the best. The departure  of previous director Jean-Claude Trichet to the Bank of France  in November was a stiff blow, a bit like a ranking general going  over to the enemy. The three colonels themselves, all older than  the new director, Christian Noyer, and who served on leftist  Cabinet officials' staffs, are leaving. With respect to the  Lyonnais, the four days which the minister took to reply to a  low blow which a daily newspaper had aimed at a department chief  were viewed as desertion.    Precisely what place does the "government's strategic master  plan" being concocted at the Matignon reserve for the Treasury?  "The organization of the Economics Ministry has scarcely changed  since 1960, but there have nevertheless been gigantic upheavals  since that time," observes Jean-Ludovic Silicani, general  reporter for the Picq mission.    The most gigantic of all is undoubtedly the end of the  economy of indebtedness and inflation, a revolution in which the  Treasury, the sprinkler that got its own self wet, played a  major part. Today, one no longer operates with loan  authorizations and regulations, but rather, with tens of  billions of francs of one's own funds and on open markets.  <H5>  [Box, p 50] </H5> <H5>  Failures and Blunders </H5>   Even before the Credit Lyonnais imbroglio, a series of  failures and blunders had already tarnished the aura of  excellence traditionally surrounding the Treasury Directorate  somewhat.    Inadequately overseen, in the midst of their 1980's  euphoria,  the Regional Development Companies (SDR), whose annual loans are  backed by the government, confused infrastructural development  with development of golf courses! Several SDR's could simply  vanish! "A relic that was not controlled by the government or  their shareholders," Treasury officials now admit.    Another setback: the Businessman's Accounting Office, more  of  a government agency than a bank and responsible for setting up  property ownership loans (PAP). However, its board chairman  blundered by becoming involved in real estate speculation. The  result: a plan to salvage Fr15 billion to save accessways to the  property of lower-income owners. In 1989, the Treasury completed  an OPA on savings taxes, an area covered by the department of  fiscal legislation and the Budget Ministry. The deduction in  legal tender was reduced to 15 percent and the savings stash of  the monetary SICAV's [Variable Capital Investment Companies]  took wing. "From 1986 to 1989, the Treasury expanded tax relief  without calculating the amount of revenue lost," one tax expert  charges. The sum: Fr50 billion a year.    Following the German unification in 1990, the Department of  International Affairs worried about the German economy because  of the exchange rate chosen (1 West German mark, DM, to 1 GDR  mark), but failed to foresee the tension induced on interest  rates throughout Europe. In particular, no one apparently  thought about the chance to marry the franc with a DM  appreciated by the Bundesbank's expensive money policy. It is a  fact that nothing moved in 1990 and that the escalation of  interest rates took off in June 1991. Is the Maastricht monetary  compromise itself not illusory? Germany has indeed accepted the  single currency, but postponed it indefinitely!</p>

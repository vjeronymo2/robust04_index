			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 09, BNS -- The March 7 statement by  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin was an attempt  to exert political pressure on Latvia, the head of the Latvian  parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said Tuesday [8 March].    As reported, Churkin told reporters Monday that Russia has  not taken any obligation to withdraw its troops from Latvia and  Estonia by the end of August.    Alexander Kirsteins, head of the Saeima [parliament]  committee, argued that Russia has long declared its commitment  to complete the pullout by Aug. 31 if Latvia compromises on the  radar installation at Skrunda and social guarantees for war  pensioners.    Russia has not signed any international treaty that would  have made it assume any obligations regarding the troop  withdrawal.    In the Kirsteins' words, the absence of formal agreements  allows Russia to fix the withdrawal deadline arbitrarily and  interpret the Latvian stance on debatable issues in an ambiguous  manner.    On the other hand, Latvia has also undertaken no  international obligations to supply electricity to Russian  installations on its soil, Kirsteins said. Consequently, there  were no reason for Russia to protest the explosion at the  Skrunda's high voltage electricity post.</p>

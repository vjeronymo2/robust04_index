			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: A lesson too frequently ignored Sir, Richard Tomkins ('Fast track to efficiency', March 17) illustrates a general rule for capital projects which is often ignored. This is that it is necessary to spend about 10 per cent of the total cost of a project before the main work is done to avoid having to spend an extra 50 per cent or more to make it work, outside budget and very late. The difficulty is that 10 per cent of the cost of a big project seems like an enormous sum to spend without visible result, and is usually cut out of the plan, especially by those who only have to pay for the project. With hindsight, and ignoring the effects of long-term inflation, the Docklands Light Railway project would have spent Pounds 8m to determine that the original project for Pounds 77m would never work. Whereas Pounds 30m would have given a good chance of making an excellent system for Pounds 300m, thus saving half of the final cost. The lesson is that what is certain or uncertain in one culture (engineering) cannot be easily transmitted to another (finance). But the same mistakes will be made again, or will public bodies learn?

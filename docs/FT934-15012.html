			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Pressure mounts on Belgian franc THE Belgian franc yesterday dropped to its lowest level against the D-Mark for at least three years amid renewed speculation about a possible cut in interest rates. In spite of support from the Belgian central bank, which denied rumours of a change in interest rate policy, the Belgian currency slipped at one point to the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. The French franc was also pushed down sharply. Belgian analysts said there seemed to be no single reason why the Belgian franc should have come under such pressure yesterday. However, tension has been mounting in recent weeks, as the government prepares to publish guidelines for its negotiations with employers and unions over a 'social pact' to lay the foundations for deficit reduction, cuts in labour costs and improved competitiveness. Certain Belgian economists have suggested that easing interest rates might be one way of making Belgian companies more competitive. Dealers said that pressure on the franc had come from within but there were also rumours that it might have been generated by Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, the US investment group which made some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) at the time of sterling's exit from the ERM last year. The Belgian franc ended the day at BFr21.89 against the D-Mark, up slightly from a low of BFr21.95 but weaker than its previous close of BFr21.78.</p>

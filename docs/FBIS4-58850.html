			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, YSP </F> Political Bureau member and special envoy of Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd; place and date not given;  from the "Dialogue From Afar" Program -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Why have these bloody incidents broken  out in Yemen in this way and at this particular time? Even  though everyone is talking about Yemeni unity and maintaining  it, why do we see the opposite?    [Al-Dali] Regrettably we would not have liked to talk about  such incidents, such bloody, painful, and tragic incidents. But  as you have observed, the incidents began some time ago with the  liquidation of the southern brigades stationed in the northern  governorates. As the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] did not take  any military stand on these liquidations, influential elements  in Sanaa seem to have taken advantage of this situation and  began to liquidate the Ba-Suhayb Brigade. This, in turn, led to  the flare up of the military situation. The military mentality,  which thinks there is a military solution for Yemeni problems,  is the cause of this situation.    [Abu-al-Majd] You had some demands about implementing the  Pledge and Accord Document and emphasized the first article of  that document, which concerns security. Can we have a further  explanation?    [Al-Dali] Yes, we had demands that were agreed on by all  those who signed the document, including the brothers in the  General People's Congress. We signed an agreement that the  assassins of the YSP leaders and those who wreaked havoc on the  country and brushed the citizens' and Yemen's security aside  must be arrested. We said this was the first step to restoring  confidence and that they must arrest the assassins first to  enable us to stay in Sanaa and prepare for the committees'  meeting. But this did not happen and the agreement's first  article has not been implemented.    [Abu-al-Majd] And this is why the war began?    [Al-Dali] They wanted to evade the implementation of the  document and cause the military situation to flare up. They  never liked the document and were not ready to implement it.  They aggravated the military situation to avoid public pressure  on them to implement the document.    [Abu-al-Majd] How can this situation be reversed now that  the  Arab League Council has held a session in Cairo and the  secretary general was entrusted with consulting Yemeni leaders  to stem this bloodshed? In your view, what measures are  required to stop this bloodshed?    [Al-Dali] First, halt the fighting, then disengage the  forces, and then give the brothers--the Arab League, the Arab  brothers led by Egypt--an opportunity to try for a political  solution to this stormy crisis.    [Abu-al-Majd] Before this explosion of the situation, there  were mediatory efforts by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates,  and you both signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman.  These mediations did not succeed; why? Is it because of you or  because of others?    [Al-Dali] In fact, we did adhere to the document and still  want to implement it. We have said that the situation has to be  normalized and confidence restored.    [Abu-al-Majd] Will you continue to pursue unity?    [Al-Dali] Certainly, certainly. Unity would be ours and the  Yemeni people's, and we will carry on with it.    [Abu-al-Majd] Despite all that has happened?    [Al-Dali] Despite everything. But we will rectify our  situation. It has to be corrected.    [Abu-al-Majd] How?    [Al-Dali] This is up to the dialogue.    [Abu-al-Majd] How can there be a dialogue while guns still  heard?    [Al-Dali] Fighting has to stop first; the bloodshed must be  stemmed. And then we should return to the negotiating table and  begin to implement the document. These are our demands as a  communist party.    [Abu-al-Majd] Is the YSP willing to stop the bloodshed or  will it fight unilaterally?    [Al-Dali] We are willing. But if we halt the fighting while  the other party insists on fighting, will we not surrender  ourselves for a massacre?    [Abu-al-Majd] Are you willing to accept...    [Al-Dali, interrupting] Yes in principle.    [Abu-al-Majd] But are you willing to accept Arab buffer  forces, if such a proposal is resubmitted, discussed, and  accepted by the Arab league?    [Al-Dali] If necessary. If it is necessary and there is no  other way to halt the fighting, we have no objections at all.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do you not refuse to receive an Arab  delegation  carrying these proposals?    [Al-Dali] Not at all. We have no objection if all other  means are exhausted.    [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, what is the true and effective way  out  of this crisis to save the Yemeni people and halt the bloodshed?    [Al-Dali] We believe we are suffering a caesarean section  with this new situation in Yemen. When we demand a halt to the  fighting, we mean to alleviate the pains and afflictions of this  caesarean section. That is all I can say. We insist on halting  the fighting, not because of a sense of defeat nor to avert the  outcome, but to spare the blood of the Yemeni youths who are  being killed here and there.</p>

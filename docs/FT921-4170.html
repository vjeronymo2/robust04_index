			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Logica down 54% despite good US result LOGICA, one of the few large, publicly-owned UK computing services companies still in British ownership, saw first half pre-tax profits fall 54 per cent despite the return to profitability of its troubled North American subsidiary. The fall in profits - from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 2.15m - was caused by write-offs following a decision to pull out of a loss making venture in television technology. Turnover for the six months to end December was 3 per cent up at Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 96.1m). Earnings per share came out at 2.1p compared with 4.4p last time. The interim dividend is being maintained at 1.15p, a reflection, according to Mr David Mann, managing director, of the uncertainty of the six months ahead. The company finished the period with broadly unchanged cash balances of Pounds 14.9m. The share price fell 4p to 187p. Logica's profitability in recent years has been hindered by its North American losses; the US operation, however, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 400,000 - the consequence of restructuring and tight financial control - compared with a loss of Pounds 1.8m last time. Overall operating profits were reduced by some Pounds 1.6m as a result of the company's decision to withdraw from a project called 'Playout' dealing with the automation of television studios. The loss was unexpected and surprised analysts who had been anticipating first half profits of Pounds 3.5m. Logica made small losses in continental Europe despite an 8 per cent growth in revenue as the result of acquisitions by its Italian subsidiary. Mr Mann said associated undertakings including Speedwing Logica, a joint venture with British Airways, were peforming well. The company, which makes about 50 per cent of its revenues from fixed price contracts, has customers including ANZ Bank in Australasia, the Public Records Office in the UK and the European Space Agency.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERRENCE MCNALLY: THE PLAYWRIGHT AS SURVIVOR;  </P> <P> 'YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE YOUR WORK'  </P> <P> The other day Terrence McNally had to take part in "a book-signing thing" at  the Drama Book Shop. When he saw all his plays laid out on the table, he  realized that he had been in the theater for 25 years.  </P> <P> Rather than depress him, this struck him as an achievement. Terrence McNally  likes the theater. He likes himself when he's working in it. He is glad that he  managed to hang in there.  </P> <P> McNally's new play, "Up in Saratoga" (opening Thursday at the Old Globe  Theatre) is his 30th or so script. Some have been hits: "Next" (1969), "The  Ritz" ('75), "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" ('88).  </P> <P> And some have been flops. There was McNally's very first play in 1965, "And  Things That Go Bump in the Night." This ended with one of the characters being  chased into an electric fence, a theme that several of the New York critics had  fun with the next morning. "Two of them called for my death," McNally recalled  the other day in his Village apartment.  </P> <P> Maybe this isn't a bad way for a playwright to be introduced to the theater. It  certainly avoids false illusions. The trick, of course, is to survive the  initiation. McNally did, thanks to his producer, Ted Mann.  </P> <P> "We had come in under budget, so Ted decided to cut the ticket prices to $2 and  $3 and keep the show open for two-and-a-half weeks. The reviews were so bad we  didn't know if anyone would come, even at those prices. But we sold out every  night and the show was wildly controversial.  </P> <P> "So I had my two-and-a-half weeks of feeling like a playwright. There were  people going bravo after the show. There were people who were moved by my  writing. If Ted had closed the show in one day, I don't know if I could have  lived with that. I don't know if I could have gone on being a playwright."  </P> <P> Since then, McNally says, "I've had enormous ups and downs. There have been  years when I've felt that I couldn't do it anymore, financially. But I've never  lost my enthusiasm for the theater, and I've always been able to get my plays  done, in some fashion."  </P> <P> He never writes the same play twice. Many of them are funny; some tenderly so,  like "Frankie and Johnny." But he has a dark, grotesque side, as in a new  script, "The Lisbon Traviata." In another mood, he will tackle the book of  musicals -- "The Rink" (a flop a few seasons back) or Harold Prince's planned  new version of "Kiss of the Spider Woman."  </P> <P> "It's a weird thing about my career. I do one thing and then I do something  else. After 'The Ritz,' everybody expected me to write farce. After 'It's Only  a Play," they expected me to write drawing-room comedies. Now with 'Frankie and  Johnny" everybody expects me to write blue-collar romance.  </P> <P> "You could argue that any writer's really just trying to write the same play  over and over. First as a comedy; then as a musical; then as a tragedy. I don't  know. I just think it's fun to work in all these forms. When I see a bare  stage, I want to write for that."  </P> <P> "Up in Saratoga" is another departure for McNally: a period piece. It's based  on Bronson Howard's "Saratoga," a high-society costume drama from the 1870s.  When Broadway producer Liz McCann gave it to McNally to read, with the thought  that he might adapt it, he found it "You just want people to see your work."  </P> <P> charming but creaky.  </P> <P> Rather than simply adapt Howard's original, McNally has remodeled it into "a  play by me, that I hope is respectful of the period; that I hope will make you  believe that you're in the 19th Century for two and a half hours.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of fun writing it. I liked creating a language where you can't use  gutter talk or slang. Also, if you were going to give people a sense of the  theater of that day, there had to be lots of subplots, a lot of loose ends to  tie up. Plays with 25 people shouldn't be short.  </P> <P> "Bronson Howard's name will always be on it, along with mine, but if it doesn't  work, I'm afraid I'll have to take full responsibility. I'm optimistic,  though."  </P> <P> McNally approaches his trade like a craftsman. "I never think of myself as  writing literature. I'm more like an architect who is creating a blueprint, on  which people will put up something that will stand. They can have bathrooms and  bedrooms and access from floor to floor. It's all very practical.  </P> <P> "For me, writing the play is only 50% of the experience. You write that first  draft by yourself. But 'Frankie and Johnny' isn't what's on the page, it's what  will happen in the theater. So you need actors and a director. They inspire me.  They delight me."  </P> <P> The whole theater process delights him. McNally has written for the screen  (he's adapting "Frankie and Johnny" for Paramount right now) but he's happiest  while rehearsing a new show. "Theater is like -- a friend. Not a parent figure,  but a friend. I think theater brings out the best in people. I know I'm a nicer  guy when I'm in rehearsal. More trusting. More open.  </P> <P> "I mean, there's a horrible side of me that the theater also brings out. Like  when I get a bad review, or when someone turns a play down. But when things are  going well in rehearsal, with all the actors giving so much, I'm reminded of  the nicest times in my life, back in high school -- before I got competitive  with people."  </P> <P> McNally went to high school in Corpus Christi, Tex., after which he came to New  York to major in English at Columbia. In his senior year he wrote the Varsity  Show, and that started his involvement with theater.  </P> <P> The next step was a $40 a week gofer-ship with the Actors Studio, where he  studied everybody from Geraldine Paige to Marilyn Monroe, and where he learned  that he couldn't act -- perhaps the reason he has always admired actors so  much.  </P> <P> After 25 years, McNally remains young in his love for theater, catching every  show at a late preview, so that he won't be corrupted by the critics, and up on  all the gossip. He also knows more about opera than most music critics, as he  regularly demonstrates on the Metropolitan Opera quiz.  </P> <P> He's a New Yorker to the soul -- but disenchanted with the alienation he sees  around him, the kids with their earphones, the adults buying their videos for  another lonely Saturday night.  </P> <P> "Frankie and Johnny" was a reaction to that mood. McNally had been in India,  where he found people actually paying attention to each other. He wanted to  write a play showing that it could happen in Manhattan, too.  </P> <P> "You know, that miracle. You think, I've had my two divorces or three bad  relationships (he is unmarried), and I'm not gonna get involved again . . . and  then this miracle happens.  </P> <P> "I thought it might be a play that would only interest people in their 40s and  50s, but we got the college kids and the little old ladies, and they all  responded to it.  </P> <P> "No way will 'Lisbon Traviata' be as popular as 'Frankie and Johnny.' It's very  violent. But we've had a little production of it in New York, and a lot of  people liked it, and a lot of people had criticisms of it.  </P> <P> "And that's all right. I mean, I don't love everything I write. Playwrights are  aware of the flaws in their work. They just can't fix 'em. If they could, they  would. You don't expect everything to run forever.  </P> <P> 'You just want people to see your work'.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait City, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Visiting U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher today reassured the Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC) that his country is committed to the  security and stability of the region.    At a delayed news conference following his one-hour meeting  with the GCC foreign ministers held in Riyadh, the capital of  Saudi Arabia today, Christopher, who arrived there to start his  Middle East shuttle to push forward the stalled peace process,  described the meeting as excellent.    He said the talks dealt with relations between the U.S. and  the GCC -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,  Bahrain, Qatar and Oman -- and the Middle East process.    They also discussed the Gulf security situation in the light  of Iraq's intransigence, the GCC relations with Iran and the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added.    Christopher reiterated the necessity for the GCC countries  to  stand firm in alliance against Iraq, the Kuwait news agency KUNA  reported.    He also expressed hope that the GCC states would help in  lifting the Arab boycott against Israel, explaining that the  boycott would now harm the Palestinian side as well, KUNA quoted  informed sources as saying.    The GCC ministers reiterated their countries' commitment to  the Arab League resolutions on imposing trade embargo against  Israel.    During the meeting, the ministers did not discuss the  reported normalization of relations with Israel or offering more  financial aid to back up the self-rule agreement signed between  Israel and the Palestinians.    Christopher left Riyadh this evening to continue his Middle  East shuttle, which will also take him to Egypt, Israel and  Syria.</p>

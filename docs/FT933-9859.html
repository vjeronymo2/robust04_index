			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / French still cautious on rapid interest rate cuts THE Bank of France moved to ease money market interest rates yesterday, but signalled its opposition to rapid interest rate cuts despite what was in effect a flotation of the French franc last weekend. Stock market investors shrugged off the cautious signal from the financial authorities, pushing the CAC-40 index up by almost 1 per cent to 2,149, its highest ever, in anticipation of reduced borrowing costs. The central bank reopened its five-to-ten day borrowing facility, suspended at the end of July to tighten liquidity as part of France's unsuccessful attempt to thwart sustained attacks against the franc. The rate, available to commercial banks, was re-introduced at 10 per cent, compared with the rate of 7.75 per cent at which it was suspended. The moves confirmed the government's cautious approach to reducing interest rates, despite the widening of the fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 to 15 per cent. The stance has perplexed some economists who expected France to take advantage of the weakening of the franc/ D-Mark link to cut borrowing costs and help lift the economy from recession. They warned that an attempt to keep the franc strong by maintaining high interest rates could be self-defeating. 'If the currency markets feel that continued high interest rates are damaging the prospects of French economic recovery, then the franc may come under attack again,' said one economist in Paris. Yesterday the franc fell by more than one centime against the D-Mark, to about FFr3.49. France's cautious stance partly reflects political considerations. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has staked his credibility on a strong franc and has said convergence between the French and German currencies remains the objective of his government. But some members of Mr Balladur's Gaullist RPR party are believed to favour a quick cut in interest rates. Mr Alain Madelin, minister for small business, who last December advocated a floating franc, said the easing of franc/D-Mark links opened the way to interest rate cuts. Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR leader, has also hinted that he favours interest rate cuts as a means to reduce unemployment, forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by the end of the year. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly, is also thought to be in favour of a rapid reduction in borrowing costs.</p>

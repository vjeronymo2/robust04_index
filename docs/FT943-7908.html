			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UN in Vatican's firing line: Andrew Hill examines the furore over a population conference Pope John Paul II has just begun 10 days' holiday in Italy's Valle d'Aosta. He probably needs it. Not only is he recovering from an operation on his leg and planning a visit to the former Yugoslavia, he is also in the front line of one of the fiercest diplomatic and ideological battles fought by the Vatican in recent years, a battle which concerns, according to the pontiff himself, 'the very future of humanity'. The occasion for this struggle is the United Nations' international conference on population and development, in Cairo next month. The Pope's principal concerns are what his envoys have described as an assault on the family, and an attempt by certain UN members to give new legitimacy to abortion and artificial contraception. The Roman Catholic church's position on abortion is well known and fixed. The Pope described abortion as 'a heinous evil' when he met Ms Nafis Sadik, the conference secretary, in March. But rather than relying on church hierarchy to pass on its message, the Vatican is using its own diplomatic network, and privileged position as an independent state and UN member, to influence the outcome at Cairo. The offensive started in March when ambassadors accredited to the Holy See were invited to a meeting to hear the Vatican's tough line on the conference. The day after Ms Sadik's visit to Rome, the Pope also drafted a letter to leaders of all UN countries, outlining his fears that if certain 'innovations' in the draft conclusions prepared for the Cairo conference were adopted, they 'could cause a moral decline resulting in a serious setback for humanity, one in which man himself would be the first victim'. The Vatican's main fear is that UN members will try to undermine the conclusions of the last world population conference, in Mexico 10 years ago, that abortion should never be promoted as a means of birth control. The US is a particular target for Vatican pressure, as President Bill Clinton, although opposed to abortion as a method of family planning, has come out in favour of women's right to choose - a position underlined at a tense meeting with the Pope in June. That was the highest-profile diplomatic summit organised by the Vatican, but envoys have also been hard at work attempting to enlist support from smaller UN members, including some outside the Catholic and even Christian faiths. The Holy See will only admit to having received the backing of President Carlos Menem of Argentina, who has publicly declared his willingness to push the Vatican line with pro-choice Latin American countries such as Brazil. According to Italian reports, however, the Vatican can count on the support of a core of African countries such as the Ivory Coast and Senegal, and has also been courting Islamic nations in Africa and the Middle East. In addition, the Vatican is applying pressure closer to home, in Italy itself. Abortion is legal in Italy in certain circumstances, but the issue bubbled to the surface last week - creating further tension within Mr Silvio Berlusconi's fractious ruling coalition - when Mr Altero Matteoli, the environment minister who will be part of the Italian conference delegation, equated abortion with murder in an interview with Vatican radio. In the weekly news magazine Panorama Mr Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister, said the Italian conference position 'would take account of all the orientations and sensitivities which exist in Italian society'. Only at the conference itself will the effect of the Vatican's diplomacy be obvious. The Holy See refused to comment this week on Italian newspaper claims that the UN excised most references to abortion from its annual population report, released on Wednesday, to avoid offending the Vatican and its allies. The Vatican delegation's most potent weapon at the conference is likely to be a threat to torpedo consensus on the final conclusions, risking an acrimonious end to proceedings. As Mr Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican spokesman, told a news conference last week: 'There are not many points on which we disagree but the point is that on some occasions the disagreement is very profound. . . If a consensus is reached in Cairo, which will be what almost everyone is expecting, certain positions have to change regarding the consideration of abortion as a means of family planning. The other possibility is to approve the (final) document without consensus, without unanimity. Nobody will be pleased with that.'</p>

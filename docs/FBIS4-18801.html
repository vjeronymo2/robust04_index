			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnian Administration has claimed that Serbs  used chemical weapons against neighborhoods on the outskirts of  Gorazde. Sarajevo Radio, citing statements issued by the  presidential spokesman, announced that Serbs attacked Gorazde  from three fronts and that there were large numbers of  casualties. Western news agencies have carried stories  regarding the issue based on the Sarajevo radio report.    Vice President Ejup Ganic, who is currently in Istanbul, has  stated that news regarding chemical weapons being used against  Gorazde has reached them as well. Ganic said that accurate  information regarding the situation in the city and number of  casualties will only be definite during the course of the day.    It is expected that Ganic will go to New York to take up the  issue with the UN authorities. It was also reported that  information confirming the use of chemical warfare by the Serbs  against Gorazde has not reached the UN center in New York or the  U.S. Administration. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has started  intensive contacts to investigate the truth behind the claims  that chemical weapons were used against Gorazde -- a region  inside the United Nations declared safe area.    Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will submit a  request calling for an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security  Council in case the claims regarding chemical warfare are  accurate. In a statement he issued to TRT last night, Cetin said  that a possible NATO air operation may be discussed if the  claims are correct.</p>

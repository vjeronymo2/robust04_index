			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Survey of Reinsurance (5): The big become bigger - Valerie Denney takes an overall look at the market place OVERCAPACITY, shrinking profit margins and ruthlessly regular catastrophe losses - these are difficult times for the international reinsurance industry. There have, of course, been the inevitable bail-outs such as Cigna Re UK, Yasuda Europe, Stockholm Re UK and Scan Re, to name but a few London examples. Indeed, even Swedish insurance group, Skandia, among the top five reinsurers during the late Eighties, is now paring down its reinsurance activities worldwide. However, other reinsurers have seen sizeable growth. The Germans have been particularly aggressive. According to the latest Reactions/Standard and Poor's ranking of the top 100 reinsurers, Hannover Re and Eisen &amp; Stahl Re, (both subsidiaries of industrial insurer Haftpfichtverband der Deutschen Industrie Group, which work in close co-operation) saw their net premiums rise by 15.1 per cent in 1990 to Dollars 1664.4m, moving up one place to become the world's sixth largest reinsurance group. This increase was mainly due to Hannover Re's acquisition of a substantial portion of Hamburg International Re's portfolio. Cologne Re, which is owned by France's Groupe de Suez, also moved up one place to number five as its premiums rose from Dollars 1,428.2m to Dollars 1,879.3m. Net premiums at Gerling, an ambitious group which owns a majority stake in Frankona, rose from Dollars 1,139.1m in 1989 to Dollars 1,391.9m (excluding Frankona), leaving the reinsurer at biting point in terms of world ranking. Both companies attribute their growth to new business and increased rates, particularly in non-proportional lines. Dutch company Netherland Reinsurance Group (NRG) and French reinsurer, Scor, have shown the most notable growth, however, following aggressive acquisition programmes. NRG's 1990 figures, which included the acquisition of the UK reinsurer Victory Re, saw net premiums rise by 87.8 per cent to Dollars 1,205.5m, catapulting NRG from 19th position in world ranking to 12th. Scor, which merged with French neighbour UAP Re in 1989 and acquired Vittoria Re of Italy in 1988, Deutsche Kontinentale of Germany in 1989 and the Unity Group of the US in 1990, is renowned as one of the most aggressive players in the reinsurance market today. Net premiums in 1990 increased by 40.3 per cent to Dollars 1,629.4m, moving Scor's world ranking from 12th place to 7th. It is generally believed that Scor is now looking to acquire another European reinsurer. In the US, General Re which saw a 14.9 per cent increase to Dollars 2,065m in 1990, is also rumoured to be circling possible European prey after its ill-fated attempt to buy UK reinsurer Royal Re. With only 5 per cent of its income derived from outside the US, General Re is looking to build a more international portfolio. Such activity is symptomatic of a shifting market. With all its problems the present cycle also offers opportunities for the larger, better capitalised company. As Julianne Jessup of insurance consultants De Lisle Jessup Scott points out, 'the strength and quality of the underlying asset base of reinsurers is becoming increasingly important as insurers focus on the solvency and potential longevity of their protection'. Moreover, as more reinsurance business, particularly in the property/catastrophe area, has to be retained net, it is only the large companies with a large spread of risks and considerable capital accumulation which can afford significant aggregate loss exposure. And as the big become bigger, so too does their grip on the market. In 1990 the top 10 reinsurers accounted for 53 per cent of the total net premiums of the top 100, while the top 20 accounted for 69.3 per cent. Both figures represented an increase on the previous year's 52.3 per cent and 68 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, small companies entrenched in niche positions are still well placed. It is widely believed that those who can build on a long-standing relationship with the cedant and offer specialised services should be guaranteed a stable future. This further fuels the 'polarisation' trend which has been evident in recent years whereby the reinsurance market is divided into large, multifaceted international companies at one end of the scale and the small specialists at the other. Given the combination of too many reinsurance players and a shrinking trading base as cedants retain more business, the prospect of more drop-outs and further concentration of reinsurance capacity is not in doubt. But it will only be the brave few who take the acquisition route. Ms Jessup stresses the difficulty of assessing long-term liabilities. She argues that NRG's acquisition of Victory Re which was acquired for Pounds 122m but shortly afterwards became technically insolvent has done little to encourage acquisitive activity. The Continental Europeans will continue to dominate, particularly the Swiss and the Germans who are allowed to build up catastrophe reserves which can be offset against tax, unlike their international counterparts. In a market ever more concerned with security, this is an important marketing tool. There is reason to suspect that US reinsurers, more willing than Europeans to develop new, as yet untested, means of enhancing capital such as financial reinsurance and therefore placing their longevity into question, will remain a weak force outside American borders. As for Japanese reinsurers, although capital rich and, as such, in a position to become dominant reinsurance players, they have proved risk averse, preferring to focus primarily on domestic business. Such a temperament renders it unlikely that the Japanese will emerge as larger players in the international market.  --------------------------------------------------------------------            STANDARD &amp; POOR'S TOP 20 GLOBAL REINSURERS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank                       Company              Net premium (1990)                                                   (USDollars m)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1                     Munich Re, Germany              8245.0 2                    Swiss Re, Switzerland            5633.8 3                       Employers Re, US              2639.0 4                        General Re, US               2065.0 5                     Cologne Re, Germany             1879.3 6               Hannover Re/Eisen &amp; Stahl, Germany    1664.4 7                        Scor, France                 1629.4 8                      Generali, Italy                1540.6 9                      Gerling, Germany               1391.9 10                Mercantile &amp; General Re, UK         1371.3 11                      Skandia, Sweden               1211.4 12                     NRG, Netherlands               1205.5 13                    Frankona Re, Germany            1134.5 14                 Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, Japan          927.9 15                        American Re, US              921.5 16                Winterthur Group, Switzerland        682.7 17                   Lincoln National Re, US           646.9 18                   Toa Fire &amp; Marine, Japan          645.6 19                 Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine, Japan         645.6 20                   Unione  Italiana Re, Italy        621.3  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Reactions Survey: Standard &amp; Poor's Top 100 Global Reinsurers  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: True West - Theatre Now the two brothers of Sam Shepard's tense and riveting play True West need one another; now they are split by mutual jealousy. At first, they seem as different as Apollo and Dionysus, or Jekyll and Hyde; more crucially, they resemble Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Then, as the power struggle within their sibling rivalry develops, they start to swap characters. It appears - enthrallingly - that each brother is fatally incomplete without the other; and 'fatal' becomes more or less the word. The play, which started virtually without plot, winds up in a crescendo of action. Congratulations to Leeds' West Yorkshire Playhouse and to director Matthew Warchus for staging this play, and to casting two superlative actors. At the performance I saw, Mark Rylance was Austin (the younger, more educated, citified writer) and Michael Rudko was Lee (the older, wild, lone traveller from the desert). But they exchange roles at alternate performances, and I am impatient to see them in reverse. Soon, I will have the chance: True West comes to London's Donmar Warehouse in November. I look forward also to seeing again, in two small roles, the excellent Marcia Warren's economically eloquent account of their Mom, and David Henry as (ungrateful role) the film-producer Saul Kimmer. No, True West is not a great play. It moves in terms of dichotomies and parabolas: too schematic. Only occasionally does it relax and add the kind of unnecessary detail that puts flesh on its lean bones. One such passage is Austin's hilarious slow narration of how their father lost his teeth. Two more such passages occur when their Mom talks of (a) Picasso, (b) Alaska. Later - of course] - we see that Picasso and Alaska are just another pair of Shepard's dichotomies (civilisation versus the wild, education versus nature). For that matter, Mom and the unseen Dad are themselves also artificial polar opposites. All of which is clever, interesting, but not always real. Yet True West, as they say, brings up a whole lot of stuff. No-one can miss the point of the image early on when Austin mounts a stepladder to spray his mother's house plants, while Lee chucks the beer cans he has finished onto the floor. Or the chaos later on, when the brothers turn the room into an urban desert: Lee attacking a broken typewriter with a golf club, Austin making toast simultaneously in 10 stolen toasters. Even at its most diagrammatic, the jealousies of brother and brother are shockingly potent. Warchus' production highlights such moments, but allows the actors to give performances very close to sheerest transparent. Rudko is so much the dangerous, needy, plaintive, coyote-like hobo from the desert that I cannot imagine how he will bring off the opposite role. Rylance, despite one or two more calculated moments, nonetheless gives an astonishing performance. Just the way he breathes as, early on, he watches Lee, speaks volumes: as does the way his soft, grainy voice suddenly finds a driving charge of passion as he confronts his worst shock of defeat and injustice. I know no male actor today who can so catch my heart in my throat. This production clinches what I have felt for some time: that the West Yorkshire Playhouse is the most vital and refreshing English theatre outside London today.</p>

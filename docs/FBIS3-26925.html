We hereby relay this document to you; please implement it  accordingly.    Delegating import and export powers to commercial and  material supply enterprises is one important measure to deepen  circulation restructuring, expand opening up, augment the  vitality of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and  quicken pace of developing tertiary industry. All localities  and related departments may select some large and medium-sized  commercial and material supply enterprises that fall in line  with the conditions of the experiment based on the opinions of  the three ministries on the implementation of the measures on a  trial basis in different stages and batches in an active, sure,  and steady way.    The State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT  should promptly summarize experiences in delegating powers to  commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis and  earnestly resolve enterprises' problems which surface in  unfolding exports to push the smooth progress of this work on a  trial basis.    PRC State Council    4 November 1993    ANNEX  <H3>  Several Opinions on Delegating Powers of Import and Export  Operation to Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises </H3>   Based on the spirit of the "Resolution of the Central  Committee and the State Council on Quickening the Pace of  Developing Tertiary Industry" and the State Council's  requirements on selecting large and medium-sized commercial and  material supply enterprises where conditions are mature to  delegate import and export operational powers to them on a trial  basis, we hereby set out several opinions on this issue as  follows:  <H3>  I. Principles for Delegating Powers of Import and Export to  Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises </H3>   1. Delegating powers of import and export operations to  commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis aims  chiefly at deepening restructuring of circulation, expanding  opening up, and augmenting the vigor of large and medium-sized  state-owned commercial and material supply enterprises to  quicken the development of tertiary industry.    2. First, it is necessary to select a small number of  commercial (including commercial, grain, supply and marketing)  and material supply enterprises, with comparatively satisfactory  economic returns and a certain foundation in import and export  work, to delegate powers to them on a trial basis.    3. To enable work in this aspect to be conducted in an  active, sure, and steady way, when determining an enterprise to  conduct import and export operations on a trial basis, it is  necessary to conform with the actual conditions of China's  commercial and material supply enterprises; at the same time, it  is imperative to take into consideration the present conditions  of China's foreign economic and trade structure in conducting  examination and approval and strictly abide by the stipulated  conditions.    4. While chiefly examining an enterprise's own conditions,  it is imperative to give appropriate consideration to the  distribution of trades and regions in selecting enterprises for  the experiment.    5. Commercial and material supply enterprises granted powers  of import and export operation (limited to experimental  commercial and material supply enterprises as follows) should  achieve a basic balance, and the scope of their import and  export operations should be unanimous with the approved scope of  their domestic operations. In principle, experimental commercial  and material supply enterprises should refrain from operating in  commodities imported with central foreign exchange in unified  joint operations stipulated by the state. Commercial retail  enterprises are not to participate in wholesale operations for  imported commodities or act as agents for imported commodities;  an enterprise's import volume should not exceed the annual sum  of hard currency it brings in.    6. Experimental commercial and material supply enterprises  should take up the task of bringing in hard currency issued by  the state and handing over hard currency to the central  treasury, report and submit statistical materials to responsible  economic and trade departments according to the regulations, and  accept guidance and supervision of the departments in charge of  import and export operations, while subordinating themselves to  the coordination of related import and export commercial  chambers. Experimental commercial and material supply  enterprises enjoy the same treatment as foreign trade  enterprises in state import and export policy.    7. In principle, powers of import and export will be  directly delegated to those commercial and material supply  enterprises who apply for the experiments; in general, no other  foreign trade companies will be examined and approved.  <H3>  II. Conditions Which Experimental Commercial, Material  Supply Enterprises Must Fulfill </H3>   1. They must be economic bodies with the government and  enterprise separated, operating on their own, and assuming sole  responsibility for their own profits and losses. The core  enterprise of the enterprise group must implement unified  control over enterprises in its inner circle, and general  companies (including joint companies) should do likewise  regarding those enterprises directly under their jurisdiction.    2. They must own permanent operational sites as well as the  installations and funds needed for unfolding import and export  operations, and they must have complete and healthy internal  organizations and professionals in foreign trade and technology  corresponding to import and export operations.    3. Material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises  directly under departments and in the coastal areas should  import a minimum of 1 billion yuan of commodities each year, and  material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises in the  hinterland must import a minimum of 300 million yuan.    4. With regard to those material supply and commercial  wholesale enterprises mainly operating in electrical machinery  products directly under the jurisdiction of departments and in  the coastal areas, they must accomplish a minimum annual import  and export volume of 600 million yuan, and the minimum annual  import and export volume in the hinterland must be 200 million  yuan.    5. The minimum annual import and export volume of commercial  retail enterprises must be 300 million yuan.    6. Generally, the export volume should not be less than  one-third of the aforesaid import and export volume.    7. Taking into consideration the realities of China's  commercial and material supply enterprises, when their import  and export volumes fail to meet the aforesaid standards, their  marketing volumes may be regarded as their reference figures for  the initial stage of the experiment.    8. Regarding those commercial retail enterprises who  specialize in Chinese commodities and stores which have already  opened in the former USSR, Eastern Europe, and other peripheral  countries, powers of barter trade may be delegated to those  which have established such enterprises in those countries.  <H5>  III. Procedures For Application, Examination, and Approval </H5>   1. Applications for local enterprises should be sent to the  State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT by  economic commissions and economic and trade commissions (foreign  trade administrations) of all provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities, and cities with individual listings in plans.    2. Applications for enterprises directly under jurisdiction  should be sent to the State Economic and Trade Commission,  MOFTEC, and the MIT by the various responsible departments.    3. Materials which should be included in the application  are: A report on the feasibility of the enterprise operating in  imports and exports, the opinions of the responsible  administrative department on the enterprise, the operational  conditions of the enterprise in the previous two years (State  Statistics Bureau or local statistics bureau's original  statistics) and its actual results in imports and exports, the  enterprise legal person operational license, the enterprise's  actual funds situation, and a catalogue of the import and export  commodities of the applicant enterprise.    4. After the MIT receives the applications from various  localities and departments, it will set out its opinions on its  preliminary examinations to the State Economic and Trade  Commission, which will examine the applications of enterprises  sent by departments and localities, then it will submit its  opinions on those enterprises that fall in to line with MOFTEC's  conditions, which will examine and give its official written  reply.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "State Duma Plenary Meeting. </F> Deputies Lacked a Mere Trifle To Conduct Effective Work"]    [Text] It turned out that only the absence of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy can affect the course of law-making in Russia:  Yesterday the State Duma's work was unprecedentedly effective.  First of all, the deputies succeeded in their third attempt to  pass the law on the status of deputies, in which the Liberal  Democratic leader was particularly interested. In addition, the  law "On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of Government  Authorities in the State Mass Media" was adopted in the first  reading.    The absence of the Liberal Democratic leader allowed the  Duma  to adopt a law regarding the status of a deputy without the  imperative mandate, that is, one that would not give faction  leaders the right to deprive a subordinate of a deputy's  mandate, something Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been persistently  seeking. After a long break the State Duma approved a draft law  on ways of dealing with the activity of state power authorities  and state means of mass information. Under the draft, the press  must publish materials by Russian Government authorities and  Federation components under contracts to be financed by money  from the budget. The money is considerable: If the law were  already in force, newspapers and magazines would have been paid  around 35 billion rubles for what they published in March.  Radio and television will be less costly for the budget because  semi-official reports will not be given that much air time. In a  three-minute information program no more than 30 seconds can be  devoted to the parliament. A program of more than 30 minutes is  instructed to spend at least four minutes on Federal Assembly  coverage. Information on the activity of government authorities  should be reported as a separate block at the beginning of news  programs without any comments. It was proposed that a deputy  elected in a territorial district be given a chance to speak on  regional radio and television once every two months for at least  seven minutes.    When presenting the draft, Mikhail Poltoranin said that he  would guarantee the equality of rights of all branches of power  to distribute information on their activity. At the same time,  there will no longer be any need in the "Parliamentary  Hour"-style programs, he said. Although the deputies passed the  law in the first reading, they did not appear to be entirely  certain of "information equality." Literally several minutes  later they passed a decree on setting up the State Duma's  television service, which will prepare daily programs "on the  activity of Russia's representative branch."</p>

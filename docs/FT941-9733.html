			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Cookery: An end to le gateau - Puddings Heaven be praised: proper puddings are back in fashion. Not of course that any self-respecting Briton was ever over-concerned about fashion. We knew in our hearts that traditional British cooking had the edge on all that fancy foreign stuff, but now it is official. Research into restaurant trends reveals that the reign of that false pretender, the Black Forest gateau, is finally over. Bread and butter pudding is the 'new' favourite on restaurant menus. Hurrah. Closet pudding eaters need hide their preferences no longer. Come out and be counted. While yesterday's folk toy with crepes Suzette on Shrove Tuesday, why not celebrate with something more substantial - treacle sponge, Spotted Dick, Sussex pond pudding, jam roly-poly or queen of puddings. Consider joining The Pudding Club*. Founded by Jean and Keith Turner eight years ago, when puddings were becoming endangered species, it welcomes new members and there is no joining fee. The only requirement for membership is a love of puddings. Club meetings, held regularly on Friday evenings, are so popular that places are booked weeks or even months ahead. The meetings are in fact dinners, at which seven puddings from the the club's repertoire - about 40 recipes - are served. Safeway, the supermarket chain, recently launched six recipes from The Pudding Club repertoire adapted to cooking on a commercial scale. Its versions are also designed to appeal to vegetarians, hence the replacement of beef suet with vegetable suet and palm oil. Pleasingly, however, butter is used where butter should be. No nasty margarine. I cannot pretend that Safeway's steamable/microwavable plastic-basined puddings are on a par with the best home-made, but some of them are a good deal better than anything I was given at school. I might well buy one or two as consolation for those left at home when I next go on a business trip. The syrup pudding - in other words a steamed golden syrup sponge - was agreeably light and good, though much in need, I thought, of zipping up with lemon. This was remedied by warming a little extra syrup with some lemon zest and plenty of lemon juice to pour on at the point of serv-ing. Sticky toffee pudding, another steamed sponge made with butter, was again far too sweet and could have been more generously sauced but, basically, it was appealing. I am prepared to bet it will be a best seller. I confess I have never been a Spotted Dick fan and this version, though lavishly fruited, did not convert me. Oriental ginger seemed to me solid stodge and harshly hot, as though made with African ginger rather than aromatic Jamaican or Australian. I had high hopes of Lord Randall but found the noble lord disappointing, handsome enough but the combination of marmalade and dried apricots it contained made a curiously bitter marriage. Jam and coconut pudding sounded off-putting, like the worst of junior school confections. In fact I liked the moist, slightly scented coconut sponge a lot. Pity about the jam - too much of it and low grade. RHUBARB &amp; ALMOND CRUMBLE TART (serves 6) If you are not yet ready to get your teeth into traditional heavyweight British puddings, here is a medium-weight stepping stone. This recipe also offers a good way to settle squabbles about whether a crumble, or a pie, or a tart, should go on the Sunday lunch menu since it is a hybrid. For the orange pastry: 4 oz unbleached white household flour; 2 oz wholemeal flour; 1 well heaped teaspoon of sugar; 1 1/2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz lard; the finely grated zest of an orange and about 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice to bind. For the rhubarb and almond crumble: 13-14 oz trimmed weight forced rhubarb (you will need nearly 1 1/2 lb gross); 4 oz wholemeal flour; generous  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 3 oz pale muscavado sugar; 2 1/2 oz butter; a generous 1 1/2 oz flaked almonds plus an extra tablespoon of flaked almonds to sprinkle over the top. Make the pastry in the usual way and chill it briefly. Roll it out, use it to line a 10in to 11in fluted flan tin and chill again. Line it with baking parchment, weigh it down with beans and blind bake at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6 for 10-12 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for 8 minutes more. Meanwhile prepare the filling. Whizz the flour, cinnamon and sugar in a food processor. Cut then rub in the butter and stir in all but one tablespoon of the nuts. (Everything up to this stage can be done well ahead if wished.) Cut the trimmed rhubarb stalks obliquely into one-inch lengths. Sprinkle about one-third of the crumble mixture evenly over the base of the blind baked tart. Cover with the fruit and sprinkle on the rest of the crumble - do not press it down. Then scatter the extra almonds on top. Slide the tart onto a hot baking sheet and bake at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6 for 35 minutes until the rhubarb is hot and tender but not collapsing and the almond crumble is crisp. Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving with or without custard, cream or orange syllabub sauce. * The Pudding Club, Three Ways Hotel, Mickleton, Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire GL55 6SB.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (EFE) -- In an interview  published today in the newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina stated that Cuba faces the challenge of  surviving and adapting to new times without renouncing its  revolutionary goals. Cuba has carried out "a social project for  more than 30 years. It has overcome imbalanced trade situations  and all those misconceptions about one's worth," Robaina stated.    Over the past years, according to the foreign minister, the  Cuban Government has made important reforms, above all in  economic aspects. Such reforms are not contrary to the  revolution, because the word itself signifies change and "this  country has been changing and revolutionizing since I learned  how to reason."    Robaina told the Mexican newspaper that over the past months  "we saw the need to decriminalize the dollar and we did so. In  agriculture we decided to turn over the state lands to the  people so that they could make them productive." He added that  in the future they might make other decisions "which cannot even  be conceived now, because life dictates necessities and one must  have a fresh and agile mind to adapt to new circumstances, no  matter how hard it may seem."    The Cuban foreign minister said that "the same generation  that staged the Moncada attack has headed the attack on the new  times, which demonstrates its revolutionary capability, its  constant renewal, and the profound, enriched, and expert  thinking of a group that is capable of directing changes without  losing the essence."    Robaina reiterated that Cuba is not willing to lose any of  its achievements. He stressed that "our independence, our  sovereignty, and our capability to speak with our own voice  cannot be modified." Personally, he said, he would like to be  able to emerge from the difficulties soon, "so that reason will  prevail once and for all and the United States will lift the  economic, commercial, and financial blockade to which we have  been subjected."    The foreign minister explained his wish to request that "the  pressures be lifted, so that we can rejoin a more fair and  equitable world economy, so that our people can again enjoy the  standard of living which it had before the special period, and  so that it can achieve much more."</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / RPI history of candles and mangles the barometer of the domestic economy - has been laid bare by the government. In a book published yesterday, the Central Statistical Office examines 'the ups and occasional downs' of inflation; the purchasing power of the pound; and the composition of the RPI's traditional shopping basket of goods and services. The so-called shopping basket reveals most about technological innovation and trends in consumer spending since 1914, when the government started monitoring the cost of living. Candles, corset lacing and mangles were part of the 1914 index. The CSO reviews the basket each year to accommodate fashion, new products and changing markets. Candles and mangles have long been replaced by ready-cooked meals, satellite dishes, microwave ovens and compact-disc players. When sales of black-and-white television sets declined, for example, they were dropped from the index. Since 1947, prices have increased 18-fold. One pound sterling in 1914 had shrunk to between 2p and 3p in terms of purchasing power by 1990. Retail Prices 1914-1990. HMSO. Pounds 10.95. Letters, Page 23</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "km": "Bonn Submits Offer for World Trade </F> Organization"]    [Text] Geneva, 14 June -- The Federal Government on  Tuesday [14 June] submitted its offer at the GATT headquarters  in Geneva to establish the future World Trade Organization (WTO)  in Bonn. Unless further offers are received by this Wednesday,  Germany will be competing against Switzerland, which would like  to keep the WTO in the current GATT building if possible. In a  letter to GATT Director General Peter Sutherland, Federal  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt praised the advantages of the  German offer. It has been said that Bonn would be willing to pay  for the expenses of moving the GATT Secretariat (400 employees)  and not ask for any rent. So far, in accordance with Germany's  share in world trade, Bonn has paid about 12 percent of the GATT  budget (110 million German marks). The costs for the trade  organization, of which no official estimates have been made yet,  would have to be added. Due to its many tasks, the WTO, which  will be established in early 1995 after the ratification of the  Uruguay Final Act, is expected to employ more than 500 people.  Moreover, Bonn would grant diplomatic status to more  professionals and be generous as far as work permits for  dependents are concerned. This offer is an indirect reaction to  complaints by Geneva diplomats about Swiss restrictions.  Nevertheless, it has to be assumed that Switzerland will make  further concessions in addition to what it promised so far to  keep the organization at the European UN seat in Geneva. This  is all the more likely, since the country is increasingly  beginning to isolate itself in Europe. The WTO preparatory  committee, which includes the 123 GATT members, is expected to  make a decision before the summer recess.</p>

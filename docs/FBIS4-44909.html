			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Successful Pulling of Single Crystal </H5>   At last, implementation of high-temperature  superconductivity  technology appears imminent. A blueprint for a future society  was supposed to be drawn by superconductivity technology when  high-temperature oxide superconductivity was discovered.  Finally, significant technical achievements in Japan, such as  the success in long-awaited pulling of a superconductor's single  crystal and the development of technology for superconducting  thin-film synthesis, are reported to have lifted the technical  level closer to the level of implementation.    In 1993, we saw a great breakthrough in high-temperature  superconductivity technology. Having successfully pulled  high-temperature superconducting single crystals, the  Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) developed a new  process to control crystal orientation by applying a temperature  gradient and achieved a magnetic levitative force of 20 kg with  an yttrium-based (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) superconducting  bulk material. At the same time, in the private sector, Japan  Steel Corp. developed a production method for a superconductor  without any crystalline boundaries and produced an yttrium-based  superconducting bulk material that also manifested a magnetic  levitative force of 20 kg.    Superconductivity is a phenomenon in which electrical  resistance becomes zero. Thus, superconductivity permits the  passage of large currents without loss, and superconductive  magnets generate extremely high magnetic repulsion to lift  gigantic objects. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, numerous  industrial applications have been conceptualized, e.g.,  superconducting magnetic electricity storage systems (SMES) to  store huge amounts of electric power for power electronics and  energy fields; linear motor cars and electromagnetically  propelled ships for new transportation systems on land and sea;  no-contact belt conveyor systems for distribution systems; new  medical diagnostic devices based on SQUID (superconducting  quantum interference device); and superconducting bearings.    However, at the time of the discovery of the  superconductivity phenomenon, the phenomenon was observed only  in liquid helium, or the ultra-low temperature region of 4.2K  (-268.8C) or below, which severely restricted application  and peripheral devices. In 1986, the group led by then-Professor  Shoji Tanaka, Tokyo University (currently, Professor Emeritus,  Tokyo University, and Director, SRL), discovered a  high-temperature oxide superconductor that made it possible to  use the superconductivity phenomenon at an easier-to-handle  liquid-nitrogen temperature. Thus, the dream of  superconductivity implementation was instantaneously broadened.    Nevertheless, it was still difficult to develop materials  that were ready for practical application, and application  development was progressing in a stop-and-go fashion. However,  the recent achievements at SRL spurred further development of  industrial applications of superconductivity. A joint R&amp;D  project concerning SMES has already been under way between SRL  and electric power companies; and a bearing maker is reportedly  on the verge of commercializing a superconducting bearing after  having successfully test-produced it from an SRL-developed,  yttrium-based, high-temperature superconductor.    At the same time, the successful preparation of thin films  from a high-temperature oxide superconductor made it possible to  develop superconducting semiconductors for ultrahigh-speed  computers, such as Josephson devices. R&amp;D is soon expected to  accelerate as makers of computers and semiconductors.  <H5>  Big Contribution to Medicine </H5>   Superconductivity technology is actively contributing not  only to the advanced science and technology fields, but also to  fields that are closer to our daily lives. Superconducting  magnets containing a superconducting wire coil are used in  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices capable of diagnosing  "sliced" sections of a human body. The usefulness of the MRI  device in medicine, particularly in diagnosis and treatment, is  immeasurable.    Furthermore, in medicine, SQUID is expected to help in  clarifying the sophisticated functions and mechanisms of the  human brain and in diagnosing functional impediments caused by  cerebral infarction and senile dementia, Alzheimer disease, and  central nervous system diseases. Recently, a high-quality,  biological magnetic field measurement system using SQUID was  developed, and in April 1994, the Superconductive Sensor  Research Institute is scheduled to start full-scale tests,  including clinical tests to gather data for practical  application.    Today, the worldwide market for superconductivity  technology,  primarily consisting of MRIs and NMRs for material analysis, is  estimated to be $1.5 billion (&yen;165 billion). This market is  expected to grow rapidly with accelerated application of the  recently advanced high-temperature superconductivity technology  in such fields as new energy, next-generation electronics,  information/communication, travel and transportation systems,  and medicine. Thus, the market is predicted to grow to $12  billion (&yen;1.4 trillion) by the year 2000 and to $90 billion  (&yen;10 trillion) by the year 2010. Japan is currently leading  the world in superconductivity R&amp;D and is also expected to do  the same in practical application development.</p>

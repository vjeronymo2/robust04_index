			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam pins hopes for recovery on 1993 - The dollar's weakness and poor company results have wiped out earlier gains The Amsterdam Stock Exchange appears to have given up hope of a recovery in the second half of this year and is now pinning its hopes on 1993. The bourse, which hit an all-time high in May and once seemed likely to produce further gains during the rest of the year, has fallen sharply recently, reflecting worries about the dollar, the gap between US and European interest rates and the absence of a convincing recovery in the US economy. These problems have been compounded by Amsterdam's traditional sensitivity to dollar weakness as well as by the gloomy first-half figures reported by many Dutch companies. Some of these companies, particularly Hoogovens, the steel group, and Hunter Douglas, the window-coverings maker, have lowered their sights for the rest of the year, saying an improvement cannot be expected until 1993. Analysts say that the long-term perspective for Amsterdam remains good, with prices expected to pick up again when the dollar rebounds and the economy recovery in the US takes place. In the short term, however, the bourse is expected to move sideways at best. Mr Philip Menco, head of investment research at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers, does not rule out further declines before an improvement sets in. 'We could see a small recovery at the end of the year, but the new hope now is the New Year.' Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson's analysts also say that the recovery will not come before the end of 1992, but they project that the bourse could produce a total 12-month return of 19 per cent by August 1993. A key factor determining the pace of recovery is the dollar, which touched a new post-World War Two low of Fl 1.62 yesterday. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, with its preponderance of companies with big international operations, is more vulnerable than other European bourses to the dollar's direction. Mr Menco notes that the US generates 25 per cent of the turnover of Dutch listed companies, after adjusting sales figures for the relative weight of Dutch companies. A low dollar means lower profits when dollar-denominated results are translated into guilders. The current gloom - inspired in part by the Bundesbank's July 16 discount-rate rise and the subsequent fall in the dollar - is a far cry from the heady days of May and June, when the bourse rallied on expectations of an imminent recovery in the US economy. Cyclical shares, in particular, surged, and these have now suffered the greatest falls. In recent weeks, the CBS Tendency Index has given up all the ground it made earlier this year. It started the year at 113.6, peaked at 131.4 on May 26, but has since fallen back to close at 111.5 yesterday. Defensive shares - food companies, publishers, banks and insurers - have so far escaped major downward corrections. Heineken, the brewery group, has even managed to buck the trend and rise by 4.4 per cent from the end of June to stand at Fl 174.90. The transport sector has fared badly, mainly because the dollar is far more important to the revenue side of companies like KLM, Fokker and Nedlloyd than to costs, which tend to be denominated in guilders. Although both Fokker and Nedlloyd have hedged their dollar positions until the end of 1992, this has not prevented a slide in their share prices. Nedlloyd, which barely escaped falling into the red in the first half, has plummeted by 36.7 per cent to Fl 36.90 since June 30, while Fokker has declined by 37.5 per cent to Fl 19.50. Fokker and Philips, the electronics group, have also been hit by factors which go beyond currency concerns. Investors in Fokker were disappointed when it became clear by late July that Deutsche Aerospace's plans to take a 51 per cent holding would not involve a public bid nor purchases on the open market. Instead, the German company is to acquire its controlling share by buying out part of the government's 32 per cent stake and by taking up a Fl 500m (Dollars 312m) issue of new shares. As for Philips, its shares were shaken not only by a well-publicised plunge in first-half results but also by doubts about the prospects of some of its most promising consumer electronics products for the 1990s. The shares are now trading at around Fl 23.60, some 40 per cent below their 1992 high of Fl 39.90. Investor confidence has also been shaken in the bourse's newest arrival, the consultancy engineers Fugro-McClelland. The company, whose partial flotation at Fl 38 per share in April marked the only new listing in Amsterdam this year, has seen its share price drop to less than Fl 23.50 since announcing an unexpected decline in first-half results and reducing its full-year forecast. Fugro-McClelland's drop will do little to improve the climate for new listings, which the bourse authorities are trying to promote to increase the market's appeal and its liquidity.</p>

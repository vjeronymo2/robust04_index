			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Private View: Musical strains and the meaning of life VLADIMIR Ashkenazy holds the door open for other people. He pays their taxi fares and is always saying thank you. He runs from place to place as if life were just too short. The pianist and conductor, a youthful prodigy of 56, was briefly in London this week to announce a two-year, 40-nation tour of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of which he is music director. Since the RPO is one of the three London symphony orchestras being required to undergo a beauty contest in order to decide which gets a single Arts Council subsidy (the fourth, the London Symphony, has been excused) I asked Ashkenazy what he felt about it. I had expected an outburst, but Ashkenazy was sanguine. The subject did not seem to excite him much. When, however, in the same context I asked why classical music was still regarded as the property of the cultural elite, the words began to pour. 'Do you know what I think it is? I've thought a lot about this thing in my life. I think it is people don't want to produce any effort in order to go further in their spiritual development as human beings. That's what it is. 'And then the easiest thing in the world is to say 'Oh, it's elitist. It's not for me, I'm just too low . . . ha ha.'' He manufactured an ironic laugh. 'I don't like that. Human nature is always to get as much as possible without much effort. Not always, of course, but it's a very strong characteristic of human nature which I always fight in me. I fought it quite successfully but I see too many people who want to grab and not give. In order to appreciate the great gifts we have from - I don't know, Beethoven, Stravinsky and Shostakovitch - you have to produce an effort. You have to give. Effort is giving, of course.' It was fear of having to work at it which prevented people reaching beyond accessible pieces such as the Nutcracker Suite, Swan Lake or the New World Symphony ('they are not cheap music, they are great music, absolutely fantastic') and finding themselves in that world without which, he said, music-lovers like himself could not live. Ashkenazy is obsessed, but cheerfully, by a fear of laziness instilled in him by his mother Evstolia when he was a child in Gorky. She was a good Communist who was shocked by her son's decision to emigrate soon after sharing first prize (with John Ogdon) in the 1962 Tchaikovsky piano competition. His father David, a travelling accompanist in light music, was rarely at home. 'When I was a boy, things came terribly easily to me on the piano and I didn't work. I didn't have to. And then when I won my first prize (in the Chopin competition in Warsaw) I realised that actually it's all terribly difficult.' He laughed. 'Then I started to work . . . and never stopped since.' There is nothing conceited nor moralising about Ashkenazy's self-assessment. He has a quick-witted energy kept well under control and finds time to display perfect courtesy to others. In view of his own competition successes I asked him: are young musicians today being made to perform like circus animals? 'I'll try to say something intelligent about it,' he replied. 'There is no straight answer to this. It is a phenomenon of our time. Maybe it is because we are so many on this planet that we have to find a way of selecting the best in this particular fashion. Or maybe it is our need for a spectacle always, sport and spectacle, gladiators and all that.' On balance, he thought, the negative outweighed the positive. The Russian conservatoires have been accused of producing performers whose technique outshines their musicianship. Ashkenazy said technical excellence was indispensable but conceded that audiences and record companies can find it hard to distinguish between what he called 'good delivery' and real communication. What will happen to Russian musicians now? 'I'm not very despondent about their state of affairs. I believe the Russian nation is very potent, full of talent. It will never cease to produce talent. I don't despair. It goes in cycles. It's a great country with great indigenous culture and you can't extinguish it just like that.' Do you regard yourself as primarily a deep-thinking musician and interpreter, or primarily a deliverer? 'It's not for me to comment.' You know your own talent, I said. 'You see, music means so much to me that once in a while I manage to send a message of what it means to me . . . I can't put a label on it.' Are you a better pianist or conductor? 'I've no idea, no idea. Sometimes I think I'm awful whatever I do. Sometimes I think, well, maybe it wasn't so bad. It's not for me to say, absolutely not. My attitude to my life and my activity is simply to do the best I possibly can, with my potential, with my hard work. The rest is in the hands of the elements. 'I learn all the time, I learn every day.' (Ashkenazy spends any free minutes memorising a score). 'There is no end of searching for the truth, the sincerity of your message, depth, honesty, whatever you want to call it.' I said it seemed a monastic sort of vocation. 'It only seems like this, you know? It's not monastic life. It is a sweet slavery. But I have lived my life to the full as an individual. I have fallen in love many times, I am married and I have my children and I have to deal with lots of relationships with other people. My life is very complex outside of music, very fulfilling.' Ashkenazy married an English-educated Icelandic girl, Thorunn (known as 'Dody') whom he met at the Moscow Conservatoire. They have five children. He added: 'After all, music is about life.' How is it about life? 'What else is it about?' Maybe recreation, I said: sitting back and having pleasant sounds float over your head. 'Of course some music, yes. But some of the most important music, the most important self-expression of Beethoven or whoever you like - that's not recreation. It's much more. It is actually perception of life.' You cannot learn about life by listening to music, can you? 'Oh, yes. But you have to have a good background. You have to grow up to that point. And if you've got to that point you can learn a lot.' One might learn from poetry, I said. At least there are words and concrete images. 'Yes but can you describe all your life with words? You can't. That's where music comes in. Poetry is wonderful but the poetry is actually much beyond the words. The words are only symbols.' Is music at your level of engagement an intellectual thing or an emotional one? Do you see humans as divided between heart and head? 'No. Mind for me is one thing. It is a unity of everything. Mind is what decisions we make about our behaviour, about our activities, and those decisions are based on an inter-relation between our emotional and intellectual facilities. The proportion is probably different in all of us but it's still a unifed process.' Ashkenazy is fond of quoting a Russian poet who speaks of 'the intelligent heart and kind brain'. He finds it difficult, he said, to justify dividing music into Classical and Romantic, except in purely formal or historical terms. 'Look at Mozart piano concertos. There's a lot of self-expression there but it is in a strict form that developed at that point. Mozart almost never went beyond that form. He extended it later but he never broke out. Who knows, if he had lived another 20 years he might have done.' Is classical music, as opposed to pop or jazz, dead? 'I simply don't know. I have been thinking about this particular topic for years and years. Lots of people ask me this question, and I am afraid I have no answer. It could be. But it could also not be. It might need an overwhelming new talent to find the new path for our so-called classical music. We can't predict anything. We couldn't predict the collapse of Communism a few years ago. Most of us thought it would be in a few hundred years. 'Even in pop music, which is a very primitive sort of basic, barbaric sort of . . . I wouldn't even call it expression, you can't predict. Heavy metal suddenly appeared once you thought they'd used up everything.' Some people have an end-of-millenium feeling that our creative culture is drying up and we are left worshipping the past. Do you subscribe to that? 'Do you know, we should look more into ourselves, inside our souls and think more about why we are here on this earth, what we are trying to do with our lives, what are our relationships with other people, and so on. And if we look more into ourselves life could be different. 'I firmly believe that if we thought our mission in life was really to find compassion and love and understanding, honesty and so on and trying to do our best then life would be that much better for everyone, including the protagonist himself or herself. And all the rest is secondary, I think. If it all comes from within, there is so much more value to what we do - value to everybody.' Have you found anyone outside music who expresses this well? 'It's from here and there. After all, I didn't create my scale of values just out of the clear air. It is the interrelation between music and what I read in my life. I am interested in what people think about life: that's one of my strongest interests, I think.' He had recently read a book on Hegel - 'so interesting, so stimulating I couldn't put it down' - overcoming an aversion acquired at school in the Soviet Union to lectures on dialectal materialism. How much exchange is there between music and your other worlds? 'Not much on the surface, but inside me a lot. Because I am not a groundless idealist who thinks that everything revolves around me. I am very aware of what is happening around me - intensely so, actually. No, no, I'm not detached from the ways of the world today. 'I'm lucky that I do what I always wanted to do and I have a gift from Nature. That's incredible, I think, it's fantastic. But I know how hard life can be.'</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR PICKS 2 FOR REDEVELOPMENT BOARD;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: APPOINTMENTS MAY SIGNAL CHANGE AT CRA, WITH LESS EMPHASIS ON  COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MORE ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> In what is seen by many City Hall observers as a major shift in the direction  of the Community Redevelopment Agency, Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday appointed  two new members to its board, including a prominent public interest attorney  who is expected to advocate vastly increased attention to the poor and less to  high-rise development.  </P> <P> Carlyle Hall, founder of the Center for Law in the Public Interest, and Larry  Kirk, general manager of the Los Angeles Hilton and Towers, will join the  seven-member board as soon as they are confirmed by the City Council as  expected, the mayor's office said.  </P> <P> Bradley, in a statement, said Hall will play a key role in his plan to shift  the CRA's emphasis from commercial development to social programs in the 1990s.  </P> <P> In particular, Hall will join Bradley's two-year effort to raise the CRA's  legal spending limit of public funds from $750 million to $5 billion. Approval  of the controversial 20-year spending plan is the Bradley Administration's  single biggest goal, said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani.  </P> <P> Hall and Kirk will replace two board members who recently resigned their posts  midterm, Fabiani said.  </P> <P> He said Daniel Horwitz, founder of a Century City mortgage brokerage company,  was asked by Bradley to accept a new position on the city's telecommunications  commission. Edwin W. Steidle, a prominent retailer, voluntarily resigned to  pursue personal interests, Fabiani said.  </P> <P> One well-connected downtown lobbyist who asked not to be named said Hall's  appointment is part of a snowballing effort to "force the redevelopment agency  to reassess its role in the city, and turn its efforts to homelessness,  affordable housing, child care and all the other pressing needs."  </P> <P> The agency has come under steady fire by critics, including many members of the  City Council, who have accused its board of emphasizing too much high-rise  development while remaining aloof from the needs of the poor.  </P> <P> Hall, now in private practice on public interest and environmental issues, was  hired by the city in 1988 to work with angry citizen groups who object to  Bradley's proposed downtown spending plan.  </P> <P> The poverty groups, housing interests and others have demanded that most of the  proposed $5 billion be spent on affordable rental housing, child-care programs  and other services. Bradley has proposed that half the money go to such needs.  </P> <P> "I think it's necessary that the agency begin focusing much of its attention on  the problems of Skid Row, homelessness, families in poverty and other urgent  needs," Hall said.  </P> <P> He added that if the spending limit for downtown is raised -- a plan that needs  the approval of Los Angeles County officials and the City Council -- "the kinds  of changes I am talking about will become inevitable."  </P> <P> City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, one of the agency's fiercest critics, said he  hoped the two appointments "will represent a change in direction for the CRA."  </P> <P> However, Yaroslavsky said that as long as CRA Chairman Jim Wood runs the board,  "then I'm skeptical about whether the tough decisions that need to be made are  going to be made. I think the problem with the agency is with the chairman, and  the person who is chairman of that board and has been for, what, a decade now,  has to take responsibility for the agency."  </P> <P> Wood, in a telephone interview, said he did not want to respond to  Yaroslavsky's criticism, but said of the new appointments, "I feel very good  about what's happening.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's anybody that's more knowledgeable about redevelopment  and its scope than Carlyle Hall," Wood said. Of Kirk, he said: "One of the  things that we're all concerned about is a balanced downtown and a 24-hour city  with residential, retail stores, and a grocery store indeed would be nice. So  he will be very helpful to us."  </P> <P> Dan Garcia, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist who clashed with the CRA many times  as former head of the city Planning Commission, expressed optimism over the  appointments. He said it will be "a challenge for the agency to show it can  change some of its behavior. . . .  </P> <P> "Anyone who knows Carlyle (Hall) will know he won't be a passive member of the  board, and frankly from what I have heard of Kirk, he will not be a yes-man  either," Garcia added.  </P> <P> It is hoped that Kirk, 48, a longtime hotelier and a member of the executive  committee of the Central City Assn. of downtown businesses, will take a lead  role in streamlining the bureaucracy of the agency, Fabiani said.  </P> <P> "I frankly am not going into (the CRA appointment) with a so-called planned  agenda," Kirk said. "I both work downtown and live downtown, so I obviously  have a strong sensitivity to this entire downtown situation."  </P></p>

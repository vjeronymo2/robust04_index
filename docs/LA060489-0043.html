			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLUENCE  </P> <P> Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's university-age daughter, Mary, was refused a  summer job at Yellowstone National Park (Part I, May 24). She was not  "qualified" for the job, according to the notice from the park to her mother,  Lynne.  </P> <P> After receiving this notice, Lynne Cheney called park Supt. Robert Barbee.  After the call, park officials took another look at Mary's application.  </P> <P> Guess What! Mary was then hired for the same job for which her application had  been refused because of her lack of qualification.  </P> <P> A little influence certainly helps.  </P> <P> RAY DIBBLE  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

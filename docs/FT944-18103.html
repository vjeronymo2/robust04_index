			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Management: Three ways to be a better parent - Book review Trapped inside this how-to manual for corporate strategists is a more radical book. The question the authors of Corporate-level strategy: creating value in the multibusiness company raise but never quite tackle is: why should diversified business companies exist? Again and again, the book emphasises how hard it is for a parent company to add value to its operating businesses, how easy to damage them. The authors, Michael Goold, Andrew Campbell and Marcus Alexander, members of London's Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, say their research suggests that 'a few multibusiness companies have corporate strategies that create substantial value'. But 'the majority do not; they are value destroyers'. To avoid this, big-company managers must strive for 'parenting advantage': the businesses must be better off than on their own, and better off than with any other parent. The book is about how to ensure this. The basic tool is something that two of the authors, Goold and Campbell, introduced in their influential 1987 book, Strategies and Styles. They argue that there are three approaches a parent company can take to its businesses: financial control, strategic planning, and strategic control. The first, best exemplified in the UK by Hanson or BTR, gives individual managers freedom to run the businesses as they want, as long as they meet demanding short-term financial targets. The second, strategic planning, yields parents 'closely involved with their businesses in developing plans and strategies,' emphasising long-term goals. IBM is an example, as is Canon, the camera and office equipment company. The third approach, strategic control, falls midway between the others. Parent companies must decide which style to use, the authors say, and apply it consistently across their portfolio of companies, which itself must comprise businesses likely to benefit. If there are misfits, it is easier to change the portfolio than the style. This approach forces managers to think clearly about what parenting involves. The authors have little patience with traditional answers. Finance and central services are easily obtained elsewhere, usually on better terms; merely offering a second opinion 'seldom justifies its cost'; to say the parent is needed to help subsidiaries think strategically is 'arrogant and wrong'. Instead, the authors say, managers must seek bigger 'parenting opportunities', through 'value creation insights', supported by 'distinctive parenting characteristics' and appropriate 'mental maps', applied to the right 'heartland businesses'. Some of the insights cited are shrewd, others bathetic. Put crude-ly, the one for BTR is that a tough parent can force subsidiaries to jack up prices faster than they otherwise would. To be fair, the authors say real value comes not from the insights but from underpinning them with clear and consistent corporate habits. A weakness at the heart of the book lies in the three styles on which the authors base their analysis. Arguably, the financial control style is a distinctively British approach; in the US only Kohlberg Kravis Roberts springs to mind as a fellow member of the club. The authors cite few successful western examples of the strategic planning style, though they argue that it is common in Japan. That leaves most western companies trapped in variations of the strategic control style. For them, the liberation offered by the range of potential styles is illusory; in practice, the issues are tediously familiar. Should we have a matrix structure, or worldwide business units, or country units? Which is more important, the operating budget or the strategic plan? Is this proposed acquisition in a business we understand, or is the apparent similarity a trap? Parenting analysis throws some light on all this, but the knotty problems remain. An unaddressed issue is whether successful parents can continue to add value to subsidiaries once they have achieved the one-off gain of teaching their managers the lessons of shareholder value. Which is where we came in: such transitions apart, what is the economic role of the multibusiness company? Perhaps such giants survive, protected by their inherited control of brands and shelf-space, partly because big companies find it easier to deal with companies of similar size. These forces of inertia are reinforced by familiar capital market imperfections, notably the gap between shareholders and managers. Together, these forces ensure immunity for all but the most egregious value-destroyers. The authors provide a useful guide to avoiding such a fate; but the wider questions they raise remain. * Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Pounds 24.95 (Dollars 34.95)</p>

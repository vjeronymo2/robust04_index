			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fenner ends search for chief executive Fenner, the Hull-based industrial group, yesterday announced it was promoting Mr Mark Abrahams, 38, from finance director to chief executive with immediate effect. The announcement ends a five-month search by Fenner and Mr Colin Cooke, its non-executive chairman, for a chief executive. In December, Mr Julian Bigden, the former managing director, returned to his previous job running Fenner's US polymers operation. Mr Cooke said in March that he had three candidates in mind for the job of chief executive, and it was thought that the appointee would come from outside the company. However, in a short statement yesterday Fenner said that since Mr Abrahams joined the board in 1990 on his appointment as finance director, he had made a considerable contribution to the restructuring of the group's finances and its return to a more profitable performance. Mr Cooke said yesterday that Mr Abrahams was the best of the three candidates for the job. 'He knows Fenner well, is a strategic thinker, and has all the attributes we were looking for.' Mr Cooke and Mr Abrahams have worked together closely in the past year in the restructuring of the company. The search is now on for a new finance director.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Holiday reading that pays - Diary of a Private Investor With a bank holiday Monday approaching, I will be tempted to do some further investment research. Last bank holiday Monday, the sun surprised everyone by appearing. People on the beach sat or lay in little groups. I glanced at them from my beach hut before continuing with one of my favourite holiday activities: looking at company groupings on the share price pages of the FT. It seemed to me that spending an hour or so seeking anomalies in the various sectors of the market was likely to be more rewarding than lying around in the sun risking premature ageing and skin cancer. I hoped that the fresh sea breeze would blow cobwebs from my mind and that potential bargains would dance before my eyes. From experience, I have found that comparing the price/earnings ratios of various companies within the same sector can be a useful pointer to further research. P/e ratios, published in the FT, are based on a company's share price divided by its last published earnings. Suppose a company has 100m issued shares and made a profit after tax of Pounds 10m: the profit attributable to each share is 10p. If the share price is 150p, the p/e is 15. If the profits remain the same, but the share price rises to 250p, the p/e is 25. If the average p/e for a particular sector is, say, 18 and an individual company stands out because its p/e is only 10, does this mean the company is a bargain? Not necessarily. It could well be that the low p/e is due to investors believing the company will announce reduced profits. Or, perhaps, its medium-term future might not be as rosy as other companies in the sector with higher ratios. This is why I use the p/e only as the starting point for further research. Have the company's shares been marked down too harshly by the market? Is the low rating merely temporary? Does the company have solid - perhaps under-valued - assets, so giving it considerable long-term potential? Will the low p/e attract a take-over bid? I try always to find an answer to these, and many other questions, before I invest. My first major source of reference is the annual report. With luck, the company will use the FT's annual reports service (details on the share price pages). If so, a 'phone call will be all it takes to obtain what I require. Sometimes, I will monitor the company's share price movements for a few months or more, just to see if the market marks down the share price even further on rumours of bad news. Quite often, though, not all my questions can be answered with 100 per cent certainty; thus, my eventual investment decision might be partly the result of a gut feeling or hunch. Perhaps my quickest success with this method was in April 1986 following another bank holiday p/e exercise. I noticed that NSS Newsagents had a p/e of about 14 whereas WH Smith and Menzies had ratios of more than 20. Looking in more depth at NSS, I discovered that UK Provident owned 17 per cent of it. At the time, there were press reports about various 'problems' with UKP and, indeed, it entered an operational merger that month with another insurance company, Friends Provident. I thought UKP's stake in NSS might be a useful springboard from which a predator could launch a take-over bid, so my wife wasted no time in buying NSS shares for 150p each. In June 1986, Gallaher duly made a bid and my wife accepted the 210p cash offer, so clearing a profit (before tax) of 60p a share in about two months. If low p/e ratios can point the way to possible profits, can very high ones indicate shares to avoid? Again, not necessarily. The high p/e might result from the market anticipating a substantial increase in the company's profits which might then produce a lower p/e. Or perhaps the share price has been marked up due to take-over rumours. Further investigations are needed before dismissing a company just because its p/e is very high by comparison with other companies in its sector.</p>

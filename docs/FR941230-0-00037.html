The report listed several ways in which imported goods are treated less favorably in Commission investigations than domestic goods are treated in district court infringement cases. In the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Congress amended section 337 to bring USITC procedures into compliance with the GATT ``national treatment'' rules. See H. Rep. No. 103&hyph;826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 140&hyph;142 (1994). The amendments, and the interim rule revisions that follow, focus on changes in four areas that respond to GATT criticisms:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> time limits for concluding an investigation have been eliminated and a procedure for establishing a ``target date'' for completion has been adopted instead;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents are given the opportunity to stay parallel actions in district court while a Commission investigation is proceeding; the Commission's record may be used subsequently in the district court;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations are placed on the Commission's ability to issue ``general'' exclusion orders; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents are permitted to file counterclaims at the Commission; these claims will be heard by a district court, but the same subject matter may be considered as part of an affirmative defense at the Commission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Other amendments bring Commission practice into closer conformity with district court practice with respect to bonding requirements and the deference accorded to arbitration agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Procedure for Adopting Interim Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The URAA was enacted on December 8, 1994. This legislation contains provisions which,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  amend section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337). The Commission's rules concerning Section 337 practice and procedure need to be amended to conform to the new legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission rules to implement new legislation ordinarily are promulgated in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), which entails the following steps: (1) Publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) solicitation of public comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and (4) publication of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could not be utilized in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1994, and will become effective, with respect to the amendments to section 337 of the Act, on January 1, 1995, the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, unless the United States Trade Representative announces prior to that date that the WTO Agreement will not enter into force on that date. These interim rules apply to section 337 complaints filed on or after the effective date. It was consequently not possible to complete the section 553 rulemaking procedure prior to the effective date of the new legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

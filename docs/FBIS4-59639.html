			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Acceptors and Rejectors of </F> Participation in the Palestinian Autonomous Authority"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A number of PLO  Executive Committee members have refused to take part in the  autonomous authority in Gaza and Jericho while others have  agreed to do so.    According to one Executive Committee member, those who have  so far refused are Faruq Qaddumi, Mahmud 'Abbas, Jawid  al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani, and Sulayman al-Najjab. Yasir 'Amr  has agreed to participate but some others have not made up their  minds yet.    According to the same member, those who have refused object  basically to the substance of the agreement recently signed in  Cairo and the way in which the negotiations with Israel were  conducted.    The Palestinian official said that PLO Executive Committee  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat offered participation in the authority to  all Executive Committee members without exception. All those  contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT were willing to give their views  as to why they refused to participate but they asked to remain  anonymous, with the exception of PLO Executive Committee Member  Sulayman al-Najjab who said: "Yes, as a PLO Executive Committee  member, they offered me participation in the authority and they  also made the same offer to the People's Party to which I  belong. My position is the same as the party's position. It is  neither new nor a surprise to anyone. We told 'Arafat as far  back as Oslo that our participation in the authority should not  be taken for granted because that would depend on the powers of  the authority, which was the subject of negotiation at the time,  and also on the authority's program for tackling the issues that  would be referred to it such as education, health, and so on.  We said at the time that if no agreement was reached on these  powers and on such a program then we would not participate in  the authority, and that is what happened."    Al-Najjab added: "This authority has no powers except in  name. It is more like an executive body linked to the Israeli  military government through coordination and liaison committees  named in the Cairo agreement which covers all aspects of the  activities and powers of that authority and gives the Israelis  an absolute veto. That agreement cannot be developed from within  as some people imagine. The agreement does not recognize any of  the Palestinian people's rights, not even their minimum rights  of controlling their occupied territory and their entitlement to  that territory, as the Israelis object to it being described as  occupied territory."    He also said: "Our main concern is how to defend the  objective of national independence for the Palestinian people  and the cause of the refugees in accordance with the UN  resolutions. Without securing these two objectives, the  Palestinian people will not stop their struggle and there will  be no real stability in the region."    Another Executive Committee member, who wished to remain  anonymous, said: "I support a political settlement based on  Resolutions 242, 338 and the other UN resolutions on the refugee  question. Despite my reservations regarding many flaws in the  Oslo agreement, I accepted it as a mere agreement on principles  that would be translated into detailed agreements open to  modification through negotiations."    He added: "Regrettably, the Cairo agreement and all its  supplements precipitated Palestinian acceptance of the Israeli  security plan and concept and made it possible for the Israeli  side to avoid any reference to Security Council Resolution 242  or commitment to it. That is why I have refused to be a part of  the authority that will implement that agreement."    He added: "Those who like to compare the Cairo agreement  with the Balfour Declaration are actually insulting Palestinian  intelligence. The Balfour Declaration gave the Jews a national  homeland in Palestine. I ask: Where in the Cairo agreement is  there any mention or mere reference to such a promise?"    He pointed out that he did not see in that agreement and its  clear ceiling any room for independent action, and that is why  it would not improve the current tragic situation our people in  the occupied territory are suffering.    A third member told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "It is most  regrettable that what was signed in Cairo was the Israeli draft  submitted during the Taba talks as a way of sounding out the  Palestinian side, with some superficial changes which some saw  as achievements."    Wondering about these achievements, he asked: Is changing  the number of the national authority members from 12, as in the  Israeli draft, to 24, as requested by the Palestinian side,  considered an achievement?    Is changing Palestinian territorial waters opposite Gaza  from  3 nautical miles, as in the Israeli draft, to 6 miles, as  stipulated in the Cairo agreement, an achievement?    He added: The Israeli draft, which we had the right to  reject or add substantial amendments to if we could not submit  our own plan, was the draft that was signed as the Cairo  agreement, with some superficial amendments.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Nigerian policies 'set to fail' Nigeria's new economic policies 'are definitely going to fail', Mr Kim Jaycox, World Bank vice-president for Africa, warned at the weekend. In the most forthright public criticism by a World Bank official since Nigeria's military government revalued the currency, the naira, in last January's budget, Mr Jaycox said: 'There is just no way they are going to succeed, and I think that they have got to be reversed.' He was speaking at a Washington news conference to mark the publication of the bank's report: Adjustment in Africa. 'These are not acceptable ways of managing an economy,' Mr Jaycox said. 'They have already tried this (a fixed exchange rate) in Nigeria many times. It has all come to major failure, and so it surprises us that they would be doing this again.' Nigeria was one of six countries credited in the report with a 'large improvement' in macroeconomic policies between 1987 and 1991. But the impetus that marked the reform programme fell away towards the end of the 1980s and, over the last two years, many of the benefits of reform have been lost. The single greatest blow was the 1994 budget. General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's new military leader, fixed the exchange rate of the naira to the US dollar at nearly twice the market rate. Hopes for the renewal of a lapsed agreement with the International Monetary Fund have been dashed, and rescheduling of Nigeria's external debt is unlikely to take place this year. Arrears on the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.7bn) debt exceed Dollars 6bn.</p>

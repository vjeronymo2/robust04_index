			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Lin Fei (2651 5481): "Horse Influenza </F> Has Again Broken Out and Is Spreading--Agriculture Ministry  Orders All To Quickly Control the Epidemic"]    [Text] Since spring of this year, horse influenza has again  broken out in China and has become epidemic. It is threatening  horse breeding and can be a serious threat to spring plowing.  The animal husbandry and veterinary departments of the Ministry  of Agriculture have issued an urgent circular notice a few days  ago, urging all localities to give serious attention to  preventative action against horse influenza.    Statistics on the epidemic show that during the period from  May 1993 to January 1994, horse influenza has been rampant in  249 counties of 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions throughout China, namely in Inner Mongolia,  Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi,  Hebei, Beijing, and Henan, with 1.37 million horses sick, 19,000  horses dead, and a total direct economic loss of 170 million  yuan. Although some preventive measures have been adopted in  every province, it has not yet been possible to control the  epidemic. Since February of this year, horse influenza has  reappeared in Shanxi, Beijing, Ningxia, and Gansu, and has also  spread to the breeding areas of Qinghai and Sichuan. Within only  one month, 170,000 animals have fallen sick and almost 10,000  have died; it is an extremely serious situation.    Since the founding of the PRC, horse influenza has been  epidemic in China four times, but the present epidemic is the  most serious outbreak since the founding of the PRC, specially  characterized by its widespread occurrence, long duration, high  death rate, and frequent recurrences. To control and wipe out  the present widespread epidemic of horse influenza as quickly as  possible, the Ministry of Agriculture has especially issued an  urgent circular notice, ordering the agriculture and animal  husbandry departments of all ranks to vigorously pursue and  effectively take in hand all relevant preventative work and to  immediately make comprehensive epidemic prevention dispositions.    The agriculture and animal husbandry departments shall pay  particular attention to any occurrence of the disease and its  developmental trend, and regardless of time and place shall make  an immediate report to the next higher animal epidemic  prevention organ. They shall also promptly inform the  neighboring animal epidemic prevention organs to assist in any  preventive measures. The notice orders all localities to  earnestly and effectively store up epidemic prevention material,  to render active support in supplying basic curative and  disinfecting pharmaceutical materials and instruments, so as to  ensure that regular action be taken in preventative work and  that epidemic situations be expediently dealt with. Districts in  which the epidemic has already broken out must be closed off and  isolated as quickly as possible. Entry and exit of all equidae  to and from such districts shall be forbidden, markets for all  equidae shall be closed, and buying and selling of such animals  forbidden.</p>

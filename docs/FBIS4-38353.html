According to well-informed sources, the international group  of experts, after a series of meetings and consultations and the  study of the situation, will prepare a report with due regard  for the Ukrainian Government's wishes.    The report will serve as the basis of a project for  assistance to Kiev. The project is then to be considered at a  working meeting of G-7 representatives in Rome in June.    A specific `nuclear assistance' programme is to be discussed  at a regular G-7 summit in Naples in July.</p>

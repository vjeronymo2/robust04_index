			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: The sex therapist and the shopping trolley WITH QUESTIONS of scandal and privacy echoing around the papers it is worth noting how relative these things are: one nation's political scandal is another nation's bore. In recent weeks Britain, France, and Germany have had to face frightful revelations about their politicians. Italy does not count since politicians there are expected to be frightful, and Italian newspapers could not cope with the various Lamont 'scandals.' The fact that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had inadvertently rented his house to a 'sex therapist' was amusing enough, but the row over his acceptance of a Treasury offer of a mere Pounds 4,000, which did not go into his pocket anyway, was incomprehensible. The subsequent farcical developments, involving the publication of his credit card account and untrue stories relating to purchases of cheap champagne and cigarettes ensured that all foreign interest evaporated. And so to the tedium of the influence-peddling scandals in Germany. The latest concerns the housing minister, Irmgard Schwaetzer, and a property company, Germania. In a contribution to its house magazine the minister seemed to be promoting the firm's interests. Earlier, the economics minister, Jurgen Mollemann, had to resign because he had tried to help out his wife's cousin over the matter of a patent on a supermarket trolley. Because of their sublime banality, these typically German affairs attracted little comment outside the country. The only real horror story in this litany was the French blood contamination affair. This involved hundreds of haemophiliacs who were infected with the AIDS virus through state-run blood transfusions. French scandals have considerable bearing on the current debate in Britain on the role of the press. It is proposed, among other things, that there should be legal limits on invasions of privacy. The editor of the Sunday Times, Andrew Neill, said this would make Britain like France, where, he elegantly argued, 'privacy laws have intimidated newspapers from doing investigative journalism and made them poodles of the political establishment.' Maybe in the blood scandal the press could have acted sooner - but once the story was rolling the media made a substantial contribution. The papers also did some fine work on the blowing up of the Rainbow Warrior by French security agents in New Zealand; the Pechiney share dealing racket would not have emerged but for the work of the French press and Le Monde took on the Socialist Party by helping to expose corruption there. French poodles even bite their friends. Their record compares favourably with the British bulldogs. It was not heroic newspaper reporters who first shed light on the Guinness, BCCI, Maxwell and Matrix-Churchill affairs. In France a restrictive law on privacy, which allows 'public interest' as a defence, combines with a system that makes libel cheap. This combination can help the press, if it is interested in important matters rather than trivia - partly because it discourages libel actions which perforce involve the plaintiff sacrificing the otherwise guaranteed right of privacy. Under the French system, means newspapers are fined if they reveal details of the colours of the football team in which the minister of culture is alleged to make love to his mistress. And they cannot publish pictures of even English duchesses disporting themselves with their financial advisers in a manner that falls short of the chaste standards that characterise the English aristocracy. What they can do is to say that Monsieur Farfelu is a crook and have a fair chance of getting away with it. In Britain the situation is exactly the reverse thanks to the extraordinary strictness of the libel laws which shield the guilty as well as the innocent and various bits of secrecy legislation. That has helped to ensure that the British debate on press freedom has concentrated on the Royal Family for that is the story that is at risk. In the great British theme park, the dream of happy royal marriages was fabricated by the media and the royal press office. So when, as is now the case, they turn out to be in the traditional mould there is a colossal row which can, some say, lead to the destruction of the House of Windsor. Had the press not connived at the new-fangled 'family values' vision of royalty there would not be the trouble we are facing today. The real English tradition is that the monarch and his or her spouse regard each other with indifference or loathing. Queen Victoria notoriously broke with that tradition in her relations with Prince Albert. She was not popular until much later, after Prince Albert had died, which left the Queen 40 clear years to achieve a sacred reputation unencumbered by fantasies of domestic bliss. However, that does not now seem a likely prospect for the Prince of Wales.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Mistrust and angst behind Swiss rejection of EEA Sir, Your editorial on Switzerland's rejection of the European Economic Area ('A shot across the EC's bows,' December 7) rightly states that the larger question at stake is the very future of the Swiss political system. Close analysis of the Swiss discussion on the EEA, particularly in German-speaking Switzerland, further suggests the following: Communication between the political and business elite on the one side and the public on the other broke down completely. As you stated: 'The people trusted their instincts more than their leaders.' Misinformation, largely circulated through privately sponsored advertisements in the local press, dominated the scene. Europe's political class and business leaders have failed to make the (so far diffuse) notion of subsidiarity and supranationality accessible to the public in a time of changing values and ever increasing political and economic transnational interdependence. Swiss rejection of the EEA is principally a rejection of the majority Germany-speaking Switzerland, where discussion had little to do with Europe itself, but was a reflection of a deeply rooted angst of losing one's very specific cultural identity. Swiss rejection of the EEA runs smack into constitutional realities. It raises the question whether Swiss direct democracy is practical at a time when long-term structural decisions have to be taken which simply surpass the comprehensive capabilities of the average masses.

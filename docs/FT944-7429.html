			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Padua bank seeks 81% of Credito Lombardo Banca Antoniana, a Padua-based bank, is negotiating with Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy's oldest bank, to buy an 81 per cent stake in Credito Lombardo, Monte dei Paschi's quoted subsidiary, for about L240bn (Dollars 149m). Credito Lombardo, based in Milan, has only 13 branches, but the acquisition would fit into Antoniana's strategy of extending and strengthening its network of 127 branches across north and north-east Italy. The operation is part of the continuing shake-up in Italian banking, in which Antoniana has played a small role. The Padua bank is one of four small banks from the Veneto region which decided this month to sell their joint 13.52 per cent stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto to other shareholders, in effect blocking a bid for control by Banca Commerciale Italiana. Monte dei Paschi said on Tuesday that the sale of its Credito Lombardo holding should be completed by the end of the year. Antoniana will have to launch a full bid for the outstanding shares on the Italian market at the same price of about L4,400 a share. Trading in Credito Lombardo's shares was suspended on Tuesday morning, having risen 5 per cent on Monday to L3,588. They remained under suspension yesterday.</p>

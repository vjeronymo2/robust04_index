			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Whatman lifts profits 8% to Pounds 4.6m midway WHATMAN, the specialist paper, filtration equipment and gas generator manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits 8 per cent from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds 4.56m in the first half of 1993. There was an underlying growth in sales of 6 per cent, but once a Pounds 1.2m contribution from acquisitions and exchange rate factors are added in, turnover advanced 30 per cent from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 33.7m. The exchange rate in the half was Pounds 1/Dollars 1.51, against Pounds 1/Dollars 1.91 last time. Mr Hugh Perrott, finance director, said that currency movements had little impact on profits, as the forward contracts covering the foreign exchange exposure were taken out before sterling's devaluation. In sales terms, the UK, where they slipped after a strong performance in the corresponding period, accounted for less than 15 per cent; North America spoke for some 60 per cent; continental Europe 15 per cent; and Japan 5 per cent. Net borrowings grew by almost Pounds 4m to Pounds 5.5m over the half, though acquisitions accounted for Pounds 2.5m of that. The interim dividend is raised 6.5 per cent to 3.3p (3.1p), payable from earnings up at 12.91p (12.26p) per share.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand yesterday renewed its call for the  establishment of a reception centre in Laos as a way of speeding  up the repatriation of some 12,000 Laotians.    Praphakon Samiti, director of the Interior Ministry's  Foreign  Affairs Division, made the call before international  participants at a technical meeting convened by the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).    Mr Praphakon said the repatriation of the refugees had  gathered momentum but pointed out that some 9,000 Laotians were  "expected" to remain in Thailand after the planned closure of  Ban Napho camp at the end of this year.    "I do hope that all parties concerned will join to put more  effort into solving the residual caseload," he said.    Questions of repatriation and resettlement are being  discussed at the two-day technical meeting called to seek ways  of clearing camps in first asylum countries of some 80,000  Indochinese by the end of next year when the Comprehensive Plan  of Action (CPA) drawn up in 1989 expires.    The technical discussions have drawn representatives from  Vietnam and Laos as well as first asylum, resettlement and donor  countries -- including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei,  Canada, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, New  Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom, United States and European  Union.    Mr. Praphakon expressed hope that the idea of setting up a  reception centre in Laos would be pursued at a meeting  comprising Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR due to take place later  this month.    The centre will house returnees pending determination of a  permanent resettlement site, he said. Elaborating on the idea  in a separate interview, Mr Praphakon said it would function as  a "halfway house" where skills training could be provided to the  returnees.    The UNHCR's Thailand representative Ruprecht von Arnim said  he was open to the idea. But he emphasised the need to address  the Laotian Government's concerns about employment for the  returnees.    Vientiane will not accept a simple "transfer" of Ban Napho  to  Laos and the UNHCR will find it difficult arriving at an  arrangement which might become an "open-ended commitment", he  said.    Mr Praphakon said Thailand would complete the process of  status determination of Vietnamese encamped in the country by  June 24.    He said some 6,000 Vietnamese were expected to sign up for  voluntary repatriation by the end of this month.    But he pointed to some 3,000 hard core cases which would be  more difficult to deal with, and called for a stepped-up  campaign to encourage them to volunteer for repatriation.    He also urged resettlement countries to live up to their  pledges and drew attention to the estimated 250 Vietnamese  encamped at Sikhiu who have been "screened-in" as bona fide  refugees but rejected.</p>

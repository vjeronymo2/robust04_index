			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Russia blocking oil, say Kazakhs Kazakhstan accused Russia yesterday of cutting off most of the republic's oil exports, all but paralysing its most lucrative industry. Kazakhstan's leaders have recently been subjected to strong political and economic pressure from Russia, which has demanded an equity share in Kazakhstan's giant Karachaganak natural gas field and is also said to be seeking a stake in the rich Tengiz oilfield in western Kazakhstan. The country exports some 17m tonnes of oil a year, of which around 6m tonnes go to countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States. The two export pipelines to the Black Sea both cross Russian territory and are under Russia's control. Any cut-off could be part of the pressure by which Moscow has been gradually choking off Kazakhstan's natural gas and oil flow. Mr Ravil Shardabayev, Kazakhstan's oil minister, said in a telephone interview that Russia had severed the republic's oil exports although Chevron of the US, which possesses rights to develop the Tengiz oilfield, 'is continuing to export its oil in a limited amount'. Russia's energy ministry in Moscow yesterday would not confirm Kazakh claims that the flow of oil through the larger of the two pipelines had been halted, but Russia has long complained that it could export more of its own oil through the pipelines if they were not carrying the products of others. In an interview published this month in the Petroleum Argus newsletter, Mr Yuri Shafrannik, Russian energy minister, said Russia was losing Dollars 300m a year by transporting oil from Kazakhstan and other central Asian and Caucasian republics. He added: 'There are joint ventures on the territory of Russia with western partners which have surrendered the right to transport oil because we are acting for Kazakhstan's western partners.' Mr Shardabayev said yesterday that Russia had begun cutting supplies at the beginning of last month. Mr Bulat Yeleymanov, director of Kazakhstan's state oil company, told the local newspaper Panorama: 'There is oil, but no possibility to sell it.' The republic's own internal refinery system has ground to a halt. Recent actions by Moscow have brought into question the ability of western energy companies to negotiate legitimate contracts with the Caspian Sea region's republics, particularly Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Moscow this year issued a diplomatic letter to Britain in which it demanded veto rights over any resource development project on the Caspian, claiming that without its approval any deal was illegal. The demand appeared to jeopardise western oil deals both in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (19): Fierce competition for big market - Tangles arise in dispute over car quotas POLAND'S mini dispute over car quotas with the European Community is an example of the tangles that arise when people say one thing and then demand to be allowed to do another. In this case it is the western multinationals' lack of commitment to free trade that seems to have given rise to the problem. Last year, just as Poland was negotiating its Association Agreement with the EC aiming at a gradual dismantling of trade barriers in industrial goods, General Motors Europe, which was negotiating a joint venture with Warsaw's FSO car plant, was asking the Poles for high customs tariffs as a condition of going ahead with their investment. As the Poles need both sides, they persuaded Brussels to accept the 35 per cent tariff on imported cars which would gradually be removed till the year 2002 but accepted Brussels's suggestion that 30,000 cars a year would be permitted to come in duty free from the EC. That seemed to satisfy GM Europe who are on the verge of agreeing to install an Astra assembly line at FSO and are promising further investment in years to come. But it left the thorny problem of how to divide the 30,000 quota among European car manufacturers, many of whom spent most of last year preparing to invade a buoyant Polish market which imported more than 300,000 mainly used cars last year. Finally, the Poles decided to treat the quotas as an added investment incentive. Thus, those who invested at least Dollars 50m in Poland would get their fair share. That, for the moment, narrows the list of beneficiaries to three - GM Europe who are looking at FSO, Fiat Auto of Italy who are negotiating a joint venture with the FSM plant in southern Poland, and Volkswagen who are talking seriously of assembling the Toyota pick-up truck they now make in Hanover in Poznan. Each, the Polish trade ministry announced, would be able to import 10,000 vehicles duty-free, a concession which could be worth up to Dollars 25m each a year. The decision, though, hit the French manufacturers, with Renault, for example, protesting that it had invested Dollars 50m in its sales network in Poland, and they got their government to have the car part of the Association agreement which came into force on March 1 suspended. They also asked Brussels to talk to the Poles about redesigning the way the quota is divided. That may take some time and the first meeting in Warsaw was held almost in secret. Meanwhile, Peugeot has gone ahead and signed an agreement with the FSC truck factory in Lublin for assembly of their 405 model beginning in mid-1993. They expect to assemble 2,000 a year initially, rising to 10,000 in the fourth year. Kits, it may be added, come in duty-free in any case.</p>

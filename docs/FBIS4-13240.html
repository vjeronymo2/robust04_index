			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "King Husayn Announces Ban on </F> Hamas Activities"]    [Excerpts] Amman -- King Husayn of Jordan yesterday  announced a ban on the activities of the Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) in Jordan and emphasized that his country did  not recognize or deal with any Palestinian organization other  than the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people. King Husayn, speaking at a press conference  he held after chairing a cabinet meeting which discussed the  Israeli threats to the Kingdom and the charge that Jordan  supports Hamas, said that any Palestinian organization other  than the PLO would be treated as "unlawful." [passage omitted]    Responsible government sources have told AL-HAYAH that the  government "had decided to close Hamas' offices in Amman" and  ban its informational activities before Rabin made his threats.    The sources pointed out that the government considered that  step "an internal matter in harmony with Jordan's policy which  sees the PLO as the only party empowered to speak for the  Palestinian people."    They stressed that the official authorities "have not and  will not take any measures" against Hamas representative in  Jordan Muhammad Nazzal or its official spokesman Ibrahim  Ghawshah, "because the two are Jordanian citizens who abide by  the country's current Constitution and laws." The same sources  pointed out that "despite Jordan's affirmation that neither  Nazzal nor Ghawshah had anything to do with the planning and  execution of military operations in the occupied territory, we  will allow no one to exploit their statements in the media to  undermine Jordan."

The Prime Minister said how sorry he too was to learn of the  accident.    The two leaders agreed on the importance of the work which  the coalition team had been carrying out in the area on behalf  of the Kurdish people.    They also both expressed their sorrow that people devoting  themselves to this work had lost their lives in this way, and  their deep sympathy with the families of all those on the  helicopters.</p>

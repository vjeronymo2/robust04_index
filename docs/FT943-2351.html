			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Number of new students may fall The number of students enrolling at UK universities this year is likely to fall slightly compared with last year - after more than a decade of continuous expansion - according to the Universities Central Admissions System, John Authers writes. Today is the deadline for new applicants to the clearing system. About 265,000 people have accepted places compared with the target of 270,000, achieved last year. But the number of 18-year-olds has fallen by 4 per cent so acceptances have risen as a proportion of the age group. So far 33,600 have been accepted through the clearing system for those who did not satisfy offers conditional on gaining specific grades in A-level exams, compared with 35,600 at the same point last year. Admissions officers report a dramatic slackening of interest, particularly in science and modern languages. Mr Tony Higgins, Ucas chief executive, said these figures might overstate the shortfall, as they took no account of people who 'literally come in off the street and apply direct to one university'. This practice is particularly common at London's former polytechnics. He attributed the slight fall in demand to the economic recovery, which had cut the number of mature students.</p>

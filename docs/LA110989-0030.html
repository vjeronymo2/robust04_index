			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEUERLEIN LISTED AS QUESTIONABLE  </P> <P> Raider quarterback Steve Beuerlein practiced lightly Wednesday. The team is  listing him as questionable for Sunday night's game in San Diego and holding  out hope he'll be ready.  </P> <P> "I'd be lying if I said it's 100%, but I've got a shot," Beuerlein said.  </P> <P> It's still considered a longshot. Beuerlein tore a ligament in his right knee  11 days ago. Jay Schroeder, now the backup, was the quarterback in last week's  victory over the Bengals and will start against the Chargers if Beuerlein  can't. MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

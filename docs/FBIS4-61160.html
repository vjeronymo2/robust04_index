			<p>BFN     [Text] The newspaper "DIENA" reports that the Latvian  Foreign Minister, Georgs Andrejevs, giving a telephone interview  denied the charge with collaboration with KGB and said he is not  going to resign if the government does not demand it. To his  mind the drive launched against him and the other four deputies  of the Saeima [parliament] iconvemint [as received] to some  political forces interested in the breakdown of signing the  agreements with Russia, in a complete split of the ruling  coalition and destabilization in the government. He reiterated  that his main speciality is an anesthesiologist and as a chief  expert in this branch he had to regularly provide accounts of  what was going on at the conferences abroad to the Health Care  Ministry. He assumed that the so-called first department of the  ministry possibly passed his accounts to KGB and denied the  reports of his resignation which have appeared in the press.  Andrejevs said that before leaving for his vacation he had  handed over a confidential letter to the Prime Minister where he  expressed his personal views on the possibility to stabilize the  internal political situation and on the activities of the  government linked to the signing of the agreements, and  mentioned the change of the foreign minister as an absolutely  theoretical possibility.</p>

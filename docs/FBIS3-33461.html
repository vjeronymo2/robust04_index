			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alvin Alaniz Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Based on Article 25 of Law 28, the Statute on the  Autonomy of the Atlantic Coast Regions of Nicaragua, a law still  unregulated, the Atlantic Coast received a green light for  embarking upon the 42-day-long election campaign with the  presence of the eminent magistrates of the Supreme Election  Council, headed by its chairman, Dr. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren.    During the opening ceremony that began after 1500, a little  over an hour later than scheduled and even so not graced by the  sacred words of our national anthem, Dr. Fiallos Oyanguren  summoned the 14 political groupings that will participate in the  election jousts ending on 27 February of this year to conduct a  high-minded campaign free of the violence that he said would  only usher in death.    However, what can we coastal dwellers expect of this  election  campaign that is now officially under way?    Speaking for myself, I believe a great deal. Enjoying the  right to exercise suffrage, we shall be able to elect those who  for four years will sit in our regional legislative body, the  Autonomous Regional Council.    Nor is that all. The wide diversity of candidates among whom  the coastal people may choose will enable them to determine for  whom they should vote.    It is not simply a matter of candidates, but also of the  parties that back or represent them. That is why it is necessary  to express opinions about some of them so as to provide another  perspective.    The people, particularly along the Atlantic Coast, need to  be  told very little about the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN). They need only to be reminded of the years during which  it was in power, of the barbarities committed against our  people, the suffering of the mothers, the hunger, death, and  despair. Furthermore, its candidates include members of the  fortunately now defunct Ministry of Interior.    The Central American Unionist Party (PUCA), a party with  minimum strength in the region and which in the 1990 elections  received all of 120 votes. Throughout these years, its presence  on the Coast has been little or nil.    The Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN), a party that tries to  sell the idea that it is the representative of the working  class. However, what can we expect of a party whose top leader,  Dr. Gustavo Tablada, betrayed the Nicaraguan people by forming  the sadly famous "Center" group and, in a vile alliance with the  Sandinists, assumed the presidency of the National Assembly?    In the case of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC),  one  cannot speak of betrayal, for it has been a force that has  opposed the current co-government on the national level.  However, since this contest is merely regional, one must note  that its "leaders" are not even from the Coast, nor do they  enjoy the sympathy of the voters.    The Nicaraguan Christian Social Party (PSC) is in truth a  party that is not representative and that enjoys no popular  support.    The Nicaraguan Democratic Party (PADENIC) presents itself to  the people with some new faces and others that belonged to other  parties. It attacks the administrative corruption that  unfortunately besets certain government agencies, but without  presenting any real alternatives to the problems of the Coast.    The Democratic Action Movement (MAD) is known in Bluefields  as the Group of the 20 because that was the approximate number  of persons who greeted its top leader when he visited our port  city.    It could once have been said of the Nicaraguan Resistance  Party (PRN) that it had the support of a large sector of the  population, but when it incorporated into its ranks individuals  who had held public posts, it did not do so in the proper manner  and has thus lost support and strength.    Let Us Save the Atlantic Coast (DEX) is a movement that  wants  to save the Coast, but is running candidates in only one of the  15 districts.    The people view the Authentic, Autonomous Coastal Movement  (MAAC) as a movement having close ties with the Sandinists and  are therefore reluctant to give it their trust.    Yatama is a party that lost its identity from the moment it  made a pact with the Sandinists, a party in which one cannot  have confidence because it generated a lack of stability in the  region.    The Coastal Democratic Alliance (ADECO) is the work of the  governor and deputy from the "Center" group, Dr. Alvin Guthrie  Rivers, who with four years in the regional government is  running in order to solve the problems of the Atlantic Coast. It  is not very difficult to find persons among its members who are  highly unpopular with the people.    The Conservative Popular Alliance (APC) is a party which on  the national level turned its back on the people and has become  involved in the activities of the illegal National Assembly.    The National Opposition Union (UNO), after serious research  and consultations with the people and based on the real problems  and needs of the people, presents new faces, persons with proven  honesty, capabilities, and a firm willingness to make progress  in our region. It is doing its utmost to achieve full  application of Law 28.    It should be stated that, just as it has demonstrated on the  national level, the UNO [National Opposition Union] has not been  able to govern in our region either. On the contrary, government  has been in the hands of persons who have taken advantage of the  administration of public service to get rich illicitly, so that  the UNO is now seeking to take over the government and restore  the people's confidence.    It is the voters who will have the last word and who, in the  secrecy of the voting booths and advised only by their  conscience, will know how to make their votes count.</p>

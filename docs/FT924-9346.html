			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (9): Irish mice still smile - Electronics remain healthy 1992 HAS not been a good year for the electronics industry in Ireland - until recently the great white hope of the country's industrial development authority. Ireland's computer industry flashed into life in the 1960s. It meant very little in terms of jobs and exports until the 1980s; even in 1970 it generated only 6 per cent of Irish industrial exports. And then, from 7 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s, computer goods made up 25 per cent of exports by 1991, and software accounted for 7 per cent - out of nowhere a mere decade earlier. The proud (if esoteric) boast was that Ireland was responsible for 90 per cent of the mice in Europe. Electronics generally had been following the same trend. By last year there were 300 companies set up in Ireland, employing over 28,000 people, exporting goods worth IPounds 4bn. So far hundreds of jobs have been lost at the plants of foreign multinationals, which had been identified as great providers of jobs, service jobs and export dollars. The first bad news came in May, when Apple Computer indicated that 400 jobs would go at its European headquarters in Cork. Fortunately for the workforce, Apple later modified its decision, and no jobs have gone yet. But the company had been looking in the direction of the far east (anathema to the Irish government and trade unions) where it plans to centralise its printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture. Also in May, BG Turnkey, a supplier to computer manufacturers, laid off 30 staff. In July Digital announced that it wanted 100 voluntary redundancies from its Galway plant (a Digital operation at Clonmel closed in May 1991), and if these were not forthcoming it would have to impose redundancy. Then came August, a wicked month indeed. Pulse, an American electronics firm, sacked 125; then Wang announced that 100 jobs would have to go at its Dollars 75m plant in Limerick. The other big job losses announced in August were also at American companies; the US has the highest foreign representation in Ireland, with about 350 plants or offices out of 1,000. The Wang announcement had the biggest impact, partly because it came in the same week as publication of another 500 redundancies effective at foreign multinationals operations concentrated in the west of Ireland. The bad news gave ammunition to those who had criticised the government and the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) for heavy reliance on foreign companies to create jobs and capital by setting up operations in Ireland. Mr Pat Rabbitte, spokesman on commerce and industry for the vocal minority party, the Democratic Left, says: 'The experience with Wang illustrates all the problems associated with relying so heavily on multinationals for job creation. The excellent record of Wang's Irish operation was not enough to save them.' This is the rub: having one's destiny controlled from afar. In the Irish context this is especially irritating; it is at once a fact of history and of the economic present. But it is not time to lower the curtain on this contemporary success story for Irish industry. The IDA says it has no plans for a U-turn away from its strategy of chasing electronics companies with generous financial inducements and the lure of a skilled English-speaking workforce. And there have also been a number of positive events in 1992. Wang is a typical case from the computer sector. It came in 1980 when times were good, speaking of a possible 1,500 jobs in the Limerick plant. But the actual figure never exceeded 700, although the people of Limerick were delighted with the contribution the company made to the area. In recent years turnover hovered around the IPounds 300m. But the Wang dream turned sour. US head office said that the total workforce, 12,000 internationally, would have to shrink to 5,000. The world recession was taking its toll, and the advantages of cheaper manufacture in the Far East could not be ignored by hard-pressed computer companies. Additions to the sector, such as a new plant in Coolock, Co Dublin, to be built by US firm Seagate Technologies, and a takeover of the Nixdorf plant in Wicklow by Maxtor, are in doubt; both companies have suspended decisions. (Together, these ventures would have created over 2,500 jobs  - jobs sorely needed in the context of 21 per cent unemployment nationally.) But companies like Motorola and Intel are still filing good results. Dell, another American computer company based in Limerick, reported a 129 per cent increase in sales during the quarter ended August 1992 - and net income up 77 per cent. The list of electronics companies attracted by lreland's generous provisions for foreign investors is long and star-studded: NEC, Amdahl, Microsoft, Siemens, Phillips Ericcson, Claris. Not all of them are in bad straits, although in the middle of a severe international recession there is not much reckless spending. Lay-offs must be seen in the context of the world recession, says Martin Cronin, manager of the electronics division at the IDA. 'Workers have been laid off in the UK and the US. Compared with the worldwide situation, Ireland is still in a strong position. And the response of the electronic industry worldwide would be similar to Ireland's. It's a technology that is evolving very rapidly, and new products will come in bursts.' The National Microelectronics Centre at the Plassey Technology park is engaged in doing 'cutting-edge' research, and the nearby making the graduates with skills the electronics companies need. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, acknowledged the changing scene last month: 'While previously we had been able to rely on an attractive package of fiscal incentives . . this is increasingly being matched by our competitors in other countries. It is therefore essential that Ireland should develop additional sources of advantage.'</p>

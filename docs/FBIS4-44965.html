			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jawad al-Ha'iri, an Iraqi writer living in </F> Britain: "Exiled Opposition and Exiled Peoples"]    [Text] The Iraqi opposition is one of a number of other  Arab and Middle Eastern opposition movements that have in recent  years emigrated en masse from their homelands to exile. This has  occurred within the framework of an unfamiliar experience.  Within this experience, opposition members leave their countries  in numbers amounting to millions to use countries in the  diaspora as new working arenas for their political activity in  an endeavor to perpetuate the bridges of communication with  their peoples inside the homeland and to mobilize these peoples  in the direction of the goals that these opposition movements  seek. An exception is the Turkish condition and the early  Kurdish mass emigration resulting from the national fusion  policy embraced by the new state in the wake of the fall of the  Ottoman caliphate.    Mass emigration to flee the homeland under the pressure of  various factors is something that was experienced by the people  of East Europe during the Stalinist era prior to and after World  War II. Despite the curtain lowered around those countries, they  witnessed numerous mass escape attempts throughout nearly  one-half century. Border stations surrounding those countries  saw a flood of refugees who, with the passage of time, came to  form ethnic minorities exceeding hundreds of thousands in their  new homelands.    Prior to the sixth and seventh decades [of the 1900s], the  Middle East did not see the rise of totalitarian regimes similar  to the regimes seen now. This does not mean that the area's  countries have not tried their luck with certain despotic  regimes. Rather, these countries have perhaps abounded with  examples of military and non-military individualistic and  despotic regimes. But more often than not, they were  temperamental and superficial regimes.    Opposition to those regimes emerged and was often conducted  peacefully, despite the persecution and oppression that  accompanied that opposition. But that persecution and oppression  were within the bounds of the bearable and one could withstand  them. This is why opposition movements and their supporters, and  even ordinary citizens, did not consider emigration to the  outside world. Many of those movements were known for their  attachment to their homelands and for not having a prior history  of emigration and expatriation, excluding some individual cases  of banishment, which was used as a maximum punishment against  some active opposition elements who were deported from their  countries. Many are the stories about the handfuls of soil that  those deportees took with them as a reminder keeping them  company in their exile.    But at a time when most of the world's political regimes  moved in the direction of openness, of spreading a democratic  climate, and of respect for man's freedom and rights, the  tendencies toward totalitarian rule have grown stronger in the  past two decades in the Middle East region and the Arab  homeland. It is as if these two regions want to establish  themselves as the alternative to the failed [totalitarian]  experience in East Europe. This is why contentment with power  from above is no longer the distinguishing mark of these  regimes' activity. Rather, some of these regimes have turned  into brutally suppressive regimes that are not reluctant to  embrace the scorched land policy at the first confrontation with  their peoples.    Since 1968 and under the shadow of this tendency and of the  death machine that has been hysterically devouring any citizen  who stands in its way, Iraq's politicized and unpoliticized  citizens have been compelled to wage a bloody and rarely-matched  struggle in the region in an attempt to confront the barbaric  tide coming from within. They have made thousands of sacrifices.  But with every sacrifice made, the regime's lust for predation  grew stronger and stronger. In the face of this unbearable  pressure, a way had to be found to deal with this regime. Thus,  mass emigration and escape, plus the coercive expulsions  practiced by the regime itself, became some sort of self-defense  against total and inevitable annihilation. For nearly 20 years,  new numbers have been added daily to an emigration that the  Iraqis have not wanted and that they have never before  experienced in their lives.    The Iraqi people have been divided into those who are exiled  inside their homeland and those exiled outside it, shedding hot  tears for kinsmen who have survived. From exile, the crowds are  trying to organize themselves within political frameworks, some  of which are an extension of what has existed at home, and to  coordinate joint efforts with the movement at home in order to  besiege and shatter the regime. But a positive circumstance has  developed in the Iraqi opposition's political and field reality  through the deliverance of that part of the homeland that has  been liberated from the regime's control. This part has turned  into a base that embraces the opposition movement's new  political framework, which bears the name of the Iraqi National  Congress [INC] and which includes influential Arab and Kurdish  organizations and cadres. Thus, the beginning of the process of  a counter political emigration to this part of the homeland has  been created. With the new experiment gaining more strength day  after day despite all obstacles placed in its way, the  justifications for continued dealing with opposition action from  abroad are weakening day after day and may reach the point where  all excuses cited for staying away from home will be poor  excuses lacking all objective foundations. However, there is no  harm in reviewing some perils, which some forces cite to justify  this position [of staying away from the liberated Kurdistan]:    First, the incompatibility of these forces' positions with  the INC program and plan and, consequently, these forces'  development of a different political position that reaches the  point of condemnation at times. Assuming that this faction's  position is sound, this should not be a reason for these forces  to refrain from going to a part of the homeland that is not  under the regime's control. If they believe that there are  foreign forces that have a role in creating this reality, then  do they prefer that this reality melt away and that,  consequently, the province return to the regime's control? Or is  it better to move to this base and to try to contribute to  correcting any correctable negative tendencies and pitfalls?    Second, some influential figures justify the presence of  this  vast number of leaders and cadres outside the homeland by saying  that they have inside the homeland enough leaders and cadres to  meet the needs of the action according to the circumstances of  the phase. It is very difficult to prove the soundness of these  statements for a very simple reason, namely that the indicator  of qualitative movement against the regime was at its peak at  the end of the Iraq-Iran war. This shows that numerous factions  preferred at the time to cling to the land, to seek its  protection, and to face dangers rather than emigrate to move  beyond the regime's reach. Thus, we have seen the emergence of a  strange condition in the struggle against the regime. When the  regime was strong and supported by several regional and  international forces, resistance by these factions was stiffer  and more effective. The numerous qualitative and distinctive  operations that were staged in Baghdad and its suburbs at the  time are an indication that it was possible to penetrate the  regime's red lines, despite this regime's brutality and  strength. But for the past three years, and excluding the major  uprising of March 1991--an uprising which nobody may claim as  his own--we have seen clearly how this kind of operation has  diminished and how it has retreated deep into the marshlands and  to the surrounding areas in the south. The qualitative  operations have turned into hit-and-run operations to which the  regime has become accustomed. These operations pose no strategic  threat to this regime, considering that they have turned into  intermittent and disorganized diversionary operations lacking a  unified command and a precise strategic goal. However, this fact  does not negate the unique spirit of heroism displayed by those  unknown fighters in the south's marshlands and cities.    Third, there is a fact whose revelation will change nothing  about it, namely that the regime prefers, perhaps even  encourages, the presence and continuation of some sort of  limited and calculated resistance in the southern and  southeastern sectors of Iraq, i.e., those sectors whose  extensions spill into Iran in some cases. The regime's objective  is to continue to disseminate the allegations it has been  making, and it continues to make, namely that the  post-revolution Iran is responsible for nurturing and fanning  the fires of this condition.    I have cited these justifications regarding the reservations  expressed on operating from the liberated areas of the Iraqi  Kurdistan so as to get to the common problems that the  opposition movement in exile generally encounters and which can  be summed as follows:    1. In today's word, talk about total independence, whether  political or economic, and at times even cultural, has become a  figment of the imagination. If regimes themselves cannot  establish for themselves in today's word an independent entity  in the true, not the propaganda, sense of the word, then it  behooves political opposition movements not to envision  themselves in a position that allows them complete freedom of  movement and decisionmaking. The Iraqi opposition, which is  pressured and besieged, is certainly compelled to soften its  political rhetoric and vision in a way that befits this or that  regional or international party, depending on the intellectual,  operational, and geographic background from which the  organization concerned proceeds.    This dilemma from which the Iraqi opposition suffers is  nothing new. A party seeking asylum is always supposed to  observe the rules of asylum. However, the problem arises when  the objectives of the regional or international power clash with  the legitimate national aspirations of this or that opposition  faction. This problem influences the momentum and efficiency of  the joint and unified action of the entire movement negatively.  But when the possibilities of action from a liberated part of  the homeland materialize, action under the umbrella of this or  that foreign party is not so much a must as it is insistence on  tying affairs in a way that serves the interests of those  foreign parties.    2. What has become known about opposition from exile is that  leaders well known to the masses assume leadership of this  opposition's struggle and direct it according to the given facts  of the domestic situation because it is impossible for such  leaders to perform this role from inside the homeland. Because  of the black fascist situation prevailing in Iraq, those who  lead the political and organizational action are not the only  ones who have emigrated. Rather, they have been accompanied by  an immense mass exodus. The problem is that many of the  emigrants have been turned by their new circumstances and by the  activities of the parties and movements surrounding them into  politicized cadres that burden the leaderships and block their  path to deliberate, calm, and responsible consideration. This  condition has forced many of these leaders into confused and  hesitant positions whose aim is to please and appease these  cadres. Consequently, political action in exile has largely  turned into confused and distorted action.    3. The more positive and important aspect in the exiled  opposition's movements and activities is the role they play to  expose the regime and show its ugly face through information  confirmed with figures and facts received from home. This aspect  is then embodied in the political moves they make to reap the  fruits of the impact of this information on the positions of the  world's various governments and peoples toward the struggle.  This is why a unified rhetoric in the external propaganda is  necessary, even a must. But because of the political positions  of some opposition elements abroad, this propaganda rhetoric has  become pale and contradictory, and it has begun to undermine the  results sought from it.    4. Despite the displays put up by some of those who are  abroad, the opposition in exile continues to be a ghost  opposition in which the serious mixes with the farcical, the  true with the false, thus making it easy for the enemy to  infiltrate it and, at times, to change its direction in ways  that serve his purposes. Opposition at home is the sincere,  serious, and real opposition.    5. Prolonged years in exile often transform opposition  gradually into a state of addiction. Consequently, affairs are  tackled with chatter, oneupmanship, and competition for social  status. The longer the regime survives, the more duped some  opposition elements become. Such a condition constitutes a  negative phenomenon for Iraq's future, because the phase that  will follow the regime's fall needs a positive modern mentality.    6. An opposition in exile that is aware of its  responsibility  is an opposition capable of establishing definite and organized  daily operational contact with its people at home, constantly  supplying them with all the requirements of military resistance,  both mobilizational and financial. This opposition is never  contented with the strategy of selling words.    The experience of the March 1991 uprising proved the  complete  opposite of the above. All sectors at home moved forth. But the  distance between them and the leaders in exile was very great  and the latter could not catch up with the uprising in order to  perform the role they had drafted.    Finally, if the opposition in exile enjoys its stay, and if  it stays where it is for a lengthy time, it turns into a  desperate opposition. Fascist regimes do not care if all their  adversaries emigrate, as long as they remain safe from these  adversaries. These regimes do not care what names these  organizations give themselves.    Totalitarian regimes have contributed to creating  opposition-in-exile movements and, consequently, peoples in  exile. The process of devoiding homelands can be stopped only if  democracy and respect for the citizen are followed as a path to  achieve political and social justice.</p>

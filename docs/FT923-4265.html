			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Dream teams in the fall classic: George Bush and Bill Clinton have fielded a mix of seasoned veterans and hungry newcomers as advisers As life sometimes imitates art, so politics can imitate baseball. Thus it must be recorded that last Monday, Jose Canseco, the heavy hitter of the Oakland Athletics, was summarily traded to the Texas Rangers for a less renowned slugger and a pair of pitchers. Three days earlier David Cone, the New York Mets' star, was abruptly shipped to the Toronto Blue Jays for two players of whom only their parents had ever heard. And Jeff Reardon, who has saved more games than any other pitcher, was moved from the Boston Red Sox to the Atlanta Braves. American politics, too, has seen a transfer of serious proportions - with big Jim Baker, the slugging secretary of state, and the rest of his departmental infield going to the team of George Bush, the former Yale first baseman, who promptly sent Sam Skinner, Clayton Yeutter and a host of others to minor league oblivion. The new Bush line-up was ready for action in time for the traditional opening of the 'real' election season, which begins after Labor Day (yesterday), two months before the country finally votes. But perhaps it took the field a little late. Although the latest opinion polls vary widely, all show Clinton holding on to his lead - 46 per cent against 40 per cent for Bush in a Time magazine survey and 49 per cent versus 40 per cent in a new NBC poll. The Baker deal was long-rumoured. But politics, like baseball, can also suddenly propel to prominence those known only to the true fan. James Carville, George Stephanopoulos, Mickey Kantor, Betsey Wright, Mandy Grunwald are not exactly household names. Neither are Rich Bond, Mary Matalin, Bob Teeter and Charlie Black. However, if Bill Clinton becomes the next president, a lot of credit will go to the first five, and a few more besides, and if Bush wins another term he will owe much to the second four, while reserving the best champagne for Mr Baker. Good teams can make a difference in elections, though they are not infallible in their judgments, as two seasoned professionals, Ed Rollins and Hamilton Jordan, found when they cast their lots with Ross Perot. And they cannot always pull off the same trick twice, as Mr Jordan and the Carter team discovered in 1980. Still, until Mr Baker moved over, there was no question that the hungrier Clinton team, toughened by a bitter primary season, was running circles around Mr Bush's stodgy lot, which sent him on disastrous road trips to Tokyo, Panama and Munich. As Mr Clinton's lead over the president assumed serious proportions, some began to be viewed not merely as campaign operatives but as leading lights in the next Democratic administration. This is more than premature and may be misleading. In 1976, Jimmy Carter reached out beyond the tight Georgian ship that had helped him win the presidency when filling senior foreign and economic policy positions in his administration. The Clinton campaign, still based in Little Rock, is less stuffed with Arkansas razorbacks than Mr Carter's was with Georgia bulldogs, but it, too, will get its share of the plum slots in the White House apparatus. There also remains a residue of a Democratic government-in-waiting qualified to serve and, after 20 of the past 24 years in the wilderness, rallying behind the Clinton cause. His inner circle, together for most of the year, seems tightly knit but is subject to innumerable sub-divisions. It has its pure political gunslingers, such as James Carville - the 'ragin' Cajun' who was architect of Harris Wofford's upset victory in last year's Pennsylvanian Senate by-election. Another is the deceptively youthful George Stephanopoulos, on the Dukakis communications staff four years ago and now, in practice, the chief Clinton spokesman. The Clinton camp also has its professional experts (Mandy Grunwald, the hard-nosed media consultant who persuaded Mr Clinton to play his saxophone on late-night television); old hands from the Arkansas state house (Betsey Wright, brought back to handle the 'bimbo' factor and now doing much more); and veteran Democratic consultants (Mickey Kantor, who has advised everyone from George McGovern to Walter Mondale, including, in 1976, Jerry Brown). The party itself has a national chairman, Ron Brown, with a feline diplomatic touch and considerable organisational skills. The great characteristic of this inner circle so far has been its quick reactions. Mr Carville considers passivity a crime, while Mr Stephanopoulos learned to his cost what sitting back did to the Dukakis campaign. It has done its homework on the Bush record and every charge gets a counter-attack. A televised exchange of views last week on economic policy between Mr Stephanopoulos and Charles Black showed both camps at their best, with both drawing on statistics published only hours before. Clinton's team has also been careful not to impinge on Mr Bush's prerogatives as president, especially in foreign affairs. But this artful deference is currently being severely tested by the president's ability to hog the domestic headlines and dispense largesse, in an ostensibly non-partisan manner, in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. The Clinton team also has its Bill and Hillary factions. In the first are those who, along with Mr Clinton himself, are mostly interested in how government can solve practical problems; in the second are those who, along with the candidate's wife, are more interested - to paraphrase Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff - in testing the outer envelope of ideas. A measure of tension between the two camps has been detectable. Mr Clinton has his academic networks, some input from the media, plus a sizeable leavening from the conspicuously moderate Democratic Leadership Council. Many of Mrs Clinton's friends, such as Mr Kantor and Susan Thomases, nominally her scheduling director, are from those areas of social reform for which Hillary has long been an advocate. At the next remove from the inner circle are the policy advisers whose roles have grown as Mr Clinton has become a national candidate. Here the names are more recognisable, especially in the areas of foreign and economic policy. Tony Lake (one of the first outsiders to join the effort) and Richard Holbrooke, both ex-Carter state department, Michael Mandelbaum and Peter Tarnoff from the Council on Foreign Relations, and Warren Christopher, deputy to Carter's secretary of state Cyrus Vance (now UN special envoy to the former Yugoslavia), stand out in the foreign policy area. For what it is worth, the popular betting is that either Mr Christopher or Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, will end up as secretary of state, with Mr Lake a likely national security adviser. The economic policy group has some heavy hitters, though none seems particularly close to the candidate. They include investment bankers such as Robert Altman, Felix Rohatyn, and Bob Rubin and Bob Hormats of Goldman Sachs, Peter Peterson, commerce secretary in the Nixon administration, as well as academics and authors such as Robert Reich and Lawrence Summers from Harvard and Rudiger Dornbusch from MIT. One of them may emerge as secretary of the Treasury or eventually as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Perhaps more interesting are the ideas emanating from the likes of Rob Shapiro and Elaine Sciulla Kamarck of the Progressive Policy Institute, research arm of the Democratic Leadership Council, and Ira Magaziner, a Rhode Island business consultant with some blue-chip clients. Their practical and eclectic arguments on the development of human capital in the economy seem particularly close to Mr Clinton's own philosophies. At a further remove, and bringing more specific expertise, are Tim Wirth, the retiring senator from Colorado and authority on the environment, Senator Sam Nunn and Congressman Les Aspin, both candidates for defence secretary in a Clinton administration, Jim Jones, the former congressman and now chairman of the American Stock Exchange, and another congressman, Dave McCurdy from Oklahoma, with an expertise on international security issues. Bush's team gets shorter shrift because Mr Baker's assumption of control reduces the scope of many of its previous leaders. Indeed, until he came over, it was not always easy to work out who was running the campaign. This was in sharp contrast to 1988, when Mr Baker fitted in seamlessly with the late Lee Atwater, the political director who played it rougher than anyone. That partnership worked because Mr Baker was the strategist and Mr Atwater the executor with a musician's feel for what the country wanted to hear. It is not easy to see who will be this year's necessary eyes and ears of Mr Bush and Mr Baker, both patricians to their marrow. Bob Teeter is an eminent pollster and, together with Charles Black, he brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the campaign, but both are more intimates of the president than of the man in the street. Atwater acolytes, such as Mary Matalin, the abrasive political director, and Torie Clarke, the campaign's witty spokeswoman, do not have his clout, though they may be just as hard to muzzle. It is a fair bet that less will be heard in the coming months from Rich Bond, Ron Brown's opposite number. Mr Bond took over the Republican party chairmanship after working for Congressman Bill Green of New York, the quintessential moderate Republican, which sometimes made his fervent support of the conservative agenda look a little odd. But at least he can claim he made the convention run roughly on the right time. Vice-president Dan Quayle will be equally confined to partisan corridors, inveighing only against Hollywood liberals, the media and other targets of the right. In the end Mr Baker may decide he is better off with his own instincts and the advice of his own kitchen cabinet - Margaret Tutwiler, the messenger, Bob Zoellick and Dennis Ross, the ideas men, and Liz Mullins, the politician. Certainly the maestro will have the principal role in preparing Mr Bush for his critical debates with Mr Clinton later this month and next. He will hope here to emulate his performance in 1988, when he outmanoeuvred the Dukakis team in all the negotiations over format. The teams can pump and prime the candidates, but ultimately George Bush and Bill Clinton are on their own, each as fallible as the other. Baseball knows this unpredictability; immediately after the great transfers, Oakland, minus Canesco, could hardly score a run against Baltimore and David Cone was thrashed in his Toronto debut. Bill Clinton played softball last week - and his team won - but that hardly counts.</p>

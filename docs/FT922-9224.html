			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Protesters give Bush hostile reception in battered Los Angeles MANY Los Angeles residents gave President George Bush a hostile reception yesterday as he saw for himself the destruction wrought by riots last week. Walking through black, Hispanic and Korean areas of the city's downtown area, Mr Bush expressed his 'horror and dismay' at the results of the 'wanton lawlessness'. But the president also said he wanted to tackle the roots of the urban and social problems that had provided fuel for the rioting, which was triggered by the acquittal on charges of assault of four policemen who were videotaped savagely beating a motorist, Mr Rodney King. 'There must be no return to the status quo,' Mr Bush said as he arrived in the city late on Wednesday night. 'You have to get at the cause. You've got to do that,' he added yesterday. However, the president faced protests from those Angelenos who felt he should have come sooner to visit their battered city, as well as from those who felt that, by coming now, he was merely placing an unnecessary extra burden on the police and soldiers who are keeping the peace. He also met protests from the Korean-American community, which was in many instances singled out last week as the target of violence. Korean-American shopkeepers gathered outside Mr Bush's hotel, chanting: 'We want justice.' Banners proclaimed: 'We need money now' and 'Mr President  - if you won't help, Clinton will.' Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, who had visited the riot-torn areas of Los Angeles on Monday, has criticised Mr Bush for blaming the problems of the inner cities on the Great Society welfare programmes introduced by President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s. He has been cautious in his criticism of Mr Bush's response to the crisis in Los Angeles, however. Other demonstrators yesterday protested at the response of the police to the outbreak of violence last week. Mr Daryl Gates, the controversial chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, has come under renewed attack for having been inadequately prepared for an outbreak of unrest in response to the acquittal of his four officers. The department has been accused of having pulled its officers out of the area where violence first broke out, thus giving a green light to rioters. Many shopkeepers have also complained that police did not answer their calls for help and stood by as their stores were pillaged. Mr Gates has agreed under pressure to retire in June, after 14 years in his job, but local politicians yesterday called for him to leave immediately.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Malaya to acquire Heron dealership Malaya Group, the USM-quoted motor distributor, has agreed terms in principle to acquire Heron Motor Group, the motor dealership arm of Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron group. Industry sources suggest that the consideration will be about Pounds 16m. Malaya's shares were suspended yesterday, pending a further announcement 'in the next few weeks'. Mr Nick Lancaster, chief executive, said this was to staunch rumours that had been circulating in the trade. He expected completion at the end of October. He added that the Stock Exchange was treating the deal as a reverse, because until August 1992, when Mr Lancaster and a concert party bought into the group, it had been virtually as hell. Mr Lancaster said that most of Malaya's acquisitions took place in the second half of the last financial year and the first eight months of this. As a reverse takeover, the exchange has concerns over continuity of management and it is understood this accounts for the delay. Malaya wants Mr John Bradley, managing director of Heron Motor, to join the Malaya board. Heron Motor includes the London-based businesses of HR Owen, HMG Bromley and Stockport-based Hollingdrake. Turnover of the combined group is expected to be about Pounds 150m-Pounds 160m, with Heron contributing some Pounds 90m. The sale proceeds will help cut debt at Heron Corporation, a subsidiary of Heron International, which is currently undergoing financial restructuring. Under this, bondholders will receive no payment until the bank creditors of Heron Corporation have been paid off.</p>

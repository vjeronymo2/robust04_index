			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: IBM confirms scheme to axe jobs SHARES in International Business Machines firmed yesterday morning after the company admitted that at least 32,000 people would go in its job cutting plan this year, well above IBM's earlier estimates of 15,000 to 20,000. Two thirds of the job losses would be in the US and the rest mainly in Europe. Until the announcement on Tuesday, IBM had dismissed speculation that the number of job cuts would range from 40,000 to 60,000. Analysts now expect between 35,000 to 40,000 people to accept IBM's voluntary severance package. Although the additional job cuts will cost IBM an extra Dollars 1.2bn, the news was well received on Wall Street where shares in IBM firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 94 3/8 yesterday morning. IBM expects to take about Dollars 1bn in charges in the second half of this year, with the biggest impact to its third-quarter results. Analysts have estimated that charges related to the additional job cuts will reduce IBM's second-half earnings by about Dollars 1 a share. IBM, which last year reported its first annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after charges on sales of Dollars 64.8bn, said it would recoup these costs over the next 18 months through savings. The company also indicated that changes were afoot at its personal computer division. In response to reports that its PC business would be turned into a wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM said it had been working to sharpen the focus of its PC operations, 'and you will continue to see us change'. IBM would not comment about specific changes, but it has been working towards increasing the autonomy and accountability of its business units since December when it announced a restructuring of its worldwide operations.</p>

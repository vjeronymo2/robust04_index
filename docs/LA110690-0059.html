			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT COMMUNICATOR, 7, IS DESTROYED AFTER SPILL  </P> <P> In a tragic scene that was far too common during the 27-day Oak Tree meeting,  1988 Breeders' Cup turf champion Great Communicator had to be destroyed Monday  at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old gelding, with Russell Baze aboard, was second and closing the  gap on Ultrasonido with about four furlongs to run in the $219,400 Carleton F.  Burke Handicap.  </P> <P> Then, in an instant, his right hind leg gave way.  </P> <P> Great Communicator was destroyed after suffering a compound fracture of the  cannon bone in his right hind leg and a possible fracture of the lower leg.  </P> <P> In the previous day's feature, Baldomero had to be destroyed after suffering a  broken left foreleg at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> And there were several other horses without the credentials of Baldomero and  Great Communicator who went down during the meeting, raising questions about  the track's safety.  </P> <P> "If it's coincidental, then there's been an awful lot of coincidence here,"  said one jockey, who declined to be identified. "I don't think it's so much the  turf course as it is training on this main track."  </P> <P> Great Communicator was seemingly past his prime after failing to come close in  eight consecutive races before the Henry P. Russell Handicap. But, in that Oct.  17 race, Great Communicator had looked like his old self while holding off  Polar Boy to win.  </P> <P> Monday, trainer Thad Ackel's pride and joy appeared to be back on his game.  </P> <P> "He felt 100% in the warmup and in the way he was running until that point,"  Baze said of Great Communicator, who finished with more than $2.9 million in  earnings and whose biggest victory came in the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf.  </P> <P> "He was sitting comfortably, and he was just getting himself gathered up and  starting to close the gap a bit on the leader. The first bad step he took was  when it broke. The old guy didn't want to pull up. It just makes you sick. I  feel really bad for Thad because that horse means so much to him."  </P> <P> Said Ackel: "I had a lump in my throat since I watched Go For Wand go down on  television in the Breeders' Cup. When I saw her go down, I prayed that it  wouldn't happen to me."  </P> <P> Ackel had given Great Communicator six months off after he suffered a wrenched  ankle. He returned to racing in July, and more recently the horse had undergone  minor surgery for a displaced palate.  </P> <P> "This was a perfectly sound horse going into today's race, and that's what  bothers me," Ackel said.  </P> <P> Neither Ackel nor Charlie Whittingham, a trainer with numerous grass horses,  would blame the Santa Anita turf course for the recent injuries.  </P> <P> "You can't knock Santa Anita," Ackel said. "They responded to complaints about  the turf course by spending millions of dollars, so they put the money where it  belonged. I'm not sure they accomplished what they set out to do, but they've  spent a lot of money trying and given it an all-out effort.  </P> <P> "They ran a couple of other turf races before my horse ran, and when that  happens a course is bound to have a few holes in it. My horse took a couple of  funny strides just when he was moving up toward the lead. He had been moving so  fluidly in the mornings, and I thought he had come up to the race perfectly."  </P> <P> Said Whittingham: "How many races had that horse run? He's been in 56 races?  Well, there you are. Not only that, he runs hard, he hits the ground hard. He  runs hard, he hit the ground hard, he's not young, and he broke his leg. That's  your answer."  </P> <P> Looking for a sweep of Oak Tree's two biggest turf races, Rial won the Burke,  rallying from last to beat favored Ultrasonido by a head.  </P> <P> However, after a lengthy stewards' inquiry, Rial was disqualified and placed  second, making Ultrasonido the winner in his first start for owners Frank and  Jan Whitham. Bayakoa's owners had purchased the 5-year-old Argentine-bred from  Alberto Hansen Sunday.  </P> <P> Lugging in badly through the stretch despite Rafael Meza's left-handed urging,  Rial came in and bumped Ultrasonido nearing the wire. The stewards ruled this  caused Ultrasonido to break stride and awarded him the victory, although Rial  would have been an easy winner if he had maintained a straight course.  </P> <P> The Oak Tree Board of Stewards ordered jockey Pat Valenzuela to appear at  Hollywood Park by Monday.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old rider, who has had problems with drugs and alcohol, called in  sick Saturday, then later refused to take a drug test and told Dr. Neal Fisher  he was going to take "three months off to straighten out my life."  </P> <P> Valenzuela was suspended for 60 days Oct. 27, 1989, after testing positive for  cocaine. The suspension cost him the mount on Sunday Silence in the Breeders'  Cup Classic.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Kent Desormeaux won his first riding title since making the Southland his home.  He finished with 23 winners, one more than Gary Stevens, Alex Solis and Eddie  Delahoussaye. . . . Richard Mandella, who turned 40 Monday, won the training  title with 12 victories. . . . The daily on-track attendance for Oak Tree was  21,879, compared to 21,903 in 1989 when the meeting lasted 32 days. On-track  handle was down 1.3% from the previous year, but the daily average handle of  $6,619,645, factoring in off-track and out-of-state sites, was up 5.6%. . . .  Reluctant Guest, who finished 10th in Sunday's Yellow Ribbon Stakes, was  injured and will be out for several months.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Christine contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Richemont to pay Dollars 180m for Italian pay-TV holding Richemont, the Swiss industrial holding company controlled by the South African Rupert family, is paying Dollars 180m for 25 per cent of Telepiu, the Italian pay television operator. The vendor is Compagnie Internationale de Telecommunications. The acquisition will transform Richemont into a substantial force in European pay television. It already holds a 46.5 per cent stake in FilmNet, which broadcasts four pay-TV channels in Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia. FilmNet has more than 700,000 subscribers. Telepiu broadcasts throughout Italy two scrambled pay-TV channels featuring movies and sports events, and one unscrambled channel featuring mainly documentary and cultural programmes. It has 550,000 subscribers. Richemont's main existing holdings are controlling stakes in the Rothmans International tobacco group and the Vendome luxury goods group, built around the Cartier and Dunhill businesses. Mr Johann Rupert, managing director, has been attempting to diversify Richemont's interests, and invested in the lossmaking FilmNet three years ago together with a South African broadcasting group. They have overhauled its programming, but losses still rose sharply in the year ended March, with Richemont's share of the deficit jumping from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 25.7m (Dollars 35.6m). Mr Rupert said there was no need for a similar overhaul at Telepiu. However, he indicated it would take some time to build up the subscription list to a sufficient level. 'It seems to be endemic in this business - it takes a long time,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORDSTROM 'GUILTY' OF REWARDING INITIATIVE, BUT OTHERS ALSO REQUIRE WORK 'OFF  THE CLOCK'  </P> <P> Shame on Nordstrom for telling its sales associates to pursue their  entrepreneurial instincts and act as if they actually owned the business ("The  Other Nordstrom," Feb. 4)! Shame on Nordstrom for honoring those who thrive in  such an environment by giving them the opportunity to sell more and earn more,  to avail themselves of enviable merchandise discounts and to aspire to  increased responsibilities thanks to a strictly enforced promote-from-within  policy! And shame on Nordstrom for fostering middle management autonomy!  </P> <P> Guilty, I say.  </P> <P> As fitting punishment, let's demand that Nordstrom eliminate the title sales  associate and replace it with sales clerk. This way we can all hire nothing but  C-minus people and pay them uniformly for every hour worked. Besides, how else  can we ensure that Nordstrom will fall into line with the rest of the herd  leading us to the promised land where mediocrity forever reigns supreme?  </P> <P> HARRY STEVENSON  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

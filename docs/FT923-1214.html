			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / US seeks Gatt ruling in oilseed row THE US has asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to rule on how much the European Community must compensate trading partners for lost exports due to EC subsidies on oilseeds. The request for an arbitration panel, which will be considered by Gatt's governing council on September 29, suggests the US wants a further breathing space before unleashing its threatened trade sanctions against Dollars 1bn worth of EC food and drink imports. Retaliation from Brussels would precipitate a damaging trade war just when the two sides are hoping to finalise a deal on farm trade, including oilseeds, within the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Senior trade officials from the 'quad' countries - US, EC, Japan and Canada  -met in Geneva yesterday to assess prospects for the round. Negotiators had hoped for a deal in the 'window of opportunity' between the French referendum on Maastricht and the US elections on November 3, unlocking the round for completion early in 1993. This has now been clouded by the narrow French Yes vote last Sunday and President Bush's poor showing in the opinion polls. If established, the Gatt panel would have 30 days to come up with a binding estimate of lost oilseeds trade which would serve as the basis for EC compensation or, failing accord, retaliation by trading partners. The US says it and nine other producers of oilseeds, such as soyabeans, sunflower seed and colza, are losing Dollars 2bn a year from lower sales in the EC market. The EC has put the figure at no more than Dollars 400m.</p>

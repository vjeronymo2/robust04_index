The drafting committee, which comprised, on the Palestinian  side, president 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th and  Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and, on the Israeli  side, 'Uzi Dayan, deputy director of the Defense Ministry's  planning administration, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser at the  Foreign Ministry, held a meeting last night, which continued  until dawn today. This meeting followed a three-hour private  meeting between the head of the Palestinian delegation, Nabil  Sha'th, and the head of the Israeli delegation, General Amnon  Shahaq.    Sources close to the negotiators told MENA that the  Palestinian leadership will meet in Tunis later today to examine  the new draft agreement on security measures and international  protection in Hebron and to inform the two delegations of its  view of the agreement. Afterward, the two delegations will hold  an extensive meeting to discuss the details of the agreement.    The same sources said the worsening situation in the  occupied  territories and the outbreak of clashes in which over 66 people  were killed and wounded dominated the atmosphere of the  negotiations, which was tense at first and relaxed gradually as  the negotiators began to discuss substantial issues.    The sources added that the Israeli side proposed the  presence  of 100 Palestinian policemen in Hebron and 70 international  observers armed with light weapons and able to move freely.    The sources said that if the wording of the agreement on  security measures in Hebron is completed today, the negotiators  will turn immediately, as of tomorrow, Thursday, to the  discussion of issues concerning the Gaza-Jericho Accord.  Discussion was suspended following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in Hebron on 25 February.    The agency has learned that intense international contacts  took place with the Palestinian leadership in Tunis all day  yesterday to make the Palestinian leadership give its delegation  in Cairo the green light to restart negotiations on security  measures and international protection in Hebron after the  killing of six members of the Fatah Hawks in Gaza two days ago  by a special unit from the Israeli Army and the death of a  Palestinian woman and a man who were on the scene.    The agency also learned that Israel agreed to vanguards of  the Palestinian police force entering Gaza and Jericho directly  following the resumption of the negotiations concerning  Palestinian self-rule in these two areas.</p>

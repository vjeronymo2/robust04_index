			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 11 (A.A.) -- Turkey on Wednesday [11  May] expressed concern about the political crisis in Yemen and  about the chance that it might take the shape of armed clashes.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly  briefing that Turkey calls for the Yemeni leaders to stop the  conflict in harmony with their people's hope for unity and  peace, and wishes that further bloodshedding would stop for the  good of the country.    `During this critical stage which is going on in the  country,  Turkey calls for moderation between the two sides and hopes for  an agreement to be reached as soon as possible,' Ataman said.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Invesco With the legacy of Maxwell now behind it, Invesco deserves to be judged squarely on its merits as a fund manager. Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in the shares suggests the market's judgement is not favourable. With 80 per cent of its business in the US - where last year's bull run in investment markets was less pronounced - funds under management were never likely to match the spectacular growth achieved by others in the sector. More worrying is the rise in expenses, which held full-year profits below expectations. There may be special factors at work. Investment in systems now might attract more pension fund clients in future. Still, it would be heartening to see some concrete results from the company's declared determination to get to grips with costs. A European operating profit of Pounds 4m is especially disappointing. If Invesco can convince on costs, though, it looks well placed. While UK institutions' memory of past mistakes will linger, and its franchise in unit trusts will take time to rebuild, Invesco's position as an international manager serving US pension funds should leave scope for growth. In the short-term, the sensitivity of fund managers' shares to movements in the equity market is a reason for caution. Before yesterday Invesco had already fallen by 20 per cent since the stock market turned in early February, in common with most of its peers. If Invesco wants to evolve beyond the status of a geared play on equities - as M&amp;G did for a while in the 1980s - it still has something to prove.</p>

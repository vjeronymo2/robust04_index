			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, April 17 (ATA) -- Serbian formula  "Albanians -- Expatriation, Deportation, and Extermination" that  aims the ethnic cleansing and colonization of Kosova, the  slogan, action is added for a long time: the exchange of houses  and donation of land to the Serb settlers [sentence as  received]. Serbian Government is making large investments for  this, but colonization is committed even without investments at  all: so the Albanian houses and land are confiscated and handed  over to the Serbs.    According to the recent information of Serbian press, the  campaign of recolonization of Kosova is under its way. 220  houses will be erected in Istog commune, while a flat with 20  apartments for Serbs settlers from Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia  is being built. Istog commune has actually 500 Serb settlers.  It is planned the permanent establishment them in three ares  and each family initially will posses a house and 20 ares of  land. The first site will be located in the property of  "Dubrava" Plant and initially will have 120 families, but later  more because it will be extended into a surface of 30 hectares.  The second site will be in Gjurakovc and the third in Muzhevine  village, in each of them private houses for 50 families will be  erected. A large number of Serb's family settlers is already  established in Belice, Osojan, Zhace, and Gjurakovc villages,  all these in Istog commune.    Serb settlers in Kline commune have on possession an area of  150 hectares, while in Decan commune some 180 houses are under  construction for Serbs and Montenegrins settlers. In the same  commune is planned the construction of houses for 400 families.  According to the Serbian press, these families will receive 10  acres for gardening and 3 to 4 hectares arable land. Besides 35  buildings, some 219 sites are assigned to the settlers, in  Gjilan commune, while only in Dragodan quarter of Prishtina, 200  sites be handed over to Serbs and Montenegrins for construction.  Plans and undertakings of this kind that serves to the  colonization exist in other parts of Kosova. To this purpose is  serving the expulsion forcefully of Albanians from their houses  and putting in Serbs and Montenegrins families. According to a  recent report of the Council for the Protection of Human Rights  in Prishtina, some 42 Albanian families were expelled from their  houses, only during the first three months of the year. 600  people from families of sacked workers are expelled during these  last three years. Dismissing from the job of 130 thousands  Albanians and putting Serbs and Montenegrins in their places is  the largest ethnic cleansing carried out in mines, plants and  institutions.    These days in Podujeve has come 25 Serb families with 78  members and 33 of them are employed immediately. Currently 400  Serb work in Podujeve, many of them have come from Prokuple and  Kurshumli communes near Serbia-Kosova border.    The consequences of the war in the former Yugoslavia are  reflected in Kosova in the massive settlement of displaced  people from those areas in Kosova. Such a thing is considered  as a great chance by the Serbs for a new recolonization of  Kosova, besides the ethnic cleansing, violence, terror and  discrimination carried out by the Serbs. The Serbs have placed  and are placing in Kosova refugees from Slovenia, Croatia, and  Bosnia-Hercegovina, at a time when thousands of Albanians are  expelled. Serbs plan to bring in 500 thousand Montenegrins and  Serb settlers and to deport Albanians beside "Bjeshkeve te  Namuna" in the territory of Albanian Republic.    Political and state subjects of Kosova have demanded from  the  UN High Commission for Refugees, that the settlers should have  only the status of refugees and should not become permanent  settlers. If the colonization is carried out under the veil "of  the refugees issue solution," this would imply international  recognition of Kosova colonization and it would be tragic.</p>

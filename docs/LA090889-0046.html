			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: UNION BLUES  </P> <P> Country singer Randy Travis and each member of his band face fines of up to  $10,000 and expulsion from the musicians union for crossing picket lines last  week in Las Vegas. Musicians are striking over the use of taped music and  guaranteed work in hotel showrooms. "Randy chose to make his fans happy as  opposed to making the union happy," a spokesman for the singer said. "Randy  supports live music over taped music. Originally he wasn't going to cross the  picket line. But we got hundreds of letters and phone calls from fans -- (and)  he decided to do it." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

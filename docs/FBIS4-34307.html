			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified "special" reporters from Cartagena </F> de Indias, Colombia]    [Excerpts] At the closing of the Fourth Ibero-American  summit of heads of state and government that was held in this  city, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy on 15 June expressed his  rejection of the trade embargo on Cuba. Nonetheless, he urged  Cuban President Fidel Castro to effect a democratic opening in  his country. [passage omitted]    Wasmosy referred to the situation confronting the Cuban  nation: "We are against blockades, but by the same token we  request that there be a greater democratic opening in Cuba.  Resolutions taken in that country will thereby have more  legitimacy."    Another issue discussed by the heads of state and government  was the "right to life." But no consensus was reached on it in  order to draft a joint summit declaration.    The subject was discussed on 15 June by Argentine President  Carlos Saul Menem, who in a plenary summit session moved that a  unified pronouncement condemning abortion be made. This motion  was supported by Wasmosy.    Our head of state said: "We protect the right to life. We  believe that there is life from the moment an ovum is  fertilized. Therefore, pursuant to our religious beliefs and  laws, we deem that abortion is a crime." [passage omitted]</p>

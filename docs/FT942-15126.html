			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Heading towards the acid test - An occasional series by Leslie McClements on developing a pension portfolio My pension portfolio grew by 59 per cent during 1993. By late January, it was up by a further 5 per cent. But the tightening of US monetary conditions early in February led to higher yields and lower capital values. Due to this and other uncertainties, the portfolio had fallen back to year-end levels by the end of March. During the first quarter of 1994, the FT-SE-A All Share index, adjusted for gross dividends, declined by 6 per cent. The portfolio's better performance reflects its weighting of high-yielding shares which were less affected by the general downturn. Even so, the scheme is vulnerable to higher interest rates. Does the recent rise in medium-term interest rates herald an upward trend? The consensus is that short-term rates will bottom out during 1994. Some pundits say this happened in January but, with low UK inflation, moderate growth and lower German rates in prospect, it could be late 1994 or possibly 1995 before we see a sustained increase. As many of the interest-sensitive stocks give very good yields, I want to keep them until just before the upturn. Sphere and Fleming International High Income investment trusts are at substantial discounts to net asset values: their winding-up options in October 1995 and 1996 respectively should support prices. Exmoor Dual, Abtrust Preferred Income and Bristol &amp; West Pibs (permanent interest-bearing shares) are higher priorities for disposal. The holding in TR Property was sold in January to produce a gain of 126 per cent. Part of the proceeds was invested in Artesian Second Commercial, an unquoted property investment company which should give a better yield. Its older sister company, Artesian Commercial, plans to pay a dividend of 12 per cent. An independent valuation of its properties shows a 40 per cent increase on the original equity investment. The balance of the TR Property proceeds was invested in Redland. It yields more than 5 per cent and should benefit from continued recovery in European economies over the next couple of years. Construction companies like Laing, AMEC and Wimpey were considered as alternative late-cycle recovery prospects. But these shares all have lower yields, and prices in this sector rose sharply during January, so this opportunity could have passed. The position at Queens Moat Houses remains unclear. I wrote down the 7.5 per cent convertible stock to 1p a share in December - any improvement on re-listing will be a bonus. With the change in management, Pentos recovered to 38p in mid-March. But with poor dividend prospects and the possibility of a rights issue (confirmed recently), these shares were sold, giving a 31 per cent loss. The Pentos proceeds and accumulated dividends were invested in Northern Foods. This company provides a goodyield and should have a limited downside, with prospects for capital growth. Several readers have asked for further details of small self-administered schemes. My SSAS is a hybrid scheme run by an assurance company - there is a good general description in the Allied Dunbar Pensions Guide. It charges Pounds 325 plus VAT for its services as pensioner trustee and requires a minimum contribution of Pounds 5,000 to its unit-linked pensions. Some stockbrokers and investment managers offer similar arrangements without the insurance element. These generally involve an initial fee plus larger annual charges (Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 400 respectively in one case), and higher stockbroking commissions. Self-invest personal pensions give many of the SSAS advantages for an initial fee of around Pounds 300 and a similar yearly charge. The annual overheads for a SSAS range from Pounds 450 upwards. Large annual pension contributions (Pounds 10,000 or more for at least 10 years) or a sizable fund (Pounds 0.1m or more) usually are required to spread these fixed costs. But a smaller scheme can be justified by superior investment performance or some other advantage, such as property purchase for business use. In establishing my scheme, I aimed to contain costs within the 1 per cent fund management fee which would arise with a personal pension, and to achieve similar investment returns. Both objectives have been exceeded to date, but the final retirement fund will provide the acid test. Leslie McClements is an economic consultant. His first article appeared on January 8.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Talks over BBC dispute resume Talks between BBC management and unions resume today at the conciliation service Acas, with the aim of averting further strikes in the dispute over performance pay and working hours. Leaders of the National Union of Journalists and the broadcasting union Bectu said a stoppage planned for today was unlikely to go ahead in view of the talks. Journalists and technical staff have already staged a 24-hour strike in the dispute over performance pay and working hours, and threatened further disruption.</p>

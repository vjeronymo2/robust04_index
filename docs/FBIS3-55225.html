			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Klyuchikov: "Fight Against Spies Remains </F> a Current Issue in a Democracy as Well"]    [Text] The resolution "On Military Counterespionage  Service of the Security Service of Ukraine" has come into  effect, by virtue of Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's order.  The Security Service has been entrusted with the  counterespionage protection of the Armed Forces and other  military units. The document specifies that the military  counterespionage services shall effectively address defense  problems, disclose and prevent espionage and sabotage activities  in military units, as well as work out and implement measures to  protect state secrets.    This way, the well-known special units, which were first  introduced in the Russian Army on the eve of World War I, have  outlived the Soviet Army, and have been transplanted into the  reinstated military units of Ukraine. No matter where you go --  the fight against spies is always a current issue of any  authorities.</p>

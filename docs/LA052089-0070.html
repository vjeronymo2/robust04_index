			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'OUT OF THE BARREL OF A GUN';  </P> <P> DENG'S TIES TO MILITARY REINFORCE POLITICAL POWER  </P> <P> China's political future is now being determined in part by the personal and  political loyalties of military leaders, much as it was after the death of Mao  Tse-tung.  </P> <P> "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," Mao said, and in the 62  years since he first uttered this dictum, the Chinese Communist Party has never  forgotten it. At times of crisis in China, it is often the connections of  military leaders and the country's large police and security apparatus that  shape the course of events.  </P> <P> While Deng Xiaoping, China's current leader, is now regarded primarily as a  modernizer and economic reformer, his military ties are the source of his  power. Deng does not even sit on the party Politburo; the only formal title he  retains today is chairman of the party's Central Military Commission.  </P> <P> Deng was an important military leader in China's civil war against the  Nationalists four decades ago, helping the Communists to win one of the crucial  battles of that war. The friendships and connections he made then helped him  rise to power after Mao's death in 1976 and still help to keep him there today.  </P> <P> Friday night and early today, when the Chinese regime moved troops into Beijing  to take control of the city, the official announcement came from Chinese  President Yang Shangkun. Yang, who holds the title of head of the Chinese  state, is a veteran leader of the People's Liberation Army -- and a close,  longtime ally of Deng.  </P> <P> But this week, there have been signs of serious divisions among military  leaders, just as there were in the weeks after Mao died in 1976. As the  demonstrations for democracy in China have grown and spread, some military  commanders reportedly have refused to move against the crowds.  </P> <P> One senior U.S. intelligence official said Friday that the military units  called into Beijing are not considered crack troops. He said that their ranks  are thought to include many soldiers who sympathize with the demonstrators.  </P> <P> "The problem with calling out the troops is that maybe the demonstrators will  turn the troops (against the regime)," said one Bush Administration official.  </P> <P> A Chinese source in the United States said Friday that Deng was calling  military units into Beijing from the remote Chinese regions of Xinjiang and  Manchuria -- the areas in northwestern and northeastern China near the Soviet  Union. "They're definitely bringing troops into Beijing from out of town,  because they can't trust the locals," another U.S. intelligence analyst said.  </P> <P> In the days after Mao's death, the top leadership of the Communist Party was  split between an ultra-radical faction led by Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and a  more moderate group. The dispute was settled when the Chinese defense minister,  security chief and a special palace-guard military group known as the 8341 Unit  secretly threw their support to the moderates.  </P> <P> On Oct. 6, 1976, Jiang Qing's two allies on the Politburo Standing Committee,  the small group at the apex of the Chinese Communist Party, showed up at the  party's leadership compound in Beijing for a meeting. Both were arrested, just  as their allies were trying unsuccessfully to round up military support from  Shanghai.  </P> <P> "Hands up," said the security guards as they rushed out from behind a screen,  in an operation personally directed by the Chinese defense minister. The 8341  Unit then arrested Mao's wife in her bedroom. She was convicted of crimes  against the state and is still in custody.  </P> <P> The support of military leaders helped Deng consolidate his control over the  Chinese Communist Party a decade ago. Since then, Deng has managed to win at  least grudging support from the Chinese military for his economic reform  programs.  </P> <P> But Deng has been unable to find and groom a successor who would enjoy the same  military support that he has.  </P> <P> In 1981, Deng appointed his longtime protege, Hu Yaobang, as head of the  Chinese Communist Party. But Hu could never win over the PLA, the Chinese  military. Hu once complained that when it came to the PLA, one sentence from  Deng was worth five sentences from him.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Hu was forced to resign after he refused to take a hard line  against a series of student demonstrations in China. The party group that  accepted his resignation was called an "enlarged" meeting of the Politburo --  enlarged because it included a number of senior party leaders with military  connections who were not actually members of the Politburo.  </P> <P> Deng appointed another reform-minded leader, then-Premier Zhao Ziyang, to take  charge of the Communist Party. But there have been reports that senior Chinese  military leaders were also unhappy with Zhao.  </P> <P> Some scholars and analysts here believe that one possible beneficiary of the  current wave of unrest is a little-known Chinese official named Qiao Shi. He is  the leader who oversees the party's security and intelligence apparatus.  </P></p>

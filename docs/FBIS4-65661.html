			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/JWI: "Relief Begins for Belgian </F> Engineer Company in Bosnia"]    [Text] Brussels, 16 May (BELGA) -- The Belgian Army began  taking over on Monday [16 May] from some 170 Belgian blue  helmets in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] working on the  "Bosnia Road" operation (the repair of the road system in  Bosnia-Herzegovina), it has been learned from a military source  in Brussels.    A vanguard of 33 soldiers took off on Monday morning for  Zagreb (Croatia), from where they will travel to the Bosnian  capital of Sarajevo, a military spokesman informed the BELGA  agency.    On the return journey, the aircraft will be bringing back  some 50 blue helmets who have completed a four months tour of  duty in this former Yugoslav Republic.    Three other flights are planned to relieve the other members  of this engineering company, most of whom were drawn from the  11th Battalion from Burcht, near Antwerp. These will take place  on 20, 24, and 27 May, the spokesman added, stating that on each  occasion the relieved soldiers will be returning to Belgium on  the same flights.    The third "Bosnia Road" contingent since the start of the  operation last September consists principally of soldiers from  the third Engineering Battalion from Westhoven, near Cologne  (Germany), and from the 15th Engineering Battalion. The "Bosnia  Road" members are stationed in Kakanj, north of Sarajevo.    In addition to these 170 engineers, two other Belgian units  are also in Bosnia. A transport company (consisting of around  100 men and code-named "Moving Star") which is delivering  humanitarian aid and an infantry company (also of around 100 men  and known as "Belbos" by the Army) which is responsible for  ensuring respect for the cease-fire concluded at the end of  February between Croats and Muslims. They are both stationed in  Vitez (in central Bosnia, 45 km northwest of Sarajevo).</p>

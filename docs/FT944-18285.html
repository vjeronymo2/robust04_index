			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hydro seeks to update Russia's Bratsk smelter Norway's Hydro Aluminium is seeking to rehabilitate Russia's Bratsk aluminium smelter, the biggest in the world, to improve efficiency and environmental standards, according to a company official, reports Reuters from Moscow. A delegation from Hydro Aluminium, part of the Norsk Hydro group, visited Bratsk last month to discuss the project. 'It was a very positive meeting,' said Mr Odd Efjestad, senior vice-president in charge of aluminium at Hydro's Moscow office. Negotiations were well advanced, but no contract had been signed yet, he added. Officials at the central Siberian smelter, where environmental groups have voiced concern over pollution, were not immediately available for comment. The Kommersant Daily newspaper reported that officials at the Bratsk plant, which has capacity to produce up to 820,000 tonnes of aluminium a year, were studying reconstruction and modernisation proposals submitted by virtually every leading aluminium company in the world. It said the Russian officials were impressed with the Norwegian technology, but gave few details. Mr Efjestad said that Hydro Aluminium wanted to improve existing facilities at the Bratsk smelter 'in a way that they would reach almost the same results, in terms of both efficiency and the environment, as if they were rebuilding with expensive pre-baked technology'. The Bratsk smelter is equipped with Soderberg type pots. The more expensive pre-baked technology has come to dominate in the western aluminium industry. 'In Bratsk, we are just modernising the Soderberg cells. With our technology, we will achieve almost the same effect for almost the same cost,' Mr Efjestad said.</p>

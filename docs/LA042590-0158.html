			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENTENCE REDUCED FOR DORTCH, BAKKER'S RIGHT-HAND MAN AT PTL  </P> <P> A federal judge today reduced the prison sentence of Richard Dortch, once the  right-hand man to Jim Bakker in the PTL Ministry, from eight years to 30  months.  </P> <P> Dortch reported to the no-bars country club prison housing some of the nation's  former elite at Eglin Air Force Base on Feb. 2 to begin serving his sentence  for fraud and returned to court a week and a half ago to ask Potter to reduce  his sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Code.  </P> <P> This morning, U.S. District Judge Robert D. Potter complied.  </P> <P> Dortch had been charged with the same 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy that  got Bakker a 45-year prison sentence, but he struck a plea bargain with  prosecutors, pleading guilty to four of the 24 counts and agreeing to testify  against Bakker and other PTL figures.  </P> <P> Last September, Potter sentenced a tearful Dortch to eight years in prison,  telling him: "Mr. Dortch, I think you need to do some prison time. You  committed a fraud and a rather large fraud at that."  </P> <P> Potter sentenced Bakker to a 45-year prison sentence.  </P></p>

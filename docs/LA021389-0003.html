			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TAXATION OR MISREPRESENTATION?;  </P> <P> POST-PROP. 13 CASH SCARCITIES REPLACE THE BIG BITE WITH MANY LITTLE ONES  </P> <P> The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest  possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing.  </P> <P>  -- Jean Baptiste Colbert,  </P> <P> Louis XIV's minister of finance  </P> <P> Most San Diego public officials probably have never heard of the Sun King's  finance minister. However, from the perspective of some skeptics -- alarmed by  what they see as a disturbing trend in local taxation -- those same  officeholders have become skilled practitioners of Colbert's 325-year-old  theory.  </P> <P> "Get the most money from the public with the least squawking -- that's the iron  law of politics," former San Diego City Councilman Fred Schnaubelt said. "And  politicians have become very clever about it. They take a little here, a little  there, always in such small amounts that there's no public outrage. But, over  time, it adds up."  </P> <P> Over the past decade, local governments have turned with increasing frequency  to special sales taxes, so-called assessment districts or service areas, user  fees and other similar devices to expand their budgets in the post-Proposition  13 era.  </P> <P> In the last two years alone in San Diego County, half-cent sales taxes for  transit and jails were approved, and the city and county enacted temporary  waivers of the so-called Gann spending limit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Taxes Under Consideration  </P> <P> The city is now reviewing a plan calling for a special $50-million-plus annual  tax to hire more police, with a property-tax increase, a utility user's tax and  the sale of general obligation bonds being the major fund-raising options under  consideration. The county, meanwhile, is pondering a special property-tax  assessment to pay for libraries.  </P> <P> Elected officials argue that the special taxes -- each of which, they  emphasize, was approved by the voters -- are needed to handle growing  responsibilities at a time when measures such as Proposition 13, the landmark  1978 tax-cutting initiative, and the Gann limit tie their hands fiscally.  </P> <P> Critics, however, see the special taxes as a way of nickel-and-diming the  public, and ask: What happened to the days when you paid your taxes once and  government made do?  </P> <P> "There's ample justification for feeling that, as soon as the hand of  government is withdrawn from one of your pockets, it slips into another one  going after more money," said former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, now a  radio talk-show host.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Government's Insatiable Appetite'  </P> <P> Dot Migdal, who monitors City Hall and the County Administration Center for the  San Diego Chamber of Commerce, attributes the myriad special taxes to  "government's insatiable appetite."  </P> <P> "Whether it satisfies that appetite in one big bite or a bunch of little ones,  the result is the same," she said.  </P> <P> Dismissing those attitudes as overly cynical, city and county officials contend  that such characterizations of the special taxes also overlook compelling  political realities -- starting with the way in which Proposition 13 shifted  budget flexibility from San Diego to Sacramento.  </P> <P> "What a lot of people still don't understand, 11 years later, is that  Proposition 13 left (local governments) with the responsibility to provide  services at the same time that it took away their ability to raise revenue,"  said David Janssen, the county's assistant chief administrative officer.  </P> <P> Before Proposition 13, local governments could meet budget demands by simply  nudging up property taxes, with fractional increases capable of generating tens  of millions of dollars in new revenue. By capping property taxes at 1% of  assessed value, however, Proposition 13 eliminated that option and left local  governments heavily dependent upon the share of property-tax funds that they  received from Sacramento.  </P> <P> As a consequence, local officials argue, they have little alternative but to  turn to special taxes to address pressing problems that create financial  demands that outpace inflation.  </P> <P> Moreover, the requirement for voters' approval of all new taxes precludes -- in  the officials' eyes -- criticism of the measures as a kind of sinister  government plot to sneak small taxes by an unknowing public. Far from being  violations of the spirit of Proposition 13, as opponents charge, supporters  argue that the special tax proposals simply give voters opportunities to  continuously chart government spending.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Gives Voters a Chance'  </P> <P> "What anyone who criticizes these (taxes) as a way of putting something over on  the public is really saying is that the voters are stupid, and I don't believe  that," Supervisor Susan Golding said. "No one's forcing the voters to approve  this. It simply gives voters a chance to say, this is something we want to  spend more money on, or, no, we don't. What's wrong with giving voters that  choice?"  </P> <P> While administrators complain that earmarking the taxes for specific purposes  curtails their ability to shift funds from one area to another to meet  unanticipated needs, they concede that asking the public to spend money on a  particular program perhaps is more politically palatable than simply seeking a  general tax increase.  </P> <P> "In essence, this allows voters to set the priorities," San Diego City Manager  John Lockwood said. "From a management standpoint, that poses some problems  because it reduces flexibility. But, politically, it's understandable why  people might be more willing to spend more money on something they consider  important than to just give more money to government with no strings attached."  </P> <P> Another option that has been considered -- without much success -- involves the  possibility of local governments generating revenue in order to reduce the need  for tax dollars.  </P> <P> Last week, for example, the City Council rejected a proposal to build a  McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Balboa Park, a plan that would have  generated six-figure annual payments to the city. In the mid-1980s, the Board  of Supervisors turned down, on aesthetic and financial grounds, a proposed  retail-hotel development on the bayfront parking lots flanking the county  building.  </P> <P> Even if such proposals prove feasible, officials say, they probably will never  generate more than a small percentage of local governments' budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where to Draw the Line  </P> <P> "The question isn't so much whether you can do it -- it's where you draw the  line on commercialization," San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner said. "If we  really wanted, we probably could sell advertising on the walls of City Hall.  But do people really want a Shearson Lehman Brothers Andy Williams Isuzu City  Hall? I don't think so."  </P> <P> Recent special taxes -- and proposals for future ones -- have dealt with many  high-profile issues. Voters' approval of them, officials argue, demonstrates  the public's willingness to pay more to solve major problems.  </P> <P> The half-cent sales tax approved last November by voters, for example, is  projected to generate about $1.6 billion over its 10-year life to build new  jails -- where inmate populations are now more than double their official  capacity -- and more courtrooms. An earlier half-cent sales tax approved in  November, 1987, is expected to raise nearly $2.25 billion over 20 years for new  highways, street improvements and transit systems.  </P> <P> The various $50-million-a-year funding options being examined by the city to  hire about 440 more police officers are envisioned as a means of meeting the  San Diego City Council's longtime goal of having two sworn officers for every  1,000 city residents. There are now 1.62 officers per 1,000 residents -- a rate  that makes San Diego, the nation's seventh-largest city, ninth among the  nation's top cities in terms of numbers of officers per capita.  </P> <P> And, if the supervisors eventually propose a special tax to retire the library  system's $1.6-million-a-year debt, that election will show whether San Diegans  consider libraries important enough to justify the estimated $7-per-person  charge needed to prevent cutbacks.  </P> <P> "The public identifies the issue and the public decides whether to spend more  money on it," San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts said. "No one's ever  excited about paying more taxes, but this way, at least the voters get heard  very clearly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basic Assumption  </P> <P> Inherent in much of the debate over the special taxes is the assumption that  local governments cannot meet those needs without more money, a matter that  most officeholders regard as so common-sensical as to be indisputable. Although  inflation, business expansion and population growth swell tax revenues  annually, thereby enlarging municipal budgets, the price of needed services  consistently grows even faster, they contend.  </P> <P> Critics, however, are unwilling to accept that assumption on faith alone. With  the county operating under a $1.3-billion annual budget and the city's budget  topping $807 million, they argue that more efficient expenditure of those  dollars would make it unnecessary to resort to more special taxes.  </P> <P> "It's easy to say government is inefficient and the money could be spent  better, and, to a certain extent, that's true," Filner said. "But, unless you  just start abandoning entire programs -- and I don't sense any public mandate  for that -- at best, you might get an extra couple million dollars here or  there by tightening up. That's nowhere near enough when you're talking about  needing $50 million for something like police."  </P> <P> Both city and county officials also complain that they get shortchanged from  both Sacramento and Washington in the distribution of tax dollars.  </P> <P> County officials point out that San Diego ranks 57th out of the state's 58  counties in per capita tax revenue that it receives from Sacramento. That  inequity figures prominently in lawsuits that the county has filed against the  state, seeking reimbursement for the tens of millions of dollars that it  contends have been improperly denied it.  </P> <P> Programs mandated by state or federal laws make up about 95% of the county's  budget, transforming the county, in the words of Supervisor George Bailey, into  "basically a funnel, a middle man."  </P> <P> "When you look at how much money we have no discretion over, that $1-billion  budget looks a lot smaller," Bailey said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used for Basic Services  </P> <P> Although opponents concede that many of those arguments have some merit, they  object to the way special taxes have come to be used or proposed for basic  services such as streets, jails and police protection.  </P> <P> "These are services that, historically, people have become accustomed to  receiving without getting hit with a special tax bill," said Mark Nelson,  executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn. "It's fair to ask, if local  government isn't doing that, what is it doing?"  </P> <P> The growing number of special taxes and assessment districts also draws  critics' ire. Over the past five years, for example, the number of assessment  districts -- areas where residents agree to pay higher taxes in return for  special services -- has tripled to 24, according to William McGuigan, the  city's budget services manager. Most of those assessment districts pay for  landscaping in specific communities.  </P> <P> Officials stress that assessment fees are not imposed by City Hall, but rather  result from communities' petitioning of the council. In each case, they point  out, more than two-thirds of the districts' property owners signing petitions  telling the council that they were willing to pay extra tax dollars to have,  say, flowers planted along roadsides in their community.  </P> <P> Opponents, though, express skepticism about any attempts to portray the special  taxes' enactment as democracy in action. True, the public must approve the  taxes, they say, but the officeholders who propose them are not simply  disinterested bystanders. Indeed, some political observers go so far as to  argue that the officials shrewdly manipulate the process.  </P> <P> They do so, opponents charge, by choosing what Migdal terms "sexy programs" for  submission to the voters for extra financing. Although agreeing with that  assertion, John McTighe, a former county policy analyst who now runs his own  consulting firm, does not fault officials for taking that tack.  </P> <P> "Let's face it -- if you ask people whether they want to pay more for welfare  or things like Edgemoor (geriatric hospital), the answer probably would be no,"  McTighe said. "But government still has to provide those services, too."  </P> <P> The special taxes' relatively unpainful financial effect on individuals often  makes for persuasive campaign slogans.  </P> <P> During last fall's campaign over the proposed half-cent sales tax for jails,  for example, officials hammered away at the theme that, "for pennies a day,"  San Diegans could ensure that dangerous criminals who might otherwise go free  because of jail crowding would be incarcerated. Similarly, Filner, who proposed  the $50-million-a-year plan for more police, has noted that his plan would cost  the owner of a $100,000 home $34 to $87 annually.  </P> <P> "I guess I have no problem asking voters, 'Is it worth that much to you?' "  Filner said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers Don't Lie  </P> <P> The incremental increases in an individual's overall tax burden produced by the  special taxes, opponents suggest, are small enough and so widely dispersed as  to generally avoid massive public opposition.  </P> <P> "Taken in isolation, none of these taxes or extra fees seems like that much  money," Hedgecock said. "Over the years, of course, they accumulate. But,  before you start seeing anger or majority opposition, people have to start  doing some arithmetic. For whatever reason, that hasn't happened so far."  </P> <P> Schnaubelt, whose Libertarian-cum-Republican philosophy prompted innumerable  lectures on that topic during his years on the council, concurred with that  assessment.  </P> <P> "It's like the story of the frog in boiling water: If you turn up the heat  little by little, it stays in the pot until it's too late," Schnaubelt said.  "And that's what's happening to taxpayers."  </P> <P> County administrator Janssen, however, disputes such analyses.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in conspiracy theories, and that's what that sounds like,"  Janssen said. "First of all, I don't think people are that cunning or that  smart. Plus, all I see is an honest attempt by honest people to do what's  beneficial to the public."  </P> <P> Lockwood, meanwhile, views the debate as simply another chapter in a recurring  story that he has heard often throughout his nearly four decades at City Hall  -- one that, from his perspective, illustrates the largely no-win position in  which public officials find themselves.  </P> <P> "Since before I was shaving, the only two things said around here have been,  'We want more service and reduce the cost of government,' " Lockwood said.  "There's a tremendous inconsistency there, because those goals have you moving  in opposite directions. But that gap is there now, always has been there and  probably always will be. Knowing that makes this job a little easier."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our reporter has just told us that a few minutes ago  the Croatian and Muslim delegations ended their meeting held at  the Croatian mission. They have agreed, among other things, to  set up, within the next seven days, a commission in charge of  missing persons. The commission will be set up on a parity  basis. Toward the end of the month, the Constitutional Assembly  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation will meet to elect the  federation's president and prime minister, and pass several laws.</p>

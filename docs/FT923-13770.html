			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow offers muted reaction to PPI data Wall Street US equities were narrowly mixed in slow, summer trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.48 higher at 3,330.56 in volume of less than 167m shares. Other market indices also posted gains, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 0.39 at 414.62 and the Nasdaq composite rising 2.96 to 567.71. On Thursday, the Dow climbed 30.80 to 3,324.08. The stock market's reaction to a favourable inflation report, based on the June producer price index, was muted. The index advanced 0.2 per cent over the month. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the core PPI rate fell by 0.1 per cent - the first decline in the core index since February 1987. The beginning of the second quarter result season has started to have an impact on Wall Street. Among featured issues, Conner Peripherals, which makes Winchester disk drives, climbed dollars 1 1/4 to dollars 20 3/8 in active trading.  The company reported second quarter net income of 77 cents a share, up from 45 cents, late on Thursday. Dallas Semiconductor advanced dollars 1 to a 52-week high of dollars 10 on stronger-than-expected second quarter net earnings of 18 cents a share against 16 cents the previous year. In contrast, Sierra Pacific Resources plunged dollars 5 1/4 to a 52-week low of dollars 18 1/2 following a cut in its quarterly dividend to 28 cents from 46 cents. The utility group has also said it will restate its earnings from 1980 through 1991 to lower levels. Shares in British Petroleum tumbled dollars 1 to dollars 47 1/2 in spite of improved earnings projections from an analyst at Kidder Peabody, who increased 1993 predictions to dollars 2.75 a share from dollars 2.50. A number of blue chip stocks were actively traded on the big board including Glaxo, down dollars 1/8 to dollars 26 7/8, Citicorp, up dollars 3/8 to dollars 21 1/8 and Philip Morris, off dollars 3/8 to dollars 79 1/8. Computer issues dominated Nasdaq trading. Apple Computer slid dollars 1/8 to dollars 45 3/4, Dell Computer rose dollars 1 1/4 to dollars 17 1/2 and Microsoft advanced dollars 1/2 to dollars 69 1/2. Unilab tumbled dollars 1 1/8 to dollars 5 1/8 in heavy trading after the clinical laboratory testing service provider said it would take a second quarter pre-tax charge of dollars 12m to convert its northern California billing system. New York-based Unilab also expects revenues in the quarter to fall below expectations, although it expects them to exceed the previous year's dollars 51.8m. Canada Toronto's share prices ended little changed in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index closed up 7.80 points at 3447.55, for a gain of 27.5 on the week. Advances led declines by 291 to 237. At 24.5m, the volume of shares traded was below yesterday's 31.8m, and trading value was CDollars 278.3m against CDollars 437.8m.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS STAY HOT, WIN, 6-4;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: THEY MATCH THEIR BEST START IN CLUB HISTORY WITH VICTORY OVER FLAMES.  GRETZKY RAISES POINT TOTAL TO 1,999.  </P> <P> They came to the Forum Tuesday night hoping to see history.  </P> <P> And history they saw.  </P> <P> No, it wasn't Wayne Gretzky's 2,000th point. That will have to wait for another  night after Gretzky collected two assists to bring him to the brink with 1,999  points.  </P> <P> But two third-period goals by Bob Kudelski and one by Tomas Sandstrom enabled  the Kings to beat the Calgary Flames, 6-4, and equal the best start in club  history through nine games.  </P> <P> The Smythe Division-leading Kings improved to 7-1-1, matching the record of the  1980-81 team. Gretzky's second assist came with 1:26 to play. That brought what  was left of the sellout crowd of 16,005 to its feet, roaring every time Gretzky  got his stick on the puck.  </P> <P> But, it was not to be.  </P> <P> "I'm a little disappointed," Gretzky said. "I wanted to do it tonight. I have  not had a big night here in L.A. The fans have been great to me, and it would  have been nice to do it."  </P> <P> Rob Blake, who was playing collegiate hockey at Bowling Green a year ago at  this time, didn't have to be told he was in on history.  </P> <P> "You could feel it," he said.  </P> <P> Not Tony Granato.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth," said Granato, one of Gretzky's linemates, "I forgot  about it. I didn't realize until they made the announcement he had his 1,999th  point."  </P> <P> Gretzky missed two chances for a point in the first period.  </P> <P> Operating in a power play, he twice fed Granato, once in the crease and once in  the slot. On both occasions, goalie Mike Vernon fell to his knees to make  strong saves on Granato's shots.  </P> <P> "I was a little mad at myself that I didn't get in there and bury that one,"  said Granato of his first scoring opportunity on the power play.  </P> <P> The Flames led, 1-0, at that point with a goal only 1:21 into the game. Al  MacInnis, having skated around Gretzky into the right circle, fired a 30-foot  slap shot from there that flew between goalie Daniel Berthiaume's pads. It was  MacInnis' team-leading seventh goal of the season.  </P> <P> Some fancy skating by Todd Elik tied it at 6:31 of the period.  </P> <P> Elik skated around defenseman Ric Nattress, leaving him a clear shot at the  goal. Elik then moved past Vernon to the right side of the net where he  backhanded the puck past the goalie for his fifth goal.  </P> <P> The Kings got a little help in taking the lead later in the period.  </P> <P> John Tonelli, who has had a quiet start this season, made some noise by  slamming the puck off Vernon in front of the goal.  </P> <P> But the puck skidded to defenseman Tim Sweeney, whose momentum carried him  toward the goal. Unable to stop, Sweeney inadvertently kicked the puck into the  net with his right skate.  </P> <P> Sweeney got the score, but Tonelli got credit for his first goal and second  point of the season.  </P> <P> Gretzky got his only point of the night in the second period after taking a  pass from Sandstrom, who had controlled the puck off the right boards.  </P> <P> Sandstrom passed to Gretzky on the left. The Kings' center spotted Granato all  alone ahead of two defensemen, like a wide receiver who has beaten the  defensive backs.  </P> <P> Gretzky got Granato the puck and Granato got his fourth goal of the season by  scoring from about 15 feet out. That made it 3-1 at the 1:39 mark.  </P> <P> Goals by Roger Johansson and Gary Suter tied it again, 3-3.  </P> <P> The victory was the King's fifth in a row, surpassing last year's best winning  streak. The club's unbeaten string stands at six.  </P> <P> But when it was over, most players talked about Gretzky and the point that  never materialized.  </P> <P> "It's too bad it didn't happen," Sandstrom said. "I had a lot of chances. I  should have had two or three goals.  </P> <P> So it's on to Winnipeg where the Kings will open a six-game trip with games on  Friday and Sunday.  </P> <P> "I hope to get it over with quickly," Gretzky said.  </P> <P> Until then, Gretzky's total, already the best in NHL history, will stand at  1,999.  </P> <P> For No. 99, what could be more fitting?  </P> <P> </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Tim Watters returned to the Kings' lineup after missing six games with bruised  ribs. . . . The American national anthem was sung by Rev. George Simmonds,  fulfilling a longtime fantasy at age 100.  </P></p>

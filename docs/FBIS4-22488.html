Gribov, president of Germes-Tsentr Bank, </F> by T. Piskareva: "Bank's Silence Turns to Gold"]    [Text] A few days ago, on one of the television programs  for "businesspeople," this spirited idea was heard: since  commercial banks (almost all) operate at the expense of state  credits, then all their profit ought to be taken away from them.  The idea is spirited but just: after all, as many people are  aware, all our most powerful, soundest commercial banks have  hatched from state structures. The Moscow joint-stock bank [AB]  Germes-Tsentr, is insured against that kind of "milking." Its  president, Vladimir Gribov, allows that the bank could be  nationalized or expropriated, and there could even be an attempt  to rob it. "Just don't accuse us of getting rich off of state  funds." Germes-Tsentr AB has never seen a single state kopek. It  simply has no need of any. All its considerable capital comes  from its shareholders, 99 percent of whom are "physical  persons": ordinary citizens of Russia and the countries of the  CIS.    [PRAVDA] Vladimir Grigoryevich, you will agree that you are  at the head of a rather strange banking formation: what is a  commercial bank and a people's bank at one and the same time.    [Gribov] Computer analysis of the data on our shareholders  draws a "face" for the bank that is better than any  advertisement--as of our last general meeting, we counted nearly  75,000 shareholders. No single commercial bank in Russia has  anything like it. Three-fourths of Germes-Tsentr's shareholders  hold just 10 shares apiece.    [PRAVDA] Virtually all last year we heard nothing about the  bank. Did you stand aloof that way intentionally?    [Gribov] The shareholders quite fairly have begun to  criticize the bank for this. Naturally, all this time we have  been working actively. And we have earned accordingly. The  results of last year are these: we started the year with a  balance of 5 billion, 26 million rubles [R] and ended with a  balance of over R34 billion. The bank's profit for this period  increased accordingly from R334 million to nearly R5 billion.    That is, we have grown significantly, and all on a shortage  of financial fodder. After all, Germes-Tsentr Bank was founded  less than two years ago, when the credit-financial market in  Russia was actually separated out. The bank's capital stock at  the time came to all of R25 million. According to the effective  legislation, it was formed wholly out of the funds of its  founders. But the founders increased the capital stock from  their own deposits to R100 million.    To this day, the capital stock, which comes to R1 billion  and  $500,000, comes entirely from the shareholders.    [PRAVDA] Every bank has its own borrowers. Who do you extend  credit to?    [Gribov] Last year the bank extended to its clients loans  worth R50 billion. Of these, we gave R22 billion to the Germes  concern, and R26 billion went for loans to other banks.    Germes-Tsentr is addressing itself to extending serious  financing and credit to Russian fuel and energy programs. We  intend to expand our work especially with individual depositors.    [PRAVDA] How might one formulate the principle of growth for  the banking structure more precisely? Even the ordinary  depositor, let alone the "commercial" one, senses that the bank  is growing according to highly complex laws.    [Gribov] Germes-Tsentr is the heart of an entire system of  banks that has to be looked on as a whole. For its part, Germes  possesses an entire complex of independently operating banks:  Tyumen-Germes, Germes-Volga, and Germes-Don, each of which has a  network of branches and offices in various regions of Russia. In  essence, this reflects the basic "Germes" principle: that  exclusiveness, isolatedness, and drawing forces only toward  yourself spell ruin. A bank's exclusiveness within the framework  of a "head" office is highly undesirable. This is why, despite  the enormous expense, Germes-Tsentr is proceeding to create new  branches. In the near future, apparently, offices will be  created in St. Petersburg, Kazan, and Yekaterinburg.    [PRAVDA] Money in Russia moves so slowly and listlessly now  that it must not be easy to be "the heart of a system of banks."    [Gribov] Yes, this is a major disaster--the nonclearing of  payments. Do you remember, during the last days of his  premiership, Gaydar brought Moscow's leading bankers together to  think over together the problem of the transaction system? They  entrusted this to the Central Bank [TsB], but the task was  simply too much for the TsB. A year ago, we put our payments for  oil supplied, say, to Belarus or Ukraine through the TsB, but  since the beginning of last June we haven't run a single payment  to the countries of the CIS through the TsB. I am convinced that  the commercial banks could solve the payments problem themselves.    [PRAVDA] Or clearing centers like the Ekspress system?    [Gribov] Naturally. Those who have come to us have had  pretty  good results. The Germes-Tsentr MAB [no expansion provided]  became the initiator in the creation of the Ekspress system,  which 12 Russian banks and the major commercial banks of the CIS  countries have joined. Transactions do not go smoothly enough  with all countries, but there are no problems on payments with  Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, or Kazakhstan. All transactions with  them go through without TsB participation.    [PRAVDA] Vladimir Grigoryevich, Germes-Tsentr has taken its  payments to shareholders (after the revaluation of shares) up to  nearly 800-percent interest. A very appealing rate of interest,  but does it safeguard shareholders against the grandiose,  Russia-wide confusion, against the economic incoherence?    [Gribov] I'm a banker. And I will talk about what is closer  and more understandable to me as a professional. I am very  disturbed that Russia's banks are for all practical purposes not  making investments. If investments are not made in the country's  industry, it will reach an impasse. Look at the annual report of  any commercial bank. So little is being invested in production  you could cry. I'm ashamed for the banks. And alarmed for Russia.    Yes, the banks would be happy to make investments, but they  cannot risk the money--other people's money, notice, this is  after all the shareholders' money--so improbably. They don't  have the right to sacrifice other people's interests or their  own banking interests either.    I would simply remind you that today's discount rate is 210  percent, and loans are probably no longer made at less than 213  percent. In nature there does not exist a plan that can pay off,  given that crazy loan rate. In essence, the discount rate has  began to generate price increases and inflation. The income that  the RF [Russian Federation] TsB and the Russian budget have  bears an inflationary character.    It is time to make long-term loans for capital investment.  Otherwise, we are never going to be able to straighten out our  distorted economy.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   We are not wasting time--we are moving forward. The youngest  check investment fund in Russia--Germes-Preobrazhenka--plans to  pay its shareholders one of the highest dividends!    The fund's board of directors is recommending to the general  meeting of shareholders:    --approval of dividends, based on the results of work in  1993, in the amount of 300-percent interest calculated from the  date of registration of the second issue prospectus;    --capitalizing the shareholder income with second-issue  shares of the Germes concern AO (joint-stock company),  substituting at shareholders' request with payment in monetary  form.    The meeting will be held on 4 May 1994, at 11 o'clock, at  19a  Kuusinen Street (Polezhayevskaya Metro), Moscow. Shareholder  registration begins at 10 o'clock.    Hurry!    Shares are still being sold!    Addresses of fund stores: 22 B. Polyanka Street, telephone  238-80-55 (Polyanka Metro), and 24 Komsomolskiy Prospect,  telephone 245-02-28 and 247-63-81 (Frunzenskaya Metro)</p>

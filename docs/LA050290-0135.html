			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MITSUBISHI TO TAKE CONTROL OF FLORIDA RENTAL CAR FIRM  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America announced Tuesday that it has agreed to  acquire a majority stake in Value Rent-A-Car Inc. for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi said control of the Deerfield, Fla.  </P> <P> -based rental car firm, which operates 25 rental outlets in six states, would  provide added exposure for Mitsubishi products and good used cars for  Mitsubishi's 416 U.S. dealers.  </P> <P> The sale, scheduled to be completed by May 31, calls for Cypress-based  Mitsubishi Motor Sales to acquire more than 50% of Value's stock and all of the  company's real estate holdings. Most of Value's operations are in Florida, but  the company also has facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana and  Nevada.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Motor Sales, a bit player for most of the seven years it has been  selling cars in the United States, has experienced a sales surge recently on  the strength of a revamped product line. It has advanced to fourth place among  Japanese car companies in this country.  </P> <P> The company imports cars and light trucks built by Mitsubishi Motor Corp. in  Japan and also sells vehicles produced by the Diamond Star Motors plant in  Illinois, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Chrysler Corp.  </P> <P> Fleet sales currently account for about 15% of Mitsubishi's sales, which  totaled 150,476 vehicles last year. That percentage will not change with the  acquisition of Value, the company said. But the portion of Mitsubishi vehicles  in the Value fleet will jump from 10% to 85% by year's end.  </P></p>

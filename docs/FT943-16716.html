			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Property (Australia): They all want a view of Sydney's harbour - Its beauty enchanted Trollope last century. For home seekers in Australia's biggest city, things haven't changed Anthony Trollope, the 19th century British writer, could have made a killing in the Sydney property business. The city's harbour, he once gushed, 'is so inexpressibly lovely that it makes a man ask himself whether it would not be worth his while to move his household goods to the eastern coast of Australia, in order that he might look at it as long as he can look at anything'. More than 100 years later, little has changed. Local estate agents say newcomers still echo Trollope's sentiments, making 'harbour views' their number one demand. 'It's the first thing they all ask for,' says Carl Hall, principal at Farquarsons, a firm of executive rental agents. The industry exploits this preference shamelessly. Advertisements are loaded with promises of 'stunning skyline views' and 'panoramic vistas'  - and such is the length of Sydney's shoreline that many properties do live up to the hype. In the Wentworth Courier, a chunky weekly publication which acts as the real estate bible for anyone house-hunting in the prosperous eastern suburbs, shots of the yacht-flecked waterway almost outnumber photographs of properties themselves. The eastern suburbs, along the south side of the harbour from Potts Point to the ocean, and parts of the lower North Shore, such as Mosman and Hunter's Hill, remain favoured locations commanding top prices. According to the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales, an 'average' house in these areas would have cost between ADollars 475,000 (Pounds 220,000) and ADollars 640,000 in the first quarter of 1994. For the best properties, though, deals of ADollars 1m and up are commonplace. The pursuit of value, however, has caused younger buyers to cast their nets more widely. In the 1960s, for example, they renovated such near-city districts as Paddington and Balmain, turning generous Victorian terraces into streamlined and trendy family homes. Today, Range-Rovers and BMWs jostle for space beneath the intricate iron-work balconies - not always to the delight of older residents. More recently, attention has turned to other run-down but cosmopolitan inner-city areas such as Darlinghurst, Newtown, Glebe and parts of Redfern - once notorious as Sydney's worst slum - where properties of a similar size beckon for a fraction of the price. Travel times into the city are little different and the variety of restaurants and shops is often better. To the south-east, oceanfront suburbs such as Bronte and Coogee have also undergone a revival, although longer distances from the centre and less-than-ideal transport remain a disadvantage. Such trends explain in part the very patchy price movements seen in the Sydney property market in recent times. Until late last year, the city's house values were largely stagnant - although, even then, there were selective pockets where demand from job-secure professionals was pushing prices back to the boom levels of the late-1980s. By late 1993, for example, three-bedroomed terraces in Paddington, less than two miles from the city centre, were changing hands for around ADollars 450,000, little different from the peak prices seen in 1989. Over the past six months, however, most agents have scented a more general upturn in confidence, although many still say that it is only the most desirable properties which are guaranteed an easy, attractive sale. 'It all depends on location,' says one North Shore agent, adding that flats seem to have out-paced houses. Eva Schleisinger, at Bradfield &amp; Prichard's office in Double Bay, the heart of the affluent eastern suburbs - and known to all Sydneysiders as 'Double Pay' for its cost of living - confirms this impression although she is fairly encouraging about values in her area. 'Prices have been gradually creeping up again and are generally close to the boom period of 1989,' she says. But she points out that one factor now absent is the heavy Hong Kong and South African interest, which was a driving force late in the 1980s. In the rental market, the picture is more consistent. Rents are edging up and harbour views still win hands down. Many agents also say that the established preference among executives for the eastern suburbs over the lower North Shore shows little sign of changing. This, Hall suggests, is partly because of easier access to the airport - which is on the south side of the harbour - and a concentration of good schools. North Shore homes also tend to face south, making them darker than those in the eastern suburbs. 'Europeans seem to grasp this quickly,' he says. But he does admit that the slightly cheaper prices on the lower North Shore sometimes woo the re-locating spouse who is going to spend more time in the home and realises that a more spacious property can be obtained for the same weekly cost. There is another, more practical element. Samantha Richmond, of agent WJ Bridges, notes a frequent request for air-conditioning - something Sydneysiders install rarely despite summer temperatures of 30``C-plus. Accessibility to the city also ranks highly, and this is easier to satisfy. Bridges has on its books a Los Angeles-based banker who is searching for a suitable family home. Used to spending 45 minutes commuting on a good day in California, his first request was for somewhere quiet but within 20 minutes of the city. That would be a standard drive from the eastern suburbs. The improvement in demand over the past six months means that weekly rents at the top of the range can range up to ADollars 2,500 a week although a spacious flat with two or three bedrooms and a couple of bathrooms would cost a little less - perhaps ADollars 1,000 to ADollars 1,200 (a year ago, it might have been ADollars 800 to ADollars 900). A house with three bedrooms or more would range between ADollars 1,500 and ADollars 2,500. Hall says leases are being negotiated for periods of three to four years, with annual increases of around 5 per cent built in. Anyone paying top whack on the housing front can expect a few extras, like swimming pool or tennis court, although most agents say these facilities are rarely requested at the outset. And if there is direct water frontage, landlords may try to push prices higher still. But such efforts tend to hit market resistance: Hall says he is sitting on a house in Vaucluse, another top eastern suburb, which last changed hands for ADollars 7.8m. Its owner is asking ADollars 3,000 a week rent; so far, there has been no taker. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the Asian rental market in Sydney tends to be slightly different from the European, with executives showing a stronger preference for prestigious flats. This has become increasingly easy to satisfy: the city now offers apartment blocks in the central business district itself, such as the Quay West tower, as well as on the north side of the harbour bridge at McMahon's Point and Kirribilli.</p>

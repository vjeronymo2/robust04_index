			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / FT Guide To The Week 21 MONDAY N Korea atom row deepens The US has cancelled high level talks with North Korea, which were scheduled to take place in Geneva today. The move follows the refusal of the North Koreans to allow International Atomic Energy Authority officials to complete their inspection of nuclear installations. The Authority's board of governors is holding a special meeting in Vienna at which it is expected to decide to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions. Russian partner Russia, the US and several European countries will for the first time hold large-scale joint naval manoeuvres off Norway.  Russia last week announced it was going to join Nato's Partnerships for Peace programme. This aims to draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer to the alliance without extending them the full security guarantees that go with full membership. Global warming The Rio treaty becomes international law, following ratification by more than 50 countries. Signatories undertake to draw up plans for curbing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. Scott inquiry Alan Moses QC, prosecution counsel in Matrix Churchill trial, begins two days of evidence to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into arms exports to Iraq. UK trade figures The visible trade deficit with non-European Union countries is expected to widen to Pounds 800m in February from Pounds 785m in January. Whole-world trade figures for December showed a large increase in imports into the UK and a poor export performance, particularly to the EU. Oscar comes to Hollywood The 66th annual Academy Awards ceremony takes place today. Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List looks the surest bet in years for best film and best director. Also worth a flutter: Tom Hanks for best actor (Philadelphia) and Holly Hunter for best actress (The Piano). Britain this year may be on the outside looking in. Recent victors Hopkins, Day-Lewis and Thompson are re-nominated but not tipped to win. But Wales's Hedd Wynn may triumph as best foreign film. Fading tiger Experts gather in Geneva to try to co-ordinate programmes to stave off the threat of extinction to the tiger. It is estimated that only 5,000 survive in the wild. Holidays Japan, spring equinox national holiday (markets closed). Iran celebrates New Year and puts its clocks forward one hour. 22 TUESDAY Europe strives to expand European Union foreign ministers hold another crisis meeting to try to settle the enlargement row. Norway resolved its dispute over fish last week and is now set to join the Union together with Austria and Scandinavian neighbours Finland and Sweden. However, the applications of all four have been thrown into doubt by Anglo-Spanish objections to proposed changes to the council of ministers voting procedures to take account of the new members. Several compromises are on offer. Croatia accord Leaders of Croatia and the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, which takes up one-third of Croatian territory, are due to meet in the Russian embassy in the Croatian capital Zagreb. The two sides have never formally ended their war, which began in 1991 and spilled over into Bosnia. Russia's envoy Vitaly Churkin, who set up the meeting, hopes to arrange a formal end to hostilities between Zagreb and the Serb separatists, who have close ties with Belgrade. The hope is that widening the scope of the peace will stabilise the region. US economy Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents meet in Washington to review monetary policy. Many analysts expect the Fed to raise short-term rates either immediately or in the next few weeks. The likeliest move is a quarter point rise in the federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent, possibly accompanied by a half point rise in the discount rate, also to 3.5 per cent. More flattering US trade figures are in prospect. Starting with the release of January data today, the merchandise trade report will be expanded to include monthly data on trade in services. Last year the US ran a services surplus of Dollars 55.7bn, partially offsetting a merchandise deficit of Dollars 132.5bn. Japan's spring wage negotiations Japan's spring wage negotiations, starting today, are expected to bring smaller rises in most sectors than last year, holding down consumer demand. Hungary's parliament votes Hungary's parliament votes on legislation regulating the gas industry. It will prepare for privatisation of the five regional distribution companies. The country's balance of payments figures are also due out. Both foreign investment flows and the current account deficit are set to break records. Apprenticeships plan David Hunt, UK employment secretary, is to launch a scheme to raise the number of young people trained to skilled crafts level. Training and Enterprise Councils will run 2,000 prototype apprenticeships. 23 WEDNESDAY Sarajevo roads to open An agreement between Serb and Moslem leaders to allow the limited opening of roads, linking Serb and government-held areas of Sarajevo is due to come into force. The agreement, brokered by the United Nations, is hedged with conditions on the movement of civilian traffic because the two sides have not yet reached a political settlement. The deal bans commercial traffic from a city whose 380,000 inhabitants are dependent on humanitarian aid, but if honoured, it will be an important step towards lifting the 23-month Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital. South Korea and the US South Korea and the US are to discuss reviving their joint military exercise, Team Spirit, following the inability of International Atomic Energy Authority officials to complete their inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities. Look east Euroman Jacques Delors, European Commission president, chairs a brain-storming session at the European Commission aimed at producing ideas for accelerating the political and economic integration of eastern Europe into the European Union. European Parliament The European Parliament begins a two-day mini-session in Brussels. Fraud busters The UK will unveil an initiative to tackle fraud in the European Union at a meeting of justice ministers in Brussels. The plan is for all 12 member states to adopt similar legal measures. UK inflation The retail price index for February will be watched closely for clues as to whether Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has room for a further base-rate cut. The headline inflation rate is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in January. Underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) is expected to fall from 2.8 to 2.6 per cent. Computer at work Details of a computerised database to co-ordinate the digging-up of Britain's road are due to be unveiled at a conference in Birmingham. About 8,000 holes are dug every day to repair or lay cables and pipes. The proposed national register of information on planned street-works hopes to avoid companies digging up the same stretch of road, one after the other. Football Dublin: Republic of Ireland play Russia. Belfast: Northern Ireland play Romania. Glasgow: Scotland play The Netherlands. Stuttgart: Germany play Italy. Holidays Pakistan National Day. 24 THURSDAY Franco-German relations Germany's foreign minister Klaus Kinkel (left) meets France's President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, in Paris. The two sides will doubtless be anxious to smooth over last week's strains in Franco-German relations, following an off-the-record briefing by France's ambassador in Bonn. South Korean President starts three-day visit to Japan South Korean President Kim Young-sam starts a three-day visit to Japan. He is due to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Emperor and Empress, and business leaders. On Sunday, he travels on to China. He will ask Chinese leaders to exert pressure on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections or, if persuasion fails, back sanctions against it. Safety at sea European Union transport ministers meet in Brussels to attempt to finalise plans to combat maritime accidents caused by substandard ships. Emissions standard European Union environment ministers, meeting in Brussels, are expected to approve a directive cutting car exhaust emissions by half. It will apply to new vehicle types from 1996 and to all new vehicles from 1997 and will bring the EU in line with US federal standards. Scott inquiry Sir Nicholas Lyell, UK attorney general, gives evidence to Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry. He will be questioned about the reasons why he agreed to the prosecution of businessmen from the company Matrix Churchill for illegally exporting arms to Iraq, although it is alleged he knew the company had been providing the government with intelligence. US savings and loans The House of Representatives' Banking Committee holds a hearing on the semi-annual report of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of mopping up the 1980s savings and loan debacle. This includes the affairs of Madison Guaranty, the failed Arkansas savings and loan at the heart of the Whitewater controversy. Some Republicans may seek to turn the hearings into a Whitewater probe, but it is far from clear whether this will be allowed. 25 FRIDAY Opec considers oil price Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Geneva amid continuing signs of oil price weakness. Analysts say there would have to be a cut of at least 1m barrels a day in the present Opec output ceiling of 24.52m b/d to have any significant impact on prices. Ugandan poll In the country's first experiment in democracy since 1980, Ugandans start voting for a constituent assembly (to Mar 27). The assembly will endorse a new constitution and clear the way for parliamentary and presidential elections.

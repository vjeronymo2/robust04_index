			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 11 May features the program, "Straight Talk,"  with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest  Maribel Acosta from Cuban television.    In relation to Decree-Law 148, Rodriguez opens the  discussion  by asking: How are we going to identify the money hoarders?  Acosta answers that, "the measures against the money hoarders is  the only popular, truly popular measure of the group of measures  being implemented to heal national finances. This is not news.  It has been clearly stated that the other measures are not  popular measures, that they involve sacrifices, and the people's  understanding is needed."    Acosta adds that other measures cannot be implemented  without  first implementing measures against the money hoarders.  Rodriguez adds that the money hoarders are corrupt, in addition  to being great corruptors.    Returning to how to identify money hoarders, Rodriguez  states: "We would have to check with the authorities as well as  the police. I believe they have been working at this for awhile.  A year ago, I was told certain files were being put together to  identify who these people were and how they operated." Acosta  points out that the decree-law mentions "disproportionate  amounts in relation to legal income."    Acosta adds: "Official reports reveal that 80 percent of the  Cuban population has direct or indirect ties with the black  market, and this is illegal." Rodriguez goes on to say that the  decree tries to confront those "people who are millionaires" and  that these people are well known. Rodriguez adds that in El  Cerro Municipality, "a very modest area, where most of the  neighborhoods are humble, and where most people live even below  a modest level," he witnessed a money hoarder's son receive  privileged treatment and found it offensive.    Rodriguez stresses that "this virus is an ulcer that is  almost becoming a social class" and is developing its own  corresponding ideology. Rodriguez adds that hoarders "live  differently and think differently."    Acosta adds: "Many people have told me that this should have  been done a long time ago. This reveals the essence of the  people's opinion to which you referred. This is the most popular  measure. Therefore, it is necessary to implement this measure  quickly, correctly, in an organized manner, and fairly in every  sense and in every sector, upon whomever it ought to be  implemented because if this is not done and our principles are  not preserved, which evidently this decree is trying to do, then  it demoralizes the people, demoralizes the Revolution, and could  demoralize it to the point of becoming the beginning of a  gradual erosion of power. If the Revolution loses its power,  then the essence of what we are discussing becomes meaningless  -- if measures are not taken against profiteers in a country  were measures of adjustment and strong economic measures are  being taken."    Rodriguez points out that the actions ought to be drastic,  but implemented without fear. He closes by saying: "I believe no  one should be exempt, no matter who the individuals are, and  regardless of their backgrounds. I believe the law has to be  applied to anyone who has acted illegally, has become wealthy  illegally -- the decree specifies this clearly -- not only  through theft and illegal operations, but also through  embezzlement within state entities or entities with links to the  state. I believe there are going to be such cases. If this is  done thoroughly, it is likely that such cases, which we might  even lament, will come up."</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MOLESTATION SUSPECT SLAIN IN MEXICAN JAIL  </P> <P> A Ventura man jailed on child sexual assault charges was found stabbed to death  in his cell at La Loma prison in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, authorities said.  </P> <P> Federal judicial police say William Lee Heigel's body was discovered early  Saturday.  </P> <P> Raul Villegas, group leader for the State Judicial Police, said a preliminary  inquest indicated that Heigel died of multiple stab wounds to the neck,  shoulders, back and chest.  </P> <P> Villegas said Heigel was attacked with a machete by a man sharing the cell. The  suspect was identified as Cresencio Hernandez Tovar, 35.  </P> <P> Heigel, 43, was a convicted sex offender who was first arrested for molesting  boys in 1965. Officials said he had an IQ of 60. He spent much of his life in  California mental institutions and later in prisons for sex crimes.  </P> <P> Mario Trejo Constantino, head of Nuevo Laredo Ministerio Publico, said Tovar  told investigators that he had been sleeping when Heigel started kicking him  and a fight ensued. Officials don't know how Tovar got the knife, Trejo  Constantino said.  </P> <P> Tovar is serving a 22-year sentence for several offenses, including aggravated  sexual assault and robbery.  </P> <P> Heigel came to the attention of Mexican authorities several months ago in  connection with a series of sexual assaults on young boys in different cities.  He was arrested April 30 in Nuevo Laredo as he stepped off a bus from Mexico  City.  </P> <P> He was detained by police after they discovered pornographic photos of boys in  his luggage. A federal judge in Nuevo Laredo ordered Heigel held for medical  observation at La Loma.  </P> <P> Trejo Constantino said Heigel admitted to having molested as many as 50 boys  under the age of 12 over three years.

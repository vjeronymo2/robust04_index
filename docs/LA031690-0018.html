			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD  </P> <P> The Carlsbad Unified School District board of trustees has agreed to pay a  suspended teacher's aide $10,000 in exchange for his immediate resignation, a  district official said.  </P> <P> Gregory Tirona also gave up all legal claims he might have against the  district, including wages, benefits and future employment rights.  </P> <P> Tirona was accused of selling steroids to three students in late 1988. His  trial ended last month with the jury hung 11-1 for acquittal. He will not be  tried again.  </P> <P> "It's a closed case right now," said Gerald Tarman, the school district's  personnel director. "There's agreement on both sides."  </P> <P> The agreement was signed by Tirona on Monday and was subject to the board's  approval Wednesday at a closed hearing.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the board fired Tirona after a 30-day suspension. Wednesday's  agreement frees the district from possible lawsuits by Tirona.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TACTICS OF OPERATION RESCUE LEADERS  </P> <P> Almost as offensive as Operation Rescue's "abuse of the heroic moral tradition  of civil disobedience" ("Impersonating Integrity," editorial, Aug. 31) is its  use of what Orwell could have included in his definition of "doublespeak" in  the courtroom and any other public forum its leaders can get their misguided  hands in. In Operation Rescue's doublespeak, family practitioners become  "abortionists" and "baby killers." Family health clinics become "killing  factories" and "abortionaries."  </P> <P> The Pentagon calls MX missiles "peacekeepers." And though we may even follow  the logic of that phrase, it is still harmful. It is a very subtle and  deceitful way of molding the way the public thinks and feels. Words are  powerful tools. If we all call bombs "peacekeepers" long enough, maybe we'll  forget that people will be hurt and killed by them.  </P> <P> Judge A. Wallace Tashima should be praised for his intolerance of Operation  Rescue's doublespeak in his courtroom.  </P> <P> R. FANALI  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

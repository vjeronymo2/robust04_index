Sha'ul Gutman said their  main policy plank would be transfer of the Arab population. He  claimed the existing party, under Rehav'am Ze'evi, no longer  represented this policy. The new group is to be led by Miryam  Lapid of Hebron, who lost her husband and son in a terrorist  attack.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 25 January adds  that "the new movement is called Peace Guard [mishmeret shalom],  and transfer is its motto."]</p>

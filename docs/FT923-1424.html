			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (1): Centre of attention - Atlanta and the state of Georgia are among the US's most dynamic centres. Recession has meant job losses, but the award of the 1996 Olympics reflects continuing confidence For the next four years much of the commercial and political life of Georgia, and its capital Atlanta, will be dominated by the fact that in 1996 Atlanta will play host to the Olympic Games. For a brief few weeks it will become the centre of global attention. It is a measure of how far Atlanta has come in the past 30 years - economically, politically, socially and culturally - that its bid for the games was successful. in the 1950s it was but one of several large, provincial cities in the backward and racially divided American south. Today it is the undisputed economic capital of the region, with a well deserved reputation for harmonious race relations. Its post-modern skyline, huge airport, efficient motorway network, underground railway and shopping malls have made it the pre-eminent symbol of the economic rise of the 'New South'. But the coming of the Olympics also points up several intertwined social and political problems facing both the metropolis and Georgia. And the games highlight the distance Atlanta yet has to travel to the goal it proclaimed for itself a decade ago - that of becoming the 'next great international city'. This is a vague concept, but its essential ingredients would appear to include the economic dynamism, self-assured character, cultural sophistication and global communications links necessary to attract foreign investors and overseas visitors in huge numbers. There is no doubting Atlanta's economic dynamism. The metropolis boomed uninterruptedly from around 1977 to 1990 as the south-east enjoyed growth much faster than the national average, thanks to migration from other parts of the US, lower resource and labour costs and its spanking new infrastructure. The region is now emerging with painful slowness from a severe, 18-month recession. Still, most economists expect both Atlanta and Georgia to enjoy a growth level in the 1990s somewhat better than the national average even though the boom times of the 1980s may not return. The communications infrastructure of the metropolitan area is also impressive, as befits a city which has been careful to remember it owes its origins to a felicitous geographical position, at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains, making it an important 19th century railway centre. Arguably the most crucial single factor in the post-war Atlanta boom was the city's recognition that it needed to reinforce its position as a communications hub by repeatedly expanding Hartsfield airport, now one of the largest and most modern in the world. To that has been added a system of freeways and a fibre optic telecommunications network that could prove as important to the city in the 21st century as air transport has been in the 20th. Culturally too, Atlanta has come a long way. Its sky-line is now one of the more architecturally interesting in the US; it has numerous fine restaurants; the permanent collection in its High Museum of Art, opened nine years ago, may not be of the finest, but its periodic exhibitions are stimulatingly original. None of this means Atlanta can yet rival New York, Chicago or Los Angeles in sophistication. But time and money may eventually do the trick. What is more in question is Atlanta's personality and self-assurance, an issue underlined by controversy over the cartoon mascot the city has chosen as its Olympic symbol - a jolly, worm-like blue blob. Its promoters say the blob has the advertising advantage of being able to assume myriad different shapes. Opponents argue that this is precisely its weakness: it reinforces Atlanta's image as a faceless, money-grubbing centre and fails to project what remains of its distinctive southern character. Some observers argue that the city's doubts about its own character and purpose are revealed by its tireless self-promotion and its sensitivity to outside criticism. 'Atlanta is still trying to overcome an inferiority complex of being southern,' says Professor David Sjoquist, of Georgia State University. 'It always wants the biggest and the best.' Paradoxically, however, it is Atlanta's achievement in defusing that greatest of historic southern problems - the race question - which constitutes one of its most important defining characteristics and achievements. Relations between the races are almost certainly far better here than in any other American city of comparable size, north or south. This is not to say that all is sweetness and harmony. The races do not mix much socially and there is constant stress between the black politicians, led by Mayor Maynard Jackson, who run the predominantly black inner-city core of Atlanta and the whites who run the predominantly white, wealthy suburbs to the north and east. But Atlanta's black politicians and white business elite realised as far back as the 1940s that racial co-operation was a key to economic growth. The relative liberalism of the city's (but not the state's) white power structure during the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, which had Atlanta as its base, was also crucial in drawing outside investment to the region. Hence the slogan, 'the city too busy to hate'. The partnership has been helped by Atlanta long having a large, black middle class and the nation's greatest concentration of black institutions of higher learning. This, coupled with its liberal racial attitudes and growing economy, has made the city a mecca for ambitious blacks throughout the US. However, Atlanta's core contains the same problems of black deprivation as other American cities, with the usual attendant drugs and crime. Atlanta regularly competes for the title of 'murder capital of the US' although the small size of the city, relative to the surrounding suburbs, means such statistics over-dramatise the problem. There is a danger, then, of Atlanta becoming a city permanently divided into a white/black college-educated middle class and an underclass. It is, however, characteristic of Atlanta's can-do attitude that it is attempting a hugely ambitious solution to the problem, being closely watched for possible national lessons. This is former president Jimmy Carter's Atlanta Project, which aims to mobilise tens of thousands of volunteers to tackle inner-city problems The plight of the ghettoes is one of the most important confronting Atlanta, but there are others. They include a potential shortage of water supplies and a need to improve the quality of its primary and secondary education. The city's once frosty political relationship with rural Georgia, which still dominates the state legislature, is now more harmonious: the rest of the state better appreciates the economic benefits of a metropolis containing only 37 per cent of Georgia's population but generating over half its personal income. But there remains a danger that a lack of political co-operation between Atlanta's black centre and white suburbs will hold back much-needed regional planning on issues such as transport, water and air quality. In this, as in so many other areas, the formidable preparation still needed for the 1996 Olympics will provide an important test of Atlanta's maturity and resolve.</p>

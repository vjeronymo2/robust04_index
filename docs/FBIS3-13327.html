			<p>Language: <F P=105> Pashto </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An abortive attack by the infamous militia of  Karmal-Dostam-Hekmatyar, which was launched last night from the  direction of Qabelbay and Yakatut [east of Kabul] on positions  of the Islamic Army, has been repulsed. A responsible source of  the General Command of Kabul Garrison reported to a BAKHTAR  INFORMATION AGENCY military correspondent that last night's  attack of the infamous militia of Golboddin and Dostam, who have  been disappointed by their continued defeats, met -- as on  previous occasions -- with strong resistance of mojahedin and  the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The raiders were forced to  retreat. As a result of this abortive attack a number of the  infamous militia were either killed or injured, and a quantity  of their ammunition such as 82mm artillery shells, mortar  shells, and rockets have been taken as booty.    In retaliation for the failure of their assault, the  infamous  militia again targeted residential areas. Five residences were  destroyed as a a result of the firing of ten rockets by them.  No loss of life was reported from the rocket attack.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER built on another solid performance at the LME, ending firmer. On chart grounds, the rally should at least be maintained up to Dollars 1,910-Dollars 1,920 a tonne, dealers said. There is little fundamental justification for much further on the upside, although dips are likely to find increased buying interest. London COCOA staged a key upside reversal boosted by the weakness of sterling and some speculative buying in New York. However, dealers noted that some origin selling interest appeared to be emerging, with Ghana said to be hovering around the market. Chicago SOYABEANS resumed Wednesday's weak posture as funds and speculators continued to liquidate long positions, traders said. A large grain firm estimated soyabean acreage would increase to 60m acres, 600,000 acres higher than the USDA's estimate, as rains were hampering maize plantings. New York frozen concentrated ORANGE JUICE futures were down in early trading after three straight sessions of gains amid speculation of a smaller Brazil crop. Brazil reduced its estimate for the 1993-94 orange crop to 282m boxes from a preliminary estimate of 292.8m boxes. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Economics: US recovery concerns in the spotlight THE US economic recovery comes under the spotlight this week. Although last week's non-farm payroll figures were much better than expected, there is a feeling among economists that growth has slowed significantly since the beginning of the year following the spurt of activity that accompanied President Clinton's election. Retail sales on Thursday are expected to reflect the deceleration of growth, with the consensus forecast pointing towards only a modest increase last month. Economists will also be looking for signs that US inflation is under control when the producer prices index is released on Thursday. Mr Stuart Parkinson, international economist at Morgan Grenfell, believes there is too much complacency about US inflation. 'People are assuming it is going to go away, but all the January inflation figures were bad,' he says. In the UK the focus will be on Thursday's Confederation of British Industry quarterly distributive trades survey, expected to show a modest improvement in consumer activity. On Friday the savings ratio for the fourth quarter of last year will be published. This is forecast to have fallen by almost a full percentage point, reflecting lower interest rates. Here are the rest of the week's economic events and statistics. The figures in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists' forecasts.

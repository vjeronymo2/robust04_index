			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Italian inflation falls to 3.6% Italy's inflation has fallen to 3.6 per cent on an annualised basis, the lowest level since September 1969. According to Istat, the state statistics institute, prices in July rose 0.3 per cent compared to the previous month. This is marginally higher than the preliminary figures from Italy's major cities which showed last month's inflation was running at an annualised 3.5 per cent. The current annualised inflation rate is almost one percentage point below that of this time last year. The government has projected year-end inflation will be running at 3.5 per cent and will fall to 2.5 per cent by the end of 1995. A crucial element in falling inflation has been the containment of wage demands but the impact of the recession, at last behind Italy, has also played a part. Robert Graham, Rome Austria's unemployed as a percentage of the workforce was down 0.1 per cent in July month-on-month but unchanged at 4.4 per cent from July 1993, the Austrian social affairs ministry said yesterday. Finland's unemployment rate showed a year-on-year fall in June to 17.9 per cent from 18.1 per cent in June last year, the first such decline since October 1990, Statistics Finland said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christoph Rabe: "The Foreign Trade Structure in </F> China Leaves a Lot To Be Desired"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- The Asia-Pacific Committee of the  German Economy (APA) has directed an urgent appeal to the  government to provide an amount of funds to promote trade in the  Asia-Pacific region that corresponds to this region's  significance. That is the only way the government's Asian trade  concepts can be implemented. Until now, a stronger concentration  of economic and political resources on Asia has never involved  an increase in funds.    As an introduction to the Asia-Pacific Conference of German  Industry due to be held in Bangkok on 25-26 April, the seven  working circles set up within APA have submitted a preliminary  report on their work. On the subject of the "further  development of foreign trade instruments," APA complains  particularly about the case of China. Germany's foreign trade  infrastructure vis-a-vis China, measured in terms of market  potential and the ability to make use of it, leaves a lot to be  desired, says APA.    Despite their heavy commitment, German embassies and  consulates are no longer able to offer proper services to  enterprises involved in Chinese trade. Therefore, APA wants to  see an expansion of the foreign trade structure in the PRC. As  far as the other countries in this region are concerned, the  foreign trade infrastructure in purely quantitative terms  conforms more or less to requirements.    However, APA notes a deficiency in cooperation between  German  diplomatic facilities on the one hand and foreign trade chambers  and missions on the other. Cooperation between the federation  and the laender in the foreign trade sphere also needs  improvement. The Federation-Laender Committee obviously has  only limited possibilities of effectively coordinating trade,  says APA. Germany's politicians should be informed of foreign  trade requirements more clearly and comprehensively. APA notes  with interest that the Economics Ministry will be holding a  hearing on the subject of German involvement in Asia-Pacific  trade and that trade unions are also invited to it.    APA wants to check whether the funds "that are generously  available for East Europe but are not being utilized there"  could be used for Asia-Pacific trade instead. There is also  maneuvering space concerning development aid. According to APA  circle dealing with "political support," this aid still offers  opportunities to promote German business interests without  neglecting development objectives. The training of work forces  from the development countries is also considered expedient.    APA also sees room for improvement in other areas of  training. The personnel currently available for the Asia-Pacific  region are either specialized in a specific country and language  or they possess specific economic and technical qualifications.  But what is required is a combination of both. Therefore APA  wants to see enterprise personnel receive more practical  training concerning all aspects of Asia, and a personnel policy  that is geared more closely to this region. A data bank on  existing educational possibilities, a list of criteria for Asia  specialists, and a job placement service for this region are  also desirable.    To increase German involvement in Asia, APA wants to see  additional "German Centers" erected in countries of key  significance. These centers are an efficient way of providing  the host country with a "clear and comprehensive picture of  Germany's economic potential" and help German firms establish  markets for their products. The Federal Government should,  therefore, coordinate the establishment of such centers and  provide the funds. A "Fund for the Development of German Centers  Abroad" is also feasible.    In addition, to promote German competitiveness in Asia, APA  recommends the following:    -- Harmonization of export control regulations concerning  dual-use goods;    -- Improvement of the Hermes mechanism;    -- An investigation of the use of state consulting services  in the acquisition of projects;    -- Removal of competition barriers when financing exports  within the framework of an OECD consensus;    -- More national and international consortiums;    -- More support for medium-sized industry;    -- Faster European Union [EU] involvement in the development  of the Asia-Pacific region.    The APA circle responsible for matters concerning  competition  views Germany's duty presidency of the EU Council in the second  half of 1994 as a good opportunity to present recommendations  about harmonizing European regulations.    APA has carried out a survey on business opportunities in  selected countries (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,  Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand) to try and establish to what  extent firms and investors are free to set up business there,  what restrictions German firms might be exposed to, how these  countries treat their own citizens who operate businesses, what  kind of tariff and nontariff barriers there are to trade, and  what kind of protection is offered to private property.    The survey revealed that Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia have  the  most liberal conditions. India, Indonesia, South Korea, and  Thailand possess the greatest obstacles concerning access to  their markets. APA wants to extend this survey to Vietnam and  also include the sphere of taxation and finance. Information on  access to all these markets should be available from the  Association of German Industry and the East Asia Association.    In addition, to make matters concerning the Asia-Pacific  region clearer, the East Asia Association wants to publish  informative literature on this region and organize a symposium  in September entitled "Doing Business With Southeast Asia."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "EEA Argument"] </F>   [Text] What position should Norway take in regard to the EU  [European Union] if the outcome of the upcoming referendum is a  rejection of EU membership? The two parties opposed to the EU,  the Christian People's Party and the Center Party, have become  embroiled in a discussion of this matter. The positions taken  confirm our impression that the leadership in both parties is  lacking in political realism. The one who most clearly  demonstrates this is, surprisingly, former Foreign Minister  Kjell Magne Bondevik.    It does not at all come as a surprise when Center Party  leader Anne Enger Lahnstein thinks we should cancel the EEA  [European Economic Area] agreement, even in a situation where  Sweden and Finland become members of the EU, and Norway remains  outside. Bondevik, the Christian People's Party leader, for his  part strongly warns against abolishing the EEA agreement in the  case of Norway remaining outside the EU.    Given the current conditions, it does not look as if a  majority in the Storting can be obtained to support the Center  Party's stance on the EEA issue. It is, however, quite  unrealistic and nearly dishonest when the leader of the  Christian People's Party tries to make the voters believe that  if the referendum goes against EU membership we can just fall  back on the EEA.    Bondevik, too, should admit that we will have a very  difficult and unclear situation in our relationship to the EU if  only Norway remains outside the EU together with Iceland. In  that situation, Norway would have neither the power nor the  authority to determine the further fate of the EEA. Should  Norway say no to the EU, the chances of effecting a continuation  of the EEA in its present form in the ensuing negotiations would  be very small.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TIMING ON HIRING OF CITY ADMINISTRATOR  UNDER FIRE  </P> <P> A proposal to hire a new San Gabriel city administrator on the eve of Tuesday's  City Council election has created a political flap. Two candidates, including  one incumbent, feel the matter should be left over for the new council.  </P> <P> Mayor John Tapp said he hopes the selection will be made by Monday, the day  before the election.  </P> <P> But Councilman Sabino M. Cici, one of the three candidates vying for two  council seats, walked out of a Tuesday meeting where the three finalists for  the position were being discussed, and accused the council of "attempting to  ramrod the selection." Candidate Dominic S. Polimeni said that he, too, is  concerned about the timing of selecting a replacement for Robert Clute, who  announced his retirement in January.  </P> <P> But Councilman Ted R. Anderson, the third candidate, said the three-month  process has not been rushed.  </P></p>

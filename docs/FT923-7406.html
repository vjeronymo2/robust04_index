			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Khmer Rouge accuses UN Khmer Rouge officials yesterday accused United Nations peace-keepers of failing to act over the killing of a guerrilla leader in north-eastern Cambodia, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. 'They claim nothing has been done. . .so now they will seek revenge themselves. Military observers are in place and will try to defuse the situation,' said Mr Eric Falt, a UN spokesman. Phnom Penh government soldiers killed San Boun on August 1 - apparently by a bullet to the back of the head - after he surrendered to them to try to free his wife, who had been taken hostage, Mr Falt said.</p>

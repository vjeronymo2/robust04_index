			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons shocks analysts AN ANNOUNCEMENT that Fisons was withdrawing from one of its key development products prompted the troubled pharmaceuticals company's shares to fall sharply yesterday. The setback in the shares cast serious doubts over the near-term outlook for the company, and for its future independence. The decision to halt development of Tipredane, its anti-asthma product, leaves Fisons with only one drug in the Phase Two development stage and without any apparent prospects for good news. It would appear to set the seal on the company's profits warning last June which prompted the City to revalue the company by some Pounds 690m. In spite of a brief fillip at Christmas when the US Food and Drug Administration gave its approval to Tilade, another anti-asthma treatment, the shares have never properly recovered. Yesterday's slide of 25 to 169p on hefty turnover of 18m shares left Fisons dangerously close to the bottom of the Footsie in terms of market capitalisation. The news surprised analysts, who said only last week that they were told of Tipredane's exciting prospects at a drug conference. The turnround revived old bid talk, with Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals arm of ICI, touted as a possible predator. However, hostile bids have not been a feature of the health sector and Zeneca, when it is demerged from ICI, is likely to have its own worries. Analysts said a fire sale of Fisons' assets might be more likely.</p>

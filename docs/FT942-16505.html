			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Look before you leap - A look at guaranteed equity products and their drawbacks This year's 8 per cent fall in the UK stock market will have rattled some novice investors. Deposit rates are still miserly but the market is living up to its alarming reputation. The investor is between a rock and a hard place. One tempting answer to the problem is guaranteed equity products. The very word 'guarantee' has a comforting ring to it, even when it is not clear who is guaranteeing what or when. And the dangerous 'equity' is defused by its context. But it is worth looking very hard at these schemes before succumbing to temptation. They were an immediate success with savers when launched late in 1992. Building society interest rates were falling. Full-blooded stock market investment was worrying. Here was the ideal compromise. At their simplest, these hybrids offer the investor a fixed percentage of any rise in the FT-SE index, plus a money-back guarantee provided he keeps the bonds for the agreed period, usually five years. But critics pointed out, correctly, that what these bonds actually offered was not the best of both worlds but the second-best. If the market did well over the five-year period , the investor failed to take part fully in its growth. He would have been better off buying an index-tracking unit trust. If the market did so badly that the FTSE was lower at the end of five years than at the start, the investor would have the comfort of his money-back guarantee. But he would have done better by keeping his money on deposit. So, the second generation of guaranteed bonds usually locked in part of the stock market's rise at intervals during the period of investment. If, for instance, the market rose by 20 per cent, someone investing Pounds 10,000 might be able to lock in a profit of Pounds 1,800. Then, even if the market fell for the rest of the five years, he would still walk away with Pounds 11,800 rather than the Pounds 10,000 guaranteed originally. But, of course, there was a price. He benefited proportionately less from any rise in the index than someone who had not opted for the lock-in facility. The precise mechanics of the different schemes vary, and it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between them. Essentially, though, there is usually a trade-off between the extent and flexibility of the capital guarantee, and the degree to which the bond benefits from any given rise in the stock market. Thus, a scheme which guarantees less than 100 per cent of your capital might well give you the full benefit of any rise in the market - sometimes more. That is fine if the market continues to rise. But if it is sluggish, you could find your capital being nibbled away. The schemes with complete and flexible capital protection offer you a relatively limited share in stock market growth. The discrepancy is understandable. Most of the funds provide your capital guarantees by putting the majority of your money on deposit and using the rest to buy FT-SE options or futures, which allow you to benefit from FT-SE rises. The greater the proportion of your investment needed for the capital guarantee, the less is available for the FTSE link. So, the less you can expect to benefit if the market rises. Over the past year and a bit, most funds have offered you progressively less bang for your buck: the promised FTSE participation rates have been falling. Choppy markets have made the options and futures, which normally provide the equity link, more costly. And falling interest rates mean that more of your total investment is needed for the deposit which usually provides the capital guarantee. An alternative type of scheme hopes to achieve the same objective - equity growth plus capital protection - through a different route. It links units in a conventional index-tracking unit trust to a separate capital guarantee. This type, pioneered by Legal &amp; General, has advantages for the higher-rate taxpayer, although the capital guarantee is inflexible. How does the innocent investor decide which - if any - of these schemes to pick? There are several questions you need to ask. How inflexible is the scheme? Can you get your money out before the end of the agreed period? And what are the penalties for doing so. What exactly is being guaranteed? Some schemes guarantee only your net investment after knocking off all charges. If it is only a partial guarantee, what is the most you could lose? Does the guarantee apply only to investors who stay for the full five year? What are the tax implications? In schemes structured as life insurance bonds, tax is paid at basic rate within the fund, but higher-rate taxpayers will have an additional liability. These schemes subject your gains to income tax, rather than capital gains, so you cannot take advantage of your annual capital gains tax allowance (now Pounds 5,800). On unit trust schemes, you will be liable to CGT. How easy is it to check the progress of your investment? A tiny minority are unit trusts and can be found in the normal prices pages. Some will give you a surrender value if you telephone them. With many, though, it is hard to know what is happening to your money. One of the few financial advisers to monitor this market is BESt Investment*. Asked for selections for higher-rate taxpayers which combined high potential returns with good capital protection, it picked the Legal &amp; General Guaranteed Plan (also available in a Pep), the Hypo F&amp;C Protected Capital plus 'A' scheme, and the new Govett UK Safeguard fund. For basic-rate taxpayers, BESt suggested the Save &amp; Prosper guaranteed stock market bond - soon to be re-issued. *A copy of the guide costs Pounds 10: tel. 071-936 2037.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Continental says shake-up plan may offer 'significant' benefits CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier which has been in bankruptcy since late-1990, has filed its revised reorganisation plan with the courts. The new scheme incorporates the potential Dollars 450m infusion from Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texas-based investment partnership. That deal, announced last week, would give the two investors equity stakes of 27.5 per cent each in the reorganised US carrier. In the document, Continental claims that significant potential benefits may be realised from an inter-carrier relationship with Air Canada. It suggests that the principal gains could come in the areas of technical operations and maintenance, commercial synergies, information systems and fleet planning. The reorganisation proposes: That Air Canada could handle some of Continental's engines and components maintainence; That Air Canada could put more focus on Newark airport in New Jersey, a Continental hub, and feed traffic into the Continental flight network; That the two companies could enter a five-year technology sharing agreement, with Air Canada paying Continental a Dollars 3m annual fee. The document also outlines various areas of decision-making at Continental, which would require a 'super-majority' - so that either the six directors appointed by Air Canada or Air Partners would be in a potential blocking position. These would include matters such as material capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset sales. Similar small print in British Airways' proposal to acquire a minority stake in USAir has provoked a storm of controversy, with big US carriers arguing that this equates to control. US rules do not permit foreigners to control a domestic airline. Under the revised reorganisation plan, secured creditors of Continental will generally have their claims restructured, while unsecured creditors will be offered shares in the reorganised airline, plus a share in any cash arising from certain litigation. Air Canada is exploring new options that it says the federal government should look at before it commits any financial aid to PWA, Reuter reports from Ottawa. 'Before the government commits itself to a bail-out of PWA they should sit down with both parties and see if there is not something of interest for the industry,' said Mr Denis Couture, spokesman for Air Canada.</p>

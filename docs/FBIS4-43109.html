			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 11 (AA) -- Sixteen members from an  outlawed organization fighting against the regime in Iran were  captured in Ankara, it was reported on Saturday [11 June].    AA reporter learned that the members of `People's  Mujaheddins' [Mojahedin-e Khalq] were captured after operations  carried out in three different safe-houses in the city,  following tip-offs.    Their request for political asylum was refused by the  Interior Ministry and they were sent to a camp in southeastern  Silopi town to be later expelled.    A high-level official said that Turkey will not allow any  organization working against its neighbours within its  territories, adding likewise the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] organization should not be allowed to work in Iran.

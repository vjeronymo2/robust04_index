			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / German unions dig in: Public sector strike spreads ahead of talks GERMAN public sector unions yesterday responded to the prospect of peace with the greatest show of force so far in their nine-day national strike over pay. More than 330,000 workers were called out as negotiators prepared for today's resumption of talks. 'The strike has worked,' claimed Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV union. 'The employers have returned to the negotiating table on our terms.' Yesterday's promise from Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and chief negotiator for the employers, to improve his previous 'final' offer of a 4.8 per cent increase at today's talks was greeted with guarded optimism in most quarters. He is under orders from Chancellor Helmut Kohl not to send the wrong signals to other, private sector unions still negotiating. Ms Wulf-Mathies warned again that the stoppages would continue until an acceptable result was achieved. Any deal must be approved by a 50 per cent 'yes' vote in a national ballot. Engineering employers, meanwhile, threatened to lock out workers staging further 'warning' strikes in support of their 9.5 per cent pay claim. The fourth round of talks for the country's 4m engineers broke down without result yesterday and without any advance on the employers' opening 3.3 per cent offer. About 45,000 workers - 30,000 in Bavaria alone - joined in warning strikes. Negotiations in the printing industry were formally broken off and token stoppages started immediately. With 50,000 more members on strike than yesterday, the public sector unions brought Frankfurt airport, which normally handles about 100,000 passengers a day, to a complete stop. More than 950 flights were cancelled after fire service workers walked out. While the airport lost an estimated DM5m in landing and take-off charges, the Lufthansa airline said it planned to sue for losses of up to DM40m. Airline officials said US airforce personnel should have been drafted in to cover. Hundreds of buses queued at Dusseldorf airport to carry an estimated 8,000 package holiday trippers to waiting aircraft across the border in Brussels, Maastricht and Amsterdam. The oTV said last night that the strike would be lifted at Frankfurt today, although action would continue at Berlin and Dusseldorf.</p>

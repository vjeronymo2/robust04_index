			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SWEETWATER STANDS TOO TALL FOR MIRA MESA;  </P> <P> BIG GAME: LACK OF HEIGHT DIDN'T LEAVE THE RED DEVILS SHORT IN THEIR 87-68  VICTORY OVER MARAUDERS.  </P> <P> Sweetwater High players do not particularly care that their tallest player,  Carlos Campbell, is 6-feet-4. They are seemingly unbothered that the next  tallest is two inches shorter.  </P> <P> Sweetwater feels it can win it all. Not just the Hilltop Invitational, in which  it will play for the championship at 5:15 p.m. today against Kearny. The Red  Devils think they can win the San Diego Section Division I championship.  </P> <P> No. 10 Mira Mesa (1-3) would be hard pressed to argue. No. 5 Sweetwater (4-0)  defeated the Marauders, 87-68, Friday evening at Hilltop.  </P> <P> "I think we have a good chance," Sweetwater's Joe McDowell said. "But we don't  want to get big-headed. It's still too early in the season."  </P> <P> Early in Friday's game, Sweetwater looked unstoppable. The Red Devils raced to  an 23-8 lead after just five minutes and was in front, 27-14, after one  quarter.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa slowly got its inside game working -- namely Marc Ziegler, who had 21  points and 10 rebounds -- to pull within 54-49 late in the third quarter, but  Sweetwater went on a 14-2 run to re-assume command. An 8-0 run gave Sweetwater  its biggest lead, 78-59, with 3:02 left.  </P> <P> "We just played our strategy like we always play," McDowell said. "We got a  little sloppy, but then we cleaned that up."  </P> <P> McDowell (6-2) had 26 points and 11 rebounds, despite sitting out the final  8:44 of the first half after falling on his right wrist. He said he first  injured it in a physical education class earlier in the day.  </P> <P> John Gilbert (6-2) added 22 points and six rebounds, including four  three-pointers. Campbell had 11 points and six rebounds despite injuring his  lower back in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Off the bench, Sweetwater's Juan Martinez (5-9) had 11 points, including making  five of five free throws. Melvin Rushing (6-0) made eight of eight free throws,  all in the fourth quarter, for eight points.  </P> <P> "The guys coming off the bench was the main factor," Sweetwater Coach David  Ybarra said. "They really stood out today."  </P> <P> Said Campbell, "We've got a real balanced team. We don't depend on just one or  two guys."  </P> <P> Other than 6-4 Ziegler, Mira Mesa had only one other player in double-figure  scoring -- Kal Chatham with 11.  </P> <P> And what of that size disadvantage? Sweetwater outrebounded Mira Mesa, 36-32.  </P></p>

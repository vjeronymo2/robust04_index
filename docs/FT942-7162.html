			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grain price fall sparks sell-off in commodities Commodity markets sustained a long-awaited sell-off yesterday as the drop in grain futures prices in Chicago spilled over into other markets. July coffee futures price at the London Commodity Exchange lost almost Dollars 250 a tonne at one stage in hectic trading. It later recovered to close down Dollars 138 a tonne at Dollars 2,210 a tonne. The nervousness in the commodity markets also affected cocoa which lost Pounds 30 a tonne at Pounds 1,024 a tonne. The fall in price was partly due to speculators and fund buyers taking a breath in their current commodities buying spree. But analysts said the coffee market still looked tight even at these prices and could move higher again. 'Given the magnitude of the rally, the market still seems well supported at these breaks and I don't think we've seen the highs yet,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, softs analyst at Merill Lynch in New York. The coffee market has been pushed upwards by the reluctance of many companies to sell stocks they are holding because they are worried about further price rises. But supply tightness is expected to remain even in spite of the decision earlier this week by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to sell off the rest of the stocks held under their export retention programme. Investor interest in commodity markets has been sparked by the current price rises, which have received a lot of attention in the media. This has added fuel to the recent price spiral. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers said: 'I've never known as much media interest in commodities in all the seven years I've covered the markets as there has been in the past week.' Some of the heat was also taken out of London Metal Exchange trading. There was much less business than in recent stormy days and copper trading became hesitant above Dollars 2,300 a tonne - but metal for delivery in three months reached Dollars 2,305 before a downward reaction set in. By the official close three-month copper was down Dollars 17 at Dollars 2,279.50 a tonne and in late trading it fell again to touch Dollars 2,250. Traders suggested that the market was going through a necessary period of consolidation before making another upward move.</p>

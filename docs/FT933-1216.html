			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (10): Volume rises to record levels - Derivatives / The growth in the use of these complex financial instruments VOLATILE market conditions have helped boost volume in the world's futures markets to record levels this year. Turmoil in the foreign exchange markets, as currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism came under repeated pressure during the past 18 months, has encouraged greater use of derivative products among speculators, for whom volatility represents an investment opportunity, and among companies and institutions persuaded by the swings in the markets of the need to hedge their exposure. The proliferation of these complex financial instruments has attracted the unwanted attentions of regulators, particularly in the US, who fear that the level of systemic risk is growing as a result. However, this year the pressure has eased following a series of reports, for example by the Bank of England, which have adopted a more conciliatory approach towards the derivatives industry. The derivatives market divides into two distinct parts: the over-the-counter market in swaps and options which consists of specially tailored, but often illiquid, instruments created by banks and sold directly to companies and financial institutions; and the highly liquid market in homogeneous futures and options contracts traded and cleared through exchanges. The growth in over-the-counter business has fuelled growth in the futures market - although exchanges have tended to view the growth of OTC business with some suspicion. Banks active in the OTC market use liquid contracts traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange to lay off their risk. Futures exchanges have a number of advantages over the OTC market: they generally offer greater speed, at lower cost. In addition, institutions dealing on an exchange do not take on credit exposure to a counterparty, since contracts are settled through a central clearing house. However, many users prefer to buy products in the OTC market which are specially tailored to suit their individual needs. But the line between these two markets is becoming increasingly blurred, as exchanges try to emulate the flexibility of OTC products, and banks consider ways of replicating the clearing mechanisms of exchanges. The expansion of the world's futures markets has transformed the way financial markets function. Ten years ago there were only a handful of exchanges and a few liquid contracts; now, it is hard to think of any developed cash market which does not have an active futures market attached to it. More than that, futures markets have become more than an appendage of the cash market: frequently, the tail wags the dog. The idea that futures markets drive cash markets can appear disconcerting, or even worrying - for example, some regulators have tried to pin the blame for the stock market crash of 1987 on futures traders. The dominance of futures over cash market trading is partly due to their greater liquidity: volume in S &amp; P futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, is nearly twice the turnover in the underlying stocks. But in many cases futures trading has helped boost liquidity in the underlying cash market. For example, institutional investors are more likely to buy foreign stocks if they know they can hedge or adjust their positions using derive instruments. Futures also demand a smaller outlay than the cash market and allow traders to express more complex market views - for example, to position themselves to gain from a falling market, or from the narrowing of a margin between two markets. Futures markets have grown fast in the last decade, particularly in Europe, where the market only started 10 years ago. According to a recent report by the Group of 30, the Washington-based think-tank, the notional amount of futures traded every year is Dollars 140,000bn. The volume in the OTC market is much smaller, at around Dollars 2,000bn. However, regulatory concerns centre on the OTC market, both because of the intrinsically greater credit risk, and the larger amount of contracts outstanding: G30 estimates notional outstandings of Dollars 4,500bn in the OTC market compared with just Dollars 1,000bn in the futures market. The growth of the swaps and futures markets has consistently surpassed expectations for the past 10 years, and there is some doubt about how much longer such growth rates - still around 40 per cent annually at European exchanges - can be maintained. In particular, many market participants say the US market has now reached maturity in a number of areas. In the exchange-traded market, growth has been supported in part by the steady addition of new products - Italian bond futures, and short-term German interest rates, for example. The array of products available on principal markets now appears virtually complete. Attempts at innovation in new areas - such as insurance futures and swap futures in Chicago - have yet to flourish. While there is no shortage of innovative ideas, it seems difficult to spur further growth in volume from the creation of new products.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         VOLUME ON INTERNATIONAL FUTURES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Number of contracts traded                                             Jan-Dec 1991   Jan-Dec 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chicago Board of Trade                       139,437,140    150,030,460 Chicago Mercantile Exchange                  108,128,604    134,238,555 Liffe, UK                                     38,583,877     71,977,025 Matif, France                                 36,978,966     55,474,238 New York Mercantile Exchange                  40,786,714     47,212,417 BM&amp;F, Brazil                                  18,768,564     35,072,146 DTB, Germany                                  15,369,730     34,842,778 London Metal Exchange                         16,937,909     24,736,920 Osaka Securities Exchange                     33,478,949     21,184,310 Sydney Futures Exchange                       12,496,018     17,557,685 Stockholm Options Exchange                    13,442,850     17,147,096 Tokyo Intl Financial Futures Exchange         15,149,104     15,540,487 Tokyo Stock Exchange                          16,601,899     14,538,717 Tokyo Comm Exchange Industry                  14,949,199     13,585,379 Commodity Exchange, Inc                       15,123,655     12,673,179 Tokyo Grain Exchange                           9,699,883     12,416,671 Simex, Singapore                               6,068,044     12,180,174 Intl Petroleum Exchange, UK                    8,412,689     10,674,803 Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange                 9,494,734      9,275,708 Soffex, Switzerland                            6,971,740      9,258,859 Osaka Grain Exchange                           4,123,743      5,441,392 European Options Exch, Amsterdam               3,469,945      3,856,247  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Futures Industry Association (provided by exchanges); excludes individual equity options  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

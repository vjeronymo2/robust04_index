See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to 7 CFR parts 723 and 1464 set forth in this final rule do not contain any new or revised information collection requirements that require clearance through the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law 99&hyph;272 provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation in rule making contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 15, 1993, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing Quota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 317(a)(1)(b) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year for flue-cured tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The amount of flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity, if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve stock level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 317(a)(1)(c) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(C) of the 1938 Act as the greater of 100 million pounds or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S. cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco by December 1, 1993. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the 1994 crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 288.0 million pounds. The three-year average of exports is 391.3 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 891.8 million pounds (58 FR 11960). Thus, in accordance with section 301 (b)(14)(C), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco is 133.8 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of December 6, 1993, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation had in its inventory 316.8 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred sales). Accordingly, the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 183.0 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year is 496.3 million pounds. However, the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the marketing year beginning July 1, 1994, for flue-cured tobacco is 802.6 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 317(a)(2) of the 1938 Act provides that the national average yield goal be set at a level that the Secretary determines will improve or ensure the useability of the tobacco and increase the net return per pound to the growers. Yields in crop year 1993 did not change significantly from the previous year. Accordingly, the national average yield goal for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year will be 2,088 pounds per acre, the same as last year's level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 317(a)(3) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage allotment for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco is determined to be 384,386.97 acres, derived from dividing the national marketing quota by the national average yield goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 3 percent of the national acreage allotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco of 744 acres is adequate for these purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

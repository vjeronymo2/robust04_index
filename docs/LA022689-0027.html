			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: SOUND TRACK FEVER  </P> <P> If you've read most of the movie reviews, you know how vital it is to avoid --  at all costs -- the hopelessly dumb "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." On  the other hand, the film's sound track is a delight, especially for hard-rock  fans who'll appreciate such high decibel rockers as Shark Island's "Father  Time," Extreme's "Play With Me" and Vital Signs' "The Boys and Girls Are Doing  It." Oddly enough, the record's most infectious potential single is "In Time,"  an ear-catching ballad performed by Robbie Robb. It's especially ear-catching  if you've just listened to U-2's "With or Without You." We couldn't help but  notice a curious resemblance, especially in the lilting melody and ringing  guitar-chord departments. Think Bono would agree? . . . If they gave Grammy  nods to reggae sound tracks, the year's most adventuresome entry would be the  music to "The Mighty Quinn," the upcoming thriller starring Denzel Washington  and Robert Townshend. Due out from A&amp;M Records, the sound track features "I  Gotta Keep Moving On" by UB-40, "Groove Master" by Arrow, "Giving/Sharing" by  Half Pint and "Send Fi Spanish Fly" by Little Twitch. The title cut, performed  by Sheryl Lee Ralph with Cedella Marley and Sharon Marley Prendergast (both Bob  Marley daughters), has new lyrics rewritten (with Bob Dylan's permission) to  fit the plot of the film. . . . And thanks to Rhino Records, a classic live  double album -- "The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival 1976" -- is back  in print. Available in all formats, it offers performances by Allen Toussaint,  Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas and Professor Longhair.  </P></p>

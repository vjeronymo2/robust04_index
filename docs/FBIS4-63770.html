			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Statement at the Ukrainian-Russian </F> Border"]    [Text] Representatives of the command of Ukrainian and the  Russian Federation's troops, Customs services of the two states,  leadership of the ministries of internal affairs, and state  administrations of Kharkiv and Belgorod oblasts met with  journalists at the Ukrainian-Russian border. As is known, after  signing the memorandum on border cooperation between Ukraine and  Russia, some mass media disseminated a "sensation" on the  renewal of the system of single borders of the CIS countries.  It was stressed at the news conference that Ukraine and the  Russian Federation are building their relations on the  principles of friendship and good-neighborly relations and do  not intend to violate the sovereign rights of the close  neighbor. Each side strives to respect each other's state  attributes, including state borders.</p>

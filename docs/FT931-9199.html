			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Marching Romanians call on Iliescu to quit THOUSANDS of Romanians marched through Bucharest yesterday shouting for President Iliescu's resignation in the first workers' street protest against the government which took office in November, Reuter reports from Bucharest. Discontent over dwindling wages, soaring prices and growing unemployment has built up over the past month with a series of strikes and threatened stoppages, as well as quarrels between unions and the government during wage negotiations. Many of the 3,000 workers who massed in Revolution Square in icy weather also shouted slogans demanding bread and pay rises. The protesters, led by the Solidarity 90 trade union federation, are demanding better welfare provision, new jobs and minimum monthly pay of 41,000 lei (Pounds 56) instead of the present 17,300. The marchers carried banners daubed with slogans such as 'Where is the bread?' Romania is facing one of its worst droughts this century, and this year's grain crop could be severely affected, weather forecasters said. The drought is being worsened by a lack of fertilisers and a shortage of fuel and farming equipment. This helped slash Romania's grain crop by 36.3 per cent to 12.3m tonnes in 1992, the National Statistics Board said. An official forecast for the 1993 grain crop was not yet available. Last year, Romania imported 1.1m tonnes of wheat and over 263,000 tonnes of maize to make up for domestic crop shortages.</p>

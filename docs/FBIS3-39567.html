			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Cassell in Belfast, Tim Coone in Dublin </F> and David Owen in London: "Mayhew Maintains Diplomatic Efforts  To Find Ulster Peace"]    [Text] Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary,  yesterday employed further delicate diplomacy to maintain  British government efforts aimed at encouraging all sides to  embrace the peace process in Northern Ireland.    In an article published in yesterday's IRISH TIMES, Sir  Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address  some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing  Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what  could lie beyond a permanent end to violence.    His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir  Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] a  virtual assurance that the Anglo-lrish conference will not meet  while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the  DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the  Northern Ireland secretary indicated "a willingness to suspend"  the conference.    The DUP -- which is boycotting the talks process -- last  week  wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime  minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish  counterpart, on Saturday.    According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that  there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint  declaration as the basis for political talks.    In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated  the  government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and  that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and  commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he  also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by  republicans as being in need of clarification.    His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds.    Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end  to  IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks  "within three months" rather than at the end of a three-month  quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all  terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the  community would include "our ability to manage without troops  being deployed in support of the police and without emergency  legislation."    Sir Patrick said Britain "cannot and will not adopt the role  of persuader for any particular outcome" and that "with or  without" Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: "We  are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search  for widely-based agreement."    In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick  said he wanted to see "substantial devolved powers" in Northern  Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a  unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called  three-stranded talks process which includes the Irish  government. "We cannot revert to a system of government in  Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can  readily identify."    In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the  rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon,  deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said  members of his party were increasingly being singled out as  terrorist targets.</p>

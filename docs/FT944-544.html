			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Boeing wins German orders Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer, has announced orders and options worth an estimated Dollars 692m (Pounds 443m) from German airline customers. Air Berlin, the charter operator, is ordering six 737-800s and one 737-400. It has an option on four more 737-800s, a forthcoming 'next generation' stretched version of the current 737-400. Lufthansa German Airlines has also ordered one 747-400, which will be its 19th 747. Boeing said the purchase breaks a five-year lull in long-haul aircraft orders by the airline. Two other German airlines, Berlin-based Germania and Munich-based Bavaria Fluggesellschaft, have also said they intend to order next generation 737s, said Boeing. Last month Hapag-Lloyd, another German carrier, announced the first 16 orders for the 737-800.</p>

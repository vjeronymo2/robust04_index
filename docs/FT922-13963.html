			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Chemical sector spending falls 13% CAPITAL expenditure by the chemical industry, which is suffering in the recession, fell 13 per cent in 1991 and will fall a further 10 per cent this year. The fall in 1992 spending, predicted today by the Chemical Industry Association, is in spite of record sums being spent by the chemicals sector on environmental protection, and substantial amounts invested by the pharmaceuticals groups on research and development. The association warned that 1992 was going to be another tough year for the UK's chemical industry. Since January, little had happened to improve prospects of an economic recovery either internation-ally or domestically, it said. Moreover, high levels of debt, shortage of capital and the likelihood of continuing high levels of interest rates would mean that the projected recovery would be much slower than that after the recession between 1980 and 1981. The industry's present three-year investment programme of Pounds 5.4bn was down by 22 per cent in real terms compared with the period between 1989 and 1991. The present programme was the lowest since the period between 1984 and 1986, although it was higher than between 1981 and 1983, the association said. Capital spending on plant, machinery, vehicles and buildings would fall to Pounds 1.7bn this year from Pounds 1.8bn in 1991, it said. A small increase to Pounds 1.8bn is expected in 1993.</p>

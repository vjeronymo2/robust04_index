[Words indistinct] an embargo against  the Haitian authorities has failed to do little than hurt the  people of Haiti, and they are fleeing their native country,  flocking to the United States and The Bahamas. In fact, at this  moment a session of the high-level segment of the UN global  conference, Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham spoke of  this influx of refugees, saying it is a burden for his country.    [Begin Ingraham recording] The Bahamas could be faced with  large numbers of illegal Haitian immigrants who continue to pour  into our country, creating excessive demands on our educational,  housing, health, and welfare services, creating unregulated  pressures on natural resources, including water, demands which  we can ill-afford to meet. How can a nation of 280,000 people  reasonably be expected to cope with the problems of millions of  Haitians? Ill-equipped though we are to meet these demands on  resources, The Bahamas is humane in its treatment of Haitian and  Cuban shipwrecked persons. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan, while not an  advocate of military intervention, believes there is no other  solution to the Haitian crisis:    [Begin Jagan recording] I know what military occupation from  imperialist powers has done to a lot of countries, but we have  to look at the dialectics of the whole situation. First,  Aristide was overwhelmingly elected by the people. Second, if he  is not restored to power, it sends a wrong message to would-be  dictators and military upstarts in different parts of the world  because there is a movement throughout the world toward  democratization and this can be endangered if Aristide is not  returned to power. [end recording]    President Clinton has [word indistinct] the support of Ricky  Singh, president of the Caribbean Association of Media Workers,  a nongovernmental organization accredited to the conference. Mr.  Singh says the U.S. threat can be avoided, but he pointed out  that (the other way), Caribbean people, and especially  journalists, have a moral obligation to [word indistinct] the  Haitian people.    [Begin Singh recording] [Word indistinct] have to begin to  interact with Haitian counterparts in terms of promoting a  better understanding among the Haitian and the people of the  rest of the Caribbean. There is a lot of ignorance abroad and a  lot of prejudices among non-Haitian Caribbean people because we  have [word indistinct] over the years all of the ugly  caricatures of the Haitian masses. It is our problem that [word  indistinct] ourselves from that process and beginning to relate  more pragmatically and sensibly to the problems facing the  Haitian masses. [end recording]    So it is now a question of wait and see, to see if the U .S.  will indeed send its troops to Haiti and what will be the  outcome.</p>

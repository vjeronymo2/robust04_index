			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SUDS UP: Beach Beer Inc. of Newport Beach makes beer in Dubuque, Iowa, that it  calls "Trestles Lager," after the South County beach that took its name from  the nearby rail line.  </P> <P> Other surf labels include "Zuma" and "Rincon.". . . Company President Michael  Imeson, who used to surf here as a teen-ager, now works out of Seattle and  hasn't surfed at Trestles in six years. Still, he says he is donating 1% of  Trestles' gross profits for beach protection, "to have some vehicle to make  sure those beaches stay surfable for years to come."

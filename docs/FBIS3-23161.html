'Uwaydat said the investigation is secret and  continuing. A judicial investigator will be appointed in  implementation of the Council of Minister's decision.    Commenting on the REUTER report, security sources said the  authorities in such cases detain many suspects and witnesses.  They added that six women gave testimonies as witnesses and  were then released.    Another security source has categorically denied REUTER's  report, pointing out that the investigation is completely secret  and is being conducted by three people supervised by the  Lebanese Army's intelligence directorate. The investigation is  being shrouded in the necessary secrecy to achieve quick results.    Other sources said that the security authorities have  detained six people for questioning as witnesses, including  three women.    According to available information, the pertinent security  authorities recently detained a non-Lebanese person married to a  woman from Kasrawan district. He frequently visited a religious  leader and asked him for help to get Lebanese citizenship.  Security sources said that this person informed the religious  leader that there was a plan to detonate bombs in various places  of worship, including Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il.  He said he received the information from a Lebanese man.  Instructions were then issued to security forces to keep a  close watch on the places named and search them after securing  permission from the religious authorities concerned.</p>

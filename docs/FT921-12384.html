			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Spending on TV advertising shows first flickers of life: Caution is still the watchword from the industry's executives in spite of an increase in revenue IS TELEVISION advertising revenue telling us something the government desperately wants to hear - that the end of the recession can be spotted in the distance, drawing slowly closer? No one in the television world is yet prepared to stick a neck out and announce even the beginning of the end of a long period of gloom. In a community more given to razzmatazz than analysis, caution is still the watchword when it comes to forecasting trends in advertising revenue. Nevertheless, the last month has seen a considerable uplift in television advertising revenue. Senior members of the Independent Television Association point out that the level of advertising expenditure has in the past often been a useful indicator of which way the UK's overall economy is headed, and that television advertising is a particularly sensitive barometer. Mr Malcolm Wall, chairman of the association's marketing committee and sales director of Granada TV, said that this January's revenue 'will be up on that for January 1991 by in excess of 12 per cent, taking us, both ITV and Channel 4, to some Pounds 114m'. He puts that into perspective - the January 1991 figure was historically low at Pounds 102m, far short of the figure for the same month in 1989 and 1990, which was Pounds 123m in both years. Mr Wall said the UK's commercial television networks had 'been badly hit by the recession, although we had a good final quarter in 1991, up 10 per cent on one year ago'. He added: 'I expect to see a continued recovery in the first half of this year, with perhaps 3 per cent to 4 per cent growth in real terms above the retail prices index.' That is good news, but hardly begins to catch up with declines, in real terms, of 5 per cent in 1990 and perhaps 3 per cent in 1991. According to Mr Peter Battle, sales director of Ulster TV and chairman of the association's revenue forecasting committee, 'there have been two years of appalling drops in real terms in an area where there was formerly unbroken, continuous growth'. But he also detects a notable uplift in TV advertising revenue in the past nine months. 'Take 1991: advertising revenue in television was down by 6 per cent to 9 per cent in the first six months; in the third quarter, down further by about 1.5 per cent. But the fourth quarter was substantially up, and there isn't much doubt that the first quarter of 1992 will also be substantially up.' Mr Battle says the trend is comforting but should not be exaggerated. Mr Dominic Proctor, managing director of the UK's largest advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP group, also counsels caution. He said: 'We are forecasting marginal growth, but we are certainly in for another hard slog this year. The possibility of a double election is a horror, since companies tend to freeze their spending during an election period.' Mr James Best, chairman of the BMP DDB Needham advertising agency, said: 'March will be the real litmus test. Our feeling is that January and February this year are special cases since those months last year were so bad. We have some 50 clients, and the mood we have from them is that they are not prepared to pump-prime the economy but are instead waiting for the consumer to set the trend. It's too early to put out the flags.' If the advertising sector overall is still stuck in the doldrums, some research published tomorrow by Carat, Europe's largest media planning and buying specialist and part of the Aegis group, seems to confirm that television is doing rather better. It indicates that, across Europe as a whole, television advertising revenues in 1991 showed a real increase of 5.8 per cent, in a year when total media advertising fell by 0.9 per cent in real terms. Television's share of total European display advertising reached 33.4 per cent last year, overtaking newspapers - which in 1991 had 30.4 per cent of the market - for the first time. That gap will probably widen over the next two years. The growth of television advertising, in the UK at least, may be at the cost of newspapers. The Newspaper Publishers Association has been conducting an advertising campaign since October designed to persuade advertisers that print works more effectively than the small screen. The NPA's campaign has sniped at television, suggesting that viewers pay scant attention to screened commercials, more to advertisements in print. According to the latest estimates of the Advertising Association, total press advertising fell by slightly more than 7 per cent in the first nine months of 1991. For newspapers there is, as yet, little sign of the sort of recovery which television is - momentarily - enjoying.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: West African rice boom poses problems for researchers - A deepening funding crisis is hampering efforts to boost indigenous production RICE IS booming in West Africa, with a growing number of people switching from traditional cereals, which take hours of preparation, to opt instead for a food they can put straight in the cooking pot. Once considered a luxury, rice has become the chief staple food and major source of calories for some 70m of West Africa's 200m people. Output in the 17 countries that make up the region has risen by more than 5 per cent a year since 1980, doubling to a record 6.6m tonnes last year, the highest increase for any of the major cereal crops. The popularity of rice in West Africa, particularly among urban dwellers, means that consumption has shot up at an even faster rate than output, exceeding 9.5m tonnes in 1992. Some 3m tonnes had to be imported last year at a cost of Dollars 600m, putting a severe strain on scarce reserves of foreign exchange. While countries in the region are trying to encourage yet higher output, and cut down on imports, farmers are facing a number of problems that could put a brake on expansion. Rice is still a relatively new crop in West Africa and high-yielding varieties suitable for the region have yet to be developed. A research institute, the West Africa Rice Development Association, based in Bouake, Ivory Coast, which is trying to develop improved varieties of rice and encourage sustainable farming practices, is facing a funding crisis. Warda, which was set up in 1970, was recently forced to close one of its stations in Sierra Leone because of the withdrawal of funds by USAid, The US government aid organisation. Two other research stations, at Bouake and at Saint Louis in Senegal, are down to skeleton staffs. The World Bank, one of Warda's largest donors, last year cut its annual funding from Dollars 1.785m to Dollars 1.5m, while the European Community slashed support from Dollars 532,927 to Dollars 324,000. Only two of the regions's 17 countries contributed funds for Warda's research, despite their interest in producing more rice from their own fields. 'If the countries who spend so much money importing rice, divert only a tiny fraction for us to do research it would help solve the problem,' said the association's director-general, Dr Eugene Terry. A panel of rice experts that conducted a review of Warda's work said that it had been 'reduced close to the level of critical mass, and in some aspects may already be below it. This is an extremely serious and urgent situation'. Most rice in West Africa is not grown in Asian-style paddies but by small farmers in upland areas without the benefit of irrigation. Africa's existing upland rice varieties are hardy but yield less than a tonne per hectare, compared with a global average of about 3.5 tonnes. Upland farmers in West Africa who apply fertiliser are averaging more than two tonnes a hectare, but fertiliser is not widely available. When Warda was first established, it concentrated on adapting high-yielding rice varieties developed in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere to West African conditions. It was hoped that these varieties could give Africans the benefits Asians were enjoying. But Warda admits that this approach proved 'misdirected'. In the hot dusty winds and extreme temperatures of West Africa the Asian varieties fared badly, and researchers are now trying to improve local varieties. Higher yielding varieties could have an important environmental spin-off, enabling farmers to allow longer fallow periods in between rice cultivation. Much of the expansion of rice output in West Africa has taken place because farmers have shortened these fallow periods, but at the risk of serious land degradation. Researchers point out that provided the right varieties can be found there is considerable potential to expand the output of rice from West African inland valleys. These valleys cover about 19m ha, and rice now only grows on about 5 per cent of them.</p>

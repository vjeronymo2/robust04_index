			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 19--The swadeshi hardliners in the  BJP forced the party to retain a crucial clause in the economic  resolution on the Dunkel draft which called for the "total"  rejection of proposals aimed at expanding the scope of the  General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT).    The original draft which had incorporated the clause was  dropped after being screened by a few party general secretaries.  When the draft was put before the BJP national executive, many  members stood up to press for the complete opposition to the  proposed GATT treaty.    The leaders who were in favour of the party adopting a  "middle of the road" attitude over the Dunkel draft found  themselves isolated and the majority opinion prevailed. Members  argued that the party could not afford to take a wishy-washy  attitude over the draft in view of the strong line adopted by  other Opposition parties over the issue.    A few voices which spoke in favour of advocating a partial  opposition to the Dunkel proposals were heavily outnumbered. The  final draft which was presented to the Press had been worked out  by party general secretaries, Mr Pramod Mahajan, and Mr K.N.  Govindacharya and the convenor of the BJP economic cell, Mr Jay  Dubashi.    The discussion on the Dunkel proposals could not be expanded  to include other contentious issues regarding the party's stand  on liberalisation, but many in the party who feel that swadeshi  should be taken in a big way, welcomed the view of speakers  calling for strong reaction to the Dunkel proposals. Leaders who  have been known to have differences with swadeshi hawks who  believe that foreign capital should be treated with extreme  caution were conspicuously silent.    The resolution on the Dunkel draft is the only concrete  document that the party has adopted. The two other documents are  in the nature of poll analysis. The party had previously limited  its opposition to the Dunkel draft proposals dealing with  agriculture, but has now announced its total rejection of the  move to globalise trade and lower tariffs.    The senior party leader, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, who  addressed the Press today, denied that the party had belatedly  woken up to the dangers of the Dunkel draft's proposals. "We  have been speaking on the agriculture-related before and now  that the government has failed to protect our interests, we have  decided to take up the issue," he said.    The resolution states that the government's acceptance to  the  officials-level agreement over the GATT treaty amounted to  sacrificing the interests of the country. The day on which the  agreement was signed would go down as a "Black Day" in the  nation's history.    The rich nations have used their economic muscle to ride  roughshod over the interests of the poor nations and the  proposed treaty would keep the Indian consumer at the receiving  end of powerful multinational corporations, the resolution  states. The Third World was once again facing the threat of a  new type of colonial aggression, it emphasised.    The resolution attacks the Union commerce minister, Mr  Pranab  Mukherjee, for having stated in Parliament that India had not  been able to stand up to the pressures exerted by the US and the  European union. While the South Korean Premier had tended in his  resignation at being unable to protect the country's commitment  not [to] allow rice imports, the P.V. Narasimha Rao government  had virtually opened the entire economy.    The statement also points out that the prices of food would  rise and the buffer stock would be under threat. Giving an  example, the resolution states that China has increased its  exports manifold and enjoys a trade surplus. However, reports  today said that China has accepted all GATT conditions needed  for it to rejoin the negotiation process.</p>

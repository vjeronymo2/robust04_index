Ukraine is the  Slovakia's only neighbor possessing strategic nuclear weapons.    Slovakia considers documents on removing nuclear weapons  from  Ukrainian territory signed by Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President  Bill Clinton to be an important step on the road towards  complete nuclear disarmament, the statement said.    Under the Moscow agreement, Ukraine is to rid itself of all  176 nuclear missiles and of almost 1,600 nuclear warheads in  exchange for aid amounting to one billion U.S. dollars.    "We consider this fact proof that even in complicated social  and economic conditions, it is possible to find compromise  solutions in the interests of stability and security in Europe.  Such an approach could serve as example for other states in  solving other important problems," the statement said. It  voiced the conviction that all the countries concerned will  create the conditions necessary for practical realization of the  documents signed and for fulfilling obligations ensuing from the  Strategic Arms Treaty (START-1) and the Lisbon protocol.</p>

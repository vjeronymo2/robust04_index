			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ECONOMIC GAP BODES ILL FOR U.S.'  </P> <P> Regarding the first in a series on "Poverty in America" the statement by the  article's authors that most Americans are unmoved by the poverty within their  country and that "Americans as a society apparently have chosen to tolerate  this level of poverty" is an astounding misinterpretation of the facts. A more  accurate assessment of the situation would be that most Americans, themselves  living so close to the edge, are gravely concerned about the plight of those  less fortunate among us, but are at a loss as to how to deal with so monumental  a problem.  </P> <P> In the past, whenever this nation has been faced with a crisis of such grave  proportions, citizens looked to the federal and state governments for the  leadership to solve such problems. Today, Americans have come to realize that  many of the officials currently walking the hallowed halls of our state and  federal capitals are the problem. These officeholders are totally out of touch  with the general population and as a result, they continue funding programs the  American people don't want.  </P> <P> One of the only solutions to this problem is for people to vote those whom they  feel do not represent them out of office. Unfortunately, most Americans don't  believe their vote counts for much these days.  </P> <P> DEBORAH BLAIR PORTER  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

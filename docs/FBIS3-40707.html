			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Creating a Frankenstein"] </F>   [Text] Having failed to read the signals properly when on  November 9, 1993, Ms Barbara Bodine, acting co-ordinator for  counter-terrorism, US, spoke to the National War College in  Washington DC about the dastardly attacks of the Kurds in  various cities, the criminal conspiracy to assassinate President  Bush in Kuwait and terrorism in various parts of the world  leaving out conveniently Pakistan without a mention, India has  done well not to respond to the latest US gimmick of dropping  the Pressler Amendment against Pakistan. It is nothing but a  gimmick to draw India into a bilateral dialogue between the  United States and Pakistan. By choosing to ignore the bait India  has done well. Any response or resentment by India would have  drawn the country into what is essentially a bilateral issue and  equate its own position to that of Pakistan, that being the  original bait, thus getting trapped into the dragnet of US  strategic policy to work out a nuclear understanding in the  South Asian region. India's reluctance to sign the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty due to its discriminatory character has  been a bugbear with US defence and strategic analysts. The US  approach to the nuclear issue encapsulates two worlds, the  have's and have nots--the distinction being made on the grounds  of who exploded the nuclear bomb before 1967 and those who did  so afterwards. Instead of protecting the weak and the have nots,  the US policy discriminates against them and expects all their  facilities to be placed under the International Atomic Energy  Agency inspection regime; no self-respecting sovereign country  could be expected to toe this line willingly. What is most  diabolical about the treaty is that though it expects the have  nots to sign the treaty, the treaty per se does not  contain any clause that extends help and protection to the  suffering nation in the event of an attack by a nuclear power  nation. Aware of India's growing economic and scientific clout,  also aware of India's reluctance to sign the NPT, the United  States is now using its cat's paw, Pakistan, to enmesh India in  a regime which will satisfy its strategic needs.    From being on the brink of being labelled as a terrorist  state to the dropping of the Pressler Amendment against it,  Pakistan has proved to be a mere pawn in the strategic games  that US plays in South Asia. The Pressler law proscribes  military sales and economic aid to Pakistan till the US  President certified that Pakistan was not making nuclear  weapons. What new and objective evidence has the US pounced upon  in the last six months that it is willing to drop the Pressler  law against Pakistan? If anything, the evidence pointing to  state sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is only mounting. More  than 20,000 people have died in Punjab and the toll is around  7,000 in Kashmir till now, and the contribution of Pakistan to  this death and gore is very critical. The bomb blast in the New  York Trade Centre is child's play when compared to the mayhem  created in Bombay this year. Again, it was Pakistan which had a  lot to explain for such happenings. All these would not have  happened but for the funding, safe haven, and logistical support  provided to terrorists by Pakistan. While the US recognises the  large pool of operatives from Afghanistan working in the Middle  East and the former Soviet Union, it turns a Nelson's eye to the  most compelling evidence as to Pakistan's nefarious activities  in the Indian sub-continent. The US policy has, from time to  time, proved to be quite thoughtless having created  Frankensteins wherever it operated. This was the case with the  World Trade Centre conspiracy, this was the case with respect to  Iraq and many more such examples can be given relating to UK,  Germany and France. By choosing to play around with countries in  the sub-continent, the US is again at its game of pitting one  country against other, to garner valuable benefits for itself.  The dropping of the Pressler law against Pakistan will lead to a  fresh bout of arms purchase by both, Pakistan and India. This  can only upset the economic reforms programmes being put in  place by them and also put the peace process of the entire South  Asian region in jeopardy. Should any such development occur, the  responsibility will rest solely on the United States of America.</p>

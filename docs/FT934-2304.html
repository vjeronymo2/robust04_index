			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Ukraine tightens grip on its N-arms The nationalist victory at the Russian polls has left Ukraine's 52m citizens nervous about the future of their newly independent state, and could further stall Ukraine's stated intention of becoming a non-nuclear power. For many leaders and politicians, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's strong showing is a concrete sign that Russia poses a real territorial threat. 'Our feelings have been justified,' Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, head of the parliament's foreign relations committee, told Ukraine's most popular newspaper. 'I think it should now be clear to many in the west why we have taken such a position on disarmament.' In the face of strong international pressure Ukraine is standing firm on its demands for security guarantees and fair financial compensation for the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads it transferred to Russia last year and for its 1,656 remaining warheads. Kazakhstan's ratification on Monday of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has left Ukraine as the last of the former Soviet states outside Russia to renounce its nuclear status. Though President Leonid Kravchuk has promised to resubmit the Start-1 and NPT treaties to the new parliament after elections in March, the new rise of Russia's radical right goes to the heart of why Ukraine is reluctant to send its 176 strategic missiles to its unstable neighbour without achieving western security guarantees in return. 'It is reason to hold on to the weapons in parliament and will push us to a more anti-Russian position,' said Aleksandr Charodeyev, a pro-Russian parliamentarian from the eastern coal mining region of Donetsk. 'Zhirinovsky's victory only strengthens nationalism within Ukraine. There is a great danger that there could be two nuclear powers with nationalist tendencies pitted against each other. This is a deathly, dangerous threat on a planetary scale.' Ukraine's military experts acknowledge that their missiles are long-range, designed to hit targets half way around the globe and cannot be aimed at near-by Moscow. Also, Ukraine has no operational control - Russia still controls the 'red button' and targeting codes. Many Ukrainians nevertheless perceive that their missiles somehow protect their borders against invasion. Mr Kravchuk himself has so far adopted a 'wait and see' attitude on the Russian election, but he did say yesterday: 'I can't agree with the indivisible Russia extending to its February 1917 borders. If this turns out to be the official state policy of Russia, then we will come out with a reaction.'</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Package holiday industry set to escape monopolies probe The Office of Fair Trading is expected to announce this week that it will not refer the package holiday industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The announcement will follow a 13-month OFT inquiry into complaints by small travel companies that they were finding it difficult to get on to travel retailers' shelves. Independent companies said they were being hampered by the strong links between the biggest tour operators and travel agents. The OFT also investigated the large tour operators' practice of giving travel agent staff financial incentives to sell their holidays. The OFT is thought to have concluded, however, that there is no need for further inquiries by the MMC. The expected announcement will be welcomed by Thomson and Airtours, the two largest travel groups, which have argued that the industry is highly competitive, selling foreign holidays to an increasing number of consumers at low prices. Independent operators are hoping that, in the absence of a referral to the commission, the OFT asks large groups for undertakings to treat smaller companies fairly. Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain. Airtours owns Going Places, the second largest. The two retail chains are currently engaged in a price-cutting skirmish, selling summer 1995 holidays at discounts of up to 15 per cent. Lunn Poly has argued that far from using its market dominance to drive up prices and deprive consumers of choice, the cost of foreign holidays had actually fallen over the past year. It said the average price of a summer holiday booked by Lunn Poly by the end of June this year was Pounds 353, compared with Pounds 356 last year. Lunn Poly said last week that it currently sells the holidays of 147 travel suppliers. The three largest operators - Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad  -are given only 33 per cent of the racking space in the Lunn Poly shops. It said the remaining space was occupied by brochures from travel suppliers who account for only 30 per cent of sales. It added: 'Far from being undersupported, small tour operators are allocated far more shelf space than their proportion of sales would justify.' Small tour operators have argued, however, that large travel retailers demand higher commissions from them than from leading operators. Thomson buys into UK market, Page 17</p>

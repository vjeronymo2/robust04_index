			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> INJURED SAMPRAS QUITS WEMBLEY CONTEST, MAY SKIP ATP FINALS  </P> <P> U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras withdrew from an indoor tennis tournament today  with shin splints and said he may have to skip next week's ATP Finals in  Germany.  </P> <P> "The situation is that my shin is as bad as it's ever been and I can't move to  the ball like I'd like to," Sampras said.  </P> <P> "If it stays as it is now, Frankfurt is up in the air."  </P> <P> Sampras, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., who had been scheduled to play  Christian Bergstrom in a second-round match today, said that he had experienced  throbbing pain in his left shin for several days and that it was getting worse.  </P> <P> Sampras had X-rays on Sunday that did not reveal a stress fracture, but doctors  advised him to get a bone scan before playing again to determine if there was a  micro-fracture.  </P> <P> "If I played today, there could be a chance of more serious injury," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier today, fifth-seeded Aaron Krickstein was beaten 7-5, 6-4 by Peter  Lundgren in the second round.  </P> <P> No. 3 seed Michael Chang had more success than his American compatriot,  advancing to the quarterfinals by defeating Jeremy Bates 6-3, 6-3.  </P></p>

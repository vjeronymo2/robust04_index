A ministry spokesman identified the defector as Maj. Zuo Xiukai,  40, the fourth-ranking member of the Chinese delegation to the Korean Military  Armistice Commission. The Defense Ministry spokesman said the Chinese couple  remain in protective custody of the American-led U.N. Command after walking  across the border through Panmunjom truce village. It was the first known  Chinese defection through Panmunjom, although North Koreans, Soviets and Czechs  have defected there.  </P></p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Pay increase level rises PAY increases rose slightly to an average of 4.5 per cent in the three months to September, up on the 4.3 per cent recorded in the quarter to August, according to a survey of agreements compiled by the Labour Research Department for Bargaining Report, the bulletin for union negotiators. The inflation rate was 3.6 per cent in both months. The survey was conducted before withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism, which some employers fear may ease the downward pressure on pay rises.</p>

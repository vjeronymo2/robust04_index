			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Amec moves ahead to Pounds 9.3m Pre-tax profits of Amec, the international engineering and construction group, increased slightly from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 9.3m in the first six months of 1994 in spite of a Pounds 3.2m loss on a property sale. The shares rose 4p to 121p following an optimistic assessment by Sir Alan Cockshaw, the chairman, of the trading outlook for the second half of this year and in 1995. The housing and property side would have made a small profit but for the loss, due to an unforseen tax charge, on the sale of the company's Trafalgar Place development. Amec is maintaining the interim dividend at 1.5p. Sir Alan said that he would consider whether to raise the 1.5p final 'in the light of trading prospects for 1995'. Earnings per share fell from 1.4p to 1.1p requiring an Pounds 800,000 transfer from reserves to meet the cost of the interim dividend. Sir Alan said that trading conditions in general building and civil engineering remained tough, but the group had made good progress in winning higher margin overseas and specialist engineering work. The group's determination to improve the quality of its order book by rejecting underperforming contracts was reflected in a 17 per cent decline in turnover from Pounds 1.12bn to Pounds 926m. General building and civil engineering only broke even and made a loss in the UK, offset by a return to the black by Morse Diesel in the US. Divisional turnover rose from Pounds 346.3m to Pounds 348.9m. Mechanical, electrical and process engineering profits rose from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 15m in spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 741.9m to Pounds 525m. Profits continued to flow through from previous North Sea hook-up contracts although work in this sector has declined. Sir Alan said the company was winning better quality construction work in the UK, while service contracts for the North Sea were compensating for a lower level of fabrication and hook-up work. A higher proportion of work was being won overseas. COMMENT Only Trafalgar House and BICC, among UK contractors can boast the range of skills offered by Amec. Its problem is that margins for overseas work and process engineering are still not great, albeit better than those for general contracting. The group, moreover has managed to trip itself up in recent years. Housing should show some sharp gains as margins rise. Amec remains a quality business but needs to deliver better times rather than just promising them. The long awaited settlement of the Tiffany contract may help. Profits of Pounds 27m (excluding Tiffany) this year and Pounds 40m next put Amec on prospective multiples of 23 and 16, which looks a little dear.</p>

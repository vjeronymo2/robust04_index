			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Citroen to lay off 1,600 workers Citroen is to lose more than 1,600 jobs this year, 5 per cent of its national workforce, as part of its campaign to reduce capacity in line with falling demand and to lift productivity closer to that of Japanese competitors, writes William Dawkins. This is the third round of job losses in the French car industry in recent months, following state-owned Renault's announcement that it is to shed 2,249 workers, and 2,597 job losses at Peugeot, part of the same group as Citroen.</p>

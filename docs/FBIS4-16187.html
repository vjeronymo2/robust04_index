			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Romanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr -- We are proceeding on the basis  that the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovy islands near  Khabarovsk are Russian. This is the position that our  representatives have been expounding and defending at the talks  with the Chinese side on border issues, the ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told today by a senior Russian Foreign  Ministry staff member. Moreover they have been and remain de  facto under our control. The border talks with China, he said,  are not hampering this territory being under our jurisdiction.    The high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry staff member  elucidated the situation in connection with a report that a  public committee to promote and consolidate the Russian status  of these islands has been set up in Khabarovsk. The committee  has sent an appeal to Federal Assembly deputies proposing that a  demand be made that the Russian Foreign Ministry should  "officially and precisely express the position of the Russian  state on the immutable Russian status of the islands."    The diplomat said the position of the Russian Foreign  Ministry had been determined in accordance with the government's  instructions for holding talks on demarcating the border with  the People's Republic of China. The talks have been under way  for 30 years now. They made it possible for the first time in  the history of relations between the two countries in May 1991  to sign the agreement between the USSR and the PRC on the  eastern section of the Soviet-Chinese state border. The  document was ratified by the Russian and Chinese parliaments and  afterwards signed by the Russian president and the PRC chairman.  It therefore has the force of a treaty.    At present the line of the border between Russia and China,  which extends for 4,300 km, has been more than 98 percent agreed  upon, excluding two sectors -- the islands near Khabarovsk and  the Bolshoy island on the river Argun in Chita Oblast. As for  the Chinese maps, which designate these islands as PRC  territory, that is a matter for the Chinese side. Russia's  representatives at the border talks have repeatedly mentioned  these cartographical inaccuracies, but for quite understandable  reasons we cannot make the Chinese designate the aforementioned  islands as ours on their maps. Naturally on Russian maps they  are shown belonging to the territory of Russia.    By mutual agreement of the sides the border talks are  strictly confidential. This is so work involving  representatives of the Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and  other departments may proceed in a calm atmosphere. The fact  that the inhabitants of the Amur valley are insufficiently  well-informed on these issues is to be explained precisely by  this circumstance. According to the senior Russian Foreign  Ministry staff member, a certain amount of concern locally has  been produced by reports in the Japanese press claiming that the  islands near Khabarovsk have already been handed over to China,  which in no way corresponds to reality.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, State Duma deputy, under </F> the "In the Country" rubric: "Perestroyka Goes On"]    [Text] We have been told: Russia is entering a phase of  relative stability. There are no tumultuous political  conflicts, nor is there a standoff between authorities, and a  treaty on social accord has been signed. But before rejoicing  at the "stabilization," it would be wise to think: What is  actually being stabilized? And by what methods?    Let us look carefully: The key elements of the old, Soviet  system of socioeconomic life still exist and operate.  Monopolies and the former structure of production are still in  place. Real private property and a competitive environment are  lacking. No land reform has been carried out. No democratic  procedures of public control over authorities have been worked  out, nor has a local self- government system been formed, there  is no real division of powers.... The stabilization of such a  system is not an asset. It means that Russia will remain an  oligarchic and supermonopolized state, only with a new  "political superstructure": without the CPSU, but with a  distinct criminal tinge.    This system cannot be run by normal, democratic methods.  Under Soviet power, the most effective means of government were  Politburo decisions. Passed by a narrow circle of people  without any discussion in society, without consideration for  democratic "convention," they were subject to unquestioning  implementation. Unfortunately, it is precisely those decisions  that the recent presidential edicts are closely reminiscent of.    In his economic edicts, the president is encroaching on the  State Duma's jurisdiction, demonstrating that it is incapable of  creating economic legislation on time and that the government is  unable to run the economy in a correct and prompt fashion.  However, government by decree will hardly succeed, either.  When a law is being created, a mechanism for its enforcement  must be worked out simultaneously. Here we do not have any  mechanism at all. The "infrastructure" for the edicts will be  added by the government, and it is anyone's guess how much the  ideas they contain may be distorted. Moreover, the edicts,  while often expressing correct economic ideas -- which are not  new, as a matter of fact -- nonetheless inevitably suffer from  being unfinished, incomplete, not comprehensive. Some of them  are really populist in nature. Naturally, cutting taxes is okay,  but so far it is only an instruction to the government (to all  appearances, only for the next year). Undoubtedly, quotas and  licenses should be lifted, to say nothing of benefits. But whom  will the president rely on in solving this problem?    Entirely justified fears have been expressed that various  political forces may use the edicts as a pretext to crank up  tension, hunt for enemies, and indulge in political intrigues.  But this is not the main danger; the danger is that there is a  clear emphasis on antidemocratic, illegitimate, and even  unconstitutional methods of government. The departure from  earlier stated principles has culminated in the edict "On Urgent  Measures To Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other  Forms of Organized Crime." It violates everything that can be  violated: human rights, a number of federal laws, even the  Constitution.    Of course, at a time when the people are totally intimidated  by rampant crime it is easy to evoke positive emotions by  promising tight measures. But everyone must realize: Tomorrow,  if not today, he himself may become a victim of legalized  lawlessness. Yes, lawlessness, because there is no other name  for a situation where it is laid down that crime is to be fought  by unconstitutional and unlawful methods. A perfect opportunity  for settling scores with rivals and for staging inter-group  political showdowns.... It is entirely unclear what will now  happen to our courts. How will judges act when they have, side  by side before them, the edict and the laws and the Constitution  it violates?    However, this scenario was predetermined by the very method  of preparing and adopting the Constitution. Was it not clear  even at the time that we were in for a struggle against crime?  If the Constitution had been discussed in society in a normal  fashion, if the professionals had been given a say, would they  not have warned that in our conditions 48-hour pre-trial  detention is absurd? Then it would not have been necessary to  "correct" the 48 hours to 30 days by edict.    Before the very eyes of the entire country the very  "letter," not only the much-invoked "spirit of the law" is being  violated. Moreover, it is being violated by the sole guarantor  of the Constitution -- the president. So does the established  "system" whose stabilization some are ready to welcome allow  itself to be run in this way? It is becoming clear that we did  not have profound reform, what we experienced was nothing but  perestroyka.    "How can it be that we did not have reform?" advocates of  the  course will retort. "The market is filled with goods; true,  they are very expensive, and more often than not they are not  for all...." But nor were they meant for all formerly, and more  often than not those for whom they were meant were the same  people. "But formerly we did not have any democracy at all...."  But it is manifestly clear especially in the light of the  recent edict that we do not have it now, either.    So, what's up "in the country" nowadays? For most people it  is more of the same.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique Issued by the Supreme Court read by Justice Juan </F> Jose Rodil Peralta in Guatemala City on 2 April; from the  "Patrullaje Informativo" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Supreme Court Justice Juan Jose Rodil Peralta has  condemned the murder of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon:    [Begin Rodil recording] You are going to be the first to  know  this information. The Supreme Court is drafting a communique,  and I am going it to read to you. You will be the first media  source to have it. The communique states the following:    The presidency of the judicial branch, representing the  Supreme Court of Justice, has heard with astonishment and  indignation of the vile assassination of Constitutional Court  President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. We manifest our strong  condemnation and aversion for this sad occurrence, which  directly attacks the state of law and the legal regime. To  silence with bullets the voice of the leading authority in the  defense of our Constitution directly attacks the state of law  and the legal regime, the basic supports of our democratic life,  and, in essence, negatively affects all Guatemalans.    We state this vile and cowardly action clearly shows the  vandals and assassins, who caused bloodshed in Guatemala in the  past, are active and are now attempting to destroy the  Guatemalan democratic process again and, with it, the defense of  human rights and the demands for social justice for the  Guatemalans who live between violence and poverty. The murder of  the president of the Constitutionality Court threatens, in  essence, freedom in Guatemala.    We demand the government of the Republic, headed by  President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio, immediately implement each and every  measures established in the Constitution to safeguard the state  of law and the legal regime, which are being threatened as never  before in the current Guatemalan democratic process. At the  same time, it must order all civilian and military investigation  offices, which the state controls, to direct all their efforts  to determine promptly and efficiently the truth of the events so  that the material and intellectual authors of Epaminondas  Gonzalez Dubon's murder can be punished in an exemplary manner  and with all the weight of the law.    With great sadness and pain, we send our heartfelt  condolences to Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's relatives and hope  they will find acceptance in our Christian values.    This is the Supreme Court of Justice communique, which we  are finishing right now and giving "Patrullaje Informativo" as a  scoop. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salvadoran Gen. Mauricio Ernesto </F> Vargas, former deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces and  member of the Dialogue Commission, by unidentified reporter on  19 May; from the "KL Radio News" newscast -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Reporter: Good morning General, we  would like to hear your opinion on the attack on the security  guards of FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  Deputy Nidia Diaz [nom de guerre of Maria Concepcion Valladares  de Sosa].    Vargas: [passage omitted] The fact that this is  the second attack on this same person, specifically this same  security guard, is strange. I believe this should be thoroughly  investigated and that the weight of the law should fall upon  those who are responsible, so that the exemplary punishment can  dissuade others from acting the same way within Salvadoran  society.    Reporter: Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the  political connotations that this attack could have. As member  of the Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the  Chapultepec Agreements how do you view these actions against a  party like the FMLN which recently entered the country's  political life?    Vargas: As I said.... [pauses] although I did not  say it directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the  attack was against the same person, the same security guard who  was attacked the first time. As you said, this incident  warrants a thorough investigation, as it could have other  connotations. Attacks that could occur at a given time which  could be directly or indirectly related to political groups  should be rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against  ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic  Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all  political parties. [passage omitted]    This case should be given more attention because there could  be factors that are not political, which if not properly  investigated can have repercussions in the political field,  which of course would be totally undesirable.

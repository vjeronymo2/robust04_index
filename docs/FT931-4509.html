			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Angola heads for long war The Angolan government has warned of a long and bloody round of civil war as Unita rebels yesterday threatened to 'neutralise' oil installations in the north if government forces tried to recapture them, Reuter reports from Luanda. The government army chief warned Angolans earlier that Unita possessed a 'terrible war machine' and they should prepare for a long war which could cause more casualties than the previous 16-year civil conflict. The loss of the highland capital of Huambo at the weekend dealt a double-blow to the government, hard-pressed since fighting resumed in earnest two months ago after Unita's rejection of last September's election results.</p>

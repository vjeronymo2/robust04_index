			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sentrachem ahead despite fall in demand SENTRACHEM, one of South Africa's largest chemical companies, overcame difficult trading conditions to record an increase in earnings for the six months to the end of February. Operating income was up 14.1 per cent, at R116.8m (Dollars 40.7m), while turnover was 3 per cent higher at R1.17bn. Mr John Job, managing director, said the improved margins reflected effective fixed cost control and productivity improvements. Pre-tax income improved by 38.9 per cent to R75.4m, but taxation was 53.1 per cent higher owing to the low base in 1991. Income attributable to outside shareholders rose to R10.4m from R4.2m because of the improved performance of the Safripol and Sena-chem joint ventures. Mr Job said demand from the automotive industry, an important market, continued to decline, as did demand for plasticisers, solvents and resins. The agricultural products division had, however, performed well, with higher exports off-setting the impact of the severe drought at home. Exports, which currently account for under 10 per cent of turnover, are expected to increase in future. Mr Job said although the economic climate remained difficult, he expected earnings for the year to be higher than in 1991. The production base of the group was in good shape following a R830m capital expenditure programme over the past three years. Earnings per share rose to 25.7 cents from 24.2 cents, and the dividend was maintained at 6 cents per share.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: FNB steps up dividend on mid-year advance FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, has reported a 22.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to R421.5m (Dollars 84.55m) for the six months to March 1993. It is stepping up its dividend. Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said he was pleased with the results, given the difficult operating environment. He cautioned, however, that the level of economic activity continued to slow. Mr Swart said it was difficult to generate lending volumes, and he doubted whether even a 5 per cent drop in interest rates would generate much activity, given low levels of confidence and consumers finding themselves over-borrowed. Net interest income rose by 17.4 per cent to R1.08bn in the half-year as declining interest expenditure offset a sluggish income performance. The bad debt charge rose by 15.1 per cent to R184.8m, with most of the growth coming from Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank purchased in October and included in the results for the first time. Other operating income rose by 17 per cent to R755.4m Mr Swart said the Ansbacher acquisition was bedding down well and benefits should accrue in the next six months. He said FNB's plans for Ansbacher included increasing the focus on international trade finance, resurrecting the money market operations, streamlining the trust operations, and becoming more active in the corporate finance/merchant banking market. Earnings per share rose by 20.3 per cent to 310.1 cents before taking into account a deferred taxation rate adjustment, and net of a tax equalisation provision. The dividend is increased to 55 cents a share from 50 cents. Total assets grew by 21.7 per cent to R48.1bn at the end of March. Advances increased by 18.6 per cent to R38bn.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the FDIC's proposed rule lowering the risk weight for certain multifamily housing loans incorporated the specific statutory criteria described in section I. above and also included four additional safety and soundness criteria that multifamily housing loans would have to meet in order to receive a reduced risk weight. These four criteria, which were developed by the FDIC after consulting with the other federal banking agencies, provided that: (1) The loan-to-value ratio used to determine the eligibility of a multifamily housing loan for the lower risk weight would be the ratio at the time the loan was originated; (2) the loan must not be more than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status; (3) the average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least one year; and (4) the loan must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards. Taken together, the statutory and proposed additional criteria were intended to ensure that only those multifamily housing loans whose future repayment prospects are such that they expose an institution to relatively low levels of credit risk would receive the more favorable 50 percent risk weight. These criteria were also intended to ensure that such loans have risk characteristics that are consistent with the Basle Accord's provisions regarding the assignment of a preferential risk weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans, the FDIC observed in the preamble to the proposed rule that its risk-based capital guidelines presently accord a 50 percent risk weight to privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that are ``backed by a pool of conventional mortgages,'' each of which meets the criteria ``for inclusion in the 50 percent risk weight category at the time the pool is originated.'' Such securities must also meet a number of safety and soundness criteria that are specified in the guidelines. Therefore, by operation of the existing language on privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines, the proposal stated that the explicit addition of multifamily housing loans to the 50 percent risk weight category would have the effect of lowering to 50 percent the risk weight for privately-issued mortgage-backed securities collateralized by such loans, provided the multifamily housing loans that back these securities qualify for a 50 percent risk weight at the time the securities are originated. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, in general, the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines currently assign a 20 percent risk weight to mortgage-backed securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans that have been issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored agency. The final rule does not change the treatment of these mortgage-backed securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Loss Sharing Arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC's existing risk-based capital guidelines do not specifically address how asset sales involving various forms of loss sharing arrangements are to be handled by a selling bank. This is because, for purposes of applying the risk-based capital standards, a bank's balance sheet assets are determined in accordance with the instructions for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). Thus, the instructions for preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income are the source for guidance on determining the extent to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as sold when there is a loss sharing arrangement covering the assets. The proposed rule therefore sought to implement the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements on sales of multifamily housing loans by referencing the relevant Call Report instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to sales subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements, the Call Report instructions direct banks to report these transactions in a manner that is consistent with the language of section 618(b)(2) quoted in section I above. These instructions state that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the risk retained by the seller is limited to some fixed percentage of any losses that might be incurred and there are no other provisions resulting in retention of risk, either directly or indirectly, by the seller, the maximum amount of possible loss for which the selling bank is at risk (the stated percentage times the sale proceeds) shall be reported as a borrowing and the remaining amount of the assets transferred reported as a sale. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to provide in a footnote an explanation of this treatment for sellers of multifamily housing loans subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Call Report purposes, in general, other transfers of multifamily housing loans are to be reported as sales of the transferred assets only if the selling institution ``(1) retains no risk of loss from the assets transferred resulting from any cause and (2) has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the assets transferred'' resulting from any cause. The FDIC's risk-based capital framework has taken other loss sharing arrangements into account in this manner when determining the extent to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as sold and excluded from the balance sheet assets that must be risk weighted. In order to implement section 618(b)(3), the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to explicitly disclose this treatment of other loss sharing arrangements in a footnote.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

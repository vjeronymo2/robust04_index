Bank chairman Sergio Siglienti issued a statement in which  he  underscored how Comit had "fulfilled expectations in response to  the confidence shown to it by the government and IRI [Institute  for Industrial Reconstruction]."    Siglienti went on to stress how the bank's ability to sell  stock "was confirmed by the fact that shares sold directly by  our bank amounted to some 40 percent of the entire world offer  and at a price which, while very interesting for the investors  as demonstrated by the success of the sale, represented for the  seller, even with the discount, the most advantageous  privatization operation carried out so far, even on an  international level."    Satisfaction for the Comit operation was also voiced today  by  Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who said "The privatization of  Comit marks an important moment for the Italian economy. IRI,  formed to manage the bank crisis of the 1930s, today exits from  the banking sector. Some of the most prestigious public banks  have now become banks of the public. With the sales on the  market of Credit, IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal  and Real Property] and Comit 700 thousand new stockholders were  born." Ciampi then went on to recall the skepticism, only a few  months ago, over Italy's true intention of privatization and  how, between May and September, the government had paved the way  to make it legally possible.    The path is now well defined, he concluded, and "must be  followed with determination in the framework of an overall  economic policy aimed at reinforcing the efficiency and  competitiveness of the Italian productive system."    For his part, IRI chairman Romano Prodi recalled how  privatization plans are in the process of being defined for the  state's interests in the steel and foods sectors, to be followed  by the privatization of such leading IRI interests as the Rome  airport authority, the National highway authority and, above  all, the communications company STET [Turin Telephone Finance  Company]. In all cases, he concluded, the utmost transparency  and rules of the market will be respected."    In his statement on the Comit success, Prodi stressed how it  "confirmed that the right direction has been taken and that this  opinion is amply shared by the public. The fact that hundreds  of thousands of people have shown such confidence in our  operation is a comfort in view of our next operations."</p>

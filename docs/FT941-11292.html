			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels rapped over farm fraud The European Court of Auditors, the European Union's main financial watchdog, has criticised the European Commission and member countries for allowing widespread fraud in its Ecu30bn (Pounds 23.6bn) farm budget. The complexity of EU farm policies encourage abuse particularly in subsidising exports of surplus farm products, which accounts for a third of the budget, the auditors said. The report stated that member countries and the Commission had adopted a 'somewhat minimal approach to monitoring and combating agricultural fraud'. The auditors accused the countries of having no central monitoring of companies involved in agricultural trade. Although a limited number of companies operating in several member countries received the lion's share of export subsidies, there was no cross-border co-ordination of the findings of investigations. The court found that, out of seven countries surveyed, checks were only regularly carried out in two to ensure that export subsidies were not being wrongly applied. The inadequacy of systems for monitoring fraud had meant that the Commission was extremely slow to recover funds that had been wrongly allocated, the report found. The auditors pointed to 5,775 cases of fraud and irregularities over the 1972 to 1991 period involving Ecu725m, of which only 77m had been recovered. The court called for a system to assess the risk of fraud by product, value and activities of the company concerned. It said member countries should co-operate more in monitoring multinational companies.</p>

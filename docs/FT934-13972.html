			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors chief urges Samsung to reduce stake KIA MOTORS, South Korea's second-largest car producer, yesterday vowed to fight a possible takeover bid by the Samsung group. Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, has suddenly emerged as Kia's second largest corporate shareholder after purchasing large blocks of stock since June. 'The 9.6 per cent Samsung stake in Kia Motors is a threat to stable management. I urge Samsung to reduce its stake to the level of early June,' said Mr Han Seung-jun, president of Kia Motors. Samsung's interest in June was 5.8 per cent. He added that Kia employees, who form the company's largest shareholder block with 11.4 per cent, may try to buy more stock to resist Samsung. Samsung has expressed an interest in becoming a vehicle manufacturer but claims the stock purchase by its insurance subsidiary was purely a financial investment. 'I don't think the massive buying by a life insurer of our company connotes a normal investment practice as an institutional investor. I can't rule out the possibility that Samsung intends a hostile takeover of Kia Motors by increasing its stake,' Mr Han said. Under current Korean law, Samsung cannot purchase more than 10 per cent of Kia shares on the stock exchange. But legislation pending in the National Assembly would abolish the 10 per cent shareholding limit for institutional investors next year, paving the way for corporate raids. Kia has urged parliament to reject the proposed change in shareholding law. Samsung's action has caused widespread concern within the Korean corporate sector, which is characterised by a stable ownership structure and where corporate takeovers are unheard of. Kia is considered vulnerable to a bid since its ownership is highly fragmented, with no single strong shareholder, but some analysts believe that Ford and Mazda, which own 10 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, and other institutional investors could co-operate in blocking any Samsung bid. The government also expressed concern yesterday about the Samsung share purchase, with finance ministry officials suggesting the state might intervene by claiming a takeover would violate fair trade and monopoly rules.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: 'The Juliet Letters' - Elvis Costello and the Brodsky Quartet 'This is no more my stab at 'classical music' than it is the Brodsky Quartet's first rock and roll album' warns Elvis Costello in the sleeve notes to The Juliet Letters. The release of the disc, and the performance at Drury Lane on Sunday, are the latest stage in Costello's carefully calculated move away from the rock background of his earlier work and towards something (not 'that junkyard named 'Cross-Over' he insists) that he clearly hopes will prove to be richer and stranger. With sublime hindsight hints of growing disaffection with the direction of his career could be traced through Costello's last two albums, Spike and Mighty Like a Rose. But neither of those patchy collections contains anything to anticipate The Juliet Letters, in which he seems to have abandoned almost every shred of his past work and started again from scratch, working with the members of the Brodsky Quartet on a sequence of songs for which the writing credits are shared equally. The intentions may have been honourable enough, but the result is hugely disappointing; in submerging himself in this collectivity Costello seems to have sacrificed almost all his creative identity as a songwriter. There are just flashes that reveal the distinctive tang of his best work, an occasional twist to a vocal line or a familiarl modulation, but the hard acerbic edge to the songs has all but gone; the rhythms of the lyrics are flatter, less abrasive, and the emotional power has been drastically dimmed. The textures of a string quartet marry uneasily with Costello's voice; there are songs in the set in which the accompaniment would undoubtedly be far more effective on a guitar-based band, while at best the string figures simply blur the melodic shapes. Promoting the Brodsky from a perfectly decent string quartet into creators in their own right has really added little; the accompaniments and interludes which the players invent for The Juliet Letters simply paraphrase choice nuggets of their mainstream repertoire - a Bartok pastiche here, some Shostakovich or Britten tags there. It is not surprising there is little sense of coherence, while hearing some of their words put into Costello's mouth only reminds one of the power his own lyrics regularly generate. In live performance, with a sound very faithfully duplicating the recording, the anodyne effect of the songs was if anything emphasised. Costello sings them well enough, standing among the quartet to underline the blamelessly democratic basis of the exercise. No one could deny the finest British singer-songwriter of his generation has not earnt the right to experiment, to explore new directions; it is the extent of Costello's failure here that is so surprising; the huge sense of disappointment that is hard to accept.

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Venezuela may help insurers The Venezuelan government may have to intervene to help local insurance companies hit by the country's banking crisis, according to Mr Konrad Firgau, the Venezuelan superintendent of insurance. Mr Firgau said yesterday that some of the frozen deposits held in seven commercial banks, closed by the government on June 14, held the technical reserves of insurance companies. As a result he said, at least two insurance companies could face state intervention. Insurance companies are obliged by law to maintain 40 per cent of their premiums as 'technical reserves'. The banks closed down by the government were Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas, Construccion, La Guaira, Maracaibo and Metropolitano, all of which were controlled by private investors. Some of them were the central organisations in financial groups which included insurance companies. The government also shut down an industrial finance company, Fiveca.</p>

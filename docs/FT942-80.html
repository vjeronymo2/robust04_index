			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: SG Warburg still top analysts - Top houses seek ways to differentiate services, says Extel survey SG Warburg Securities is the top rated City research house for the fourth year running in the annual Extel survey of research analysts. However, its winning margin was smaller than a year ago. James Capel, the winner from 1980 to 1990, was the biggest loser, falling back from second to fourth. It was displaced by NatWest Securities, up from third to second, and BZW which rose from fifth to third. Overall, the top houses are becoming more closely bunched, said Mr Geoffrey Osmint, founder and consulting editor of the survey. This is forcing them to find ways to differentiate their services to institutional investors. The investors surveyed perceived, for example, that Warburg devoted more of its research than other brokers to corporate finance activities. Smith New Court used much of its analysis for marketmaking while Capel was oriented to its institutional clients. Investors remained critical of the high volume and sometimes inadequate quality of research landing on their desk, according to the survey of 112 institutions with some Pounds 850bn of funds under management. It was the 21st annual survey and the first since the Financial Times acquired Extel. Half the investors said they read only a quarter of the material they received and most of the other respondents read less than half. They were particularly critical of the fundamental analysis of companies' accounts, accounting techniques and financial structure. One third of managers believed that less than a quarter of the research they received provided satisfactory analysis in those areas. The demand for research was growing, with 56 per cent of large fund managers and 36 per cent of smaller ones expecting to increase their use of information this year. They wanted, for example, more data on emerging markets. However, a growing number of institutions were turning to in-house research. The trend was strongest among mid-sized managers with Pounds 10bn to Pounds 20bn of funds. Some 60 per cent of them said they planned to do more research themselves. There was also a sharp increase in the number of meetings between investors and company managements. Fund managers were using more derivatives, typically for tactical asset allocation. But in general derivatives were being used by only 25 per cent of the managers surveyed. In the opinion of institutions surveyed, the best team of analysts was NatWest's integrated oil group led by Mr Fergus MacLeod. Second was Kleinwort Benson's water team led by Mr Peter Hyde followed by Smith New Court's chemicals team led by Mr Charles Lambert. Mr MacLeod was also the top rated individual analyst, followed by Mr John Spicer, the breweries analyst at Warburg, and Mr Jamie Stevenson, the construction and building materials analyst at Kleinwort Benson. The best single piece of research was 'A profits pathology' written by Mr Paul Walton and his team at Capel. Overall, NatWest received the most votes for the content of its research and Capel and NatWest were rated top for presentation.</p>

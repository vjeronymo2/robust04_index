Criminal  proceedings were instituted against 11 men who took part in the  May 1 demonstration, the Russian "Vesti" television programme  reported on Wednesday.    Nine of them face charges envisaged by Article 79 of the  criminal code of the Russian Federation -- participation in mass  disturbances. If court finds them guilty they will be sentenced  to imprisonment from 2 to 15 years.    According to preliminary reports, the investigation  established that leader of the "Labour Russia" Movement Viktor  Anpilov, leader of the National Salvation Front Ilya  Konstantinov and leader of the "Officers' Union" Stanislav  Terekhov were initiators of mass disturbances in Moscow on May  1, 1993. An investigation into their activities on May 1 is  being conducted separately.    The accused were not taken into custody but signed a  document  pledging not to leave Moscow.    On May 1, 1993 representatives of opposition movements  organised an unsanctioned rally on Leninskiy Prospekt in Moscow  which resulted in clashes with law enforcement bodies.

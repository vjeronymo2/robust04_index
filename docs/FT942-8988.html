			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Electricity productivity 'not improved' since sale Privatisation did not significantly improve the productivity growth of most electricity companies in England and Wales, the Centre for Study of Regulated Industries said yesterday. The centre's claims conflict with the industry which says efficiency improvements are one of the main benefits of privatisation four years ago. They come ahead of a review by the industry regulator into the distribution businesses.  This will set price controls after taking into account issues including the companies' ability to cut costs in the future. The regulatory regime set up at privatisation was probably too lenient and did not offer sufficient incentives to improve efficiency, the centre says.  Since privatisation all companies have been allowed to lift distribution prices in line with inflation and many be more.  The authors suggest the review by Offer should result in price rises being limited to inflation minus 2.5 percentage points. The centre, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, says the rate of productivity growth between 1991 and 1993 was 3.1 per cent on average, against 2.8 per cent for 1971 to 1990. However, the centre says the 'slight' improvement is not statistically significant and most of it would have happened even had privatisation not taken place. The centre says only three companies, Manweb, South Wales and Eastern, significantly improved their performance after privatisation.  The gap between the most efficient and least efficient companies has widened, it says. The report says the failure to significantly improve performance is explained in part because the companies were privatised during a recession.

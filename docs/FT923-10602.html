			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally boosts share prices THE LONDON stock market enjoyed a widely expected rally yesterday, rising sharply in the second half of the session in spite of the predictedly bearish survey of opinion from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The driving force came from an early gain in the new Wall Street session. Trading volume in London equities was not large enough to imply a convincing change in the investment mood. Equities opened firmly behind more stable performances in Tokyo and New York. Traders were poised for a rally in a London market which had fallen by more than 4 per cent in the previous trading account. Shares in Wellcome stabilised as the Pounds 2.16bn share sale was absorbed. Dealers sensed that some bear positions had been left open in blue chip shares which had been sold to raise cash for the new Wellcome stock. More significant, however, was the squeeze on marketmakers' books after the prolonged selling bout. Traders seeking stock to meet previous selling orders in such recent losers as Thorn EMI, Reuters and BAT Industries found prices moving up ahead of them. However, lack of genuine investment demand left the Footsie struggling to hold its early gain of around 15 points. The CBI quarterly survey, confirming that the economic recovery expected in April had 'failed to materialise', had been so widely discounted that it had little effect one way or the other. The final impetus for London came when Wall Street, discounting its own bad news in the shape of a heavy fall in the US consumer confidence index, opened strongly, gaining nearly 30 Dow points during UK trading hours. The UK market was quick to follow other European bourses in responding to Wall Street. A determined buyer for the September contract on the FT-SE Index in the stock index futures market lit the fuse under the underlying blue chip stocks. The FT-SE Index rose sharply and closed, just under the day's best, at 2,373.4 for a gain of 25.4. The day's Seaq trading total of 446m shares was not particularly exciting, even by recent standards; Monday's Seaq total of 564.4m, worth Pounds 1.3bn in terms of retail business, was swollen by trading in the 270m new Wellcome shares. One of the more genuinely firm sectors was the distillery industry, which took a highly favourable view of the European Community agreement on a package of binding excise duties which, in the view of City analysts, might presage a curb on further increases in spirits duties in the UK and other producer countries. Guinness, with major whisky interests, led the way forward. ICI, the market bellwether stock, which announces trading results tomorrow, benefited from recommendation by a leading UK investment bank. However, market strategists maintained that yesterday's rally was no more than a technical bounce in a badly shaken stock market. Traders continued to doubt whether either the stock market or the UK economy is ready to mount a sustained recovery at this stage.</p>

"We view them as a substantial link in the general chain  of international efforts aimed at untying the Bosnian knot," he  said.    Nevertheless, the diplomat said, there are still several  unclear questions, above all concerning the possible status of  the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and territorial limits.    "Considering that relations between the Serbs and the Croats  are of key importance in the endeavors to resolve the entire  Yugoslav crisis, Russian diplomacy is building up its efforts in  this direction along the Belgrade-Zagreb and the Zagreb-Knin  line," he said. "We expect that it will become possible to  reach an agreement on ceasing fire and halting military actions  on Tuesday [22 March] as a result of talks to be held in the  Russian embassy in Zagreb between the Croat leaders and local  Serbs," he said.</p>

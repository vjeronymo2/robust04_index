			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Technology: The art of Tom, Dick and Harry - Technically Speaking PRODUCERS of personal computer presentation software have a lot to answer for. Increasing numbers of salespeople and corporate executives are using their programs to create business presentations that insult the sensibilities of viewers with odd combinations of garish colours, loud backgrounds and strange mixtures of type. You know the sort of thing. A sales representative from a company with a name like Fuzzy-Tech Office Equipment comes by your office to give a sales presentation on his company's latest goodies. He fires up an overhead projector or a colour computer display and proceeds to overwhelm you with dozens of slides that feature red text on a purple background. You quietly cringe at the unreadable mess, serve him a cup of undrinkable coffee and send him on his way. Time was when such a salesperson would carry only a series of brochures and perhaps some corporate slides created by professional graphic designers and artists. However boring the content of the slides, you could at least be assured that the look of them would not resemble a trip through San Francisco's Haight Ashbury district in the 1960s. The problem lies with PC-based business presentation software. It is now so cheap and easy to use that anyone with a keyboard, mouse and a good printer can create their own business presentations. In theory, this is good news. It gives marketing people better control over their presentations - and ensures that they much more accurately reflect the sales message they are trying to get across. Corporate training and educational presentations also benefit from this technology - users can create timely presentations tailored to their target audiences. When putting this theory into practice, however, far too many corporations eliminate an important step - they fail to offer users any kind of training and guidance in the graphic arts. Managers assume that if they give their marketing staff the right software, they will automatically be able to produce professional quality presentations. This is simplistic and wrong-headed. Sales and marketing executives are no more qualified to be designers and typographers than house painters are to be architects. There are specific skills required to produce professional-looking presentations and they cannot be acquired overnight. The software companies who produce these presentation applications - such as Aldus Corporation, Microsoft and Lotus Development - must take some of the blame for propagating the notion that anyone can be a designer. They have, however, generally recognised this problem by including dozens of presentation 'templates' that come prepackaged with the software. These templates use professionally-matched colours, backgrounds, typefaces and graphics - and look respectable. But the enterprising young salesperson from Fuzzy-Tech isn't going to be caught using the same template as his competitor - and therefore goes off to create something for himself. One solution is to limit the choices available to individuals who create their own presentation graphics to a number of corporate-approved colours, typefaces, backgrounds and 'transition effects'. Most popular presentation applications already allow corporate software or MIS managers to set up such a system by 'locking out' certain functions and customising the presentation application. It is up to corporate purchasers of presentation software to make use of these features. For those who do, may I suggest - as a frequent viewer - that everyone remove the overworked magenta from the colour palette and do away with those clever 'exploding' transition effects, which are no longer novel. I would also like to see a limit on the number of slides per minute.</p>

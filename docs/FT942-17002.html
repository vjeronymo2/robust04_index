			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost takes shine off free trade Sir, I have received a request for the renewal of my annual subscription to a business guide published in the UK. After giving details of the Pounds 99 payment due it says: 'Please draw your cheque on a sterling bank account in the UK. If cheque not drawn on a UK bank please add Pounds 17.00 to cover bank charges.' This is a general requirement and therefore applies within the European Union. A thumping levy by banks of 17 per cent on this sort of cross-border trade takes a lot of the shine off the Union as a free trade area. I can understand why financial institutions like to enjoy the profits earned on currency transactions. I can understand why governments like to retain national currencies so that they can manipulate them for national advantage. But while these benefits come in the short term, there must be a substantial price to be paid in the long term. European businesses will suffer both in the size of their domestic markets and in their wider international competitiveness. Will the Maastricht treaty be able to address this problem, or will it turn out to be rather like asking bookies to vote for fewer race meetings?

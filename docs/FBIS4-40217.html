			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- The 9th round of  Moldovan-Russian negotiations on the 14th Army's withdrawal from  Moldova led the parties to agreement on all articles of the  General Accord, except Article 2, told BASAPRESS Nicolae  Osmochescu, Moldovan vice minister of foreign affairs and head  of the Moldovan delegation to the negotiations. He pointed out  that Article 2 deals with the term of the Russian troops'  withdrawal and that the Moldovan delegation insisted on 31  December 1995 or January 1996 as the deadline for the  withdrawal. "This is Moldova's official position based on the  judgments of our experts," said Osmochescu. According to him,  Russia insists on a period of three years, arguing that the  withdrawal will have to take place through the territory of a  third country. Some information media have reported that Moscow  will demand four years for the withdrawal of its troops.  Osmochescu also mentioned that additional issues, such as the  utilization of the Tiraspol airport and compensations for  repatriating the Russian officers were discussed. The Moldovan  delegation considers that these compensations can be covered  from the money gained through the selling of the flats and  houses freed by the Russian officers, and not from the budget.  The Dniester Republic's representatives in the negotiations  tried to claim their share of the 14th Army's property. These  claims were not accepted either by the Moldovan or by the  Russian delegations. The 10th round of negotiations will be  held in Chisinau in July or August this year, said Osmochescu.  Nicolae Turtureanu, the representative of the Moldovan Defense  Ministry, did not take part in the negotiations. Concerning  this, Osmochescu said that "it is not exceptional; a large part  of the Moldovan delegation had to be renewed." The head of the  military delegation was Vasile Grosu, head of the Artillery  Direction of the Moldovan Defense Ministry.</p>

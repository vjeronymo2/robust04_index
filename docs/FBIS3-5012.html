This  comes after Mr. Rabuka, after being reelected prime minister  following the recent Fiji elections, said he hoped the  Government of National Unity could be formed within the next  five years. [sentence as heard]    Opposition Leader Jai Ram Reddy says before that can happen  there must be a review of Fiji's 1990 constitution, which he  says discriminates against Indians and ensures they remain in a  parliamentary minority. Terms of reference have been agreed for  a constitutional review, which must be completed by 1997. In  last month elections, Mr. Reddy's National Federation Party won  20 of the 27 seats set aside for Indians in Fiji's 70-seat  parliament. Indians make up 45 percent of Fiji's population.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Babcock refocuses after fall to Pounds 21m  -Reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 13m contribute to the profits downturn BABCOCK International, the engineering group, is to cut up to 500 jobs at its Renfrew plant outside Glasgow as part of a belated refocusing on international markets. The group set up a Pounds 13m provision for reorganisation, one of the factors behind a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 56m to Pounds 21m on sales down 10 per cent at Pounds 748m. The board is recommending a final dividend of 1.1p, giving a total for the year of 2.1p compared with 3.15p. Earnings per share fell from 8.19p to 1.72p. Mr Jeff Whalley, acting chief executive, said the group had reorganised and accounted for the changes which would allow Renfrew to be a smaller manufacturing base for a more aggressive push into international markets. The group would be sourcing some of its more basic engineering needs from countries near where it hopes to win contracts, particularly in the Far East. Mr Whalley, brought in by Lord King, chairman, after Mr Oliver Whitehead left the chief executive position in April, said the group had not been changing direction fast enough under the previous management. Lord King is understood to be meeting potential chief executives next week. At the operating level profits fell from Pounds 43.6m to Pounds 32.3m. Energy and Manufacturing halved from Pounds 17.46m to Pounds 8.75m partly because of delays and postponements of orders. New contracts had been won in Greece, the UK and in Hong Kong, so the division ended the year with a forward order book of Pounds 317m, up from Pounds 295m at the end of March 1992. Mr Whalley said Babcock was in preliminary discussions with two continental European groups to form an energy joint venture with combined sales of Pounds 700m that would be in a better position to compete. Contracting and construction fell from Pounds 12.66m to Pounds 5.26m while facilities management at Rosyth Royal Dockyard fell from Pounds 10.46m to Pounds 6.83m. Materials handling, enlarged by the merger of Consilium and Claudius, had increased profits from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 12.1m while the African division produced marginally lower profits of Pounds 6.79m (Pounds 7.13m) on sales more than halved to Pounds 73.86m. Net group cash fell from an abnormally high level of Pounds 111.6m to Pounds 41m. Much of this was advance payment on contracts. Mr Erik Porter, finance director, said the underlying reduction in cash was Pounds 20m - Pounds 14m in settlement of litigation in Germany and Pounds 5m which was invested in a joint venture with Yorkshire Water. Net cash would fall further this year as retentions built up from the Drax coal-fired complex in Yorkshire. COMMENT It is difficult to see how Babcock can transform itself in quite the manner management has mapped out. Unless it can find a niche, why should multinational companies prefer to deal with a group of Babcock's size rather than ABB, for example? With net assets of only Pounds 93m - a figure already bolstered by a Pounds 32m pension fund surplus - and sales of Pounds 750m, Babcock might even be ruled out of certain contracts by its modest resources and the negative impact that big contracts would have on its cash position. Rosyth remains an unknown quantity, but loss of the Trident re-fit contract could mean a slow shrinking of a traditional earner. The company says it has conservatively budgeted Pounds 200m of orders which should nearly fill Renfrew next year. But to achieve this, Babcock is going to have to run hard internationally. Despite the above average yield and low prospective multiple - 8 times based on pre-tax profits forecasts of Pounds 36m for 1993  -there are many better engineering recovery stories.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raimonda Rameliene: "V. Landsbergis: `Elections </F> in the Spring are the Way Out of the Crisis'"]    [Text] At a press conference at the Seimas yesterday, V.  Landsbergis, the leader of the rightist opposition, stated that  a crisis has gripped the country's current government and that  this crisis is very "evident in debates dealing with the fate of  the government." According to the professor, the various  discussions indicate that the ruling party itself comprehends  that the government is not coping with its tasks, and this was  why it was looking for someone to blame. The non-party  ministers, justice minister J. Prapiestis and finance minister  E. Vilkelis, could become these "scapegoats."    The LDDP, with no younger members in its ranks and therefore  without a future, is rushing about looking for a way out and for  personnel who could be nominated for positions in the  government. Alas, the LDDP reserve ranks consist of only the old  nomenklatura. Can another government be formed from the same  resources, could it work better with such a majority? "It is  clear that this would not be worthwhile," Landsbergis said.  However, it seems that there are reserves in other parties, and  the opposition could without a doubt form a government, although  there is no purpose in doing so with the kind of majority that  currently exists in the Seimas. And the LDDP will not fool very  many people by changing ministers in the current government.  This is why the theoretical discussion initiated by the LDDP on  a party-based, political-based, or competence-based government  does not make much sense either. Here you have continual  contradictions "which are outlined particularly exhaustively in  the article by Mr. Kirkilas in TIESA." The professor analyzed  and commented upon this article (which appeared on 21 May) in  some detail; he also drew quite a few conclusions. One of these  was that the composition of the new government would be  deliberated "not by the entire LDDP convention, but rather by  some kind of politburo." The president would not be a  participant either, but rather, it appears, would only execute  the decisions. Also, the statements made by the president  himself are quite contradictory: in speaking all the time about  the stability of the government he says that a fundamental  renewal of the government is required. "It seems that stability  applies only to the very top or to the confirmation in the  Seimas of the same personnel who are already in the government,  in order to create the illusion that the government is new, and  that it should not be criticized for a period of time. Or maybe  this is simply avoiding responsibility," V. Landsbergis said.    In that same article by G. Kirkilas, there is "an unclear  offer of coalition to those who are unnecessarily issuing  interpellations," according to the professor. Obviously the LDDP  comprehends that the burden of governing is not after all so  simple. This is why the "old gimmick" was again being used,  namely, that the opposition had refused to cooperate. This was  not true, because the opposition had refused only after "being  kicked": it had offered on a number of occasions to reach  agreement reasonably on some very concrete issues. But the  ruling party had not accepted a single proposal, because it is  convinced that it alone has a mandate to govern the country. The  results are plain to see: internally, great damage resulting  from the governing of the LDDP, and abroad, time has been wasted  in many areas learning some elementary things. The only good  thing is that the LDDP is already beginning to understand that  it is necessary to be more oriented toward the West.    So the only "democratic and civilized" way out of the  current  crisis is to hold new elections next spring, in the opinion of  the leader of the opposition. The Seimas itself could make such  a decision. V. Landsbergis called the initiative by the  Nationalists for early elections correct, but said they had not  quite started in time. For this reason, the initiative might be  unsuccessful.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS AT MANHATTAN BEACH;  </P> <P> MARTINA BACK IN TOP FORM, 6-3, 6-2  </P> <P> What is the tennis version of Showtime?  </P> <P> Why, it's the Martina Navratilova Show, featuring serves speedier than a Laker  fast break, lobs taller than Magic Johnson on tiptoes and volleys deeper than  Pat Riley's inner thoughts.  </P> <P> There's no place like Los Angeles to put on a show, playing tennis all the  while, says Navratilova, who ought to know because she has been coming here and  knocking balls around since 1974.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, Isabelle Demongeot got in the way of Navratilova's  performance, but not for long.  </P> <P> Under the lights, Navratilova scored a 6-3, 6-2 second-round victory in the  Virginia Slims of Los Angeles and the winner thought it was a pretty good show.  But it always has to be, she said.  </P> <P> "This is L.A.," Navratilova said. "You people are really critical here. You're  used to the very best in entertainment.  </P> <P> "So I'm aware of a need to perform well. If you're playing in a city where you  don't get much stuff, smaller places people are thrilled to see you, period.  You can just about miss every shot and they're still clapping.  </P> <P> "Here, it's different."  </P> <P> At 33, it's the same old Navratilova. Well, almost. She feels like she's in  pretty good shape after training in Aspen, Colo., by riding her bicycle up  hills and lifting weights.  </P> <P> But she was playing her first match since losing to Steffi Graf in the  Wimbledon final and her first on a hardcourt since the Australian Open in  January.  </P> <P> The result? Except for one game in which she double-faulted three times,  Navratilova showed a formidable serve, a whole bunch of well-timed returns and  enough sharp volleys to keep Demongeot, 23, in perpetual trouble.  </P> <P> Demongeot, of France, went for big first serves, but did not get a high  percentage of them in, so Navratilova wound up with what she called a  "comfortable" victory.  </P> <P> In fact, Navratilova had to weather only one rough spot, that one when she was  broken in the first game of the second set after three double faults three  times.  </P> <P> She blamed her five-week layoff for that game, which she traced to rustiness.  </P> <P> Demongeot was suitably impressed.  </P> <P> "I think she's still good," Demongeot said.  </P> <P> Distracting, too, she said. Navratilova played to the audience at Manhattan  Country Club a couple of times -- spanking herself with her racket after  missing a drop shot and deliberately hitting a ball to a man in the stands  after he had dropped a ball hit to him just before.  </P> <P> "It's difficult," Demongeot said. "She's talking to the public and everything  and it's a show."  </P> <P> No kidding, Navratilova said.  </P> <P> "If she's aware of it, she shouldn't be," Navratilova said.  </P> <P> After all, the show must go on.  </P> <P> How long, Hana?  </P> <P> Two years ago, she was a member of that exclusive club, the top 10, checking in  at No. 5. Now, Hana Mandlikova thinks she is going to be there again.  </P> <P> She just isn't sure when.  </P> <P> "It took (John) McEnroe two years," said the 18th-ranked Mandlikova. "It might  take me a year, two years. It might take me six months."  </P> <P> Funny, that's how long her second set seemed Tuesday in an up, down and up  again, 6-1, 0-6, 6-2, third-round victory over Amy Frazier, 17, of Rochester  Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> No matter how it looked -- double fault at 0-5 and overhead into the net on set  point -- Mandlikova said it wasn't a matter of her taking a nose-dive in the  second set as much as it was Frazier firing winners past her.  </P> <P> "She kept hitting bullets at me," Mandlikova said.  </P> <P> There is one bullet heading in Mandlikova's direction that she might not be  able to dodge: Martina Navratilova, who must first defeat Terry Phelps today.  </P> <P> Mandlikova is 0-4 against Navratilova this year and has not won a set.  </P> <P> Pam Shriver lost her serve once and it cost her the first set, then took out  her aggression on Claudia Porwick of West Germany.  </P> <P> Shriver advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, victory, allowing  Porwick only 11 points in the third set.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova said she hasn't necessarily closed the door forever on Pam  Shriver as a doubles partner. "This is not a permanent situation," Navratilova  said. "It's way up in the air." . . . Meanwhile, Shriver has discovered that if  she has extra time on her hands from not playing doubles, then fishing is a lot  of fun. Shriver recently taken up angling. "I think it's a great hobby except  when you have to take the hook out of the fish's mouth." Shriver is working  with a new coach, Jason Goodall, 22, who was once the No. 2-ranked player in  England. . . . Women's tennis historian Ted Tinling received the Billie Jean  King Award for service to women's tennis.  </P></p>

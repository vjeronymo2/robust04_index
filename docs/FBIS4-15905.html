It will be held from April 20 to July 1 and citizens  from 18 to 25 years of age, who do not have a right to delay  their recruitment, will be recruited.    According to an inter-governmental agreement, about 600  draftees will serve together with Russian border guards on the  Turkish border. They join on a voluntary basis the "Georgia"  armed group of the Caucasian special district of Russian  border-guard troops on the Turkish border.    The special district was created in March, this year,  following a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It  includes the relevant armed groups in the Transcaucasian region:  "Georgia", "Azerbaijan" and "Armenia".    As against Russian conscripts, Georgian draftees will be  administered not to an oath, but to a solemn obligation.</p>

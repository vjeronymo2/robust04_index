			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PORTRAIT OF CHET BAKER  </P> <P> Feather's assertion that Baker "was a limited trumpeter . . . and an even less  talented singer" is way off the mark and damning to Baker's talent ("Film  Portrait Does Jazz a Disservice").  </P> <P> The first time I heard Baker's voice, I said to myself, "That's not singing,  that's communicating!" He didn't take over a song, but rather he made it a  listener's song.  </P> <P> Baker had a talent to give of himself, like a Nina Simone or a Piaf or a Merle  Haggard and damn few others.  </P> <P> Chet Baker is gone and so are his troubles. The important thing is that his  legacy lives on.  </P> <P> TOMATA DU PLENTY  </P> <P> Silverlake  </P></p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Last lap in the Gatt race PETER SUTHERLAND took over as director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade less than two months ago. But already he has injected urgency into efforts to complete the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations by the end of the year. This was badly needed. But it will not be enough on its own. Also required is political commitment at the highest level. Failing that, what must surely be the last of the Uruguay round's many lives will be thrown away. The director general's strategy has been in three parts. The first has been increased pressure on the negotiators. On July 28, the Uruguay Round trade negotiations committee (TNC) agreed an ambitious work programme, proposed by Mr Sutherland, which should keep its members busy until mid-October. As he remarked, 'leaving problems for the eleventh hour is a recipe for failure. If we are to succeed in December, the eleventh hour is now.' The timetable is necessarily ambitious, because much remains to be resolved. Mr Sutherland stressed, for example, the importance of 'using the month of August to receive instructions from capitals, to maintain the pace of bilateral exchanges of offers and to bring renewed expertise and flexibility to the negotiations in early September.' The TNC is to reconvene on August 31, with the succeeding six weeks used to make progress on all aspects of market access before multilateralising the discussions in late October. Principal benefit This is an almost heroically tight timetable. To make it look feasible, Mr Sutherland has also turned his hand to propaganda. The secretariat has produced two short reports, to remind politicians and the wider public of the costs of protection. The increase in imports that governments are accustomed to view as the cost of a trade deal is in fact its principal benefit. Meanwhile, protection forces what are often relatively poor consumers to subsidise bad jobs at the cost of better ones. At this stage in the negotiations, such propaganda, though valuable, cannot be decisive. What matters most is political leadership. This then is the third part of Mr Sutherland's strategy. He has already reminded the world's leaders of the importance of this task, notably before the summit of the group of seven industrial countries in Tokyo last July. He insisted then that an agreement on market access had to be reached if the round was to be completed. Agreement, if still incomplete, was accordingly reached. Burden of blame Everything now depends on Japan, the European Community and the US. Of these Japan is likely to prove the smallest obstacle. The new government is unwilling to liberalise imports of rice. But Japan can afford neither to watch the round collapse nor to bear the burden of blame for failure. Subject to the twin pressures of a strong yen and an irate US, the government must know that free trade abroad and deregulation at home will be its salvation. If unpalatable policies can be blamed on foreign pressure, all the better. The European Community comes next in order of importance. But the EC needs a healthy multilateral trading system. The risk that bilateral trade disputes would otherwise shred the EC's common commercial policy has already been demonstrated by the German deal on telecommunications with the US. Moreover, apart from agriculture, no issue is likely to prove round-breaking for the EC. Even in agriculture only a collapse of co-operation between France and Germany seems capable of producing a rejection of what is likely to be on offer. Such a breakdown seemed conceivable when the narrow-band ERM dissolved, but looks less likely now. The heaviest burden of responsibility rests on Mr Clinton, whose job it is to articulate the long-term interests of his country. The president has to decide whether or not to fight for a dynamic and open world economy. The Uruguay round is more important economically and probably more important politically than the North American Free Trade Agreement. If Mr Clinton fails to show the required leadership in the next few months, the round will fail. These decisions cannot be evaded. His presidency will be judged by how he takes them.</p>

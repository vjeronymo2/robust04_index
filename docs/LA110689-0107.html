			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN POLL BACKS FOREIGN LABOR  </P> <P> Most Japanese believe that their country should open its doors to unskilled  foreign workers, but the government says tough entry restrictions on such  workers will continue.  </P> <P> A poll of 3,000 Japanese nationwide, conducted by the Asahi Shimbun daily  newspaper and published today, showed that 56% believe that Japan should admit  foreign workers, with 33% opposed.  </P> <P> A Labor Ministry official said Japan will "absolutely not" review its stance on  admitting unskilled foreign workers.  </P> <P> "Not only do they take job opportunities away from Japanese, they also make it  difficult for Japanese to improve their working conditions, because foreign  workers are willing to take low wages and not demand insurance and other  benefits," the official said.  </P></p>

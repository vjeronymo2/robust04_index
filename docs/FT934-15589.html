			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / UK utilities aim for expansion overseas THE UK'S 18 privatised electricity companies are likely to invest at least Pounds 1.5bn abroad in the next five years, as part of expansion plans to escape constraints on their profitability imposed by their regulators. Although little more than Pounds 200m has been committed so far by the electricity companies they have plans for projects in the US, Portugal and Germany. The electricity, water and gas companies are following the lead of BT, the telecommunications group which was privatised in 1984. Its international plans, which have met with mixed success, culminated in June with its Pounds 2.88bn purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the US long-distance carrier. However, the international push by the former nationalised corporations may raise doubts about their ability to manage overseas operations and prompt calls for tighter regulation of their international activities. Ofgas, the gas regulator, wants British Gas's international operations included in its remit. Ofwat the water industry regulator, commenting on the water companies' expansion abroad, said: 'We have been doing a lot of work to prevent cross-subsidisation - money from customers' bills being used to finance this expansion.' The electricity companies' move is being led by National Power which expects to invest up to Pounds 1bn overseas by the year 2000 in projects valued up to Pounds 15bn. It recently spent Dollars 160m on Tevco, which owns power plants in the south-east of the US. It expects between 10 and 20 per cent of its earnings could be generated abroad by the year 2000. The National Grid, which operates the transmission system in England and Wales, plans to invest up to Pounds 370m overseas in the next five years. It has already spent Pounds 23m as one of a consortium which has taken over the Argentinian transmission system. Midland Electricity has indicated to the City that it is prepared to commit up to Pounds 200m in overseas investments. International expansion is a large component in British Gas's plans, in the light of commercial and legal challenges to its dominance of the UK market. Since privatisation in 1986 British Gas has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn on foreign exploration and production assets.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Energy minister rebukes Nuclear Electric Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generator, yesterday received a highly unusual government rebuke when Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said it was for ministers to decide whether the industry should be privatised, and not for the companies. He warned the industry that it had to be realistic both about the desire of government to offer financial support and about the 'difficult issues' it would be raising in the forthcoming nuclear review. Any decisions about privatisation would be taken by the government 'when it is appropriate to do so and not before'. His comments, in a speech to trade unionists, represent one of the strongest public attacks by a minister on a state-owned company. They follow Nuclear Electric's decision earlier in the year to stage a campaign for privatisation ahead of the nuclear review that the government has promised to launch this year. Nuclear Electric, which runs 12 power stations, also angered the Department of Trade and Industry in October by applying for planning permission to build its proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk before the outcome of the review. Mr Eggar provided some comfort for Nuclear Electric by saying the long-term future of the industry must be in the private sector. 'I do not think the question is whether, but how and when it gets there.' He said government had not yet reached a firm view on the way forward and it would be inappropriate to announce yesterday the terms of reference for the nuclear review. Mr Eggar said the nuclear industry in England and Wales was often described by critics as overpriced and uncompetitive. The best way to deal with this was to become profitable without the nuclear levy. He said: 'The industry needs to be able to prove to the world that nuclear energy needs no such support in the future. 'It cannot be assumed that the government will provide the finance for new capacity in the future. In the context of an extremely tough spending round, why should the taxpayer be willing to fund new nuclear stations costing several billions, when this money could fund hospitals, schools or policemen on the beat?' Mr Eggar said privatisation had been put forward as 'the answer to all our prayers'. He added: 'I can understand the desire of management to be part of a privatised business. But it is not good enough just to have aspirations. Management have a duty to staff and the industry to consider thoroughly what the issues really are. The industry needs to be realistic about the difficult issues which it will be raising for public debate. 'It needs to be realistic about the ability or desire of the government to offer financial support.' Mr Eggar said the industry should not lose sight of the fact that any decisions about privatisation would be taken by the government. 'They will be taken when it is appropriate to do so, not before.' Separately Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the other UK nuclear generator, said the review should not just focus on commercial viability and privatisation. Scottish Nuclear is much less enthusiastic about privatisation than Nuclear Electric.</p>

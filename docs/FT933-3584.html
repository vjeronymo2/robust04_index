			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Murdoch sells HK newspaper stake MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday agreed to sell 34.9 per cent of South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, to Malaysian-born billionaire Mr Robert Kuok. The deal - valued at Dollars 349m (Pounds 227m) - puts one of Hong Kong's few remaining independent newspapers into the hands of an influential Asian businessman. Mr Kuok is well known in Hong Kong for his pro-China sympathies. Mr Stephen Brown, director of HG Asia, a large local stockbroker, said: 'I cannot read anything but politics, and the big hand of Beijing, in this deal.' Mr Kuok has no previous experience of investment in newspapers. There is little doubt in Hong Kong that the Chinese government will be pleased to see a corporate ally taking effective control of what is arguably Hong Kong's most influential newspaper. The SCMP shares are being sold at around HKDollars 5.18 per share, against the last traded price of HKDollars 5.35. Mr Murdoch will retain 15.1 per cent of the newspaper. SCMP is one of the most profitable newspapers in the world. News Corp purchased the company in 1987; assuming the remaining 15 per cent is sold at current prices, Mr Murdoch will have earned more than HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 418m) on his HKDollars 2.4bn six-year investment. The capital raised from the latest sale will cover 66 per cent of the acquisition cost of Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster Star TV, purchased by Mr Murdoch in July for Dollars 525m. The two transactions are widely interpreted as showing a switch in Mr Murdoch's focus from print to electronic media. The purchasing company is Kerry Media, an associate of Mr Kuok's Hong Kong flagship company Kerry Group; the remainder of Kerry Media is owned by other Kuok-controlled companies. By purchasing a stake of below 35 per cent, Mr Kuok avoids having to make a general offer for the company. It had been anticipated that there would be some Singaporean involvement in the deal However, Straits Press and United Overseas Bank already own 14 per cent of SCMP, and any further purchases in concert with Mr Kuok would have triggered an offer for the entire company. This will raise expectations that Straits Press may acquire part of Mr Murdoch's remaining interest in the company. The Singaporean newspaper publisher is anxious to build up its regional publishing interests and would provide a useful partner for Mr Kuok, given his lack of media expertise.

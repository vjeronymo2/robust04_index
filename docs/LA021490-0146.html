Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 2 'STAR WARS' SATELLITES IN ORBIT  </P> <P> Two "Star Wars" satellites rocketed into space today to test a plan to destroy  enemy missiles by bouncing deadly laser beams off orbiting mirrors.  </P> <P> A mirror on one of the satellites was designed to reflect laser beams fired  from a mountaintop in Hawaii back to a ground target to assess the accuracy of  a system for intercepting ballistic missiles.  </P> <P> Sensors on the second payload were to measure laser strikes in a test aimed at  correcting laser distortions caused by dust, moisture and gases as the beam  shoots through the atmosphere.  </P></p>

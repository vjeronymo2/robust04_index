			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Unions deal blow to Smith plans for party reform: Setback for Labour move on block vote MR JOHN SMITH'S attempts to reform the Labour party ahead of the next general election received a potentially fatal blow yesterday when three trade unions rejected his plans to introduce a one member, one vote system for selecting parliamentary candidates. The GMB general union, leading the campaign against attempts to remove direct union influence from the local selections; Nupe, which represents public-service workers; and NCU, the telecommunications union, voted overwhelmingly against. That leaves Mr Smith, who has recently come under criticism for a lacklustre performance as party leader, with only about 35 per cent of votes behind the proposals at the Labour party conference in September. Senior shadow cabinet members said they were confident that in the end enough union leaders would support Mr Smith's plans, in spite of yesterday's setback, which highlights the continuing divide between the trade unions and the leadership over the issue. Labour officials pointed out that, in contrast to the GMB, which has adopted a tightly worded motion, other unions had left room for manoeuvre. Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, said it was possible to find a solution that was neither one member, one vote nor the block vote at local level. The most popular compromise, with both Nupe and the GMB, centres on a register of Labour supporters within affiliated unions who would retain a different status from ordinary party members and vote for Labour candidates through their unions. Mr John Edmonds, the GMB leader, said the best option now was that the review group examining the link between the party and the unions should be recalled and make a unanimous recommendation to the national executive before the party conference. Mr Edmonds said unions were not to blame for the Tory victory at the last general election. He hit out at Labour 'professionals' who overplayed the health service and underplayed union policies for full employment in the election campaign. There was anger within Labour ranks at Mr Edmonds in particular for providing such a distraction from the Tory party disarray. Mr Neil Kinnock, former party leader, attacked union leaders for causing a 'distressing and totally unnecessary' diversion, and warned that a defeat for Mr Smith on the issue would cause serious difficulty for Labour. The party now faces the prospect of having no system for the next round of candidate selections. But a compromise involving the register of supporters is unlikely to appeal to Mr Smith. Mr Smith said yesterday: 'No one was under any illusion that this was an easy matter to solve. What we have got to do is the right thing for our party and for our democracy - and that is one member, one vote.' He has suggested arranging for union members who pay the political levy to take part in Labour elections as individual party members. Mr Gavin Laird, leader of the engineering union, reiterated his support for Mr Smith. Page 8 Smith faces uphill struggle to reform union links Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

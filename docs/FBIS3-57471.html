The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper front-pages a series of  articles on this event with the general heading "Feat of the  Besieged Leningrad is an Immortal Symbol of Courage and  Staunchness".    "True, veterans of the battle of Leningrad and Leningraders  who lived through the siege, do not look, to our great shame,  like victors decorated with laurel wreaths. The state and  society are not very lavish with signs of attention to them,"  the newspaper continues. "Paying great homage to them, let us be  worthy of their feat."    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about the musical  comedy theatre which worked in Leningrad almost during all the  900 days of the city's siege.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper devotes the entire front  and  a considerable part of the second page to reminiscences of  besieged Leningraders as well as to photographs depicting those  difficult years.    "Reminiscencing the Leningrad siege," writes retired naval  captain Leopold Sirotkin, "I ask myself: could we withstand a  similar situation today, following all changes of the recent  past in our country? I cannot find an unequivocal answer. The  situation in our country has changed very much."    The IZVESTIYA writes about a recent trip to the city of  Oryol  (central Russia) by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.    The newspaper notes that the premier's trip to Oryol "in  close company with main opponents of ousted Yegor GaYdar (former  vice-premier) and Boris Fedorov (former finance minister) looked  like a political demonstration" against the background of the  still uncomplete drama of forming a new cabinet and resolute  ousting "antagonists of easy distribution of budget funds".    At the same time, IZVESTIYA continues, the concluding speech  by Chernomyrdin at a conference on the revival of central  Russia, which took place in Oryol, "threw into confusion the  uninitiated, since Chernomyrdin praised the policy pursued by  Gaydar and Fedorov ousted from the cabinet".    The same newspaper features Fedorov's interview with  IZVESTIYA and the INTERFAX news agency. He points to the  absence of sufficient powers to conduct "his own financial  policy" as the main reason for his refusal to take the post of  finance minister in the renewed cabinet.    The former minister claimed that "it would be impossible to  raise production" in the conditions of galloping inflation which  is already forecast.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an extract from  former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy's book "Collapse of the  Power", describing political life in Russia in 1993 and the  tragic October events in Moscow.    The newspaper reproduces Rutskoy's photograph at the  Lefortovo prison printed in IZVESTIYA on Wednesday.    The same newspaper carries an interview with Aleksandr  Gorbovskiy, a high-ranking official from the committee for  conventional problems of chemical and biological weapons.    He writes that Russia has not violated any treaties on  chemical weapons, adding that it is no less difficult to destroy  these weapons than to develop them.    Replying to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Vladimir Kazimirov, special  representative of the Russian president on Nagorno-Karabakh,  stresses that the main thing now is to prevent  internationalisation of the Azeri-Armenian conflict in that  region, which has deteriorated over the past few days.</p>

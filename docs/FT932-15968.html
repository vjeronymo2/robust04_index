			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Insurer opposes disclosure plan NORWICH UNION, the UK's second-largest mutual life insurer, yesterday signalled that it may oppose the Office of Fair Trading's proposal that independent financial advisers should reveal their commissions in cash terms. At the announcement of Norwich Union's annual results, Mr Allan Bridgewater, group chief executive, and chairman-elect of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'We are seeking positively to find ways of reacting to the report. What we are not supportive of is that there should be one particular professional distribution channel singled out for extra publication without some examination of the level playing field implications.' However, he echoed the views of Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential, by voicing broad support for the Office of Fair Trading's proposals. He said: 'We take the view that the consumer is entitled to understand the nature of the contracts which he or she is buying.' Norwich Union also voiced concern about increasing motor and domestic crime. Higher crime levels have led to higher insurance premiums. Mr Bridgewater said that it was necessary to combat 'the decline in social and moral values so premiums can reflect a more ordered and self-disciplined society'. Lex, Page 20</p>

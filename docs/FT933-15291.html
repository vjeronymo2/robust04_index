			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: Threat to orchestras The Arts Council is close to a kill. For years it has tried to reduce the number of symphony orchestras in London. It would like to cut the four - the LSO, LPO, RPO and the Philharmonia - to two, believing this will give London two orchestras of guaranteed world class quality. But the orchestras have been unwilling to commit suicide. Yesterday the Council announced that it would continue to fund generously the LSO, which seems to be on a creative high, but the other three will have to make out a case for future subsidy before a committee chaired by Sir Leonard Hoffman. He must choose just one for support. But his card is marked. The Council has poured money into the LPO, setting it up as the resident orchestra at the South Bank. It looked with favour on its merger with the Philharmonia, which also has a base on the South Bank. It has hinted that it would consider a merged organisation and fund extra players. The obvious aim is to squeeze out the RPO, which is considered too commercial and has seen its subsidy reduced to Pounds 400,000, just 7 per cent of its revenue. The LSO and the LPO already receive Pounds 1,128,500 a year. But if the Council is moving towards a decision on orchestras it is still unwilling to name the 10 theatre companies it has marked for closure. Under a revision of its priorities it is giving Pounds 664,000 more to dance, Pounds 460,000 to visual arts, and Pounds 156,000 to education. Drama is paying the price, losing 3.6 per cent of its Pounds 40.1m budget, and 10 regional companies have been prepared for execution. But the decision has been delayed while regional Arts Boards have their say. All this is taking place against the expectation of a 2 per cent,reduction in government support for the Arts Council in 1994-95. If the Council manages to do better in the chancellor's Budget some of the threatened drama companies will survive. But all arts companies can expect to receive 2 per cent less next year than they get now, and with falling box office, business sponsorship, and local authority revenue, this is creating a deepening crisis.</p>

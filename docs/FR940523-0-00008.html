			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 10, 1994, at 59 FR 1317&hyph;1323, the Service published a proposed rule with request for comments in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before February 9, 1994. The Service received three comments relating to the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters criticized the proposed regulation for lacking any time limits for the Service to adjudicate a petition for removal of conditions. One commenter suggested that if the Service takes no action on a petition, the petition should be automatically granted after a set period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 216A(c)(3) of the Act provides that the Attorney General make a determination on a petition to remove conditions within 90 days of the date the petition is filed or within 90 days of the interview, whichever is later. Accordingly, 8 CFR 216.6(b)(1) of the proposed regulation states that the Service Center director must either waive the interview requirement and adjudicate the petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date the alien entrepreneur filed the petition. This regulation is, of course, subject to the provisions of 8 CFR 103.2(b)(10)(i). 8 CFR 216.6(c)(1) provides that a decision on a petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the date of interview, whichever is later. The above provisions in the proposed regulation adequately address the commenters' concerns as well as meet the adjudication time line set forth in section 216A(c)(3) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no provision in section 216A requiring the Service to approve a petition if the Service fails to adjudicate a petition within 90 days after filing or after an interview. Section 216A(c)(3) of the Act states that the Service must make a determination whether the facts and information described in the contents of the petition are true. Requiring the Service to ``automatically'' approve a petition after the 90-day period has elapsed would be contrary to the language of section 216A(c)(3) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the commenters suggested that the Service list additional types of evidence in 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(ii) to show that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. This regulation states that such evidence may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement. The commenters contended that although an audited financial statement is only a suggested document, it might set too high a standard in the mind of a Service examiner. They suggested other types of evidence such as bank statements or certificates from certified public accountants or officers of the investment entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As clearly stated in the regulation, an audited financial statement is only a suggested type of evidence. There is no basis for the contention that mentioning an audited financial statement in the regulation would set too high a standard. The Service recognizes that it is not common practice for all companies to have audited financial statements. The regulation will be amended to include ``other probative evidence'' indicating establishment of a commercial enterprise. The Service notes that it is possible that the evidence necessary to meet the documentation requirements of 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii), such as bank statements, would be sufficient to meet the evidence required under 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(i) and (ii). Accordingly, 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(ii) will be amended to also include ``other probative evidence'' that a commercial enterprise has been established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the commenters were concerned that proposed 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii) requires that the alien entrepreneur make the full capital investment in cash within the two-year conditional residence period. They argued that the wording of the proposed regulation should specifically cover situations where only a portion of the capital in the form of cash has been invested, with the remainder of the capital to be invested by the commercial enterprise. The proposed regulation refers to substantially meeting and maintaining the alien entrepreneur's capital investment. See 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii). As noted previously in this preamble, the regulation contemplates certain limited circumstances in which the entire amount of the requisite capital has not been invested by the end of the two-year period. Further, the word capital refers not only to a cash investment, but also to other types of investments which meet the definition of capital found in 8 CFR 204.6(e). The proposed regulation is sufficiently flexible to permit situations in which the requisite capital invested is in a form other than cash. For these reasons, the proposed rule, therefore, will not be amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter contended that the Service should state in the regulations that a good faith commitment on a debt agreement, which is secured by the alien entrepreneur's assets, should suffice to meet the requirement that the alien entrepreneur has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained the investment. Under the statute, changing the wording of the regulation to include a good faith commitment is not warranted. Section 216A(d)(1) of the Act requires that the alien entrepreneur invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital and sustained those actions during the two-year conditional residence period. The language of section 216A(d)(1)(B) of the Act uses the past, rather than the present, tense in requesting information showing that the alien entrepreneur invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. While there is no statutory requirement with respect to when the requisite capital must have been invested during the two-year period, it is clear that, by using the past tense, Congress expressed its intent that substantially all of the requisite capital be invested by the alien entrepreneur before the expiration of conditional resident status. Accordingly, the Service will not adopt the commenter's suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

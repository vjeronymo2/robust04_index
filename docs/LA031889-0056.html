			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PRISON BAN ON INDIAN SWEAT LODGES VOIDED  </P> <P> A federal judge ruled unconstitutional a Utah State Prison ban on the use of  ceremonial sweat lodges by Indian inmates.  </P> <P> Indians packed into the courtroom broke into applause, and some into tears;  and, outside, members of several tribes chanted and pounded ceremonial drums to  celebrate the Thursday order by U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene.  </P> <P> Inmates had fought for two years to be allowed to conduct religious ceremonies  in the small canvas- and blanket-covered structures.  </P> <P> Greene said the lodges were used at other prisons and he rejected arguments  that they posed a security risk. He said prison officials may decide how, when  and where the sweat lodge is used and who may use it.  </P></p>

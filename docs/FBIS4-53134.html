			<p>BFN     [Text] The air transport tax exemption agreement between  Thailand and Saudi Arabia will foster relations and cooperation  in tourism, trade, investment and exports between the two  countries, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said  yesterday.    The signing ceremony for the Agreement for Reciprocal  Exemption of Taxes on the Activities of Air Transport  Enterprises took place last Tuesday in Jeddah by Mr Surin and  Saudi Deputy Minister of Finance and Economics Dr Abdulaziz al  Nasrullah.    "According to the Revenue and Aviation departments, the  agreement would help reduce people's travelling expenses by 10  per cent and promote air transport and travel," Mr Surin said  upon his return from Jeddah.    The deputy foreign minister left Bangkok on May 9 for Jeddah  as chief of Thai pilgrims to Mecca for the annual Haj rites. He  is scheduled to leave for Saudi Arabia again on Wednesday.    The agreement was the first between the governments of  Thailand and Saudi Arabia in the last five years, he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDLAY FAMILY STAYS IN SWIM;  </P> <P> LIFEGUARD HABIT COMES NATURALLY, GENERATION UPON GENERATION  </P> <P> If a movie were made about the Findlay family, it would have to be called "They  Came From the Sea" and, unlike the dismal B-grade flicks that the title  suggests, this film would get a sparkling "G" rating, worthy of Disney himself.  </P> <P> And if an argument were made that lifeguards are made, not born, 20-year-old  Sean Findlay could contradict it simply by showing the family photo album.  </P> <P> Findlay, a Camarillo resident and Ventura College student, is the most recent  member of his family to ascend California state beach lifeguard towers,  following a tradition begun by his great-grandfather.  </P> <P> Findlay, an assistant coach for Camarillo's Pleasant Valley swimming team  during winter months, cannot remember when he did not know how to swim. "When  my mom and I weren't at the beach with my dad, we were at my grandparents'  pool," he said.  </P> <P> Sean's father, Fred Findlay, echoes his son in recounting his own childhood.  "My father was a part-time lifeguard for the city of Los Angeles back in the  days of the one-piece tank suit. They didn't have full-time lifeguards then and  the pay scale wasn't enough to support a family, so my dad worked in the mail  room at the Los Angeles Times during the week."  </P> <P> But, Fred Findlay recalled, most weekends and all summer he went to "work" with  his father -- Sean's grandfather -- at Will Rogers State Beach, where Fred  became a permanent full-time lifeguard and eventually a lieutenant for the L.A.  City Junior Lifeguard program in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Grew Up Loving Beach'  </P> <P> "I grew up loving the beach," Fred Findlay said. Like his father, he also got a  job in The Times mail room while attending Pierce College. He recalled the day  that set his career course. "I went into work at the Times Mirror Building one  beautiful morning and when I came out eight hours later, the sun was setting. I  remember thinking, 'I missed this whole beautiful day!' "  </P> <P> It did not happen again. Fred Findlay spent the next 20 years at the beach  until the Fire Department offered him a position as a paramedic. "I took it  because it was an opportunity to do something else," he said. "But I still call  in to lifeguard at Santa Monica Beach a few days a month. All my friends are  there."  </P> <P> Fred Findlay's grandfather was active in community affairs and, although he was  not a lifeguard, was enough of a beach-goer to see the need for qualified  personnel on the beaches. He was instrumental in getting Venice to form an  ocean lifeguard crew, which was then under the jurisdiction of the police  department.  </P> <P> Although Sean Findlay said he has not yet decided if lifeguarding will be his  career, he vows not to work behind a desk. "It will definitely be an  ocean-oriented career," he said. "I'm hoping to attend California Maritime  Academy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Best of All Worlds  </P> <P> In the meantime, being a lifeguard is, for both Fred and Sean Findlay, the best  of all possible worlds. "Where else can we make a living doing something we  love?" Fred Findlay asked. "Unless you're Mark Spitz, there's no great  after-market for swimmers. People work indoors all week and the first place  they hit on weekends is the beach. When kids get out of school, the first place  they head is the beach. We're at the beach all the time. The only difference is  we have a much greater responsibility."  </P> <P> Sean Findlay agreed. "I like everything about being a lifeguard, and I get paid  for it."  </P> <P> Do lifeguards always get the girl? "Well," he said with a laugh, "I'm not sure.  The first girl I ever cared about I got -- and kept. But that was at a pool.  Does that count?"  </P></p>

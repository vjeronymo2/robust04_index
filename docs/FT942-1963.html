			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Third World child health improves as violence worsens position in west The widening net of immunisation and better primary health care are improving the lives of children in developing countries, while growing violence in industrialised societies is leading to a worsening in their security, according to a United Nations report* published yesterday. The 1994 Progress of Nations report, issued by Unicef, the UN children's fund, assesses global developments in child health, nutrition, education, family planning and progress for women. The report explains the need for an examination of social development as opposed to strict economic indicators by citing cases such as Vietnam, which, with a per capita GNP of Dollars 240, has a far better child survival rate than Algeria with a GDP per capita nearly seven times higher. The assessment of quality of life for children in the industrialised world is the most striking confirmation of Unicef's view that social development is not 'an automatic by-product of economic advance'. It cites the US where one in five children is living in poverty, 8m lack health coverage, 3m a year are reported to be neglected or physically or sexually abused - triple the number in 1980. Unicef's account of social development in the Third World is predominantly upbeat. Fifteen years ago, benefits of immunisation were restricted to no more than 15 per cent of the developing world's population; today they reach almost 80 per cent, preventing about 3m child deaths a year. Falling infant mortality is coupled with a drop in fertility. Since 1960, the family planning rate in the developing world has risen from about 10 per cent to 55 per cent and family size has fallen steeply to an average of 3.7 from 6. Nevertheless, 2m children die each year from vaccine-preventable disease and a further 3m from diarrhoeal disease. The report forecasts Aids will claim up to 850,000 extra child deaths a year by 2010. Malnutrition remains the largest single factor in infant mortality. Although more than 150 nations signed the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, violations continue to escalate. The report highlights the growth in the sex-tourism industry, estimating 1m child prostitutes in Asia alone. *'The Progress of Nations' published by Unicef costs Pounds 5.00 and is available from Unicef, 55 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3NB</p>

Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David  reports that the three were evacuated to hospital, and IDF  troops launched searches for the perpetrators.    Two Arab residents were wounded by soldiers gunfire in Gaza  this afternoon. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that as  a soccer game between Gaza and Rafah teams was in progress, IDF  soldiers entered the field to pursue an armed suspect. While in  pursuit, they were pelted with stones by the spectators.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 29 January  adds: "Last night in Rafah, IDF soldiers captured a Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist carrying a Kalashnikov  and ammunition.    ["A Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Border Police patrol  near Abu-Dis tonight. The bottle shattered and ignited, but no  one was hurt and no damage was caused."]    Fatah figures have expressed satisfaction with the results  of  the elections to the Gaza Strip Engineers Association, in which  Fatah representatives were elected to four out of the nine  seats, with Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which ran on a joint list,  gaining the other four seats. [The ninth seat is to be held by  rotation.] The elected chairman is Sa'id Khurama from Fatah.  Our correspondent in the south notes that because of Fatah's  dire financial condition, by comparison to other organizations,  Fatah had been unable to achieve better results in the election  campaign, with many candidates defecting to Hamas as a result of  Fatah's inability to pay salaries.</p>

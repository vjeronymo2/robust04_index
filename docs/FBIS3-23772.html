			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentaries by Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the "New </F> Ukraine" coalition, and Viktor Pynzenyk, chairman of the  Ukrainian Fund for Supporting Reforms, edited by H. Pyvovarov:  "Do We Have a Chance To Stop our Fall Into the Economic Abyss?"]    [Text] I asked Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the "New  Ukraine" coalition, and Viktor Pynzenyk, chairman of the  Ukrainian Fund for Supporting Reforms, to answer the following  three questions:    1. Do you see a way to resolve the current critical  situation?    2. Under simultaneous inflation and stagnation, is it  expedient to regulate the monetary-financial system without  reanimating industries and agriculture?    3. Is it expedient to introduce the hryvna [national  currency] under the current economic circumstances?  <H3>  Volodymyr Hrynyov: "People Cannot Stay Long in an Abyss of  Despair" </H3>   1. Before answering this question, I want to ask another  one:  What kind of reform did Gaydar carry out in Russia? People call  it shock therapy or monetarism, but it is the pace of reform  that matters. Gaydar's reforms were rapid from his point of  view but slow from the perspective of their objective necessity.  In my opinion, reform in post-communist countries can only  survive if it is carried out expeditiously, because people  cannot stay in the abyss of despair too long. Of course,  society is not a column of soldiers where everyone can be put in  one line and told to move in one direction. Well-being of all  its members cannot grow simultaneously. Some people are bound  to get rich quicker, while others will get more and more poor;  inefficient enterprises will be closed down, and unemployment  swell. Unfortunately, nobody ever invented a way to realign the  economy to market tracks avoiding social cataclysms.    Analyzing the situation in Russia where reform, unlike in  Ukraine, was finally launched, one comes to the conclusion that  it did not start there on time either. Financial stabilization  was carried out in fits and starts, and was accompanied by cases  of credit emission.    I am referring to the mistakes in Russian reform to avoid  similar ones in Ukraine. The first conclusion is -- reform must  be carried out promptly. However, how rapidly should this be  done to avoid social flare-ups?    Being a technocrat, I know that sound travels at different  speeds in different media and attempts to accelerate this  process may ruin the latter. The same can be said about reform:  It should be carried out as rapidly as the social situation and  people's mentality allow it. As I said, there always will be  people dissatisfied with the heavy burden of reform. Thus,  economic reform should be carried out on the "threshold" of  people's patience and readiness to carry its weight. If reform  slows down, this may lead to the accumulation of discontent and  thus, disrupt the process. At the same time, excessive speed of  reform may result in the people's failure to understand the  cause of the former.    I understand that your question is: What should we do in  Ukraine to prevent this? In the first place, privatization must  be carried out expeditiously. Ukraine is mature enough for mass  privatization. One might say that in the West this process  lasted decades. However, there is a big difference between us  and them. Private property in the West has long existed and a  normal process of economic development is under way. Thus, the  Western variant of privatization involves the selling of  facilities that have not been privatized by now. They have  nowhere to hurry, while we want this process to be carried out  rapidly. Why? Because we need a stratum of owners for  alleviating social tension. Owners are quite different from  beggars who have nothing to lose other than their chains.    The second important aspect is the creation of a land  market.  This market should not be limited to rural areas; land should  also be sold in urban areas, where enterprises should be sold  along with land to private owners, including foreigners. Today,  we have the potential to inject financial means in the economy  by using the real resources that we possess, including land,  enterprises, and real estate. These are noninflationary means  facilitating structural reshaping of which much is being said  and little done.    I understand that we cannot embrace the entire economy with  these stabilizing measures, and I have always advocated the  forming of "stability islands" as the first step. Hopes that  the economic giant malformed and destabilized for 70 years can  be brought back to its feet in one rush, are futile. At the  same time, we can initiate this process in special economic  zones and territories where market mechanisms will be launched,  including the functioning of securities, shares, bonds, and  other components of a normal economy.    Yet, sticking to the ideology, we have been stubbornly  trying  to revive our economy by macroeconomic means. This is doomed to  failure. Whether we want it or not, we will have to begin with  reform in regions and stabilize the economy "bit by bit." This  should be done on the basis of the entire system of markets --  those of land, capital, real estate, labor, and products.    2. We have always been told that priority should be given to  production. This has become a part of our socialist mentality.  Proceeding from this postulate, we have tried to expand  production and now, we are as ardently attempting to save the  latter. Yet, let us answer this question: Why save it? What  advantages is this going to bring? Only those enterprises  should be preserved that meet peoples' demands. We have no way  to maintain production, other than subsidizing priority  enterprises and branches vital for the economy. All others must  take care of themselves.    Our "care" for production results in destroying the economy.  In market economies the main goal is to sell a product not just  manufacture it.    The rapid formation of a class of owners is not sufficient  for enhancing the efficiency of production; on the contrary,  this might have the opposite effect. However, this is a  precondition for the optimal use of privatization money. This  money can be spent on modernizing the capital stock and  introducing new technologies. Enterprises will begin  manufacturing products for which there is a demand, which can be  rapidly sold and yield high profits.    This means that privatization is a priority in the creation  of a market economy that would be stable and efficient. A land  market is a necessary prerequisite for financial stabilization.  An intensive flow of capital will create noninflationary  sources for the structural reshaping of the production sector.    Finally, we should constantly explain to the people the  meaning of all measures taken to reform the economy. Only then,  can reform be carried out firmly and rapidly, supported by a  majority of people.    3. The exhaustion of the coupon has become evident. This is  why the demands to urgently introduce the hryvna are becoming  louder and louder. Hopes that the new monetary unit will  resolve our financial problems are very naive.    The power of national currencies does not depend on what  name  is printed on a piece of paper, but what material wealth backs  it. Russia's raw materials, although sold at dumping prices,  serve as the basis for the ruble. What basis do we have for  stabilizing the hryvna? Our products might become such a source  of stability, but only after they become competitive on foreign  markets.  <H5>  Viktor Pynzenyk: "Not Until We Stop the Printing Press...." </H5>   1. The opinion that we do not know how to overcome the acute  crisis appeared not due to a lack of programs or their erroneous  nature, but due to a stalemate in implementing them. Thus, the  question is not how to exit the situation but how to persevere  in reshaping the economy.    There can be disputes over the sequence of reforms, but  stopping the money-printing press is undoubtedly the first thing  that must be done. Without this, fighting inflation is out of  question. Trillions of karbovanetses are being printed every  month. Production is not expanding, while the volume of money in  circulation is increasing on a daily basis. This results in  skyrocketing prices. The postulate that the more money is  printed the larger the purchasing power, is false. We cannot  consume more products than we manufacture. No matter how often  the price of bread is increased, the number of loaves will not  double.    The budget deficit is one of the main causes of the  increased  printing of money. Our state's money supply is represented by  two components: 20 percent of it is cash, and 80 percent noncash  money. Suppose, the National Bank declares that they are putting  an additional two trillion into circulation. In fact, this  money is not printed; it is only added to bank accounts. Thus,  by stopping the printing presses we will deliver a heavy blow to  the budget deficit.    This cannot be done instantaneously, just as it is  impossible  to stop a speeding car at a moment's notice. In the economy, we  need time to gradually slow down the process of printing money  and thus, curb inflation.    Financial stability will limit credit emission and reduce  budget expenditures. On the other hand, bureaucrats will be  devoid of the possibility to abuse authority and embezzle state  property.    Having stopped the printing of money we will eliminate  profiteering on inflation processes. Take this example: A  state-run store purchases a shipment of recorders costing  100,000 karbovanetses each and then holds off on selling them.  Due to inflation, the price hits 300,000 by the end of the  month. Will the store sell the recorders at the new price?  This will bring no profit. They make a deal with a private  store owner and sell him the recorders for 300,000 a piece. In  this case, the state and private storekeepers will each receive  100,000. Such redistribution of profits has become a  commonplace phenomenon. The larger the difference between the  purchase and selling price, the larger the "shadow"  redistribution. In this case, administrative control is  helpless.    The solution lies in privatization and the appearance of  private owners. The latter will not let anyone profit at his  expense. He will officially conduct the revaluation of his  products, being interested in earning more money. He will also  pay a higher tax to the state.    Ukraine also needs major changes in the sphere of foreign  economic activities. We are in need of so many different  products, especially power resources! However, we need larger  exports to have money to buy more products abroad. Our exports  are tied up with quotas, licenses, and taxes. Today, when  prices on domestic and international markets are commensurate,  there is no economic justification for preserving quotas. The  only way to regulate exports is by increasing export duties.    Returning convertible currency to the state is an important  problem. When people know for sure that their hard currency  assets are not devaluating, bringing money back [to Ukraine]  will be advantageous. Otherwise, the mass flow of capital out  of the state will continue. Only economic stabilization can  bring the money back.    Due to ill-suited foreign economic policies, exporting  products becomes unprofitable. Buying hard currency from  producers at a fixed price, the state has in fact imposed an  additional export tax. Who will trade with foreign countries  under such conditions?    This brings us to the idea of a deregulated exchange rate  for  hard currencies, which is a normal measure throughout the  civilized world. Now, the question is how to make imports  advantageous for the state.    Suppose I have received money for purchasing oil, but buy  cigarettes and chewing gum instead, claiming that my counterpart  abroad has no oil. In this case, economic mechanisms should be  enacted, including high customs duties of 100 or even 200  percent. This is the way to protect native producers.    A lot of economic notions meet with uncivilized perverted  interpretation in our state. Accompanied by credit emission,  the deregulating of prices is lethal for society in the current  situation. When we manage to avoid emission, the situation will  normalize. How?    If I have 40,000 karbovanetses in my pocket, no matter how  hard you try you cannot take more out of it. Setting prices  free and limiting emission will reduce demand and curb prices.  However, so far, we have been limiting cash payments by  limiting wages, while noncash emission has been at the same  level. Thus, wholesale prices have been increasing bringing  about increases in retail prices.    Neither should we be afraid of bankruptcy. Thousands of  enterprises go bankrupt in the United States every year.  Bankruptcy in market economies merely amounts to a change of  owners. A new owner comes, injects new funds, reorganizes and  modernizes the enterprise and technologies, and the enterprise  becomes profitable again.    2. Regulating the monetary-financial system without  reanimating industries and the agriculture is impossible. What  are the advantageous spheres of activity these days? Production  is not one of them, because it entails huge expenditures and  does not rapidly yield profits. This explains the recent  dramatic decline in investments. Given our high inflation that  exceeds interest rates on credits, it has become very profitable  to buy products and keep them.    First, measures must be taken to make subsequent selling of  the same product unprofitable. To achieve this, the interest  rates on credits should exceed inflation. This will resolve the  problem of people's savings. People will find it advantageous  to deposit money in banks aware that in a year they will be able  to buy more for the same sum.    If inflation is reduced, so will interest rates. Then,  investing in production may become profitable again unlike  middleman operations. Thus, we can revive production only by  stabilizing the financial system.    3. Ukraine has its currency called the coupon, while its  noncash equivalent is called the Ukrainian karbovanets. Calling  it dollar or hryvna will not change the situation. The power of  money does not depend on its name; it depends on the state's  policy toward it. What will the introduction of the hryvna  change if the printing press is not stopped? Thus, it is a  delusion to believe that a change in the name of Ukraine's  national currency will improve the economic situation. I am  afraid that this populist step will be made. The hryvna's  introduction has been so much talked about that people started  to pin their hopes on it. However, no such experiments should  be conducted with people.    First, we must halt inflation. Italians, Poles, or the  Japanese are not worried over the exchange rates of their  national currencies because these rates are stable. Neither  would we worry had the price of the U.S. dollar in Ukraine been  stable. What ails me however, is that the printing of money is  devaluating the coupon more and more. Under these conditions,  the fate of the hryvna will be the same.    Our experts have lately been moving toward confiscation-like  monetary reform. The claims that this alone can stabilize the  national currency are ridiculous. They believe that 9 trillion  karbovanetses are "wandering" in Ukraine. On the one hand this  is not a huge sum, taking into account current inflation rates  and prices. On the other hand, this money is not "wandering,"  because people prefer to buy a couple of dollars to save their  money from inflation.    There is no technical justification for this kind of fiscal  reform. This would be a merely technical act: 10,000 coupons  will be exchanged for one hryvna and the latter will be declared  hard currency. However, over one month inflation will "soften"  this currency so much that the hryvna will have the same  "battered look" as the unliked coupon.    Money printing is a continuous process -- once you do it you  cannot stop. The hryvna can only be introduced after inflation  is curbed.</p>

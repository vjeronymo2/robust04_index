			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo ex-chief's pay up 40% but directors to take 5% cut LASMO executive directors will take a 5 per cent pay cut this year, the oil exploration company said yesterday. The announcement followed the annual report's publication showing that Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive, saw his remuneration package increase by 40 per cent last year to Pounds 480,647. Lasmo is struggling under a debt burden which pushed gearing to 111 per cent. This will drop back to 88 per cent when proceeds of a package of asset sales are received. Last year the company incurred a loss of Pounds 385m and cut its dividend, but Mr Greentree received a Pounds 50,000 performance-related pay bonus. Lasmo said yesterday that its current chief executive Mr Joe Darby, would receive a salary of about Pounds 200,000, half that of Mr Greentree. Mr Greentree is still negotiating his severance package. Lasmo has also proposed issuing Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) of cumulative preference shares in the US and up to Dollars 250m of long-term fixed rate debt securities or Yankee bonds. The company said it would count the perpetual preference shares as equity and expected the share sale to reduce its gearing by 20 percentage points to 68 per cent. Some analysts, however, do not take the preference shares as equity. The issuing of bonds would extend the life of the company's debt as well as giving it more exposure to US investors. Other annual reports issued yesterday showed that Mr Tom Farmer, chairman of Kwik-Fit Holdings, had his pay reduced from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 234,000 as pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 32m to Pounds 17m. Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, picked up a little more at Pounds 218,000 (Pounds 193,000) but Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, received less at Pounds 352,000, including Pounds 17,000 performance-related incentive payments, compared with Pounds 381,000. Coats Viyella pre-tax profits for 1992 were Pounds 109m, against Pounds 111m published, and Pounds 97m restated.</p>

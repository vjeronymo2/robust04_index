			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland It is hard to adjust to the idea that Westland, in such deep trouble eight years ago, is now worth over Pounds 500m. But the company's medium term prospects have been transformed by good management and the Royal Navy's order for the EH-101 helicopter. Having sweated through the hard part of the recovery, Westland may be forgiven for feeling that GKN's bid is opportunistic. Faced with the current offer, shareholders may agree. Despite GKN's brave attempts to make a helicopter look like an armoured personnel carrier, there is little overlap between the two defence businesses. The industrial logic of the deal is thus weak. On the other hand, profits from the Warrior fighting vehicle will slow in 1996, just as the EH-101 comes on stream, making the deal look wonderful on an analyst's spread sheet. At that stage, Westland's UK earnings would also release a large slug of GKN's pent-up Advance Corporation Tax. Yet GKN has come in at a discount to the current market price. Admittedly, it is offering other shareholders the same deal it struck with United Technologies, and it already holds 47 per cent of the shares. But to reap the ACT benefits, GKN needs at least 75 per cent of the equity. Relying on a few institutions to tip it over 50 per cent, and then hoping that everyone else will cave in rather than remain a minority holder, is a dangerous game in a share with Westland's growth prospects. Clearly, there would be more money available for a recommendation, but that looks unlikely at anything like the current price. There are financial risks with a small company shouldering such large defence contracts. Ironically, those concerns might increase if Westland were to win the British Army attack helicopter order with the Apache. Even so, it looks as though GKN wants Westland more than Westland needs GKN.</p>

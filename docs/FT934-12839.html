			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / FBI probes financing company A US COMPANY being investigated by the FBI and Florida authorities is offering to help cash-strapped companies in the UK and Ireland raise finance. Turnberry Underwriters, which now appears to be operating out of Miami, Florida, under the name Bond Street Commercial, has been offering to provide UK and Irish companies with collateral for bank loans in return for a payment described as a retainer. This is similar to an advance fee for the procurement of expected finance, which is illegal in Florida but not in the UK. US authorities estimate that Turnberry, and companies and people associated with it, have taken up to Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) in retainers from companies in the US. They believe that companies outside the US, principally in the UK and Ireland, have paid a further Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m in retainers. British authorities are investigating Turnberry and its associates in conjunction with the FBI following complaints to the Serious Fraud Office. The Financial Times has talked to companies which paid retainers of between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 140,000, in the expectation that the US group would put up collateral against which they could procure finance. However, the deals were never completed within the time allotted. In most cases known to the FT, the companies were alleged to be in default and the retainer was kept by Turnberry, in accordance with the agreement. At least two people involved in the fundraising schemes are facing fraud charges in the US on separate matters. Turnberry has been put in touch with prospective clients by agencies which have placed advertisements in the business sections of national newspapers, both in the US and UK. These advertisements have proved particularly attractive to small companies which are desperate for finance. In one case, Turnberry did repay a Dollars 100,000 retainer to a UK company, Cybereye, after it agreed to withdraw a 'fraud alert' it had previously circulated to banking regulators in the Cayman Islands and accountants, bankers and fraud authorities around the world. Banking regulators in the Cayman Islands are now investigating Turnberry's relationship with some of the directors of a bank in their region, Guardian Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd, including its chairman Mr John Mathewson.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nakuru, 16 Mar (KNA) -- The Rift Valley provincial  commissioner [PC], Mr. Ishmael Chelang'a, has strongly refuted a  story appearing in today's THE STANDARD newspaper that nine  people died and hundreds others were displaced in fresh clashes  in Molo Division of Nakuru District and vowed that the  government will not rest until the motive of the perpetrators of  the falsehood is unearthed.    Terming the story as total lies, Mr. Chelang'a expressed  shock that anyone in their right mind could engage himself in  disinformation campaign with the aim of inciting people into  chaos. He said the government will deal with the authors firmly  and ruthlessly.    Mr. Chelang'a, who was addressing members of the press in  his  office, lamented that similar disinformation campaigns  responsible for the clashes which hit parts of the province last  year, aimed at setting the country on the war path, which could  not be allowed [sentence as received]. He called on the  security officers in the province to be on the lookout, noting  that the story had given a clear indication that last year's  instigators of the clashes had embarked on new campaign, which  he explained had made a "ritual" towards every end of school  term, in order to create tension and fear among residents.    The PC said in last year's clashes similar rumours were  peddled by the same people which caused people of different  tribes to react, and he urged the people of Molo not overreact  to the false story and disrupt the peace they were currently  enjoying. At the same time, Mr. Chelang'a challenged the  editorial of THE STANDARD to send an independent group to Kamara  area, where the incident was alleged to have occurred, and  witness for themselves how people from different tribes resident  in the area were peacefully coexisting.    Mr. Chelang'a called on journalists to always countercheck  their stories with those on the ground for purposes of  authenticity, noting that if THE STANDARD newspaper had bothered  to countercheck the story they would have confirmed that it was  a fabrication.</p>

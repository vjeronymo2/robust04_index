Utterly groundless and  fanciful correlations are being made with certain changes in the  executive structures of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI).  The president of Romania cannot possibly be thought as due to  react to such irresponsible absurdities, as it is rather the  duty of those who launch them to substantiate their allegations  with evidence and not by unproved assertions," says a press  release from the presidential spokesman.    "The decree of the president of Romania ruling the  discharging from the position of secretary of Romania's Supreme  Defense Council of Lieutenant General Marin Pancea and his  transfer to the reserve was signed and sent for publication to  the official gazette. The signing of this decree has nothing to  do with the recent speculations in the press, his transfer to  the reserve corps having been decided a longer time ago," the  press release runs.</p>

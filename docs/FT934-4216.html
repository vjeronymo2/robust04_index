			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Pru defiant, others wary - Insurance tax / The Budget and You Within minutes of Kenneth Clarke completing his Budget speech, the Prudential issued a press release emphasising its 'determination' not to pass the costs of a new 3 per cent insurance tax to customers. Unfortunately for consumers, who have faced average rate increases of more than 40 per cent on home and motor policies already, most of the Pru's competitors will not be following suit. The tax does not affect long-term life insurance (including endowments) or pension policies. But it will be charged on most classes of policy which are bought by individuals - such as home, motor and travel - and, on the whole, it looks like bad news for the customer. The Pru, which insures 2m householders, says it will absorb costs through improvements in efficiency and Pearl Insurance will follow suit. 'I have decided that our customers should not bear the cost,' said David Pye, Pearl's general manager for general insurance. Most companies seem certain to pass on the cost of the tax in higher prices, however. The Association of British Insurers, which represents nearly all of them, said the tax, which comes into effect next October, represents an 'additional burden for our policyholders.' It added that the tax was 'the last thing we wanted at the present time because the cost will need to be passed on to them.' And Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, predicted the extra costs would amount to about 35p a week for most customers. 'Somehow, the cost will have to be passed on to the policyholder. I can't see how we can afford to absorb it,' said Mike Jones, head of public relations for Sun Alliance, the largest insurer of homes in the UK. Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal Insurance, agreed: 'The cost will have to be incorporated into premiums eventually.' Legal &amp; General, the fourth-biggest home insurer in Britain, says companies promising to protect their customers 'have not fully thought through the implications, particularly to shareholders who have had very poor returns from general insurance in recent years. Neither have they considered how they will deal with potentially damaging tax increases in future.' There are widespread fears also that the 3 per cent rate could be increased in future years. Most European consumers pay higher premium taxes, with rates ranging from 7 per cent in the Netherlands to 10 per cent in Germany and up to 30 per cent on some French policies. 'This is the thin end of the wedge. When it comes to taxes, chancellors are like starving men - they can never get enough,' said David Prosser, chief executive of Legal and General.</p>

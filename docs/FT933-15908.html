			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / KIO's missing cash used in slush fund, say ex-officials FORMER OFFICIALS of the Kuwait Investment Office have claimed that a slush fund was created in London in the autumn of 1990 to influence national political leaders in countries which eventually came to Kuwait's rescue after Iraq invaded the Gulf emirate. The former officials claim that some Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) which went missing shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait from the KIO's Spanish operation was used to buy political support in the west and the Arab world in favour of armed intervention to liberate the emirate. According to confidential evidence submitted to Kuwaiti investigators looking into the collapse of the KIO in Spain, substantial sums are also alleged to have been used to buy votes at the United Nations where crucial Security Council votes later provided the legal basis for Kuwait's liberation led by troops from the US, Britain, its European partners and Arab states. Members of the KIO's former management, some of whom are accused by the Gulf emirate of stealing between Dollars 300m and Dollars 510m, have persistently claimed that the missing funds were used to influence political opinion on the instruction of Kuwaiti leaders in exile. France was specifically mentioned as being targeted in the propaganda campaign, as well Tunisia and Morocco. Both the Kuwaiti government and the present management of the KIO deny the existence of such a political slush fund. However, in the first official reference to the possible existence of a London-based slush fund, a Kuwaiti parliamentary committee investigating alleged losses of up to Dollars 5bn from the KIO's Spanish operations, has been told its ex-chairman, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah, transferred Dollars 300m from Spain to accounts under his control in London soon after the invasion. The report by the parliament's finance committee quotes Mr David Betts, KIO chief financial officer, as telling it last February: 'The former president of the Office (the KIO), Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah, asked him not to mention anything about the transfers made from Grupo Torras in Spain to his account in London and which amounted to Dollars 300m in 1990. He justified the secrecy by saying that these sums were confidential and were transferred for political purposes. He (Sheikh Fahad) repeated this on several occasions.' Grupo Torras is the KIO's crippled Spanish industrial company. Some Dollars 1.2bn was transferred to Torras by the KIO from London between August and October 1990 of which up to Dollars 510m cannot be accounted for. Former KIO managers allege around Dollars 300m of that was then sent back to London on Sheikh Fahad's instructions to be used for political purposes. Writs issued against many former KIO managers in London by Kuwait this year allege this money was stolen. Mr Ismail al-Shatti, president of the committee, said yesterday: 'There were transfers reaching Dollars 510m without justification. These transfers could be considered outright theft of the country's funds.' Current KIO managers and members of the Kuwaiti parliament say the former management may be trying to hide the true destination of the money by pretending it was used to help save the country after the invasion by Iraqi forces. However, Mr Betts is highly regarded in the KIO and there is no suggestion of impropriety on his part. His testimony, if correctly reported, carries considerable weight. He was not available for comment and Sheikh Fahad is believed to be in the Bahamas. The day after the invasion Sheikh Ali Khalifa, the country's former oil and finance minister with overall responsibility for the KIO, faxed written instructions to the world's central banks saying that only he, Sheikh Fahad, and Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, the KIO deputy chairman, could authorise the movement of official Kuwaiti funds of any kind. In his evidence to the committee Sheikh Ali Khalifa denied that 'any payments or political transfers were made from the investment office in London for that period to any destination'. He said he knew nothing of a Dollars 450m loan made by the KIO to Torras in the spring of 1990 - for which no authorisation was sought from Kuwait - and that he did not know of the Dollars 1.2bn transferred to Spain after the invasion.</p>

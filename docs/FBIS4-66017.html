			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 26 (AA) -- Interior Minister Nahit  Mentese said on Thursday [26 May] that the emigration of  civilians from eastern and southeastern Anatolia to northern  Iraq is another tactic of the separatist terrorist organization  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].    Speaking at parliament's general council Mentese refused the  claims that the government was pursuing those emigrating to  northern Iraq.    `The PKK called these people there to provide international  support and to make propaganda but still Turkey calls these  people back,' Mentese said.    He said the PKK initiated all the incidents in eastern and  southeastern Anatolia and massacred children, women and old  people there.</p>

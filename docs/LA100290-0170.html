			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEASTS ARE BLESSED WITH A BENEFIT DINNER;  </P> <P> A FRIENDS OF THE SANTA ANA ZOO EVENT RAISED FUNDS FOR A MONKEY HABITAT TO BE  CONSTRUCTED NEXT YEAR.  </P> <P> Zoo News  </P> <P> Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo tossed a party last week in the courtyard outside  Prego restaurant in Irvine, drawing about 100 guests at $40 each for no-host  cocktails and a buffet of Italian specialties. The benefit raised $5,500 toward  the construction of Monkey Island -- an 18,000-square-foot, cageless habitat to  be built next year.  </P> <P> The exhibit is to be the first of 50 major projects planned for the zoo, said  Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who sipped red wine and pressed the flesh of  his constituents. Young said the zoo board has a master plan that calls for  approximately $20 million in construction and renovations at the city-owned  facility.  </P> <P> "We anticipate private funding for 90% of that," said Young, "so we're probably  talking about a 10-year plan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monkey Business  </P> <P> H Iko -- a 5-year-old squirrel monkey on a leash. The handlers (from Pacific  Animal Productions in San Diego) gave each guest a sunflower seed to feed shy  Iko, who reached into strangers' hands for the treat, then scampered back up to  perch on familiar shoulders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Animal Attractions  </P> <P> Also there were Cleo the constrictor, Marcy the opossum, Pedro the parrot, Iggy  the iguana, Barney the barn owl and a pygmy hedgehog named Spot. "These animals  are really used to all the attention," said zoo volunteer Elta Chapman, who,  with staffer Karen Cress Cribbs, brought the animals out of their cages one at  a time and held them. "This is like our little movable petting zoo."  </P> <P> Zoo board members Judy Fluor-Runels and Bradd Linn stroked Marcy's shaggy fur  as Fluor-Runels asked about possum diet, sleep habits and behavior. "So will  she have babies or no?" Fluor-Runels asked in conclusion. (No, Chapman said.)  </P> <P> Checking out Barney the owl, Karen Amies joked about the thick feathers in the  center of his face. "How would you like to get up in the morning and brush your  nose?" she asked her husband, Grif. (Not much, he said.)  </P> <P> Marilyn Sion and Sharon Ballidis reached out and touched Cleo the constrictor,  and Sion talked about her two grown daughters' having done volunteer work at  the zoo when they were teens. "They were always very animal-oriented," Sion  said. "It was a great experience for them. They learned how important the  hands-on part of the job was -- and they loved taking the animals out of their  cages and communicating with them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buffet  </P> <P> Iko settled for sunflower seeds, but the guests dug into a spread that included  radicchio salad, prosciutto pizza, garlic rosemary bread, grilled shrimp with  feta in a vinaigrette sauce, grilled eggplant and pasta in vodka cream sauce.  For dessert: espresso-soaked ladyfingers, Mascarpone cheese, rum and cocoa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Also Seen  </P> <P> Trudy Thomas, Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo board member and chairwoman of the  party. Allen Doby, Santa Ana director of parks and recreation, with his wife,  LaFaye. Ron Izumita of the architectural firm Pod/Sasaki, which is to build  Monkey Island. Also there were Ron Rus, Wanita Thomas, Donna Ayotte, Mary and  Ron Green, Yvonne and Eric Rasmussen and Kathy and Randy Smith.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quote  </P> <P> I'm a friend of a Friend of the Santa Ana Zoo," said Diane Triantis. "I  bartended at one of their charity functions."  </P> <P> "And I drank the booze," said Triantis' escort, Mike Gubbins, "So I guess I'm a  friend of a friend of a Friend of the zoo."

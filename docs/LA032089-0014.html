			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPTURING ATOMS: FIRST YOU HAVE TO SLOW THEM DOWN  </P> <P> Slowing and capturing atoms by bombarding them with photons of laser light is  easier said than done. One elegant solution to the problem took scientists  years to devise, and both the problem and the solution concern a phenomenon  called the Doppler effect.  </P> <P> In everyday life, the Doppler effect can be heard when a car passes by blowing  its horn. The pitch, or frequency, of the horn slides noticeably downward as  the car goes by because the horn's sound waves are distorted by the car's  motion.  </P> <P> As the car approaches, the sound waves are squeezed closer together like the  bow waves of a boat, so the horn's pitch sounds higher than it really is.  </P> <P> Motion also distorts the frequency, or color, of light waves and photons.  Therefore, to a sodium atom hurtling head-on through a barrage of yellow laser  photons, the color of each photon appears slightly shifted toward the  higher-frequency blue part of the spectrum.  </P> <P> This Doppler shift complicates atom trapping because free atoms absorb photons  only at select frequencies called resonant frequencies. Like tiny radios  programmed for several key stations, the atoms absorb laser photons only when  the laser is "broadcasting" at one or more of those predetermined frequencies.  </P> <P> Since the motion of the atoms shifts the laser's apparent frequency out of tune  with their resonant frequencies, scientists must compensate for the difference.  </P> <P> One solution is to apply a strong magnetic field to the atoms. This alters  their structure and fine-tunes the atomic "radios" until the laser "station"  locks in.  </P> <P> But that creates another problem. When the atoms are tuned in, they absorb  laser photons and quickly decelerate. And as the atoms continue to slow down,  the apparent frequency of the oncoming photons shifts out of tune again. Photon  absorption falls off and so does deceleration.  </P> <P> Happily, this problem is solved by tapering the magnet that surrounds the  atoms. As the atoms absorb photons and decelerate down the barrel of the  magnet, the steadily changing magnetic field keeps their resonant frequency  correctly tuned to the laser frequency.  </P> <P> Once the atoms have absorbed enough photons to bring them to a virtual stop  (about 30,000 for a sodium atom), they can be confined by a force field called  "optical molasses," which is created by six opposing laser beams pointing  east-west, north-south and up-down.  </P> <P> Since the six identical beams are deliberately detuned just below the resonant  frequency, atoms traveling in any direction with enough velocity to escape will  encounter Doppler-shifted photons near or at their resonant frequency. The  resulting increase in photon absorption slows down the atoms and usually  frustrates their escape. A difficult problem becomes a clever solution. THOMAS  V. HIGGINS  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MURRAY WINS OPENER  </P> <P> Terry Murray, possibly the first coach to get the job after his brother was  fired, had a winning debut as coach of the Washington Capitals Tuesday night at  Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Michel Pivonka had two goals and an assist in a wild, 9-6 victory over the New  Jersey Devils that ended the Capitals' eight-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Bryan Murray, Terry's brother, was fired Monday and Terry, who coached the  Capitals' farm team at Baltimore, said he thought long and hard before  accepting the job.  </P> <P> After 14 minutes of his first NHL coaching job, Murray might have been having  second thoughts. The Devils, leading the Patrick Division, needed that much  time to jump ahead, 4-1.  </P> <P> But the Capitals, their defense hampered by the loss of injured stars Scott  Stevens and Rod Langway, bounced back with six consecutive goals and won going  away.  </P> <P> "It's a great feeling, I feel great," Murray said. "But there were some anxious  moments early."  </P> <P> Pivonka scored at 11:23 of the second period to give the Capitals the lead and  late in the period, he scored on a power play to make it 6-4.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 3, Vancouver 0 -- At Uniondale, N.Y., a magnificent  performance by goaltender Glenn Healy kept the Islanders on their hot streak.  </P> <P> The former King stopped 51 shots for his second shutout and the Islanders  reached the .500 mark with their seventh victory in a row.  </P> <P> Randy Wood's goal at 4:24 of the second period was all Healy needed to run the  Islanders' record in the last 20 games to 16-3-1.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 3 -- At Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux kept his scoring  streak alive and the Penguins kept the Flyers' winless streak alive.  </P> <P> Lemieux assisted on Rob Brown's second goal of the game in the second period to  get a point in his 34th consecutive game. The Flyers are 0-5-3 in their last  eight games.  </P> <P> Paul Coffey had two assists to reach 900 points, only the fourth defenseman to  get that many.  </P> <P> Calgary 5, St. Louis 2 -- Brian McLellan scored twice at St. Louis, including  the first of two power-play goals to open the game, and the Flames won handily.  </P> <P> Goaltender Mike Vernon stopped 20 shots to win his third in a row.  </P> <P> Quebec 8, Winnipeg 6 -- Veteran center Claude Voiselle had a goal and three  assists at Winnipeg to lead the Nordiques back from an early 2-0 deficit.  </P> <P> Guy Lafleur had his 12th goal and an assist for the Nordiques.  </P> <P> Detroit 6, Edmonton 4 -- Steve Yzerman scored twice at Edmonton as the Red  Wings fought back from an early 3-1 deficit.  </P> <P> The loss to the last place team in the Norris Division dropped the Oilers into  a tie for first place in the Smythe Division with Calgary.

Occupants may not enter spaces undergoing abatement. In most circumstances, occupants must be temporarily relocated during abatement, in accordance with &sect;35.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) All abatement procedures must be concluded with a thorough cleaning of all surfaces in the affected dwelling units and common areas in order to remove lead dust. Cleanup shall be accomplished by vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum and washing surfaces with a trisodium phosphate detergent, followed by another high efficiency vacuuming. The waste generated by abatement shall be safely disposed of in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) In the case of defective paint spots of one square foot or less, misted scraping and repainting of the defective spot is considered adequate treatment. However, treatment of defective paint spots shall include proper containment and cleanup. If the total area of defective paint spots on any one surface exceeds one square foot, or if there are defective paint spots on more than two surfaces in any one room or space (hallways, pantry, etc.), misted scraping and repainting of the defective spots is not acceptable treatment. In such circumstances, the entire defective paint surface must be abated in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new &sect;35.28 would be added to subpart C, to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;35.28  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary relocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Protection of occupants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appropriate action shall be taken to protect occupants, especially young children and pregnant women, from lead hazards associated with abatement.

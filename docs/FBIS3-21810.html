			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Santos Mario in Campo Grande] </F>   [Text] In Mato Grosso do Sul State, the federal highway  police have seized another 10 kg of high-quality cocaine that  were being carried to Sao Paulo in hidden compartments built  into an Opala [a Brazilian-made Chevrolet model] trunk.    The cocaine shipment was intended for the Nigerian  connection  in Sao Paulo State. The arrest of a Bolivian citizen indicates  a new tactic by the traffickers on the Bolivia-Sao Paulo route.    Antonio Omar Sanchez, a Bolivian merchant living in Sao  Paulo, is under arrest. He was caught during a routine  operation carried out by the federal highway police on the  BR-262 Highway.    In the federal highway police's opinion, impaired by  successive arrests in which people were caught red-handed, the  Nigerian connnection is reportedly using people who do not look  so suspicious to carry the drug. Antonio Omar Sanchez was sent  to the federal police and indicted for being caught red-handed  in a crime.</p>

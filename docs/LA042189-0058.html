			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: TEMPORARY ARTWALK PROJECTS GIVE CITY A  GLIMPSE OF WHAT PUBLIC ARTWORKS COULD DO FOR LANDSCAPE  </P> <P> ArtWalk can mean much more than a mass of people trekking downtown Saturday and  Sunday to see art galleries, artists' studios, performances and the few sites  where permanent artworks have snuck through San Diego's nationally renowned  armor-against-art. It's a chance, and a challenge, to consider what the visual  arts really have to offer a city.  </P> <P> Four temporary projects in the Gaslamp Quarter and nearby areas lend themselves  very well to such consideration. Each bears implications for what things might  be like if artists and what they do were more a part of daily life here. None  are in an art gallery. All were produced through Installation Gallery, the  organizers of ArtWalk.  </P> <P> The most unusual of the four is Mario Lara's "Home," a sculpture perched on the  roof of the Arts Complex, at 9th Avenue and G Street. Here, Lara has created  another of those structures which are a hallmark of his art: a physical  mid-point between architecture, with its functional orientation, and sculpture,  which generally performs no other task than being itself.  </P> <P> This newest creation incorporates text and, for the first time, a silhouette of  a human figure. The overall structure re-creates a cage. Inside is a mock TV  with a picture of the Statue of Liberty painted on it. The cage suggests a  house -- at least a kind of house, like a large cardboard crate or the entryway  of a building that can be a house if that's all you have to call "home."  </P> <P> Lara's work doesn't shout from the rooftop, it's just there, like the homeless  people are just there, downtown. It's not a pleasant reality to confront, but  the more it's ignored the longer it persists, as is true of any problem. Art  can't solve the problem of homelessness, but it can present issues in fresh  terms that can help keep concern alive. Any community that has any concerns can  be served by art in precisely this way.  </P> <P> Concerns at once more personal, more universal and more delightful bounce forth  from the series of window installations created by Leslie Nemour for the 4th  Avenue facade of the Balboa Theatre, between E and F streets. A sweet and wild  jumble of brightly colored images -- fruits, insects, sections of road, tools,  animals and people -- inject a jolt of visual jazz into this otherwise bland  urban environment.  </P> <P> Nemour's inspiration comes from her young son, as she attempts to capture what  it must be like for him to experience the deluge of new and unexplained images  he encounters every day. Such childlike innocence and excitement successfully  infects Nemour's work which, in turn, infects its immediate environment with a  very wonderful vitality. Who wouldn't welcome this kind of influence in their  community?  </P> <P> More along the lines of what a painting does for a wall in a home or office is  Todd Stands' and Susan Yamagata's billboard, at the corner of 6th Avenue and G  Street. The image, titled "Big Nature," combines a blockish office building and  a succulent of some sort in a brooding, drawing-like image suffused with an  atmosphere of dark smog.  </P> <P> The artists presumably intend to put forth a warning here. But more  significantly, the image stands as a kind of foil to the commercial intent of  other billboards. Notwithstanding the popularity of advertising posters for  home decor, who wants ads on their walls? So why not ask that at least a little  art be mixed in with the commercial billboards that constitute one of the  principal types of "decoration" downtown?  </P> <P> When it comes to billboards, there's a middle ground here, too -- where art  steps out beyond its formal concerns to engage the world around it, as does  Lara's "Home." Billboards, with their juxtapositions of imagery and text,  naturally attract artists with this orientation. David Avalos, Elizabeth Sisco,  Louis Hock and Deborah Small are four artists with strong interests of this  type.  </P> <P> Together they created a billboard at 11th Avenue and G Street that poses a very  tough question juxtaposed against a salient image. The image shows Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr. in mid-oratory, with his hand in a fist. The question posed  takes the form of a fill-in-the-blank: Welcome to America's Finest a) city, b)  tourist plantation, c) convention center.  </P> <P> If this makes you think about recent events and controversies, then the artists  have succeeded in their intent to make people more aware of their environment,  the social environment in this case.  </P> <P> Each is part of art's continuous fabric, reflecting aspects of what life is and  what goes on in life. To deny art a place, to squeeze it into a corner, or to  dictate that disengaged, pretty art is OK but engaged political art isn't OK,  is to deny a place for life itself, because the two parallel and reflect each  other.  </P> <P> If this notion of reverberation between life and art informs people's  experience of ArtWalk, the chances increase that new and interesting outcomes  will result downtown and throughout San Diego. It was with the hope of  increasing these chances that ArtWalk was organized in the first place.  </P></p>

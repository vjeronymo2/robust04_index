			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Clarke warns on EC monetary rush MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday warned European Community countries against rushing to recreate the European monetary system as it existed before the August currency crisis. The chancellor called on the community to adopt economic and monetary disciplines that were 'realistic and take account of the lessons from the recent past'. Delivering the Swiss Bank Corporation annual lecture in London, he said that the EC's future economic discussions should be guided by three basic principles: Free markets and free trade, including the need to complete the single market and the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Sound budgetary policies to keep real interest rates down to levels that would make investment attractive. Price stability, with monetary policies in each member state geared to ensuring that the EC is a zone of low inflation. These principles - clearly based on UK policy since the exit of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago - were, he said, the right way to achieve greater convergence of economic policies while making the community competitive with the outside world. 'Only when we have achieved these objectives and only in the light of real experience, should anyone think of going back to the question of monetary and exchange rate policies,' the chancellor said. Mr Clarke, who comes from the pro-European wing of the Conservative party, was careful to provide some comfort for all sections of Tory opinion. His opening words, which referred to European union instead of the EC, were unlikely to endear him to Euro-sceptics. 'Britain,' he declared, 'will be a member of the European union for the foreseeable future.' But he depicted the Maastricht treaty as having broken the 'federal mould' for the EC. The parts of the treaty that mattered 'are not the bureaucratic and artificial timetable towards Emu' (economic and monetary union), but subsidiarity, with its emphasis on limiting community action, and the establishment of intergovernmental co-operation in foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. These elements involved the EC 'in a totally different way'. Initiative rested with the EC member states, rather than the commission. Voting, except in very limited circumstances, was by unanimity. These elements were also not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court.</p>

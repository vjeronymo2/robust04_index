			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: All the King's horsemen Ours not to reason why. Just be thankful the air of chivalry hasn't entirely evaporated in defence secretary Tom King's reshuffle of Britain's Army. True, cooks and latrine- diggers are being lumped together with drivers and so on to make a Royal Logistic Corps. But new titles are out for cavalry regiments due for amalgamation, although the peculiar logic that gave rise to the old names has become still more unfathomable in the process. The fact that the titles now refer to armoured troops is easily grasped by comparison with manoeuvres such as the replacement of the existing King's (no relation) Royal Hussars by the King's Royal Hussars formed from the Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own) combined with the 14th/20th King's Hussars. Never mind that another regiment currently carries that title (the 15th/19th). It will disappear, along with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own) and re-emerge dashingly as the Light Dragoons, which is what their ancestor regiments were called before, for reasons now obscure, they started becoming hussars early last century. Even more obscure is why, on reverting to dragoons, they should be light ones. Could it be, for instance, that they're 'light' in the same sense that beer is, or entertainment?</p>

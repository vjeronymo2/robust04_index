			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with PFL national President Jorge Bornhausen by </F> Rita Tavares; place and date not given -- first paragraph is  JORNAL DO BRASIL introduction]    [Text] The national  president of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], former Minister  Jorge Bornhausen, is convinced his party has a strong candidate  for the presidency of Brazil, a modern platform for governing,  and that the party rank and file are ready to go to work. That,  according to him, is enough reason for the PFL not to agree to  participate in a coalition unless it is part of the majority  slate. In other words, the PFL wants the vice presidency, and if  it does not get that spot on the ticket, it will nominate Bahia  Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for president. Despite  resistance from sectors of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] to a rapprochement with the PFL, Bornhausen is not  worried and almost disregards the subject. He says that Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is modern and in tune with  the liberals. The former minister respects his former partner in  the Democratic Alliance, the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party], and said people must not underestimate the strength of  the party in the coming campaign, but his judgement on the PT  [Workers Party] is different. Bornhausen believes the PT is tied  to communism and that Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is not  sufficiently prepared for Planalto Palace. Although he has  definite opinions about his opponents, his position regarding  Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] is  an unknown. Bornhausen was in Sao Paulo this week to explain the  PFL's negotiations with Fernando Henrique to his friend. At the  same time, the former minister does not rule out a coalition  with the party of Maluf, which he says is the PFL's natural  ally. Maluf's PPR has the platform that most closely resembles  the PFL's system of ideas.    [Tavares] Does an alliance between the PFL and PSDB  necessarily mean that the PFL would occupy the vice presidential  spot on a slate headed by Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso?    [Bornhausen] I believe that the PFL, with about 3 million  members, 18,000 city councilmen, over 1,000 mayors, about 200  state deputies, more than 100 federal legislators, and nine  governors is in a position to run its own candidate for  president. In fact, it has a natural candidate in Governor  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. If any alliance is to be made for the  sake of this country, it is obvious that a political  organization with this kind of strength cannot be left off the  presidential slate.    [Tavares] If the PFL were to be given ministries and  influential state enterprises in the composition of the future  administration, wouldn't it have an important and sufficient  role?    [Bornhausen] It must be very clear that the PFL is not going  to discuss participation in the government. The PFL is going to  discuss its plan for governing. We adopted a course of action at  the convention: the party would first develop a platform; only  later would it select its candidate for president. We put  together a team of Brazilian notables: Drs. Daniel Dantas, Paulo  Guedes, Paulo Rabello de Castro, Roberto Procopio Lima Netto,  Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, Nilton Molina, as well as our  distinguished colleague Mauro Salles, are all members of this  committee. I plan to have this document ready by the end of  March, and we are absolutely not concerned about what posts we  might hold. We want Brazil to experience a resumption of  development, to see jobs being created again, because Brazil's  social problem cannot be resolved by paternalism. Not at  all--unless new jobs can be created, Brazilians will not really  be able to exercise citizenship. It is a platform that gives  preference to education.    [Tavares] Won't it be necessary to hold high office in order  to carry out this platform?    [Bornhausen] The PFL is not worried about holding office in  this or that state enterprise. On the contrary: we want them to  disappear, for there to be as few as possible of them. We want a  smaller state. We want privatization. We want a modern state  where the citizen is respected, a state devoted to education,  health, and safety. There is no need to talk about any coalition  in terms of ministries. However, the political participation and  political influence of the PFL demand that it be part of the  presidential slate.    [Tavares] Has the platform changed the identity of the PFL  in  any way? What is the party's identity today?    [Bornhausen] The PFL was not born at a meeting of a group of  liberals who formed a political party. It was born at an  historic moment when the members of a political organization  decided they could not tolerate the absence of freedom to select  their candidate for president. Therefore, it was born so that  the transition to the democratic system could take place. The  PFL platform is a liberal platform. I was the coordinator of  that platform. But the party was not born of those ideas  exactly; for that very reason, we have taken some very difficult  positions at different times, because the party was not  preaching what was in its platform.    [Tavares] On what occasions did that happen?    [Bornhausen] We went so far as to have, in 1989, a candidate  for president who had nothing liberal about him, a man who even  today defends the monopolies every chance he gets. Although he  is a man of the greatest political integrity, Dr. Aureliano  Chaves is in no sense a modern and progressive liberal. He is  really a statist. So now, the PFL is living according to its  program. The opportunity provided by the constitutional revision  was precisely what enabled us to put the party on the road to  modern and progressive liberalism and be a party that truly  wants to solve Brazil's problems, via the market. The PFL knows  that is the only way to actually achieve a breakthrough on those  serious social problems that exist in Brazil. So we are in a new  phase: that of identity with our platform. And for that very  reason we do not want to discuss possible government posts. We  want to talk about ideas.    [Tavares] Isn't there a contradiction in that reasoning?  Former Minister Aureliano Chaves is now a member of the PSDB, a  party the PFL is talking about allying with for the presidential  race. And there are strong factions in the PSDB that think the  same way as the former minister does. Isn't the PFL, once again,  giving up its platform?    [Bornhausen] I want to make it very clear that the PSDB has  its own platform and that certainly if there is any  alliance--remember, there is none as yet--we will have to sit  down at the table with each party's platform and see what the  common points are and pick out the parts that Brazil needs. And  I believe the PSDB leadership is modern enough to find these  points.    [Tavares] Would you say that, right now, the party is  leaning  more towards running its own candidate, or towards forging a  coalition?    [Bornhausen] As a result of what I am doing right now with  Senate leader Marco Maciel and Chamber leader Luis Eduardo  Magalhaes, and with the party's secretary general Deputy Eraldo  Tinoco--which is to listen to the senators, and the federal and  state deputies, the chairmen of the party executive boards, and  the governors--I can say, after consulting the delegations from  the south, southeast, and west central regions, that the party  prefers to run its own candidate and that, if he wants to run,  the governor of Bahia is the natural candidate of the party  without any reservation. He would have the support and  enthusiasm of all the units of the PFL. That is really what the  PFL prefers.    [Tavares] What happened? Until last week, even Governor  Antonio Carlos was publicly advocating an alliance with the  tucanos. Is it resistance from parts of the PSDB that  hinders this coalition?    [Bornhausen] I believe the ideal is for each party to have  its own candidate. Governor Antonio Carlos announced his  candidacy, but added that it was not irrevocable and that, in  his view, the country should look beyond partisan interests.  That gesture was typical of a public figure. So we came to the  conclusion that it was possible to study not only whether to run  a candidate of our own, but consider alliances as well.  Incidentally, we never ruled out alliances with any party.    [Tavares] Is there a possibility of a rapprochement with the  PMDB?    [Bornhausen] It is very unlikely at the moment, because the  PMDB is experiencing internal conflict that will be decided at  its convention. If you don't know how the convention will turn  out, you cannot sit down at a table to negotiate. That's the  problem, but we are moving in the direction of several accords  with the PMDB.    [Tavares] For example?    [Bornhausen] At the state level--Pernambuco, for example.    [Tavares] How do you explain the fact that the PMDB, the  PFL's former partner in the Democratic Alliance, is not much of  a factor in the presidential succession contest?    [Bornhausen] I do not think the PMDB is a weak party. I see  strong grass-roots support there. It is going through internal  difficulties, there is internal dissension, and that really is  not good for the party. But to underestimate the PMDB is not to  understand Brazilian politics. It is a party with a very  significant number of members, of city councilmen, of  mayors...and it certainly will not fail to have a role in this  campaign that bears watching.    [Tavares] What can be done to circumvent some of the  resistance that has emerged among some tucanos to a  rapprochement with the PFL?    [Bornhausen] I think each party has its own life and should  live that life within its own walls, following the path of its  particular position. It is not appropriate for me to comment on  the behavior of A or B, because that is something that has to be  resolved internally. Just as I would not accept comments on  behavior within my party, it is not right for me to comment on  things outside my party, because it is a matter interna  corporis for the PSDB. I just don't think there should be  intrigues at this point. That's all.    [Tavares] Do you see Minister Fernando Henrique as an  antidote to the candidacy of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva?    [Bornhausen] I don't believe people in this country should  ever think about being against someone. What we need to be is  pro-Brazil. We need to opt for a platform that makes Brazil  resume its development, that admits this country into the world,  because today we are a country that is very closed toward what  is most modern in the world and we really must find a candidate  who is prepared to carry out an open program. Not to think  against others, but to think in favor of Brazil.    [Tavares] So Lula's candidacy doesn't scare you?    [Bornhausen] No, it is a respectable candidacy from the  election politics standpoint. I do not believe, however, that  Lula is well-prepared to be president of Brazil and I do not  believe that his party has overcome the reasons that led to its  creation. It is still attached to what is most backward in the  world, which is communism.    [Tavares] What does Lula lack?    [Bornhausen] I think Lula lacks administrative experience,  political ability, and a modern party.    [Tavares] How strong do you think Fernando Henrique Cardoso  is as a candidate today?    [Bornhausen] In the first place, I do not think his  candidacy  can be assessed until it actually exists. In other words, we  must wait until Minister Fernando Henrique says he is a  candidate, leaves the ministry, goes out into the public square,  and returns to the Senate to play the additional role of working  for his plan which is to modernize this country, in the  constitutional revision. Then we can evaluate him. What I  believe is that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a man who  is prepared to be president of Brazil.    [Tavares] Isn't there a risk that the minister might be seen  as a candidate of the more intellectual segments of society,  that he might not have popular appeal?    [Bornhausen] I think that a candidate for president of  Brazil  should be as well-prepared as possible. I cannot fault someone  who is cultured and intelligent.    [Tavares] But do you think he has charisma?    [Bornhausen] I think he has run for office before, he has  won  before, and he has lost before. Well, he has enough electoral  experience and his language is suited to all strata of society.  He is modern. Now, obviously, I have to say this does not mean  that the PFL will take that road. I repeat: the PFL has a  natural candidate in Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. The PFL  has not closed the doors to an understanding with any party.  This week, we visited the mayor of Sao Paulo.    [Tavares] What was the significance of that conversation  with  Mayor Paulo Maluf?    [Bornhausen] I believe that Mayor Paulo Maluf had been  talking with the PFL, and with the PP [Progressive Party], and  deserved to hear from us an explanation of our party's current  position. By this I mean what we are doing, what we are finding  out in this x-ray of our colleagues in terms of the progress of  the presidential succession process. He has a deadline when he  must make a decision and it is not my business to talk about  that. But I did have an obligation to tell him what was  happening in the PFL, and that is what I did. And my explanation  was clear: there is a clear preference in favor of having  Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes as our candidate. Only if he  does not run will we discuss the problem of alliances. I think I  made that very clear.    [Tavares] Did Mayor Maluf suggest an alliance with the PFL?    [Bornhausen] Of course. He proposed either supporting  Governor Antonio Carlos for president, or receiving an  indication of a vice presidential candidate on a slate he would  head. I took this issue to my fellow leaders in the party. And  that possibility can certainly not be ruled out.    [Tavares] Historically, the PFL has always been more closely  associated with the PPR than with any other Brazilian party. If  the PFL could choose between a coalition with the PPR or with  the PSDB, which road would it take?    [Bornhausen] I think the partisan/political platform of the  PFL is closer to the PPR than to the PSDB, but there are no  insuperable problems between the platforms of the PFL and PSDB.  Either road could easily be taken.    [Tavares] Isn't there a point of conflict between the two  parties, since part of the PSDB still favors some very statist  ideas that go against the PFL ideology?    [Bornhausen] In this case, I know the views of Minister  Fernando Henrique, and they coincide with those of the PFL.    [Tavares] Aren't you worried about this resistance within  the  PSDB?    [Bornhausen] I think Minister Fernando Henrique has a  position, and if he becomes the candidate, there is no reason  for me to worry about some opposing minority views.    [Tavares] You said the PFL still needs to reach a decision,  internally. How much more time does the party need before it can  take a position?    [Bornhausen] I think we will decide within a month, at most,  i.e., during the first half of April.</p>

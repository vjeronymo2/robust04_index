			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Many Plants and Factories Could </F> Be Sold Off and Their Leaders Fired"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin has signed the edict "On the Sale of  State Debtor-Enterprises." This is one of the most important  documents in the recent package of economic edicts from the  president.    A number of experts believe that the edict was not signed  together with six previous edicts because of strong pressure  from the directors' lobby because the document proposes a  realistic mechanism for removing incompetent enterprise  directors from their jobs.    But Sergey Belyayev, leader of the Federal Administration  for  Insolvency (Bankruptcy), claims that the delay in signing the  edict was caused not by pressure from lobbyists, but by the need  to finalize this legally important document.    Under the edict, insolvent state enterprises not covered by  the statute on the procedure for granting state financial  support are to be sold off. They will not be subject to other  forms of reorganization and will be selected by the Federal  Administration for Insolvency as suitable for selling off.    In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Sergey Belyayev reported  that  the sale of insolvent enterprises is designed to prevent the  process of bankruptcy or the effective self-liquidation of  certain production facilities. The term "sale of an enterprise"  means the sale of its business and property, and a change in  corporate ownership.    Essentially, selling off insolvent state enterprises is  tantamount to privatizing them. But this will not be a  traditional kind of privatization from below, through a  flotation, but a denationalization as a result of the enterprise  being bought by a new owner.    The sell-off process will automatically ensure a change in  the managerial staff. And it is this more than anything that  worries the traditional Soviet directors, who are strongly  whipping up feelings in their labor collectives in connection  with the adoption of the new edict. But if anyone will be  unambiguously fired it will be the director himself.    After the Federal Administration decides that an insolvent  enterprise is to be sold off, the contract with its leaders will  be torn up. And a new administrator, who will work within the  framework of the sell-off agreement until such time as the  enterprise is bought up, will be appointed by the state to  replace the former director. His powers will be strictly  defined by the state, and he will have no opportunity to exploit  state property, as happens under the conditions of full economic  management [vedeniye].    Enterprises will be sold by commercial tender. The main  requirement of any purchaser will be to pay off the enterprise's  debts. The nonpayment problem will thus be resolved. One other  condition is the need to put in a certain minimum amount of  investment.    Sergey Belyayev believes that there will be people in Russia  willing to buy up insolvent enterprises on these terms. In the  opinion of the leader of the Federal Administration, the  opportunity to buy up such enterprises will not only be an  incentive for the start of a new phase of privatization, but  will also be an excellent antidote to the flight of Russian  capital abroad. Incidentally, foreign investors will also be  able to buy enterprises.</p>

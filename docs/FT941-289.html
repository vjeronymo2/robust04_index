			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian earnings up 16 per cent in 1993 despite sales curb Malaysia's timber export earnings are estimated to have risen by 16 per cent to MDollars 12.2bn (Pounds 3bn)in 1993, Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the primary industries minister, said yesterday. However, he said the country's log exports were thought to have plunged by 50 per cent to 9.4m cubic metres, valued at MDollars 2.9bn because of Malaysia's policy of sustainable management. 'Total log exports are expected to be lower this year in view of export ban on logs by Sabah state,' he told a news conference. Sabah banned the export of logs in January 1993. The higher revenue from timber exports was due largely to the strong performance of sawn timber, estimated to have generated about MDollars 4.4b in 1993 against MDollars 3.4bn in 1992, Mr Lim said. Sawn timber prices rose to an average MDollars 1,823 a cubic metre in 1993 from MDollars 1,149 in 1992. 'However, in terms of export volume, sawn timber experienced only a slight increase of 0.9 per cent to around 5.44m cu m in 1993,' the minister said.</p>

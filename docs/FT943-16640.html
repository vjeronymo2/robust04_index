			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Gerashchenko wants amnesty to attract investment capital back Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, believes an amnesty should be prepared to attract Russian flight capital back into productive investment in the country. The Russian Finance Ministry estimates that Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn has flowed out of Russia illegally in each of the last two years, he added. Mr Gerashchenko, who faced fierce criticism from reformers last year but survived calls for his removal, said in an interview, 'The Russian 'new class' understands that opportunities exist for profitable investment in Russia. But they want certain tax and investment incentives and guarantees that nobody will enquire too closely into the provenance of the repatriated funds.' 'I say 'yes' to an amnesty. Why not? What will we obtain through making unnecessary enquiries which require much difficult work, will not obtain useful results and will certainly not create a good environment for investment?' Mr Gerashchenko, who remains sceptical about the efficacy of monetary policy in a country with inadequate financial instruments at the command of the monetary authorities, now acknowledges the importance of positive real interest rates in attracting savings and underpinning the rouble. 'Six months ago many citizens were buying foreign currencies to try to preserve the value of their money. Now they receive positive interest rates from rouble accounts with the Russian commercial banks and prefer to keep their funds there.' Predicting that inflation would drop to between 6.5 and 7 per cent in the month of June from 8-9 per cent over the first five months of this year, Mr Gerashchenko said he expected a period of economic stability for the rest of the summer but some tension in the autumn, traditionally a time of pressure on government spending and prices. Expressing scepticism about the government's ability to stick to the tough budget limits drawn up to conform with IMF performance targets, he said the main problem was the inability to collect taxes. 'There is a large grey economy and the government cannot collect taxes in full. That is why the 1994 budget law does not satisfy us much. Parliament continues to impose spending obligations which we cannot fulfil, although we are hoping to be able to issue more Treasury bills to raise revenue in the last quarter,' he said. Western tax experts have warned the government that if it does impose high or arbitrary taxes on foreign companies and individuals it risks alienating foreign investors who are free to chose more favourable tax and administrative regimes in the extremely competitive investment climate.</p>

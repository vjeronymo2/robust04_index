			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Honecker set to go free MR Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist leader, was last night on the point of being released from prison after the Berlin constitutional court ruled he was too sick to stand trial. Mr Honecker has been charged with responsibility for the fatal shooting of 13 East German refugees trying to escape to the west across the Berlin Wall. The move is likely to end a case originally billed as the most sensational political trial since Nazi war criminals were tried at Nuremberg. It will allow the former East German dictator to emigrate to Chile to join his wife and daughter, and it is unlikely the government will stop him going. He is expected to die of liver cancer within a matter of months.</p>

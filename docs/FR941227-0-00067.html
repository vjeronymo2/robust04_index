			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> In General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations prescribe certain federal income tax consequences of the disposition of all or a portion of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant to which a Fund relates. The regulations treat a transfer of Fund assets in connection with such a disposition as a nonrecognition event, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The transferee of the interest is viewed as stepping into the shoes of the transferor with respect to the amount of the assets in the transferor's Fund that is proportionate to the interest transferred and with respect to the transferor's ruling amount for the portion of the taxable year that follows the disposition. These regulations also provide rules for the calculation of schedules of ruling amounts for the transferee and for a transferor that retains a portion of its original qualifying interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations also contain a general provision allowing the IRS to treat a disposition occurring on or after December 27, 1994 as satisfying the requirements of the regulations if the IRS decides that this treatment is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 468A and the regulations thereunder. Another provision allows the IRS, upon the request of an electing taxpayer, to apply these regulations to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant occurring after July 17, 1984, and before December 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations also allow rural electric cooperatives to qualify as electing taxpayers; modify the information requirements that are part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts; create a new mandatory review period for schedules of ruling amounts determined with respect to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant; require that the trust agreement for each Fund contain a provision that assets of the Fund may be used only in a manner that is authorized by section 468A and the regulations thereunder; and provide that the period within which a taxpayer must substantially comply with the provisions requiring information to be submitted as part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts is the general period applicable to requests for private letter rulings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) can be divided into five general categories_rural electric cooperatives, reduction in time to provide additional information, trust provisions, disposition provisions, and self-dealing rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rural Electric Cooperatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations extend the benefits of section 468A to electing rural electric cooperatives. One commentator requested that the IRS (1) not consider earnings on assets in Funds when determining whether tax-exempt rural electric cooperatives satisfy the 85 percent test of section 501(c)(12) (which requires at least 85 percent of the cooperative's income to be from members); (2) specify the regulatory authority (Rural Electrification Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or State Commission) that is charged with approving cost of service amounts; and (3) allow rural electric cooperatives to elect to apply section 468A retroactively for all open taxable years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The determination of whether earnings on nuclear decommissioning funds (whether or not established under section 468A) count toward satisfaction of the 85 percent test is an issue under section 501 and, therefore, is outside the scope of this project. Further, it is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities to decide which of the authorities is responsible for approving cost of service amounts. These issues, therefore, are not addressed in the final regulations. Additionally, because sections 468A (a) and (g) require that payments to a Fund for a taxable year be made no later than two and one-half months after the close of that year, the IRS believes that retroactive application of section 468A to rural electric cooperatives is not permitted by the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Time Period for Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations also reduce the time for submitting additional information requested by the IRS concerning a request for a schedule of ruling amounts from 60 to 30 days. Many commentators stated that the abbreviated response time would be inadequate for a taxpayer to gather, prepare, and submit requested information. Retaining the requirements of the proposed regulations, the final regulations merely conform the section 468A rules to the normal rules governing requests for letter rulings to help expedite the rulings process. The final regulations clarify, however, that the IRS may waive this deadline if the taxpayer is making a good faith effort to comply with the deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

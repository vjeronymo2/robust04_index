			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions DURING A fairly quiet week directors' selling out-weighed buying by some considerable margin. Following the announcement of interim results by many companies, a fair amount of the selling activity actually concerns options. PizzaExpress has only spent about six months in its new guise as a fast food operator for franchises and its own restaurants. The share price has performed spectacularly since then but the sale by David Page of 380,000 shares was made to satisfy his outstanding obligations following the acquisition of G &amp; F Holdings, in which he was a major shareholder. He still retains over 2 per cent in the company. The food retailing sector has been in the press recently as the giants line up against warehouse discounters. Directors are ready to put their money where it counts and have been buying. William Morrison Supermarkets recently announced interim results that were flat, however four members of the board, including the chairman and chief executive, have bought a considerable quantity of stock. At Tesco, three directors bought shares in the company though the value of the investment was relatively small. ISA International manufactures ribbons, disks and fax paper for information processing equipment. The company announced interim results in September which showed pre-tax profits up 48 per cent on the same period last year. Three members of the board, including the non-executive chairman and the finance director, sold stock; in the case of the third director, non-executive Bernd Triebel, this left him with a holding of nil.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                No of Company                    Sector       Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Border TV                     Med       10,000       14           1 BSG                          Motr       50,000       36           1 Courtaulds Textiles          Text       33,750      182           1* Cranswick Group              FdMa       14,000       27           2 Dewhirst                     Text       16,000       14           1 EIS Group                    EngG       30,000      122           1* ISA International            Elns      363,510      422           3 Legal &amp; General               Ins       32,500      159           1* MacFarlane Group             PP&amp;P       67,500      142           1* Magellan Industries          Text      100,511      191           2 Microfocus                   Elns       12,000      207           1* North West Water             Watr        4,000       21           1 Photo-Me Intl                Misc      180,000      666           1 PizzaExpress                 FdRe      380,000      388           1 Quicks Group                 Motr       75,000      139           1 Readicut Intl                Text       15,000       15           1 RTZ                           Mng      125,000      856           1* Seacon                       Tran       50,000      100           1 Spandex                      Misc        6,500       29           2*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Aberforth Small Cos          InTr       49,000       77           1 Bristol Evening Pst           Med       10,000       35           1 Hillsdown Holdings           FdMa       20,000       31           1 Huntingdon Intl ADR          Hlth        9,000       85           1                                                 Dollars Invesco                      OthF       30,000       50           1 Morrison WM                  FdRe      243,000    2,454           4 Rexmore                      Text       38,000       20           1 Tesco                        FdRe       20,746       23           3 Welsh Industrial IT          InTr       22,000       37           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Nissan denies cuts plan NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, has denied it has told workers at its Sunderland plant that either a third of them will lose their jobs or wages will be cut by 8 per cent and all overtime and bonuses scrapped, Chris Tighe writes. The company confirmed it was consulting its 4,600 Sunderland employees over next year's production plans because of the downturn in the continental European car market. But it insisted that at this stage it was presenting options for discussion, not final decisions. It declined to say whether the threatened loss of a third of the workforce, or an 8 per cent wage cut next March, reported in the Newcastle-based regional paper The Journal, were among the possibilities floated at a meeting on Monday of the company council, the employees' representative body. 'Job security has always been a top priority; it remains so,' Nissan said. It said the company council would put its own proposals to management. Briefings for all employees were held to reassure them there would be extensive consultation before final decisions.</p>

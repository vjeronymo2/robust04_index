			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (2): A canny move by Koc - Processed tomatoes Beating the Italians at football - well, Turks can only dream of that. Beating them in the production of peeled tomatoes, however, is a much more realistic prospect. That, at least, is the prediction of one Turkish company  -Tat Konserve Sanayii - which believes that Turkey could one day supplant Italy as Europe's best known tinned tomato producer. Tat, despite its slightly unfortunate name, is the shining light in Turkey's processed foods firmament, a market leader in tomato paste manufacturing and trading and one of the most dynamic companies in the Marmara region. Turkish food concerns are proving some of the most attractive equity investments for foreign institutions. Apart from natural advantages such as soil and climate, Turkey is seen to enjoy relatively cheap labour, a large and growing consumer market and good export potential. Tat leads the pack. Floating a 10 per cent stake on the Istanbul exchange last year, Tat's shares have advanced by leaps and bounds and now stand at almost six times the issue price - and this against a background where many stocks have faltered in the wake of the currency collapse. Analysts say the company appears to be relatively sheltered from the impact of Turkey's economic crisis. 'It hasn't yet shown its face in our industry,' says Mr Ahmet Toygar, the deputy general manager. 'The farmers planted their seeds long ago, and now they're harvesting the produce.' What the farmers planted last autumn, the company is now selling as a processed product. With as much as 70 per cent of production now destined for export, the company is earning handsome profits. Global Securities, one of Istanbul's biggest broking houses, forecasts earnings could rise to TL850bn in 1994 from TL109bn last year - a phenomenal growth rate given the contraction of many economic sectors in the wake of the lira crisis and the austerity measures instituted by the government. Things are even said to be looking up at the frozen products arm where the company has been suffering from growing inventory costs, with some reports that the factories were refusing to take fruit and vegetables from suppliers. Brokers say the market anticipates a sharp improvement in performance if Tat is successful in its bid for Sek, the government-owned dairy concern. Sek has a distribution network delivering daily to some 35,000 grocery stores, which Tat can use to expand the market for its own range of products. However, after submitting a bid of TL520bn for the Istanbul-based dairy a couple of months ago, the company is still awaiting a decision from the government in the wake of union objections that the state-owned enterprise was being sold off too cheaply. Tat is the brainchild of Mr Vehbi Koc, Turkey's best-known industrialist, the founder and at 93 the honorary president of this eponymous Turkish conglomerate. Mr Koc is said to have first developed the idea for Tat after a visit to the citrus groves of Israel in the 1950s. A decade later, with some help from a Mr Fuller of Heinz - remembered by one company official simply as 'Mr Tomato' - Tat was launched. The company has three factories, processing about 7,000 tonnes of raw vegetable a day. The plants include the one at Mustafakemalpasa in the farm belt near Bursa - the original investment. Tat then acquired the Karacabey factory, in partnership with Oyak, the army's pension fund. In 1989, Koc swapped its Aymar vegetable oils company for Unilever's Dosan plant near Iznik. Tat is today considering a new investment at Balikesir which, being further south, will allow the company to diversify its production cycle and thus improve plant utility rates. The company's success derives from a number of factors - the backing of a strong Turkish parent which brings a good domestic franchise; an equity link-up with a major international buyer offering access to one of the fastest growing world markets; and an approach to manufacturing which gives the company control of the product from seed quality to the tomato delivered to the factory. Mr Toygar says the company has one other key advantage over its rivals - its hands-on relationship with the farmers. Unlike in California, the world's most concentrated tomato production area, the level of mechanisation remains fairly modest, which Mr Toygar says results in better quality and colour of the fruit. The farmers, all of them smallholders, are contracted to Tat, and provided with seeds fertiliser and most important, finance. 'Everyone of our farmers has his own computer number,' says Mr Umit Guvenc, the sales manager, with pride. Rivals commend Tat's management approach, pointing out that 'the factory boss is quite likely to find himself raised to the group production manager,' as one Istanbul fruit company executive put it. The input is not all homegrown, however. Tat now uses a processing technology called reverse osmosis, which was first developed by the US Pacific fleet during the second world war to extract salt from sea water. 'It's very near to the fresh flavour,' says Mr Toygar. Traditionally tomato processors used an evaporation technique. The main advantage of reverse osmosis is that the enzymes and vitamins remain in the fruit and are not burnt away as they were under the traditional evaporation technique for processing tomatoes. The decision to link with Kagome - which controls over half the Japanese tomato paste market - gave Tat its big break. Tat has an exclusive arrangement and is Kagome's largest supplier. Tat has even persuaded its Japanese partner to relocate part of its Italian peeled tomato facilities to Turkey - perhaps the most telling measure of Turkey's growing international reputation as a supplier. It all started in the 1960s. In 1967, in a typically canny move, Koc sought out the government-owned sugar beet factory as a partner. Seker Fabrikasi's stake in Tat was sold only last year, as part of the government's privatisation programme. Originally a national company, Tat had a sourcing arrangement with Heinz of the UK. The company then invited the Swiss Migros group to take a 3 per cent stake in 1977, which was later sold in the wake of prime minister Bulent Ecevit's anti-foreign investment drive. In 1987, the company sold a 7 per cent stake to Kagome, a well-established foods group famous in Japan for introducing (the now ubiquitous) Worcester sauce. When in 1992, the state-owned Sugar Beet Factories sold its 8 per cent share, the Japanese - Kagome and Sumitomo - increased their collective stake to around 15 per cent. Today, apart from its branded products which are sold in the wholesale market in Japan, Tat's main customers are the big food groups. 'We're supplying Nestle in Malaysia and Unilever in Brazil. We don't sell to the trade,' says Mr Toygar. After the US and Italy, Turkey is now the third largest producer of tomato paste. Tat controls 35 per cent of the domestic market. The company reported exports of TL393bn in 1993 - about Dollars 30m at the prevailing exchange rate. Its main market is Japan, but Tat also sells to North Africa and Middle East and despite quotas on tomato paste and peeled tomatoes enjoys quite big sales to some EU countries. Mr Toygar believes with the lifting of quotas, Turkey's share of the EU market could increase tenfold. Now is perhaps the time to invest. After the initial public offering last August at TL7,500, Tat trades at around TL42,000. And as one broker enthused: 'Foreigners are now buying and they're buying to keep.'</p>

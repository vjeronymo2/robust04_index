			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Cemex Dollars 1bn deal sets benchmark for Mexican debt CEMEX, the largest cement company in Mexico and the fourth largest in the world, yesterday launched the biggest Eurobond ever by an emerging market name with a Dollars 1bn, five-year offering. The deal will set a benchmark among Mexican issues and was well-received in the market. Cemex plans to use the proceeds to refinance existing debt on more favourable terms, reducing its overall financing costs and extending the average maturity of its debt. Part of the proceeds will refinance the balance of a Dollars 1.1bn bridge loan related to the acquisition last year of two Spanish cement companies - Cementos Sanson and Valenciana - while the rest will be used to prepay Cemex's 9.41 per cent notes due May 1996. The 8.875 per cent bonds due June 1998 were priced at 99.53 and rose to 100.375 by late afternoon. The yield spread over US Treasuries was 370 basis points at launch, and tightened to 345 basis points. 'It was a blow-out,' said one dealer involved in the deal, saying the bonds had been priced to ensure they would trade at a premium. JP Morgan, the book-runner, said the deal met strong institutional demand. Cemex is well known in the capital markets and has seen yield spreads narrow considerably: the spread on its seven-year bonds due 1999 has fallen from 450 basis points at launch to 345 basis points recently. Two other Latin American names tapped the dollar sector yesterday: Banco Safra and Banespa, two Brazilian banks, with deals of Dollars 55m and Dollars 100m respectively. There has been a flurry of Brazilian banks borrowing in the Eurobond market recently, as the terms are more attractive than in the domestic market. The Republic of Italy launched a Dollars 300m tranche of its 10-year bond issue, a further step in its recent bond exchange offer. Meanwhile, the EIB launched its first dragon bond issue, a Dollars 500m, five-year offering which is listed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg, and aimed at investors in the Asia-Pacific region. The dragon bond market has seen borrowers such as the ADB, NIB and GECC. One or two European sovereign names are said to be exploring this area in the hope of raising funds at lower costs.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wyevale grows 26% to Pounds 4.5m Wyevale Garden Centres, the UK's largest garden centre group, yesterday announced a 26 per cent increase, from Pounds 3.54m to Pounds 4.45m, in pre-tax profits for the 1993 year, aided by lower interest payments and a gradual increase in consumer spending. Sales expanded by 6 per cent to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 34.6m), boosted by a 2.5 per cent increase in customers numbers. The results were in line with forecasts, but the share price fell 4p to 180p. Following a successful Pounds 10.9m rights issue in November, gearing has been reduced from 36 per cent to 4 per cent; the company is now looking to enlarge its sales network. Mr Brian Evans, chief executive, said: 'We want to expand the number of outlets and improve on current sites.' The company has invested Pounds 1.2m in acquiring the 10 acre Challis Garden Centre in York, and is looking for other similar opportunities, in addition to expanding and refurbishing existing centres. Interest payments fell from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 961,000 as a result of declining interest rates and improving cash balances. Following the rights issue, Wyevale had money market deposits of Pounds 5.5m at the year end and Mr Evans said acquisitions would be funded from internal resources. Earnings per share were 9.7p (7.8p). A proposed final dividend of 1.65p brings the total to 4.4p, a 10 per cent rise. Wyevale also announced that Mr John Rudgard, group managing director of HP Bulmer, will join its board as a non-executive director.</p>

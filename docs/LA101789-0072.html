The Holiday  Bowl and ESPN originally signed a three-year deal in 1987.  </P> <P> No terms of the new television contract with ESPN were disclosed. Last year's  game earned a 6.1 rating on ESPN, making it the second-most watched event  outside of NFL games in the history of the network.  </P> <P> Finally, Moore said that the 1989 Holiday Bowl is sold out -- the earliest  sellout in the 11-year history of the game. More than 40,000 tickets have been  sold, and the Holiday Bowl is required by the NCAA to hold 20,000 tickets for  the participating teams.  </P> <P> This year's game will match the champion of the Western Athletic Conference  with an at-large team.

An extensive pattern of opening up to the  outside world in economic relations and trade has initially  taken shape.    In 1993, our region continued to implement the strategic  principles of opening up to the outside world in all directions,  paying special attention to areas in the west, importing from  abroad and cooperating with units in the interior, and  establishing economic ties with regions in the east and  distributing products to those in the west, thereby achieving  fairly satisfactory results in foreign economic relations and  trade. Total export and import volume amounted to $912 million,  an increase of 30 percent over 1992. Of this, local border  trade continued to grow rapidly; total local border trade volume  reached $570 million in 1993, an increase of 80 percent over  1992 or 68.3 percent of the region's total foreign trade volume.    Abulaidi Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the autonomous  regional party committee and acting chairman of the autonomous  regional government, spoke at an autonomous regional work  conference on foreign economic relations and trade that was held  yesterday. He said: The year 1994 is one in which the  autonomous region will develop its economy rapidly on the basis  of high efficiency, and will advance reform of the foreign trade  system. We should seize the current favorable situation in  international markets, do a good job of earning foreign exchange  from exports, and steadily develop local border trade while  incessantly improving economic returns. We should improve the  investment environment, and expand the scale of utilizing  foreign capital and economic and technological cooperation.    Regional leaders Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, Aisihaiti  Kelimubai, and Li Donghui attended yesterday's conference.</p>

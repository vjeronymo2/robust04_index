			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORCO SWEETENS BID FOR MINING FIRM TO $5.7 BILLION  </P> <P> Minorco SA, making the largest offer ever for a British company, on Monday  renewed its hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and sweetened the  proposed buyout to $5.7 billion.  </P> <P> Consolidated Gold Fields, a British gold mining group, immediately rejected the  long-awaited, renewed offer from Minorco, the investment arm of the South  African Oppenheimer family's mining empire.  </P> <P> "The board intends to resist the bid strongly," said Consolidated Gold Fields  Chairman Rudolph Agnew, who advised shareholders to take no action in response  to the offer.  </P> <P> "This renewed bid, which is of questionable value, bears no relation to the  underlying worth of the company and is clearly not meant to be taken seriously  by shareholders," Agnew said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Major Hurdle Remains  </P> <P> Under British takeover rules, Minorco needed to renew its bid by Thursday or  risk having to wait till next fall to bid again. By announcing its offer now,  Minorco gets nearly three months to proceed with its takeover attempt.  </P> <P> The renewed bid follows approval Friday by the European Community Commission,  which conducted an informal inquiry into whether the proposed acquisition would  result in a monopoly of platinum markets.  </P> <P> It also follows clearance by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission  earlier this month. Minorco's original bid automatically lapsed when the matter  was referred to the commission in October.  </P> <P> Minorco faces at least one more major legal hurdle. The offer is conditional on  Minorco winning its appeal against a U.S. court injunction that blocked it from  acquiring more than 30% of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Bid Expected by Some  </P> <P> Minorco's offer would top Nestle SA's 2.6-billion-pound, or $4.6-billion,  purchase of British confectioner Rowntree PLC last year.  </P> <P> The latest bid is worth 14 pounds, or $24.78, a share in cash and stock at  current exchange rates, for a total of $5.7 billion. Minorco's previous offer  was equivalent to $23.12 a share in cash and stock, for a total of $5.1  billion.  </P> <P> Consolidated Gold Fields' shares rose 8 pence to 14.43 pounds on London's Stock  Exchange on Monday, suggesting that investors believed Minorco eventually might  make an even sweeter bid.  </P> <P> Minorco's shares rose 10 pence to 7.66 pounds.  </P> <P> Most analysts were surprised by the latest bid, having expected Minorco to  offer between 15 and 16 pounds a share.  </P> <P> By putting forward a bid on the low side, Minorco might be buying time while it  overcomes obstacles to the takeover, analysts said.  </P> <P> Minorco's latest offer "isn't the end of the game," said Christopher Spreckley,  a mining analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing &amp; Cruickshank. "There might be  another pound (per share) in it."  </P> <P> Minorco also might be hoping to force Consolidated Gold Fields to disclose the  price at which it values itself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> South African Link  </P> <P> This is a "sighting shot," Consolidated Gold Fields' Agnew said. "They don't  know what to pay and they want to get our defenses open."  </P> <P> Based in Luxembourg, Minorco is 60% owned by the Oppenheimers' Anglo American  Corp. gold mining giant and the diamond mining group De Beers Consolidated  Mines Ltd. It already owns 29.6% of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares.  </P> <P> Part of Consolidated Gold Fields' defense in the past five months has been to  raise objections to Minorco's South African connections.  </P> <P> Sir Michael Edwardes, Minorco's chief executive, said: "We have now cleared all  the U.K. and European regulatory hurdles put in Minorco's way by the Gold  Fields board."  </P> <P> "Minorco believes that the owners of Gold Fields should now be given the  opportunity to consider the new offer on its merits and to determine the issues  which affect them as shareholders," he said.  </P> <P> Minorco told the European Commission it would sell all Consolidated Gold Fields  platinum interests should a takeover succeed.  </P> <P> Minorco also has said it intends to sell other minority stakes held by  Consolidated Gold Fields, including a 49% stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the  United States, 48% in Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. of Australia and 38%  in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.  </P> <P> This would leave Minorco with Consolidated Gold Fields' ARC construction  materials businesses in Britain and the United States, and with Gold Fields  Mining Corp. in North America.  </P></p>

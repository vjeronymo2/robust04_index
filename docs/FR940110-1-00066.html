			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonprofit or state or local government sponsored projects.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for projects that finance the purchase,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation of housing sponsored by a nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization, a state or political subdivision of a state, a local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing authority or a state housing finance agency. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;960.10(d)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special needs projects.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for projects that address special needs, which shall be defined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan, which special needs may include but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Empowering the households or residents through programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as resident management of the property, self-help housing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homesteading, and sweat equity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Providing housing for special needs populations such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeless persons, abused or battered persons, persons with AIDS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentally or physically disabled persons, or persons with substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse problems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Providing housing in rural areas or areas targeted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local, state or federal governments for community development or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revitalization through the development of affordable housing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic investment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Providing housing with special services to meet the needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of low- or moderate-income households including, but not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, child care, job training, medical care, substance abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, independent living skill training, and rental household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and homeowner household counseling. (See proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.10(d)(3).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In defining the special needs priority in its AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan, a Bank is not required to include all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special needs listed as examples above. Rather, a Bank may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selective in giving priority to some special needs and not others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in devising its scoring system. In addition, the Bank may select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other special needs not listed as examples above if the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs chosen are similar in nature to such examples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) District Bank priority. Applications for projects that meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's Advisory Council and adopted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's board of directors that each address a housing need in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's district and are consistent with the purposes of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank shall describe in its AHP implementation plan how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points for the priority or priorities will be distributed. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;960.10(d)(4).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Economic mobility priority. Applications for projects that provide housing for low- or moderate-income households that move from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to neighborhoods, mixed-income buildings or owner-occupied housing developments in which at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 percent of the households have incomes above the median income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the area, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Urban Development. (See proposed &sect;960.10(d)(5).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scoring for objectives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board's existing AHP regulation contains the following ``objectives'' scoring criteria: Targeting; long-term retention; effectiveness; community involvement; community stability; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovation. The proposed rule makes long-term retention a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold criteria and adds a new objective called ``applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation.'' A description of this new objective and the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scoring for targeting objective.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.10(e) of the proposed rule provides that an application can receive a maximum of 20 points for the targeting objective category. This is an increase from 15 points under the existing regulation. The proposed rule provides that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall award points to applications based on the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project(s) serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an application based on the extent to which the project has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of units reserved for households at certain income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

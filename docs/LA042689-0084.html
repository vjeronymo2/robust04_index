			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A key figure in two federal investigations involving Washington Mayor Marion  Barry was convicted in U.S. District Court in the Virgin Islands of drug  trafficking. Former Virgin Islands government consultant Charles Lewis, 48, was  found guilty of two counts of drug possession and two counts of distribution in  the sale of $550 worth of crack, a cocaine derivative, to undercover FBI agents  last month. Lewis faces felony charges in Washington in a separate case in  which District of Columbia police reportedly were called off an attempted drug  buy from Lewis while Barry was visiting his hotel room in the city. A second  investigation focuses on a joint district-Virgin Islands personnel project,  which Lewis headed until he was fired because of cost overruns.  </P></p>

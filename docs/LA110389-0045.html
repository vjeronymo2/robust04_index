			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG GAME;  </P> <P> MISSION BAY SEEKS PROOF OF PROGRESS;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS: TO SHOW THEY'RE NO FLUKE, BUCCANEERS MUST BEAT KEARNY -- WHICH  THEY'VE DONE ONCE IN 35 TRIES.  </P> <P> Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh already has as many reasons as he does two-way  players (11) to smile about the accomplishments of his football team.  </P> <P> Against preseason speculation that had the unranked Buccaneers finishing  somewhere near or at the bottom of the City Western League standings, Mission  Bay (7-1) has played to its first winning season since 1975 (when it was 5-4),  assured itself of its first playoff berth since 1974 and scored more points  (179) than have been scored against it for the first time since 1985.  </P> <P> But not all the talk is kind. Are long-suffering Mission Bay fans enjoying a  winning season because of -- or in spite of -- the team's talent?  </P> <P> "I think people still think we're a fluke," Pugh said.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7 against Kearny at Mesa College, the Buccaneers will test their No.  1 defense (5.4 points-against average) against Kearny (also 7-1) for the league  title.  </P> <P> "A win here would be nice," Pugh said. "This is our 'finally-get-some-respect'  game. But we want to win. This is not just for respect. We've played in a lot  of supposed mismatches, and we've come through those."  </P> <P> Kearny Coach Willie Matson is pleased with Mission Bay's new-found success.  Matson and Pugh formed a strong friendship when Pugh was an assistant under  Matson at Mission Bay for the 1984 and 1985 seasons.  </P> <P> "I wish them all the luck in the world," Matson said, "except when they play  us."  </P> <P> Kearny, with a 34-1 series lead, seems to have the clear edge. The only time a  Mission Bay team defeated Kearny was in 1958.  </P> <P> "We'll try to make it two," Pugh said. "We figure beating them twice in 35  years is about right."  </P> <P> Pugh knows Mission Bay has its work cut out.  </P> <P> "Talent wise, they're the best in the league, no doubt about it, " he said. "We  can't make many mistakes, and we don't want to turn the ball over." But the  key, he said, is that "we can't let them get out to a big lead."  </P> <P> With quarterback Tommy Rawlins -- fourth in county passing with a  185.4-yards-per-game average -- Kearny established itself primarily as a  throwing team, but Matson said double coverage on his receivers forced the  Komets to gear up their ground game.  </P> <P> "The last four weeks we've been averaging 200 yards on the ground," Matson  said. "We're pleased to see the offense diversify. Any one-dimensional team is  beatable."  </P> <P> But Mission Bay, with its thin roster, has been multidimensional from the  beginning.  </P> <P> "We have lots of players with lots of abilities," Pugh said. "(Pat) Betancourt  is a running back, wide receiver and safety. He's always pooped after the  game."  </P> <P> Said Matson: "We have to stop their run game. Then we'll be OK. And I'm always  concerned about mistakes. We just can't do that."  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Kabul waits in fear of an ethnic explosion IN KABUL - a city that has lived on its nerves all week, uncertain whether it faced attack, liberation or ethnic strife - there seemed yesterday to be a great longing for peace. 'God willing, peace will come. There will be no fighting,' said Gul Afghani, a vegetable seller in the Kote Sanghi market who took an optimistic view of the city's fate in the coming days. Far more apprehensive were the girls at a Kabul University hostel, some of them daughters of provincial party bosses or army leaders. 'We are very frightened,' said Zarmina. 'We are more afraid than ever before.' Even so, vegetable prices have fallen in the last two days and the Afghan currency has been strengthened - a sign that popular sentiment believes that a peaceful end to the immediate power struggle for Kabul is possible. Those who have most to fear from the mujahideen taking over the city - which now seems inevitable, whether or not they are united among themselves - are the top officials of the former communist regime. 'I think I owe it to myself to stay to see the end of the film,' said one such former official yesterday. He has refused to leave but has sent his family abroad. 'When I decided to stay, I accepted the worst of eventualities - that is, the death sentence. I think I will not regret it.' To the north of Kabul are the Tajik, Uzbek, and non-Pathan forces of Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, the leader of a northern-based alliance of guerrilla groups now working hand-in-hand with the army and paramilitary forces. Together they have thrown a cordon around the city. Advancing through Logha province to the south of the city are the Pathan-dominated Hezb-i-Islam forces of Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The Hezb, the most fundamentalist of the Islamic guerrilla groups earlier this week threatened to attack Kabul. Afghan officials and diplomats in Kabul do not believe that Mr Hekmatyar can take over Kabul by force. But what they fear is that he could conspire with disaffected army, militia or Pathan groups to stage another coup in the city. They see him as encouraging ethnic strife. Kabul is now the only city in Afghanistan where power has not been transferred to a guerrilla-dominated coalition that includes representatives of the armed forces. But as the capital, it is obviously the most important city. It is also the one where the ethnic mix is the greatest - and thus where the risk of explosion is also the largest. The mujahideen will soon enter to claim the prize of 13 years of civil war. But the city's population prays for a peaceful transition. The Afghan government said last night a dialogue had been opened with all Islamic guerrilla groups for transfer of power to an interim mujahideen administration, writes David Housego. The statement came after Gen Mohammed Rafi, one of four vice-presidents, met Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islam group which had earlier threatened to attack Kabul. Gen Rafi said Mr Hekmatyar had proposed that an interim administration be formed from those acceptable to the different guerrilla groups. This does not significantly differ from the proposal of his main rival Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, head of the northern-based alliance, for a 20-man council to run the country. Mr Hekmatyar also advocated an interim administration of guerrilla commanders around Kabul. The aim was to strengthen his own position in any post-war settlement. The proposals came as the International Red Cross announced that it was reducing by half its 70-man presence. An official was shot dead on Wednesday by a guerrilla apparently belonging to the Hezb group.</p>

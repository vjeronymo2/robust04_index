			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: G7 must be more democratic Sir, In his article 'Ground rules wanted' (June 29), Edward Mortimer writes of 'the intense suspicion with which the G7 is regarded by many third world governments'. As he indicates, the G7 is suspected of 'colonial nostalgia or greed for oil'. This, however, is not the full story, nor even the main story. The main limitation of the G7 must be seen in the fact that it is highly unrepresentative. The countries of the G7 represent little more than 10 per cent of the world's population. This is surely a thoroughly undemocratic method of handling problems of global macroeconomic management. In particular the third world, with a majority of mankind, is completely unrepresented, even though it is deeply affected by decisions in the G7. There is a strong case for the enlargement of the G7 by at least adding, say, Brazil for Latin America, South Africa or Nigeria for Africa, and India for Asia. One alternative would be for the UN in the person of the secretary-general to act as a spokesman for third world countries. Another alternative suggestion for making the process more democratic is to vest global economic management in a new UN Economic Security Council - this is elaborated in the current 1994 Human Development Report published by the UN Development Programme. Whatever the method chosen - and there are other alternatives apart from the three mentioned here - the case for broadening the scope of global management is incontrovertible. Hopefully this will make the process more effective as well as more democratic. H W Singer, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RE</p>

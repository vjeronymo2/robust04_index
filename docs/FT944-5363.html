			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): A new Aim for the small company - Unlisted Securities Market The Unlisted Securities Market is scheduled to be put to rest at the end of 1996, and from the end of this year no new companies will be listed on it. So what is an investor in smaller companies to do? The USM was launched in 1981, largely in response to growing interest in so-called over-the-counter stocks which were too small or too new to meet the requirements of the London Stock Exchange's official list. And while it enjoyed a surge of popularity in the mid- and late 1980s, trading trickled to a virtual standstill as the recession began to eat its way through the fortunes of smaller companies. The decision to close the USM reflects the near-abandonment of the market by both investors and listees, although, quite clearly, investors still want a place where they can buy the shares of the smallest companies. The current debate about what should replace the USM centres on two key considerations. First, what is the desired level of investor protection necessary to ensure a healthy market in small-company shares? And second, what sort of exchange is most likely to stimulate investor interest in this sector through good times and bad? The London Stock Exchange thinks it has the answer. First, it has already made several key changes to its official list, to make it easier for biotechnology and healthcare companies to join. And second, it has proposed an Alternative Investment Market (AIM), to list the shares of companies that are either too small or whose shares are not traded widely enough to qualify for the official list. Whether the AIM will satisfy those who want to buy small-company shares remains to be seen. For one thing, it is not clear that the tax advantages available to those who have bought USM-listed shares - their inheritance tax liability is reduced by 50 per cent - will be available. Also, it would be up to investors to assess their own comfort with looser regulation. The Stock Exchange has proposed that looser listing requirements shall apply to this category of company; and no minimum threshold is envisaged for length-of-trading record, market capitalisation or the percentage of shares in public hands. Moreover, it proposes that companies seeking a listing on the AIM shall not be required to have a sponsor, charged with ensuring that due diligence has been taken in preparing documentation for listing. Mr David Jones, chairman of Sharelink, a share-dealing service for private clients, argues that, as long as investors are fully aware of the risks they are taking, they do not need excessive protection. 'What private investors like is clarity,' he says. 'The proposition that you need lots of regulation to encourage them is untested.' However, others argue that investor protection is crucial to encourage private investors to buy small-company shares, and that, moreover, such shares need an exchange specifically devoted to promoting interest in the sector. To this end, a group of European venture capitalists, the Paris Bourse and the US-based Nasdaq stock market have announced plans for a new pan-European market for small-company shares. The market, intended to begin operation by late 1995, will allow investors to buy shares in small companies across Europe. Regulation will be much closer to that prevailing on Nasdaq; and companies will be required to have an investment-banking sponsor and to report market-sensitive information regularly.</p>

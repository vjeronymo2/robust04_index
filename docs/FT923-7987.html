			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: BBC Philharmonic Orchestra - London Promenade Concerts SHOSTAKOVICH'S Fifteenth Symphony, so laced with quotations, is a gift to the thematically conscious programme-builder. In Wednesday's prom it appeared alongside Rossini's Overture to William Tell, whose most famous theme dodges in and out of the symphony's first movement. Both works were thrillingly delivered by the BBC Philharmonic and reflected the prodigiously wide-ranging gifts of their conductor, Edward Downes. With his recently acquired knighthood and formal appointment at the Royal Opera House, Downes may be receiving the wider recognition his great gifts deserve, but it is useful to be reminded of the breadth of his sympathies, which stretch through the operatic and orchestral repertories right up to contemporary British works. The brilliance of the Rossini may be relatively easy to spark, but the Fifteenth Symphony is a much more refractory nut. In a fascinating interval talk during the Radio 3 relay, David Fanning delved into the work's maze of references, its mingling of external allusion and musical autobiography, finally dismissing any thoughts of an explicit scenario to the work and settling instead for viewing the work as a purgatorial experience. As such it surely invites comparison with Mahler's last two symphonic works. Shostakovich followed his song symphony about death, the Fourteenth, with this fugitive piece; Mahler followed his death-song symphony, Das Lied von der Erde, with the unfinished Tenth, whose third movement is explicitly labelled 'Purgatorio'. Such parallels must surely have struck the hypersensitive Shostakovich. But Downes resisted all temptation to turn the work into a superficial quotation game; his steady unfolding - beautifully paced and wonderfully played by the BBC Philharmonic - placed the emotional weight on the second and fourth movements, menaced by their Wagnerian references, yet preserving their implacable flow. Even the closing pages, so easy to turn into a tear-jerking slow fade, were perfectly defined, unblinking and unafraid. Between overture and symphony the young Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes played Britten's Piano Concerto, and in this context made it seem the most eastward-looking of all Britten's works, his closest stylistic approach to the pre-war Soviet music of Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Andsnes made light of the technical difficulties, propelling the music at an exhilarating pace with crystalline passage-work. The Proms audience was suitably impressed and demanded an encore, a fragment of Grieg shot through with Chopin-esque shading. * * * Barely 50 minutes after the applause for the BBCPO had died away the evening's second concert in the Albert Hall was in progress. The Australian Chamber Orchestra is the house band of the concert hall at the Sydney Opera House. Its artistic director is Christopher Hogwood; Charles Mackerras and Richard Hickox are regular conductors. Hickox was in charge of the orchestra here, with Steven Isserlis recruited as soloist for Haydn's C major Cello Concerto. Isserlis's impassioned playing was the most enlivened part of the evening. The orchestral contributions were routine and monochrome. Betwen the concerto and Mozart's G minor Symphony, the orchestra brought a short piece written for them by Peter Sculthorpe: a Lament from 1976, derived from his theatre piece Rites of Passage and receiving its British premiere. As a well-crafted string meditation, it is effective enough, but it left neither a lasting impression nor a distinctive flavour.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN ENTHUSIASTS HELP SISTERS  </P> <P> In response to "Gun Enthusiasts Stage Benefit Shooting Event" (Metro, Nov. 24):  </P> <P> In a society of guns, there are good intentions and then there are better  intentions. A good effort was made by the members of Gun Owners REACT Committee  (a group of assault-weapon enthusiasts) who donated half of the event's  proceeds to the daughters of a pregnant Long Beach woman who was fatally shot  in yet another round of gang violence.  </P> <P> One of the members even brought the sisters to the "clay pigeon" event to show  that guns could be used for sport and not for killing.  </P> <P> But 5-year-old Sasha Graves' tearful reaction to the pellet rifle indicates  that there is a better course of action: stricter gun control laws. At the risk  of cramping the style of recreational gun users, I ask: How long are we going  to tolerate the murder of innocent people by guns? Criminal access to firearms  is far too easy. As long as we tolerate such violence, and sanction it with  lenient gun control laws, we are the real "clay pigeons."  </P> <P> ELLEN BHANG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

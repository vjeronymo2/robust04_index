			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN MEETS SAFETY STANDARDS DESPITE STRIKE, FAA CONCLUDES  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines appears to be meeting federal safety standards despite a  six-month strike against the carrier, according to a Federal Aviation  Administration report filed Friday.  </P> <P> In fact, the FAA said Eastern's top management "has exhibited a more compliant  attitude toward its regulatory safety responsibilities" since the strike.  </P> <P> The assessment of safety at Eastern, which gradually has been restoring  operations since a strike shut it down March 5, is contained in a report filed  with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York where Eastern is seeking protection  from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.  </P> <P> The International Assn. of Machinists, which represents mechanics and ground  crews, struck the airline over proposed concessions in pay and benefits. Most  of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants honored the picket lines. Eastern has  rebuilt some of its operations by hiring new employees.  </P> <P> Eastern's unions have frequently questioned the airline's safety because former  managers and clerical employees have replaced striking workers. But the FAA,  which has stepped up surveillance of the airline because of the strike, found  no evidence of such abuses.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the pilots union said the FAA's view of safety at Eastern is  not warranted and that significant safety problems remain as a result of having  to throw inexperienced workers into jobs.  </P></p>

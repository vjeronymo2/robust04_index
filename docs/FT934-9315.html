			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Minister underlines cabinet's changed role A SENIOR minister's analysis yesterday of the structure of Whitehall decision-making underlined the transformation of the cabinet from an executive into a reporting and reviewing body. Lord Wakeham, Lord Privy Seal, and one of the longest-serving members of the cabinet, said that the delegation of decision-making to small groups of ministers was 'an irreversible consequence' of complex modern government. In a lecture offering a comprehensive account of the workings of the cabinet, Lord Wakeham said Mr John Major, the prime minster, had halted a controversial trend of Baroness Thatcher's premiership. Mr Major was by and large avoiding her tendency to establish small ad hoc groups of hand-picked ministers to push through decisions. Instead he was relying on the more formal cabinet committees with their fixed membership of senior departmental ministers. Speaking at Brunel University, Lord Wakeham said these committees, which embrace all the main domestic and foreign policy issues, have 'authority to decide on behalf of the cabinet'. They did so unless the committee's head took the unusual step of referring an issue to full cabinet. Lord Wakeham, who chairs many domestic policy committees, agreed that by the time the full cabinet met each Thursday most main issues had been settled. But he insisted that the cabinet maintained a vital role. 'I think many commentators who bemoan what they see as the decline of the cabinet as a decision-maker fail to appreciate its significance as the cement which binds the government together,' he said. Lord Wakeham's lecture confirmed the pivotal role of the Treasury in all significant policy decisions, and highlighted the constitutional and practical limitations on the prime minister's authority. It was 'not practicable' for Downing Street to have a depth of knowledge to 'drive policy forward across the whole field'.</p>

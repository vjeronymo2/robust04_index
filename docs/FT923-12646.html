			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Lagos jet purchase puts IMF accord at risk NIGERIA is due to take delivery of 12 Czechoslovakian jet trainers in a secret deal which could jeopardise efforts to renew a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Negotiations on the IMF agreement, a precondition to further rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) external debt, are stalled. The main hurdle is government over-spending, including defence outlays, which resulted in a fiscal deficit last year of 35bn naira (Pounds 1bn). Without a rescheduling arrangement, Nigeria will be unable to pay debt service obligations this year of more than Dollars 5bn from forecast export earnings of Dollars 9bn-10bn. The purchase of the 12 Aero L-39 Albatros trainers is believed to be part of a larger order, made last year, for 30 L-39s. Defence experts say the deal is worth more than Dollars 90m. Diplomats believe that part of the payment will be in crude oil. The military government of President Ibrahim Babangida, scheduled to hand over power to a civilian administration at the end of this year, is taking delivery of a second controversial arms order. The first batch of an order for 80 British Vickers Mark 3 tanks, worth more than Dollars 225m, has arrived at Lagos port. Nigeria already has over 70 Mark 3 tanks. Western donors say the two defence deals are part of a web of extra-budgetary spending which has undermined the country's economic reform programme. Last year, in a confidential report, the World Bank strongly criticised the lack of accountability and transparency in public spending programes, and questioned the accuracy of figures for oil export earnings. Defence experts say the Czech order makes no strategic sense. The country faces little external threat, and the priority should be maintenance of the existing sizeable air force fleet. The fleet includes 23 Russian MiG 21s, 15 British Jaguars, 21 German Alphajets, and 12 Italian Aeromacchi MB339s. Most are grounded for lack of spare parts and because of inadequate servicing. Many of the aircraft in the air force's transporter fleet are also grounded. 'The deals make no sense when you look at the military's maintenance needs,' said one defence expert. 'But the big boys always choose to buy new machines because there is a bigger opportunity for graft.'</p>

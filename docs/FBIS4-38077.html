			<p>BFN     [Text] The court of criminal appeal of Algiers Judicial  Council today issued a ruling in the case of the deceased  president, Mohamed Boudiaf, and decided to refer the defendant  Boumaarafi Lembarek to the criminal court of Algiers Judicial  Council. Boumaarafi is charged with committing a premeditated  murder, causing deliberate injuries with firearms, and planning  to topple the regime. These crimes are punishable in accordance  with Articles 254, 255, 261, 256, 257, 77, and 266 of the penal  code.    It is worth noting that the court of criminal appeal had, on  1 March 1994, ruled in favor of further investigations into the  case to examine all the elements of the inquiry. Afterwards the  measures linked to these additional inquiries were implemented  by the examining magistrate who was busy completing the  investigation entrusted to him. At the end of his mission, the  magistrate sent the file back to the court of criminal appeal of  Algiers Judicial Council which, after examining it, ruled to  refer the defendant Boumaarafi Lembarek to the criminal court of  Algiers Judicial Council. Thus, the case is now ready to be  examined at a trial. The trial is due to start in July 1994, in  accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>

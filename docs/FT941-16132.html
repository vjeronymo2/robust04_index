			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japan plans to open up its construction industry Japanese officials have been drawing up an action plan to make Japan's construction market more accessible to foreign companies in a bid to avert sanctions by the US before a scheduled deadline on January 20. The plan is likely to include open bidding for public works contracts worth more than a specified amount and other measures to make it easier for foreign companies to win contracts in Japan. The measures will be in line with proposals drawn up in October to make the construction market more transparent which helped convince the US to postpone sanctions from October 31 last year to January 20. Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, said yesterday it was up to the Japanese to take the initiative in opening up its markets rather than relying on foreign pressure. Mr Hata signalled that Japan aims to tackle disputes with its trading partners not through administrative guidance but through deregulation of its markets. This, he said, could improve the lives of the Japanese people and open up Japan's markets thus reducing the country's trade surplus. For Tokyo to try to influence private business matters, while promoting free trade, would lead to managed trade and that is something Japan should be careful not to do, he said. However, US demands for measurable indicators of progress in opening up Japan's markets to foreign products, for including NTT, the privatised telecommunications company among organisations for which agreed public procurement rules would be applied, and for using administrative guidance in winning greater market access for US cars and car parts in Japanese markets, have come up against strong resistance among the Japanese authorities and industry. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US president Bill Clinton are scheduled to announce results of bilateral trade and economic negotiations on February 11.</p>

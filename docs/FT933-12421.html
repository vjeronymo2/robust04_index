			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Karadzic calls for Bosnian talks to be postponed THE future of the troubled Bosnian peace talks in Geneva was thrown into further doubt last night after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, sent a letter to Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, suggesting that the talks would be 'premature and counter-productive'. Mr Karadzic called the talks a 'pseudo-summit', questioning whether a 'Geneva meeting at this juncture could be called negotiations without misusing the word'. He said Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had 'no intention' of reaching a settlement acceptable to Serbs and Croats, suggesting that talks be postponed until mid-autumn. 'In their reply, the co-chairmen said they expected to see Dr Karadzic here at the talks scheduled for noon tomorrow provided President Izetbegovic is here,' said Mr John Mills, spokesman for the Geneva talks. Earlier yesterday Lord Owen had warned that plans for the three-way division of Bosnia would collapse by next week if Mr Izetbegovic did not attend the peace talks in Geneva tomorrow. In the face of military gains, Serb leaders may try to put off the talks until they can force the capitulation of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army. Serb forces currently control 70 per cent of Bosnia. Lord Owen on Thursday postponed the final round of the peace talks because of a Serb offensive around Sarajevo, which killed seven people and wounded 49 in the besieged capital, and Brcko, north eastern Bosnia. Belgrade radio yesterday reported an upsurge of fighting around Brcko. Bosnian radio said Serbs resumed their shelling of Sarajevo after it eased overnight. Serb forces appeared to have halted their offensive on Mount Igman, the capital's key defence point to the south west. In Bosnia, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Lieutenant-General Ratko Mladic, said yesterday that his forces were ready to observe a ceasefire around Sarajevo by 10am tomorrow. He told reporters after talks with the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, General Francis Briquemont, that Moslem forces would also have to observe the ceasefire. Lord Owen painted a grim picture of the violent fate awaiting the Moslems if they refused to endorse the republic's ethnic division. 'The fight for the Serb cause will then be handed over to General Mladic, who with great relish will move his forces all over Bosnia-Hercegovina and Krajina,' he said referring to the self-styled Serb state in Croatia. Serb forces recently have advanced, raising fears that they are aiming for a total defeat of the Bosnian army. Meanwhile Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, yesterday again snubbed Belgium's foreign minister Willy Claes, the EC president, who left Belgrade without meeting the most powerful man in Serbia, who was reported to be 'out of town'. Reuter adds from Zagreb: Bosnia's growing class of new urban poor could form the Balkan republic's next humanitarian crisis, a UN Protection Force spokeswoman said yesterday. Ms Shannon Boyd said less privileged people in towns and villages were having difficulty buying food because of sharply rising prices.</p>

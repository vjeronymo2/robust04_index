			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladikavkaz, May 20 (RIA) -- In connection with the  seizure of five Ingush citizens in a suburb of Vladikavkaz last  night, Vladimir Lozovoi, head of the provisional administration  on part of the territories of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia in  the rank of vice-premier, has issued an official statement for  the mass media. The statement notes, in particular, that "of  late gross violations of law and order, explosions of military  equipment, shellings of the Russian Army's peace-making forces  and seizures of hostages have become more frequent in the area  of the emergency situation." Lozovoi has called upon the  relatives and friends of the captured men to remain calm and  restrained and assured them that all necessary steps would be  taken for their release.    The head of the provisional administration stressed that the  appropriate measures would be taken with regard to the  authorities and heads of law-enforcement bodies of Northern  Ossetia and Ingushetia who are unable or unwilling to carry out  their duties in introducing law and order. The inactivity of  the authorities of both republics may lead to an aggravation of  the situation in the entire south of Russia, the statement  notes.</p>

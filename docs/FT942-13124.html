			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (24): Glimpse of alternative worlds - Virtual Reality The computer's ability to create alternative worlds has been one of its great fascinations. Recent advances in technology have taken this idea to the limit and a computer user can now be 'transported' to a virtual reality, where, in theory, all things are possible. At one extreme, it is now possible to dress in a body suit equipped with sensors, put on a headset with built-in sound and vision and step into another world. At a more mundane level, the same technology can be used to manipulate molecules, design drugs or re-design your garden. Despite the recent hype surrounding virtual reality, it is still a long way from the total experience written about in science fiction stories. The so-called 'immersive' virtual reality experience, which uses headsets and body movement sensors, is still at the level of a fairground ride with all that this implies. Users complain of disorientation after only a few minutes which is fine for a fairground but of little use in business. At the practical, non-immersive end - where the user sits at a desktop screen and controls the software with a keyboard and mouse - the technology is proving to be useful in a number of commercial areas. Market researcher Frost &amp; Sullivan forecasts an overall growth rate of 65 per cent a year in the US, with revenues exceeding a billion dollars by 1997. Leisure-based applications are expected to dominate throughout this period and show the largest growth. But commercial applications of virtual reality on the desktop are likely to be the most profitable - with training, data visualisation and computer-aided design leading the way. The breakthrough in computing which has made virtual reality possible comes from the emergence of interactive, three-dimensional graphics systems. These systems have evolved from two distinct areas of computing: computer-aided design (CAD) and games software. Both areas need software which lets users interact with three-dimensional images. They both need hardware which is fast enough to make the images appear 'real'. Advantages for users Until recently, CAD and games software developed separately. CAD developments were restricted to expensive, specialised workstations and games software concentrated on intuitive interfaces. The emergence of concepts like multimedia and virtual reality has drawn them together. At the same time, the price/performance improvements in standard personal computer hardware have made it possible to spread these advantages to a wider number of users. Desktop personal computers - like the Apple Macintosh or PC's based on Intel's 486 and Pentium processors - are powerful enough to handle three-dimensional graphics and convey an impression of 'space' to the user. This makes it possible to 'walk' around buildings which don't exist and 'visit' places on the other side of the world without leaving the desk. The number of VR applications for desktop computers is growing. Superscape, a software tool from the UK company Superscape VR (formerly Dimension), can be used to show the effects of drugs on the human body. The software allows a user to navigate around a representation of the body and 'see' the effect of a drug at the molecular level. About 30 applications have been built with Superscape so far - with most ideas coming from customers. Superscape has also been used to build environments as diverse as a telecom network simulation for British Telecom and an exhibition modelling system for Dragon Exhibitions. Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has created a virtual reality model of the Pounds 180 million Quayside development in Newcastle. The virtual reality Quayside is being used to show prospective investors what the development will look like before it is built. Faberushi, another UK VR specialist has built a multimedia virtual exhibition system (VES) which re-creates the sound, look and feel of an exhibition floor. Maxis, a US software company, has built a package which simulates the Wall Street Stock Exchange in the form of a casino. Prospective 'investors' can risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time. It is still early days for virtual reality and attention will continue to focus on the extremes rather than on practical applications. But companies exploring the practical applications of virtual reality are likely to be among tomorrow's leaders. Virtuality, a UK company specialising in the commercial area, came to the London Stock Exchange near the end of 1993 and has been one of the fastest growing stocks in the UK. Superscape VR is to follow Virtuality to the stock market this summer.</p>

The former FTC official, Taro Kayashima, 68, will file the  suit at the Miyazaki district court against Hosokawa, opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono and speaker  of the House of Representatives Takako Doi.    Kayashima is seeking a total of 3 million yen from the three  and the government as compensation for the damage which he said  was inflicted by the compromise via a backdoor deal.    The government-proposed political reform bills were  initially  rejected in the House of Councillors and the likelihood of  enactment became slim because of disagreement over compromise  between representatives of the two Diet chambers.    Doi, however, proposed her own conciliatory plan to Hosokawa  and Kono, and the two men took advantage of the proposal as a  chance to reach an accord in a backroom meeting.    Kayashima claims the actions taken by Doi, Hosokawa and Kono  violated the Constitution.    The plaintiff alleges that Hosokawa, as leader of the  government, intervened in deliberations in the conference  committee of both houses.    Hosokawa allegedly violated separation of the  administrative,  legislature and judicial branches of the government, thus  damaging trust in parliamentary democracy, Kayashima said.    In addition, Kayashima claims infringement on his liberty to  support a political party because the political reform bills  guarantee designated parties to receive public financial  assistance paid through taxes.    The upper house on Friday made into law political reform  package amendments which feature changes in the lower house's  election system and revised regulations on corporate donations  to political fund-raising organizations.</p>

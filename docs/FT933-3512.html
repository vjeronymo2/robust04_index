			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Goodyear to build Dollars 150m Indian plant GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the US tyremaker, is to build a Dollars 150m (Pounds 97.4m) joint venture factory in India in one of the largest foreign investments in the country since economic reform was launched two years ago. The plan will boost the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, which is trying to promote foreign investment through economic liberalisation. Foreign companies have secured government approval for projects worth Dollars 3bn since mid-1991, but only a fraction of these schemes have so far gone ahead. Mr Hoyt Wells, Goodyear's president and chief operating officer, said Goodyear was establishing a 50:50 joint venture with Ceat, a leading Indian tyre company affiliated to an industrial grouping headed by Mr R P Goenka, the Calcutta-based entrepreneur. Subject to government approval, the plant will begin annual production of 500,000 tyres next year, rising to 3m. Tyres from the plant - to be built at Aurangabad in Maharashtra, western India - will be sold under both the Goodyear and the Ceat brands through separate marketing operations. The companies already have factories in India but decided a new plant on a greenfield site would be the best way to expand their operations.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Commercial jet buyers must turn to markets  -Boeing forecasts reluctance among Japanese financial institutions AIRLINES will have to turn to international capital markets in the face of a growing reluctance from Japanese financial institutions to pay for the Dollars 857bn worth of new aircraft they will require over the next 20 years. This structural change in the financing of commercial aircraft is highlighted in Boeing's annual review of the world aircraft market to be published today. More innovative financing will be required to fund airline jet requirements especially since Boeing expects to see the contribution of Japanese banks, trading companies and equity investors in aircraft leases drop from between 55-65 per cent of total commercial aircraft financing in recent years to barely 8-12 per cent over the next few years. The willingness of Japanese institutions to invest in aircraft has been badly damaged by the fall in Japanese share and property values. Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners, remains confident of the longer-term outlook for the industry with a recovery in world air travel requiring airlines to take delivery of 11,678 new aircraft worth Dollars 857bn between now and 2010. But financing the future aircraft requirements of airlines has become a severe problem for the aviation industry. Boeing says the industry is beset with three kinds of financial difficulties - 'monumental' losses or bankruptcy; the declining value of used aircraft; and a general credit crunch. The Seattle, Washington manufacturer expects the international capital market, whose aircraft financing contribution was 'insignificant' in recent years, to play an increasingly important role in aircraft financing accounting for between 25-35 per cent of total funding requirements. Another new source of financing to replace Japanese sources is expected to come from equity issues. These have also been 'insignificant' but are now likely to account for 8-12 per cent of total commercial jet financing requirements, according to Boeing. US banks will probably drop out entirely from this market, while European banks are expected to expand their share from 10-20 per cent to 15-25 per cent. Manufacturers are also expected to become more important financing sources with their share of the market increasing from 4-6 per cent to 5-9 per cent. Boeing expects financing conditions to improve with the recovery of airline profits. Its latest market outlook forecasts world airline revenues growing in 2000. In a more private market-orientated industry, airline profitability is expected to recover with 4-6 per cent operating profit margins. A return to a 5 per cent operating profit margin for the industry in 1995 would be the equivalent of total profits of Dollars 15bn. Although Boeing continues to be optimistic about the industry's long-term prospects, the shorter-term outlook for aircraft manufacturers remains bleak. Manufacturers, including Boeing, are scaling back production as airlines defer or, in some cases, cancel orders. New jet airliner orders fell to Dollars 32bn last year from Dollars 71bn in 1990 and a record Dollars 90bn in 1989. Boeing's share last year was Dollars 20bn, 63 per cent of all orders. The industry in general does not see any improvement in new order activity this year, with some analysts expecting no real recovery before 1994 or even 1995. However, the total industry backlog of orders at the end of last year remains solid at Dollars 191bn and 3,158 aircraft. Boeing's backlog totalled Dollars 105bn and 1,665 airliners. After world air travel declined last year for the first time in the history of the jet aircraft, Boeing expects it to grow by an average of 5.5 per cent a year between now and 2000 and then slow to about 5 per cent a year for the next 10 years. Aircraft deliveries are expected to average 655 a year between now and 2000 and then 580 a year for the following 10 years. In dollar terms, deliveries will average about Dollars 45bn a year over the next 19 years compared with an average of Dollars 18bn a year during the past 21 years. The Boeing outlook forecasts that of the 11,678 new jetliners worth Dollars 857bn that manufacturers are expected to deliver over the next 19 years, 27 per cent will replace old airliners and 73 per cent will be for airline growth.</p>

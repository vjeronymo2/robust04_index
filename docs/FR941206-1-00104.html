			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Handling, Transfer, and Storage of Volatile Organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP Containing Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Volatile organic emissions (including HAP) result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, handling, and transfer of solvents and paint wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contain VOHAP. These solvents, typically stored in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 55-gallon drums, are frequently transferred by pump or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spigot into small buckets or 1 gallon containers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport to the painting site. Waste solvent and HAP also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporate from solvent-laden rags and spent solvent used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning activities and coating operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  These HAP emissions may be minimized with appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work practices including managed chemical (paint and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent) distribution systems designed to curb the volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material exposed to the atmosphere and the length of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. For example, solvent-soaked cleaning rags should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be kept in impervious bags or containers that are normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed when not in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Selection Rationale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Emission Points to be Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would limit VOHAP emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface coating operations at shipbuilding facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are major sources in accordance with the EPA's list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). Standards are being proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to limit the VOHAP content of 23 categories of coatings used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in shipyards. In addition, the proposed standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require work practice measures for handling, transfer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage of solvent and paint wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Welding, gas freeing (tank degassing), metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrication, fuel combustion, flame cutting, cooling towers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos removal, and cleaning would not be regulated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule, although their emissions must be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in determining if a facility qualifies as a major source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asbestos removal is covered in 40 CFR part 61, subpart M;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling towers are treated in the industrial process cooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tower rule proposed on August 12, 1993; and chromium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by the rule for hard and decorative electroplating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and anodizing operations proposed on November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methodology for determining and managing emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning solvents is detailed in the ACT document_Industrial Cleaning Solvents, EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;94&hyph;015.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The general methodology for selecting the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT standards was discussed in section V. A more detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion specific to this industry is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Coating Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No emission control measures are known to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously been implemented specifically to reduce HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from this industry. Regulations that reduce VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will limit HAP emissions since almost all organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP are VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  At shipyards, the only VOC control measure that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been fully demonstrated for outdoor coating operations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of coatings with inherently lower emissions. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings have and are being developed by an enlightened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to reduce its environmental impact. The new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products are used for compliance with VOC regulations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana and some California jurisdictions. There are as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yet no known cases where add-on pollution control systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been used to control VOC emissions from outdoor coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations at shipyards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The California and Louisiana regulations limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable quantity of VOC in each of several categories of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings, as applied. Because VOHAP are VOC (with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception noted above), such regulations also reduce, or at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a minimum, put a ceiling on the allowable HAP content of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The California regulations (VOC limits) are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than those in Louisiana. Thus, the major sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to those California rules represent the ``best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled sources.'' Because three major source facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are located in California, the single best controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and the median facility of the best performing five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are both subject to the stringent California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Therefore, the Agency has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor for both new and existing sources is identical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current California VOC limits on marine coatings, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for one additional paint category [weld-through (shop)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primer].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> A HOME FOR FOLK MUSIC: GREEK, BALKAN, GYPSY AND MORE  </P> <P> Fielding a phone request for Mongolian "throat" music . . . sending off a mail  order of five cassette tapes of Gypsy music to a woman in Texas. . . .  </P> <P> It's all in a day's work for John Filcich, the owner of the Festival Foreign  Records store in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Festival Foreign Records is a far cry from a typical contemporary record store.  The spacious, homey store near Pico Boulevard and Normandie Avenue is jammed  with record bins full of traditional folk and folk dance records from around  the world.  </P> <P> Festival specializes in Greek and Gypsy recordings as well as music from the  Balkan nations.  </P> <P> Such albums as "Le Mystere Des Voixs Bulgares" and "The Gipsy Kings," two  recent left-field pop chart successes, are representative of the kind of music  regularly available at the store.  </P> <P> "I had them before they were known," said Filcich, 65, in a bemused tone. "I  had the Chieftains before the Chieftains became popular and reggae music before  you heard about reggae.  </P> <P> "I don't know how many more things I've got here right now that people are  going to be excited about 10 years from now. It just takes the right kind of  exposure."  </P> <P> Providing that exposure for international music has sustained Filcich through a  career that began in the era of 78s, 40 years ago, and has now reached the CD  age. Filcich's dislike of pop and rock music means that he doesn't stock many  of the international pop records that are beginning to make inroads in the  mainstream pop market, but he's not surprised that pop fans are showing more  interest.  </P> <P> "It certainly should be appreciated by everybody," he contended. "The music has  a long heritage and tradition and the most beautiful aspect of any foreign  culture is the music and dance. It's a universal language; you don't have to  understand it to be able to appreciate it."  </P> <P> Filcich's interest in international music was sparked after his father received  an old phonograph and a stack of Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian records in  exchange for painting a house. He gave the device to John, his eldest son, in  1935.  </P> <P> Filcich's interest in music was further fueled by growing up in the polyglot  city of Gary, Ind., a steel industry town packed with immigrants from Eastern  Europe who performed the music and dances of their native lands at picnics and  church bazaars.  </P> <P> Filcich opened the first branch of Festival Records in Oakland in 1949 and then  expanded to a store in San Francisco. He opened the Los Angeles store 25 years  ago across from St. Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral.  </P> <P> The Greek community is still the cornerstone of his business. An array of  neatly marked cardboard boxes of cassettes and CDs lines the walls behind the  register, and shelves around the store display religious icons, souvenirs and  videos that Filcich stocks for his Greek Orthodox and Gypsy customers.  </P> <P> The store was devoid of casual browsers late one recent afternoon, but Filcich  indicated that was par for the course. Most of his regular customers drive in  from their homes in the outlying suburbs or, in the case of the Gypsies, stop  in when their travels bring them to Los Angeles. Filcich often loads up a van  with merchandise to sell at church events or folk dance workshops and also does  a healthy mail order business with his Gypsy customers.  </P> <P> "I will always be able to say that I found the right niche in life in my work,"  Filcich observed. "When I was young, I was either fired out of every job that I  had or hated it so much that I wished they did fire me. Once I got into this, I  couldn't spend enough hours on it. I have enjoyed my business and enjoyed my  life because of it."  </P></p>

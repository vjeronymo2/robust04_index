			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / US tobacco groups sue over report PHILIP MORRIS and RJR Nabisco, the two largest US tobacco companies, yesterday sued the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming its report on the dangers of passive smoking was unscientific, 'arbitrary' and 'capricious'. The companies claimed the agency reached its conclusion that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) was a cancer-causing substance 'only by manipulating and cherry-picking data, ignoring critical statistical studies and chemical analyses, failing to account for confounding factors and sources of bias (and) violating basic statistical principles'. Their suit, which is backed by other industry groups, also argued that the EPA's scientific guidelines were violated. The legal action follows a high-profile EPA report, published in January, which classed ETS as a class A carcinogen. This is the most serious category of cancer-causing material. The EPA report indicated that about 3,000 US non-smokers die from lung cancer caused by exposure to tobacco fumes each year, and that exposure to ETS increases the risk of asthma in 'normal' children. It could also increase the severity of symptoms in children prone to asthma, the agency said. A draft version of the EPA's study, published three years ago, was attacked by the industry and was sent back by a science advisory board for better justification of its conclusions. However, since its publication the report has been used by anti-smoking activists to demand more restrictions on smoking in public places, and has almost certainly contributed to an increasingly proscriptive climate in the US. Most states now have some restrictions on smoking in public areas. The suit was filed with the district court for the middle district of North Carolina.</p>

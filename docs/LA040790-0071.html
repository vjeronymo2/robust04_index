			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The pilot of "Secret Passions," the gay-oriented soap opera produced in Orange  County, is scheduled to air in Los Angeles on Century Cable on April 27 at 9:30  p.m., despite having already prompted a barrage of phone calls to the cable  system. Jacqui Hyland, program coordinator for Los Angeles' largest cable  system, said that even before Century committed to air the show, the company  received calls both from "right-wing homophobics" who opposed the cablecast and  advocates "insisting we were trying to prevent it from being aired."  </P> <P> A fountain sculpture by French artist Niki de Saint-Phalle was unveiled Friday  in Brea Mall's Center Court as part of the city's Art in Public Places program.  The 9 1/2-foot-tall painted polymer piece, "La Lune" (The Moon), is the 91st in  the 15-year-old program.  </P> <P> Saint-Phalle, 59, is a self-taught artist, illustrator and costume designer who  created "happenings" and installations with sculptor Jean Tinguely during the  1960s.  </P> <P> The sculpture, which cost $140,000, was bought by Corporate Property Investors,  owners of the mall, in compliance with city policy requiring all residential,  commercial and industrial development projects with a building valuation above  $500,000 to buy art for public display.  </P></p>

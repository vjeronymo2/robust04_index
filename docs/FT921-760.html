			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bols up 17% and lifts payout BOLS, the Dutch spirits group which is expanding rapidly into wines and low-alcoholic drinks, announced a 17 per cent increase in 1991 net profit and a 11.5 per cent rise in its annual dividend. Net profit rose to Fl 105.4m (Dollars 56.4m) last year from Fl 90.1m in 1990. Sales were up 11.3 per cent at Fl 1.33bn, due partly to the first-time consolidation of Ottavio Riccadonna, an Italian producer of vermouth and sparkling wine, and of the French wine house Domaines Michel Bernard. Operating profit advanced by 14.6 per cent to Fl 144.3m. The company, which did not make a profit prediction for 1992, said it would raise its 1991 dividend to Fl 1.36 from Fl 1.22 the year before. In 1991, Bols' financial expenses nearly doubled to Fl 21.1m, mainly reflecting acquisitions in Brazil, France, Italy and Spain.</p>

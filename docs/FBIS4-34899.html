[Samper] "Justice Minister Dr. Nestor Humberto Martinez."    He was bank superintendent, and he is currently abroad.    [Samper] "Government Minister Dr. Horacio Serpa Uribe."    He will occupy this post for a second time. He is the ideal  person to handle the peace negotiations with the guerrillas.    [Samper] "Defense Minister Dr. Fernando Botero Zea."    He will be the second civilian to run the Defense  Ministry--a  big question mark for the military.    [Samper] "Finance Minister Dr. Guillermo Perry Rubio."    He has been adviser to the president-elect for many years.  He  has mastered public treasury matters.    [Samper] "Foreign Relations Minister Dr. Rodrigo Pardo."

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: PAPARAZZI HOT FOR IVANA; DUNNE CASTING ABOUT  </P> <P> OF ALL the names attending Helen Gurley Brown's 25th anniversary party Monday,  the one the paparazzi went mad over was Ivana Trump. They liked her even better  than Don Johnson, once the sizzling hero of "Miami Vice."  </P> <P> As for those photos of Ivana embracing Don in such a warm way -- big deal. He  and his wife, Melanie Griffith, getting ready to take a Mediterranean cruise  together, have long been pals of both the Trumps.  </P> <P> Hot skinny yesterday had it that some of Ivana's admirers are saying "I told  you so!" They wanted her to accept the money of the nuptial agreement and take  it and run. Says one: "She'd have been better off. Now she may end up with half  of nothing!" But Ivana is going ahead with her lawsuit to declare herself the  equal partner in Donald's empire, and she'll be giving legal depositions early  next month. Her plans haven't changed. She does not intend to accept the terms  of the nuptial agreement nor to file for divorce.  </P> <P> AUTHOR DOMINICK Dunne has blanketed the United States with his promo tour for  his new novel, "An Inconvenient Woman." (This is the sizzler about a powerful  and rich California couple with friends at the top. The wife is Madame  Perfection. The husband has a longtime mistress who makes trouble, etc.)  </P> <P> Now didn't Nick Dunne recently have a little "meet" with Farrah Fawcett, who is  dying to play the "inconvenient woman"? And who does the writer envision in the  film version as the all-too-perfect wife? Faye Dunaway!  </P> <P> HAVE A staggering statistic. Conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan's  coming "From the Right" newsletter will tell us that if Trump wanted to stay  rich, he should have gone to law school!  </P> <P> Buchanan reports that the Resolution Trust Corp. (set up to oversee the savings  and loan bailout) has budgeted $500 million to be paid to consulting lawyers in  1990 alone. These fees will grow to billions before it's over, even if it is  ever over in our lifetimes.  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office's low estimate now of the cost of the S&amp;L  bailout is $325 billion. (Their pessimistic estimate is $500 billion.) The  Stanford Law and Policy Review, meanwhile, predicts that the bailout could  reach -- wait for it -- $1.4 trillion. Write that as $1,400,000,000,000.  </P> <P> TO KNOW her is to love her! That's Tina Turner. And that's all it took for  Britain's Lord and Lady Tavistock to reverse their ban on rock shows on the  grounds of their Woburn Abbey. His lordship and her ladyship had a personal  talk with Tina, and suddenly the regal estate near London will become the site  for two very special performances -- July 28 and 29 -- for more than 130,000  concertgoers.  </P></p>

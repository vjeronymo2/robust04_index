			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: A model of efficiency in Italy's public sector - Haig Simonian examines the success of Italgas, the state-run gas distribution group Italy's state-run industrial companies seldom stand out as models of efficiency. Their balance sheets are weighed down by debt and their general performance compromised by political considerations. Among the exceptions is Italgas, the public-sector gas distribution group, which will soon report a 25 per cent leap in 1991 sales to L3,353bn (Dollars 2.721bn) and a 16.6 per cent increase in gross operating earnings to L618bn. Along with the improvement in earnings, the group's net indebtedness is likely to have dropped to around 32 per cent of turnover from 36 per cent in 1990. Only a small majority of its shares are actually held by the state. Snam, the gas distribution subsidiary of the Eni state holding group, owns 45 per cent, while another Eni subsidiary has almost 7 per cent. The influence of the market may be one of the reasons why Italgas has performed so much better than many of its public-sector counterparts. Good management and government policy encouraging the use of natural gas have helped. Net profits in 1990 stood at L73.7bn. Italgas's roots go back to the 19th century, when Italy's big cities were gradually turning to gas for their lighting and heating needs. But real growth only began after the 1940s, when significant domestic natural gas supplies were found. The importance of natural gas for energy-dependent Italy surged after the first oil price shock of the early 1970s. That virtually coincided with the building of new pipelines bringing gas from Holland and the Soviet Union. 'Suddenly, greatly increased supplies become available and demand grew very fast,' says Mr Carlo Da Molo, Italgas's chairman. The third boom came almost 10 years later, when a third pipeline gave the Italians direct access to gas from Algeria. 'For the first time, we had gas coming from the south as well as the north,' he says. Distributing natural gas to customers in the south provided Italgas with a new motor for growth. 'Previously, almost all our activities had been in the north.' The arrival of the new southern supplies coincided with two other decisive events. Government policies introduced after the 1973 oil price shock to stimulate the substitution of natural gas for oil were refined. Since 1973, the share of oil in the nation's total energy consumption has fallen by 15 per cent, matched by an identical rise in that of natural gas. A further boost came in 1989, when a referendum halted the country's nuclear power programme. From 250 towns and villages in 1979, Italgas now serves 1,400 communities. Its customers have more than doubled to almost 4.4m, while sales of natural gas have swollen from under 2bn cu m to over 6.4bn today. The bulk of the growth has come through building new distribution networks in big such as Rome and Naples. Italgas now supplies five of Italy's seven biggest cities. However, Italgas has held back from gobbling up the smaller gas companies which form part of Italy's patchwork of gas distribution. The business is highly fragmented. While Eni's AGIP and Snam subsidiaries look after exploration and wholesale supplies respectively, local and urban sales are divided between Italgas, municipally owned companies and a myriad of private distributors. Italgas has around a third of the market, against 45 per cent for the municipal companies and 21 per cent for the private sector groups. Although it has bought some smaller suppliers, its growth has been largely organic, explains Mr Da Molo. 'What has happened is that the overall share of natural gas has grown,' he says. The decision to avoid takeovers has been based on both economic and political considerations. Acquisition prices for small private suppliers have risen steadily in line with the growing importance of natural gas. Moreover, potential acquisition targets only tend to become available after family disputes or the death of a founder. Meanwhile, the big municipally-owned companies have not been for sale. He believes Italgas has benefitted from not becoming a monopoly. 'The plurality of suppliers has furthered the expansion of natural gas,' he said. In Italy's complex political scene, it is better to have a policy of 'guided alliances' than a monopoly, he reckons. The impetus for gas usage has also been helped by the fact that the small, privately owned distributors often have considerable local political clout. That has helped to bring about pro-gas policies from the government, which have been passed with relatively little political fuss. Italgas has not ruled out takeovers, however. It has bought a handful of smaller competitors, notably along the Riviera. However, Mr Da Molo believes demand will continue to grow strongly enough to avoid the need for a change of strategy. He admits that sales will start to slow from the mid-1990s as the country's natural gas network is largely completed and the most important towns and villages are connected. 'There will always be some growth, but it will be much slower,' he says. However, consumption should expand through more intensive marketing in towns where natural gas is not yet widely used. Growth in Turin, where around 75 per cent of potential consumers are already connected thanks to the early arrival of natural gas in the 1970s, will be limited. But there is still considerable potential in Rome and Naples, where only about 50 per cent of consumers are so far using natural gas. Sales should also rise through gaining new markets. The completion of a natural gas pipeline along the Riviera could pull in business from the big horticultural trade in the region. In addition, increasingly strict clean air legislation will force consumers to switch from oil to natural gas in Italy's historic city centres. Italgas is also diversifying to guarantee its future growth. It has identified water distribution and waste management as logical additions to the existing gas business. The company can use its established contacts with local authorities and play on its expertise in gas distribution, which, like water, involves underground pipework and 24-hour service. Italgas's Acque Potabili drinking water subsidiary already has 2.5m customers. 'The water business will start taking up the slack as the demand for gas slows,' says Mr Da Molo. 'We have a great future in the next century'.</p>

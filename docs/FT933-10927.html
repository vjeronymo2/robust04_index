			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: A priest in lust STRANGE GODS by John Cornwell Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 262 pages THE GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS by Nicholas Salaman HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 465 pages THE ALLURE of sin and guilt for the fiction maker often goes with the notion that spiritual redemption follows expiation. Thus, the theme invites situational cliches - as, for example, in John Cornwell's Strange Gods, in which an ordained Jesuit priest - a high-flying whizzkid in the fund-raising branch of the organisation - has an affair with a young woman, which he enjoys not least because of its forbidden nature; crisis follows as love collides with the inflexible demands of vocation. From this familiar setting, however, the story, and the moral direction, develop in quite unexpected ways. Having got Jill pregnant, Nicholas Mullen decides to decamp on a mission in Peru rather than give up his vocation and do the right thing by Jill. Before that, over an expensive meal, he tries to touch a wealthy benefactor for a tidy sum for Jill and her unborn baby. He gets his come-uppance along with a lecture on hypocrisy. So, obsessed with sex, filled with guilt and self-loathing, and disillusioned with the world, Mullen arrives in Peru to work with Father Christian O'Rourke in the fever-infested rain forests. The zealous O'Rourke is a charismatic character with a reputation of Loyola and Mother Teresa rolled into one. That too turns out to be an illusion. But from the strange contest between Christianity as wielded by O'Rourke, and the native religion of the local Amerindians, Mullen's own moral development begins. Having lost against the gods of the Mekroti tribe, O'Rourke's mission is brought to a grisly end by the political god of the Shining Path terrorists. The story is often gripping and well-told. Nicholas Salaman explores sin, guilt and the vision of Hell in The Garden of Earthly Delights, based on the life of the 16th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch and his apprentice, Julius. The Master is commissioned by an esoteric order headed by an enigmatic Jew to paint the eponymous Garden but dies before finishing the painting. The task of completing Hell is left to Julius, who has suffered the torments of lust and doubt and has been rushed into a loveless marriage to a coarse Millenialist who turns out to be his half-sister. The couple move to a town in Germany, where Hell and all its concomitants are played out in reality to an apocalyptic denouement. There is a lot to be said for a well-researched historical novel with an exciting setting and on this count Salaman scores highly - the main backdrop is the millennial fervour of the Anabaptist cult, and he has used Norman Cohn's classic The Pursuit of the Millennium to good effect.</p>

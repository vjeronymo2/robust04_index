			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / US defers prospect of Nato enlargement PROSPECTS for the enlargement of Nato yesterday receded when the US tabled a 'partnership for peace' proposal, which instead foresees a series of agreements strengthening ties with eastern Europe. The US proposal for individually negotiated defence agreements between Nato and former members of the Warsaw Pact will be discussed by Nato defence ministers in Travemunde, Germany, today. It is seen as an attempt to take the steam out of discussions on a future enlargement of the alliance to include some of its former enemies. Nato fears that by inviting some countries to join, it would alienate Russia and create divisions in eastern Europe. A Nato summit, due to address the issue in January, is unlikely to make any specific commitment on enlargement beyond stating that the alliance is not a 'closed shop', according to allied officials. 'At some stage, the enlargement of Nato is an option which cannot be ruled out,' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said. But he hinted that this would be a number of years away. In the meantime, it was important to build 'substantive' military links. The US proposal would mean each eligible country would negotiate a bilateral agreement with Nato. This would not involve extending to eastern Europe Nato allies' pledge to come to each other's defence. 'Nobody is talking about security guarantees at the moment,' one official said. The plan would include Russia but its relationship would be different from countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland or Hungary. Similar agreements would also be open to neutral or non-aligned countries, such as Sweden and Austria. They would involve differing degrees of co-operation, for instance in peace-keeping, military training and assistance. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, who has actively promoted discussion of Nato enlargement, made clear he was still pressing for an eventual extension of membership. But he was not calling for eligible countries to be identified or for a timetable for entry. The US proposal is not seen as prejudicing the membership issue at a subsequent stage or the idea of a possible intermediate affiliation status. The US plan still has to be discussed with France, which is not represented at the informal two-day meeting. France has also been anxious for Nato to de-emphasise the enlargement issue.</p>

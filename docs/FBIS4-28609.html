			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, May 27 (AFP) -- Australian trade with Asia  continued its rapid growth of previous years in 1993 as exports  to the region surged nine percent to 40 billion dollars (29  billion US), according to official data released Friday.    A six-monthly trade analysis by the Department of Foreign  Affairs also showed a 17.5 percent rise in exports of  elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs) to the world,  dominated by a 30 percent increase to Asia.    Japan remained Australia's largest export market, accounting  for almost a quarter of total merchandise exports worth 15.6  billion dollars.    At the same time, Australia imported 11.8 billion dollars  worth of goods from Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 3.8  billion dollars.    Australia's total merchandise trade rose by 10 percent in  current dollar terms to 125 billion dollars, with eight percent  export growth and a 12 percent increase in imports, the report  said.    Coal remained the biggest commodity export, representing  12.3  percent of Australia's total merchandise exports.    "While merchandise trade recorded another surplus -- 454  million in 1993 -- the relative strength of imports has reduced  it substantially from the high of four billion dollars in 1991  and the 1992 level of nearly three billion dollars," the report  said.    It attributed the fall in the surplus to a decline in the  terms of trade, associated with continued weakness in world  commodity prices, increased demand for imports flowing from the  relatively strong@rate of domestic recovery and subdued economic  activity in a number of key export markets.    Exports to the United States dropped in 1993 by about one  percent, while US imports grew by seven percent, increasing the  trade surplus in favour of the United States to 8.1 billion  dollars.    During the same period exports to European Union countries  also fell by three percent while imports from the EU grew by  eight percent, the trade imbalance worsening for Australia to  6.4 billion dollars.    A statement released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan's office  said the figures clearly indicated the government's closer  integration with Asia was paying dividends in the form of  increased export earnings.    Exports to the East Asia region, including Japan, Korea,  China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the Association of South East  Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,  the Philippines and Thailand -- increased by eight percent to 37  billion dollars.</p>

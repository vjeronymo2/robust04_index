			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Observer: Amnesia on Lombard St Normally bankers just love an excuse to celebrate. The Bank of England has been having heaps of fun celebrating its 300th birthday this year. Yesterday, the supposedly canny folk at the Bank of Scotland went one better by announcing plans to spend a whopping Pounds 3m on the bank's 300th anniversary next year. Apart from organising all sorts of good deeds in the community, the Bank of Scotland has bought a tercentenary tapestry, commissioned two special histories and organised a competition to find a new pipe tune, the Bank of Scotland Tercentenary March. It should not be too difficult for the Scots to come up with a more memorable tune than the Geoffrey Burgon number specially commissioned by the Bank of England for its 300th bash. All this jollity from north of the border raises the question as to what exactly happened to Barclays Bank's 300th birthday party. Depending on who you talk to, Barclays was founded in 1690 or 1692. However, its tercentenary seems to have come and gone unnoticed, and it has crept back into its brand new headquarters at 54 Lombard Street without so much as a whiff of a cocktail party. Not the sort of thing that would have happened once upon a time, when Barclays took pride in itself.</p>

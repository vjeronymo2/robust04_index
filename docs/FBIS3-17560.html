They shared Moscow's call for a political accommodation and  reiterated their willingness to seek a negotiated settlement  which was torpedoed by the Georgians. The negotiating process  could resume on the removal of obstacles created by Tbilisi.    Djindjolia hoped Russia would keep playing an active role in  the efforts to mediate a settlement.</p>

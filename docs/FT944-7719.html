			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: SEC investigation at PaineWebber PaineWebber, the US securities firm, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of what is believed to be a broader inquiry into the sale of limited investment partnerships. PaineWebber said yesterday that it was co-operating with the SEC and said it believed the vast majority of the partnerships were properly sold. However, the firm qualified its assertion by saying that wherever the firm has discovered that the partnerships were sold improperly to clients unsuited to that form of investment, it has taken prompt action to resolve clients' claims, and would continue to do so. The investigation is similar to inquiries at Prudential Securities, which found that Prudential brokers had sold clients high-risk energy and property limited partnerships as low-risk, secure investments. Prudential ultimately agreed to pay more than Dollars 700m in fines and restitution, and the firm was put on probation for three years by federal prosecutors. Although the PaineWebber investigation is not as large as the Prudential case, it is believed to focus on at least Dollars 2bn of limited partnerships sold by the firm. The SEC is reported to be seeking to determine whether brokers systematically misled clients about the risks involved in investing in energy and aircraft-leasing partnerships. The agency is said to be pursuing similar inquiries at other firms, but an SEC spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigations.</p>

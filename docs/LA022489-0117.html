			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFGHAN REBEL ASSEMBLY ELECTS GOVERNMENT IN EXILE  </P> <P> After two weeks of bitter infighting between moderates and fundamentalists, an  assembly of Afghan guerrillas Thursday elected a government in exile.  </P> <P> The election came as an anticlimax that delegates described as a popularity  contest among old guard political leaders of the moujahedeen, as the Islamic  rebel movement is called.  </P> <P> The fundamentalist-controlled Afghan News Agency announced Thursday night that  Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, a moderate, had been elected to the figurehead post of  president and that Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, a Saudi Arabia-backed fundamentalist,  had been named to the more powerful position of prime minister.  </P> <P> Mojaddidi heads the Jibbeh Nijat-i-Milli, or National Liberation Front, rebel  group, and Sayyaf heads the Ittihad-i-Islami, or Islamic Unity, group.  </P> <P> The only candidates were the leaders of each of the seven political parties in  the rebel alliance. The five parties whose leaders missed getting one of the  top two jobs were each awarded three Cabinet posts.  </P> <P> Rebel leaders have promised that the government will soon move into Afghanistan  and, in time, take over in place of the Soviet-backed regime of President  Najibullah, at least until national elections can be held.  </P> <P> The voting constituted rejection of an unpopular fundamentalist government that  had been proposed by the guerrillas' political leaders, a sign of independence  that Western diplomats said helped the assembly regain some of the credibility  it had lost in several days of bickering.  </P> <P> It was not clear whether the rebels' staunchest supporters -- among them the  United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran -- will recognize the rebel  government. Western diplomats and independent analysts have said that its  success will depend on whether it is recognized officially by other countries.  </P> <P> International recognition, they say, would make the government a powerful  psychological tool in the effort to dislodge Najibullah, whose armed forces  still control Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other important cities.  </P> <P> Many of the delegates to the assembly, or shura, as it is called, said the  assembly had been discredited long before the voting. Several even urged that  the government not be recognized because it does not represent the majority of  Afghanistan's 9 million inhabitants and the 5 million Afghan refugees in  Pakistan and Iran.  </P> <P> The biggest blow to the assembly's credibility came from within the seven-party  rebel alliance, the Pakistan-based umbrella group dominated by fundamentalists  that organized and ran the shura. The alliance has been used throughout the  guerrillas' nine-year war as a channel for arms and other supplies for the  guerrilla commanders in the field.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, the alliance's news agency issued a false announcement that the  shura had elected a government headed by fundamentalist Ahmad Shah. Actually,  there had been no vote, and the announcement was interpreted by many delegates  as an attempt by the fundamentalists to "hijack" the election.  </P> <P> The announcement triggered a backlash among moderates and religious leaders,  who forced the seven party leaders to give the delegates more authority in  choosing a government.  </P> <P> One of the religious leaders, Mullah Nasim, from the Afghan province of  Helmund, declared to the shura, "In Islam, it is acceptable to eat spoiled or  rotten meat in times of war, but we have not yet reached the stage where we  must accept the Ahmad Shah government."  </P> <P> The seven party leaders then backed down and formed a 14-man committee, made up  of two delegates from each party. This led to Thursday's popularity poll, in  which the largest vote-getter was named president and the runner-up was named  prime minister.  </P> <P> Most of the 420 delegates stayed on at the shura after Saturday's announcement,  and they voted Thursday. But at least 100 others, among them representatives of  the 2 million refugees and rebels based in Iran, were either barred from the  voting or had left in disgust.  </P></p>

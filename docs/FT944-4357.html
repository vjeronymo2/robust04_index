			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Brazil move for Paribas Paribas Capital Markets has teamed up with one of Brazil's smaller banks in a co-operation agreement which shows continued foreign interest in Brazil as an emerging market. Paribas has entered into the agreement with BBA Creditanstalt, a private sector investment bank in which Creditanstalt of Austria holds a third of the voting shares. The two sides hope the arrangement will give Brazilian issuers greater access to international investors. They will also combine to market Brazilian fixed income and equity products to local and international investors. Interest in Brazil has grown steadily this year, helped by a new currency, lower inflation, and the conclusion of a Brady-style debt renegotiation. Foreign investment is at record levels, and there has been a steady stream of private sector companies launching issues on the Euromarkets or preparing American Depositary Receipts programmes.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Car industry confronts price 'fantasy' A closer convergence in new car prices across west Europe would remain 'a mere fantasy', as long as the European Union is confronted with frequent significant exchange rate realignments, leaders of the European car industry claimed yesterday. A survey published by the European Commission suggested yesterday that around 80 per cent of the prices for cars produced by European manufacturers and 90 per cent of Japanese models showed price differentials of less than 20 per cent as at the end of November. The Commission said that Spain and Portugal were the lowest priced markets in the EU, while Germany was the highest. The European Automobile Industry Association (ACEA) claimed that manufacturers' efforts to reduce price differences had not been reflected in the prices published by the Commission, as they had largely been offset by recent currency realignments versus the Ecu. These had varied from a 3 per cent revaluation in the DM and the guilder and 7 per cent devaluations of the escudo and the peseta. The ACEA claimed that currency fluctations were the 'decisive influence' on car prices. Spain was now the lowest priced market in the EU, but only in June last year it had been the highest priced market. The Commission accepted that car manufacturers had tended to reduce price differentials for most of their models, and said that about 90 per cent of all car price differentials were less than 20 per cent. All of the European manufacturers have price differentials of more than 25 per cent for at least one model, however.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Railtrack prepares plan for dismissing strikers Railtrack is finalising plans to break the deadlock in the 13-week rail strike by dismissing striking signal workers who refuse to accept new terms of employment. The company's chairman, Mr Robert Horton, is thought to favour an option that could cost Railtrack about Pounds 16.5m in incentives to signal workers to encourage them to defy their union and go back to work. The signal workers would be offered a final pay and productivity package that would raise their basic wage rates by up to 26 per cent and their overall earnings by 10 per cent. In return, they would have to accept new working practices to improve efficiency. Last night, Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, said he found it 'astonishing that Railtrack would spend up to Pounds 16.5m on signal workers when they could settle this dispute for a third of that figure'. He added: 'My message to the signal workers is quite simple - stand firm, refuse to sign any new contracts.' While Railtrack said no decision was 'imminent' on new contracts, the union fears the company will go ahead with its plan next week during the Trades Union Congress. After taking legal advice, Railtrack has prepared a detailed timetable for introducing the new individual contracts for the signal workers. First, a letter would be sent to the signal workers asking them individually to accept the revised offer. Eight days later, a second letter would go to those who still refused to agree, warning that if they went on strike again they would be summarily dismissed. After 16 days, if disruptive action continued, all remaining strikers would be dismissed. They would then be offered re-engagement with a choice of either accepting the new terms and conditions or returning to work on the old conditions so as to treat them equally with non-strikers. Railtrack hopes at that stage there would be large-scale acceptances of the new conditions and the strike would crumble. But the company is also preparing to face the prospect that a hardcore of workers would continue striking. It plans to train new staff to take signalling jobs but believes this option would depend on how many signal workers accepted the new terms. Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, also wrote to Mr Knapp yesterday warning him that the 'legal deadline' of September 30 to ensure signal workers secured up to Pounds 50m in pension fund benefits is fast approaching. Mr John Monks, the TUC's general-secretary, said yesterday he believed Railtrack's policy of opening up more of the network on strike days was 'not working' and he saw no end to the dispute. 'The company is not going anywhere in this strike. I don't see any sign of this changing.' Mr Monks pointed out that while half the track might be open, very few signal workers were defying the strike call. ABB to shed 289 jobs, Page 7 Investors invited to run Tube line, Page 8</p>

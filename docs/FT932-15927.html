			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: After the pain, the wait for the gain Pay-setting institutions have certainly been transformed: fewer workers are in collective agreements, bargaining is decentralised, the century-old tradition of 'the rate for the job' has been ruptured, fair wage resolutions and comparability machinery have been withdrawn, there is greater sensitivity to the fortunes of the company and the performance of the individual. The government and their acolytes have achieved virtually all they set out to do.' With these words, David Metcalf, professor of industrial relations at the London School of Economics, summarised the changes in the UK labour market in the Thatcher decade and beyond. His paper was given at a conference held on April 1 by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. One of the best illustrations of the changes is the sharp decline in union membership as a proportion of all employees. Over the short period 1984-90, the proportion of pay rises determined by collective bargaining fell from 71 per cent to 54 per cent. On the positive side, some 43 per cent of businesses had cash or share-based profit sharing by 1990, and 32 per cent had share ownership or option schemes - although in most cases these provided only a modest proportion of workers' remuneration. Moreover, in contrast to earlier decades, public and private sector employers stood up to a series of important strikes. Management's 'right to manage' was reaffirmed and employers were able to get rid of 'Spanish practices' in newspapers, airlines, and other last-ditch areas. There were benefits. As Metcalf says: 'Growth in manufacturing output per head improved such that Britain was top of the OECD-major seven nations growth league table in the 1980s, after being bottom in both the 1960s and 1970s. Labour productivity in manufacturing has continued to grow rapidly in the 1990s reflecting the sharper fall in employment than output. The improved performance of the manufacturing sector in the 1980s was attributable to the interaction of greater product competition, high unemployment and anti-union legislation.' But there were two disturbing offsetting features. The first relates to the distribution of income. Mainstream economists say that 'inequality' increased. The most widely-used measure of inequality is the Gini co-efficient which has a maximum of 100 and rises as 'inequality' increases. The UK co-efficient rose (after tax) from 28 in 1981 to 35 in 1988. There were similar movements in the US. There was no such increase in France, but the absolute level of 'inequality' remains higher than in the UK. The term 'inequality' is a loaded one, presupposing that equality is a natural or desirable state of affairs. But in the case of full-time manual workers, Paul Gregg and Stephen Machin in their contribution were able to isolate separate effects. The ratio of earnings of the top tenth of manual full-time workers to the 'median' workers (those whose pay was in the middle) increased to the highest since 1886. In itself, there might not be too much to worry about here - it might be evidence of a widening of differentials for skilled labour. The real concern is at the bottom. For the lowest tenth have experienced since 1976 a steady decline in the ratio of their earnings to the median. Absolute poverty is a highly complex and controversial area. But it is difficult to deny the evidence of an increasing trend in the 1980s. At the very least, a substantial minority did not share in the general prosperity, when real earnings for those in employment rose at a record pace. The distributional changes were largely driven by labour market forces, such as declining relative demand for less skilled workers and occupations. But the decline in importance of institutions such as unions and minimum wages played a role. The second disturbing feature is that even the productivity gains have gone to waste in unemployment, which seems to be rising to a post-war record. As Metcalf puts it: 'Either the government got it wrong concerning the link between pay-setting institutions and procedures and the employment outcomes. Alternatively, the government got it right about pay setting. In this case its macroeconomic policy must be a shambles. Either way it is disgraceful that more than 3m unemployed are needed to implement government policy.' The clue to the puzzle may have been provided by another participant, Professor Patrick Minford. He believes that the equilibrium rate of unemployment (consistent with stable prices or a constant rate of inflation) did rise in the early 1980s in the aftermath of some Labour policies and because of mistakes made by the incoming Tory administration, but has since fallen rapidly. The particular early Conservative error was the sharp rise in council rents, fully compensated in unemployment benefit, but only partly in benefits available to those at work. This much increased the 'why work?' problem, but became less important as benefits fell in relation to income. A big element in Prof Minford's view was unionisation, which added 1m to equilibrium unemployment in the 1970s, but reduced it by 1 1/4 m in the 1980s. A further favourable influence was falling employer taxes on labour. In sum he believes that equilibrium unemployment, which shot up to 3m in the early 1980s, has since fallen back rapidly and is now about 1m. This led Prof Minford to argue in his contribution to the government's panel of independent forecasters that the economy could take a very large boost without any danger of renewed inflation. This is in strong contrast to the Treasury and most commentators, who fear that because of capacity shortages, the balance of payments or other constraints, anything but a modest recovery would run into trouble. Prof Minford's presentation provoked a discussion, ended only by the clock. If there has been such a large gap between actual and equilibrium unemployment for most of the past 10 years, why did inflation not fall further in the middle 1980s; why was the economy not better able to absorb the credit expansion of the period, and why are prices not actually falling today? Fragments of explanation, offered by conference participants, were that it was not the level of demand in the late 1980s that caused the problem, but the rate at which it increased. In the 1990s there may be a constraint of physical capacity biting well before there is any chance of labour shortages reappearing. Prof Minford played down capacity restraints. Indeed if output can be increased without inflationary effects, then capacity will be created by business. Moreover if unemployment is so far above equilibrium, it should be possible to cope with any incipient balance of payments problem by having a lower rate of inflation in the UK than in competitors. As some recent chancellors will confirm, my own vision of the economic process is not always the same as Prof Minford's. Nevertheless I prefer his structural optimism to the economic establishment's tendency to project any recession or business cycle problem indefinitely into the future. If there is something in his account, then the effect of the Thatcher labour market changes is more like what one would have expected. The distribution of income has been adversely affected, but most of today's unemployment is due to recession and will be priced back into work with recovery. Lower unemployment will itself reduce poverty, but probably not enough. Non-political observers would want to investigate fiscal redistributory schemes, such as those outlined in James Meade's new collection of essays, just published by Macmillan, Liberty, Equality and Efficiency. But they would also seek to retain the more flexible post-Thatcher labour market.</p>

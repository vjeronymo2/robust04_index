			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has worked out the details of its rejection of the U.S.  Department of Commerce's criticism based on a joint Japan-U.S.  survey of the auto market. The ministry report includes the  following points: 1) The survey does not conclude that the  close ties between Japanese dealers and auto makers impede the  signing of contracts with new agents; 2) the large gap between  the prices of American cars sold at home and overseas can be  attributed mainly to the large profit-margins of importers or  costly advertising, but not to the influence of Japan's  distribution system.    There has also been criticism that the ratio between  foreign-made and domestically-made cars sold by Japanese dealers  is very low. In rejecting this U.S. criticism, MITI says:  "There are many types of dealer engaged in selling both  foreign-made and domestically-made cars. The number of Japanese  dealers selling different brands of imported cars -- no matter  in which country they are manufactured -- reaches 18 percent --  about the same percentage as that of U.S. dealers."</p>

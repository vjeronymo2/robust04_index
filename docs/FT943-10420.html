			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Business bankrolls Zedillo: As the PRI embraces free trade, the rich have endorsed its candidate - Mexican Elections The head of Mexico's largest bank recently issued a stark warning: political stability and lower interest rates could only be achieved with a victory of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party in the presidential election on August 21. Mr Roberto Hernandez, head of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, was attacked for his assertion that Mexico was not ready for a change of government. But he was unrepentant, repeating the same message a few days later to a group of reporters. Once unwilling to participate openly in politics, Mexico's wealthiest businessmen have shed their inhibitions in this presidential campaign. They have come out strongly in favour of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the governing party candidate, offering him tens of millions of dollars in contributions, and in some cases campaigning on his behalf around the country. Businessmen from medium-sized and small companies, many of whom have suffered from the trade liberalisation of the past decade, are generally divided between the PRI and the pro-business National Action party. But those who back the ruling party have played a much bigger part in its campaign than in previous elections, joining 40 odd PRI 'business cells' around the country, collecting economic proposals for the party platform. 'When business supported us before, it was very secret, with private dinners and so on,' says Mr Antonio Arguelles, in charge of PRI campaign spending. 'This is the first ever the private sector has come out openly and campaigned for us.' The new influence of the business community is largely a consequence of the economic and social reforms of the past decade. As the PRI has buried its statist, interventionist past, and embraced private enterprise and free trade, the private sector has become a more natural ideological ally than the labour unions and peasant organisations that once dominated the party. Likewise, as the government has withdrawn from the economy, the private sector's power has increased, and the need to take its view into account has grown. 'We are seeing our influence climb as the economy and the political system opens up,' says Mr Victor Manuel Terrones, head of Canacintra, the small business chamber. Mr Terrones says Mr Zedillo's economic proposals drew heavily on suggestions by members of his organisation, many of whom say the government has been indifferent to their problems. Some of the Zedillo economic proposals - such as tax breaks for the industrial sector, greater government involvement in worker training, and subsidised interest rates - read like a charter for small business. Recent political reforms making it difficult for the government to finance the PRI at former levels have raised business's influence still further, as the party has had to seek private contributions to replace state funding. The cosy relationship is not to everyone's liking. Peasant and workers' sectors in the PRI resent losing power to a group which is not formally affiliated to the party, and which supports policies - such as overturning the federal labour law - that would reduce their influence. Opposition parties complain that the PRI attracts private sector support by offering businessmen lucrative contracts or restricting competition. Last year the PRI asked 30 of the country's richest businessmen to donate Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) each to the party at a dinner in which President Carlos Salinas was the guest of honour. 'The leading businessmen - most, not all - have grown rich in the shadow of the political system,' says Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, an executive with Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest beer company. 'This will likely continue with Zedillo. In this sense support for the ruling party reflects their economic interests.' The key link between Mr Zedillo and the business sector is Mr Gilberto Borja, head of ICA, Mexico's largest construction company. Mr Borja has held more than 50 pro-Zedillo meetings in his house in recent months, and become a central official in the party's campaign team. The PRI had raised Dollars 220m by the end of June, according to a party official. Legislative provisions limiting individual contributions have been circumvented with contributions in cash, in kind or by giving through third parties. The money is vital to the PRI machinery. While there is a supposed spending limit of about Dollars 40m in the campaign, party officials say this is in practice side-stepped. Many campaign workers, including those at the highest levels, are paid part or all of their salary in cash; others are paid for directly by businessmen, which would not count as a campaign expenditure; gifts in kind are not properly accounted; and suspiciously large discounts are earned on media advertising.</p>

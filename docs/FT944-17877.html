			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Taskforces to boost engineers Five new taskforces aimed at making industry more competitive by increasing the influence and involvement of engineers were announced yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The programme, Action for Engineering, is a direct result of the Department of Trade and Industry's white paper on competitiveness, published in May, which identified a number of ways in which UK industrial performance could be improved through the better use of engineers. It represents the first co-ordinated attempt to address the underlying problems for the economy caused by the relatively low status of engineers, by bringing together industrialists, educationists and the engineering professions in industry-led taskforces. Mr Rob Margetts, a director of ICI, has been appointed chairman of the programme's steering group, which was due to hold its first meeting last night. The five main areas where action is sought are: Stimulating enthusiasm in schools for engineering. Harnessing engineers' full potential in industry. Training more technicians, supervisors and skilled workers, and improving the quality of training. Attracting the best staff and students into engineering higher education. Enhancing the understanding and status of engineering at board level in companies, among financial institutions and opinion formers. Mr Margetts said 'an enormous amount' had been done in an attempt to rectify the weaknesses caused by the way engineers' skills were being used, but the situation had not improved a great deal. The taskforces would aim to bring greater focus and co-ordination to the many initiatives already under way, such as the work being done by the Engineering Council and others to encourage more schoolchildren to study engineering. The taskforces would be complementary to such initiatives and the long-running attempt by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, to create a more unified professional structure for engineering. Dr David Evans, head of the DTI's technology and innovation division, said the department was participating in an enabling and supporting role. He said: 'The ownership of this work has got to be within the engineering community. The government is not divorced from the programme, and has to have a partnership role.' No budget has been allocated for the programme, which is expected to last 18 months, but Mr Margetts said he would be surprised if it did not produce some case for additional improvements in funding. He stressed that he would ensure the taskforces did not turn into talking-shops by appointing busy, 'action-oriented' people.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Challenges to the Alan Sugar view (2) Sir, I could not let Alan Sugar's letter pass without response because of the high regard in which I hold him. Like him - but not on his scale - my partners and I have built up a successful and profitable business from scratch through the 1970s and 1980s. For most of that time the marginal rate of tax was not 40 per cent but 85 per cent initially and latterly 60 per cent - I had no unearned income to be taxed at 98 per cent. The marginal rate of tax made not one whit of difference to our efforts to grow our business. If anything, the fact that the marginal rate was high encouraged us to do what we wanted to do anyway - invest in our business. While I accept it may be different for corporate managers, for those of us who grew our businesses the combination of a tough marginal rate (and 60 per cent is tough enough) and a corporate tax regime which encouraged retention and reinvestment was good for business growth. The current bias towards distribution introduced by Nigel Lawson is ideal if as a society we want all our business builders to retire at 35 and all our corporate managers to see the choice as between paying themselves or paying shareholders.

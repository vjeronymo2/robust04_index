			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Backing for food process - Irradiation The World Health Organisation has given strong backing to the controversial technique of food irradiation. It concludes in a study* that there is no evidence of any extra health risk associated with the process and the health benefits could be substantial. 'As long as requirements for good manufacturing practice are implemented, food irradiation is safe and effective,' the study says. Food irradiation involves bombarding products such as spices, meat, poultry and potatoes with ionising rays or electrons. This destroys insects and bacteria, making the food safer to eat and delaying spoilage. The WHO effectively scotches most consumer concerns about eating 'irradiated' food. Food irradiation does not increase the incidence of toxic radiolytic chemical substances. It does not generate 'measurable' additional radioactivity, and it is not capable of producing mutant bacteria or viruses. Nor does food irradiation destroy nutrients more than any other processing. Compared with the loss of nutrients through cooking the loss through food irradiation 'is really minimal', says Gerald Moy of the WHO's Food Safety Unit. Food irradiation holds the promise of big health gains, the WHO believes. In developing countries, up to 70 per cent of diarrhoeal diseases, which cause about a quarter of all deaths, are thought to be food transmitted. In the US, there are between 24m and 82m cases of food-borne disease every year, with some 10,000 deaths. An outbreak last year of illness caused by undercooked hamburgers killed four children and put nearly 200 people in hospital. *Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> E. Bonfire Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Performance Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed performance requirements for CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel containers to address the need to withstand high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures and pressures without catastrophic failure. Large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure increases due to exposure to flames could cause the CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to escape catastrophically and result in an explosive fire. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency proposed that the ability to withstand high temperatures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pressures be provided by a pressure relief device. More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, it proposed that compliance would be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first pressurizing the fuel container to 100 percent of service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure with nitrogen or air and placing it over a bonfire until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the container's contents are completely vented through a pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device. A pressure relief device can prevent a container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from experiencing high pressure for long periods of time. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency proposed a second test to be conducted in the same manner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except the container would be pressurized to 25 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service pressure. The second test would evaluate container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance when containers are partially filled. The purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test is to reduce the explosion potential of CNG containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when exposed to high temperatures and pressures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed requirements were based on NGV2. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there were two differences between the agency's proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2. First, under the NPRM, the container would be pressurized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with nitrogen or air; in NGV2, it is pressurized by CNG. Second,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the NPRM, all fuel containers would be required to use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device to completely vent the container's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents; in NGV2, the test is run for 20 minutes or until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container is completely vented, whichever comes first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under NGV2, a manufacturer could establish compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either by a container successfully withstanding the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for 20 minutes without bursting or by completely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> venting its contents by means of a pressure relief device at some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point during that 20 minute period. In the NPRM, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought comment about whether to allow an alternative way of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating compliance with the bonfire test that did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depend upon a pressure relief device. Under the alternative, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container would be considered to have passed the test if it did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not burst during the test period. Compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative would be achieved by designing a container so that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has sufficient strength to enable it to sustain the heat and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure buildup during the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven commenters addressed the issue of whether containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be required to have a pressure relief device. NGVC, EDO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARC, Flxible, Manchester, Thomas, and MSBA agreed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to require containers to be equipped with such a device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They stated that a pressure relief device is an integral part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a CNG container and that its importance warrants a requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that each container have one. In contrast, Brunswick, Comdyne,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pressure Technology, and AAMA stated that containers should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to have a pressure relief device because such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would be design restrictive. Brunswick and Pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology stated that the container should be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``safely vent'' its contents without rupturing, whether the venting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is done through a pressure relief device or the container wall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA stated that a container should pass the requirement if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possesses enough strength to retain its contents throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test. ARC believed that the container sidewalls should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to rupture during the bonfire test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has determined that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG container must be equipped with a pressure relief device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is necessary because each CNG fuel container needs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possess a means of releasing its contents in case the internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure or temperature reaches a dangerous level. By requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers to be equipped with a pressure relief device, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency will ensure the safety of individuals, such as vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupants and rescue personnel, who would be near a CNG vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a fire. The agency notes that the conditions experienced in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bonfire test may be less severe than certain real-world crash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations. Therefore, the agency is adopting a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative approach and requiring a pressure relief device for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all containers. In addition, such a requirement is consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the practice of most container manufacturers and NGV2 which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires such a device on all containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt NGV2's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test criteria that allows the test to be completed after 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minutes or when the container has completely vented, whichever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comes first. Adopting these criteria alters the test in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while still requiring a pressure relief device, a container could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the bonfire test if it either completely vents its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents by means of a pressure relief device at some point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during that 20 minute period or by successfully retaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's entire contents without bursting for the duration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bonfire test (i.e., 20 minutes). The agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each criterion appropriately measures a container's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstand high temperature and pressure because the bonfire test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents extreme conditions. The agency emphasizes that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either case the CNG container must be equipped with a pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA disagrees with the approach advocated by AAMA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brunswick and Pressure Technology to allow containers to ``safely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent'' their contents from an area other than the pressure relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device such as the sidewall. The agency acknowledges that, as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to a pressure relief device, pressure relief can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished by allowing the overpressurized container to vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its contents at a controlled rate, without fragmentation, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the container's sidewall. However, there would be significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems with this approach. First, it would not afford as high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a degree of safety as requiring a pressure relief device. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency continues to believe that the safest way to release CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from an overpressurized container is through a pressure relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device because some sidewall ruptures could result in fragments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being propelled from the container. Second, it would raise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential enforceability problems since the concepts of ``release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its contents at a controlled rate'' and ``rupture without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fragmentation'' are difficult to define objectively. Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above considerations, NHTSA has decided to require each CNG fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container to either completely vent its contents through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device or not burst when tested in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the test conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Types of Pressure Relief Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposal did not specify the use of a particular type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device. The agency is aware of three types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices currently being used: (1) The rupture disc, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to release CNG in the container when it reaches a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific pressure, (2) the fusible plug, which is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release CNG in the container when it reaches a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, and (3) a device that combines these two devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

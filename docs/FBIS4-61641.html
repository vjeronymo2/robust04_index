			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 8 May broadcast during  the "Sunday" program an 8-minute video report by correspondent  Natalya Chernyshova on the airbus crash in Siberia.    Chernyshova explains that this new report on the airbus  crash  in Siberia was compiled because "first of all, French experts  and the engineers who developed the airbus came to Moscow this  week, secondly -- we have received the black box recording from  unofficial sources, the same recording that we were refused at  the Interstate Aviation Committee."    As the video shows the investigation team looking at graphs,  the correspondent explains that the airbus flight was proceeding  normally and that the son and daughter of "experienced" pilot  Yaroslavl Kudrintskiy were thought to have entered the pilot's  cabin about four hours into the flight. Clips of the recording  are then played on three occasions accompanied by a  transcription on-screen, the speakers are not identified.    "Can I turn this?"    "Yes, if you turn it to the left."    "Which way will the plane go?"    "To the left."    "And if you turn it to the right?"    "It will turn to the right."    "Turn (?it) round."    "Look from the ground when you turn it. Let us turn to the  left. Turn it to the left."    "Is the plane turning or not?"    "It is turning well."    "Set it to normal attitude."    "We are moving to the right."    At this point the correspondent says there were two minutes,  25 seconds left before the plane crashes. The video then shows  the type of black box being used today before returning to the  second clip of recording.    "Why is the plane turning?"    "Is it turning by itself?"    "Yes."    "Why is it turning?"    "I do not know, you will not upset its course, will you?"    "Oh, what!"    "Kids..."    A graph then shows what was happening to the plane in the  final seconds.    "Eldar, leave the cabin, crawl out to the back, Eldar."    "We are going very fast."    "I have turned it on."    "Yes. That's it. We are moving out, we are moving out."    "Put the lever to the right."    "We are going very fast. Shut off the gas."    "I have reduced it."    "It is all right. We will be out of it in a moment."    "There we are, all normal."    "Slowly, slowly...we're getting there."    At this point the aircraft impacted on the ground.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F> Popular Party, by Mino Fuccillo in Rome on 27 January:  "`Berlusconi Spreading Hatred, Occhetto Creating a Mess....'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] There is a crowd  outside [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli's  door, whereas a few months ago it was a desert here, an  abandoned fortress. People are lining up to speak to him on the  telephone; whereas a few weeks ago he was receiving only  condolences and farewells, now it is all requests for  candidacies. "It is strange that the telephone is ringing in  this situation, in which we do not know how many members of  parliament we will succeed in having elected. We must be  careful not to allow ourselves to be overtaken by the frenzy of  saying 'yes': If we succeed in identifying the candidate's  profile, the 20 percent support could increase. Indeed, these  elections will be determined very much on the basis of  candidates; this factor will decide at least half the contest.  For the present I know that the exodus is over; there is a mood  of excitement, but many of the people I want are still  undecided."    [Fuccillo] You do have one sure candidate, a candidate to  the  premiership, no less.    [Martinazzoli] I recently met with [Pact for Italy leader]  Segni and advised him to make a very clear return to where he  was a few months ago. I urged him not to think that the contest  will be determined by cutting and pasting alliances and not to  seek victory in advance without even engaging in the struggle.  I told him to talk to ordinary people again, not with political  leaders, just as he used to recommend.    [Fuccillo] What was Segni's reply?    [Martinazzoli] He asked me to be clear about his candidacy,  his role as government leader.    [Fuccillo] And were you clear?    [Martinazzoli] I told him that we have only one chance -- to  defeat the left by halting the right. Because if there is a  strong right, the left will win. There is only one other  alternative for us, and that is opposition. Does that seem  clear enough to you?    [Fuccillo] It seems to me rather the opposite of what Segni  wanted -- to bring everyone together, both center and right, to  be sure of victory and to be sure of governing.    [Martinazzoli] Yes, Segni believed in the possibility of  bringing everyone together.    [Fuccillo] Does he seem disappointed to you now?    [Martinazzoli] Worried that his image may have suffered some  repercussions.    [Fuccillo] But you are not disappointed.    [Martinazzoli] No, I really am not. For some time in Italy  parties of the left or of the right have been winning elections,  while those identified with government, with Bribe City, have  been losing. There is a feeling of estrangement and rancor in  our regard. Can we recover by embracing the right? I do not  think so. If we do that, everyone will lose together, everyone  will become confused with each another and cancel each other  out. You know what a fine alliance [League's lower house floor  leader] Maroni proposed -- the North for us and the South for  you. And this is supposed to be the new politics. No, I would  rather pursue the straight and narrow and ask the Italians to  defeat the left by voting for the center.    [Fuccillo] Did Segni agree, or will he continue to seek  alliances on the right, possibly labeling them "technical  electoral agreements?"    [Martinazzoli] Within the Popular Party too there are those  who would like to extend the meaning of technical agreements  excessively, turning quantity into quality. A homeopathic dose  of electoral tactics is no cause for scandal -- but I am talking  about small doses. To make matters perfectly clear, I will say  that out of 475 constituencies we will be fielding our own  candidates almost everywhere, including in northern Italy.    [Fuccillo] In view of how things have gone, is Segni now not  competing like a contestant that has lost his stride?    [Martinazzoli] He has sought something that was nonexistent,  and let anyone who has not done the same in this lengthy crisis  cast the first stone.    [Fuccillo] Have you seen [Forza Italia] Berlusconi's  commercial on all the television channels?    [Martinazzoli] When I was invited to appear on one of his  television programs the whole screen was filled by Berlusconi.  I was shocked; it looked like the set for the chief of state's  New Year's message. There was something Gaullist about the set  and the staging. I will repeat an idea expressed by my friend,  [PPI deputy] Mattarella: If any other Italian citizen had  announced his entry into politics by sending a videocassette to  the newspapers, there would not have been so much ceremony. As  of yesterday there is something entirely new in politics and, I  would say, in the culture of this country -- something  disturbing.    [Fuccillo] Are you disturbed by Berlusconi as rival, as  demagogue, or as secretary of a business-come-party?    [Martinazzoli] I am disturbed by a party secretary that has  concessions from the state for three television networks. The  issue of the possession and utilization of networks and news is  a question of freedom according to the advocates of modernity.  Before Berlusconi became a politician we issued a fortuitous  response to the problem. Now everything has become more  critical. I think that a concession holder must respect the  limits and purposes of the concession. I do not think that this  is the case now. I think that the relinquishment of Fininvest's  social positions is only a way of evading the problem; we saw it  in the case of Montanelli's IL GIORNALE who was, and remained,  the real owner. Such conduct is verging on a sham. Last, I  think that no law can entirely resolve the issue unless there  are certain ethical standards on the part of the individuals  involved.    [Fuccillo] Do you think that Berlusconi has displayed such  standards?    [Martinazzoli] The other evening on television he issued a  message that was a concentration of the ideas of the right. All  this, in a mixture of aggressive Gaullism, skepticism, and a  kind of Craxi-style arrogance -- law and order, a social policy  of the survival of the fittest, and so forth. There is nothing  wrong in all this -- indeed, there are reasons for this  psychological and political response. But Berlusconi takes it  all too far, engages in ideological theorizing, and describes  the enemy as something evil. I have grounds for very strong  dispute with [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary]  Occhetto, but Berlusconi pronounces the word "communist" in such  a way, such a tone.... He adds something extra, the something  extra that prompted Gadda to say that he refused to engage in  politics because of the additional hatred and cynicism involved  in this human activity. Well, Berlusconi contributes that  something extra, whereas I have a very different conception of  politics.    [Fuccillo] In the next room your party friend, Fracanzani,  told me that it was necessary for the government to issue a  decree to set limits to the election campaign on television.    [Martinazzoli] Correct, but we must not turn Berlusconi into  a martyr and give the impression that we want to halt him by  decree. This is an anomalous and disturbing situation, but it is  the voters who must be the first to resolve it.    [Fuccillo] Forza Italia, the MSI [Italian Social Movement],  the National Alliance, the former Christian Democrats, and the  League are said to be very close to an electoral agreement, to a  cartel of the right.    [Martinazzoli] It is true. I have heard about meetings and  understandings. Having established the principle that everyone  must get together in order to win, come what may, the very  fragile wall that set the MSI apart could not remain standing.  They will not find it difficult to reach agreements; they will  find it difficult to establish who is in charge.    [Fuccillo] So the Italian right is emerging. Is it you  Christian Democrats who nurtured it in your bosom?    [Martinazzoli] No. Not even in Tambroni's day did the DC  decide to confront the left by nurturing a right-wing attitude  and action.    [Fuccillo] Assuming that it originated outside you, can it  be  defused? Berlusconi may not be capable of giving rise to this  mass right, but if it already exists in society, will it not  find a leader in Berlusconi?    [Martinazzoli] My political existence depends on the fact  that I do not believe that the right is a mass phenomenon. I  know that there is something in the subsoil of this society, and  I know that it feeds on the eclipse of morality and of the  center forces. I perceive the danger but I do not consider it  inevitable. And if I may say so, I still see in this right many  people who claim to have seen the light but who are in fact only  seeking personal salvation and advantage. Many of them will  bring in no votes but will demand positions.    [Fuccillo] What about the left?    [Martinazzoli] It comprises a mixture of the best of  Catholic  radicalism, communist nostalgia, and a former PCI [Italian  Communist Party] that models itself on Clinton. It is sterile.  Occhetto should have facilitated alternation by placing himself  at the center. He made the opposite choice, and if the right  makes headway he will bear part of the blame.    [Fuccillo] Will the PDS' and the PPI's paths not cross once  more after the elections?    [Martinazzoli] They want to win against us, and we against  them, so how can our paths cross? I know that from time to time  Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema talk in terms of a  Ciampi government after the elections, but they do so as a  second choice. In any case, I do not believe in an Occhetto who  talks like Quintino Sella [prefascist finance minister].    [Fuccillo] The coming election means two months of insults,  of open attacks on television and in the press. Is there any  option other than to accept it and submit to it?    [Martinazzoli] When [Radical leader] Pannella calls  journalists peasants, they leave the room, quite properly. But  it is the same journalists who are delighted when one political  calls another a "chicken thief." I am starting to find it  intolerable that in order to engage in politics you have to  suffer insults that would be considered unacceptable in other  fields. I wonder, is there a possibility of establishing  certain standards? Maybe in the future. At present the  standards are different -- those established the other evening  on television throughout Italy.</p>

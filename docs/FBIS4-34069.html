			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat by reporter </F> Bernardo de la Maza upon his return from a seminar organized by  the Inter-American Development Bank and the INTERNATIONAL HERALD  TRIBUNE in London -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Aninat] We met with several  U.K. authorities--particularly with Michael Portillo, the chief  secretary to the Treasury, and with the governor of the Central  Bank. We observed the great interest being shown by such  important countries as the United Kingdom in Chilean economic  development and in future British investments in the Chilean  market. We are creating great expectations.    [De la Maza] How do well-informed sectors in Europe view  Chilean negotiations with NAFTA and with Mercosur [Common Market  of the South]?    [Aninat] With great interest and with special attention  because it amazes them that Chile is undertaking two practically  concurrent major negotiations, namely negotiating with North  American countries--the United States, Canada, and Mexico--and  with Mercosur member countries. This is a positive indication  that we are maturing and gaining access to other types of  alliance. This is how they see us. I say with special attention  because EU countries do not want to be left out of Latin  America, or Chile in particular, through this type of  negotiations. This is very interesting for us and we should  propose special relations with European countries.    [De la Maza] In light of the criticism voiced about Chile's  possible incorporation into NAFTA, from the workers' standpoint,  how will joining NAFTA be to their advantage?    [Aninat] For one fundamental reason: Chile has been on an  export drive for more than 10 years, an outward-looking policy  that seeks to promote exports. The performance of those sectors  is fundamental for investments and employment. Moreover, Chile  is a poor country which does not have enough capital at its  disposal to undertake every interesting investment project. As  we attract capital by promoting more investments in our country,  there will be better and more productive employment. This is the  key to sustainable wage increases. In other words, increasing  productivity will mean workers will have more capital,  technology, and technical knowledge about investments at their  disposal which will, in turn, increase employment levels and  productivity.    [De la Maza] Many people wonder why Chile is so interested  in  joining NAFTA when we already have special tariffs on a  considerable slice of our exports into the United States and we  have a bilateral agreement with Mexico establishing zero tariffs.    [Aninat] Joining NAFTA is not a matter of life and death. It  is an important and complex negotiation, but it is neither  unique nor a decisive negotiation. The lower tariffs on our  products--which average a reduction of 3 percent--are to a large  extent based on the premise that Chile will for ever be subject  to the general system of preferences. These are unilateral  preferences that the Unites States graciously grants if it so  desires. We want a guaranteed and stable access and an openness  over our trade with the United States.    [De la Maza] What is your overall assessment of our economy?    [Aninat] I believe we are doing fine. There is some  impatience among some business sectors but I think we are doing  fine in terms of the adjustment between spending, revenues, and  our projection for the rest of the year. There is no doubt that  inflation will drop in the second semester and we will see that  our growth rate this year will be 4 percent. This is a little  lower than last year but it will consolidate one great step  forward and enable us to grow by 5 or 6 percent in real terms in  1995.    [De la Maza] Thank you very much.</p>

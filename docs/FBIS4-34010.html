			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera said tonight the time is right for Cuba  to rejoin the OAS, but he added President Fidel Castro could  make this process more viable.    "We are at the right time for Cuba to rejoin the hemispheric  community of nations," said Caldera, recalling statements made  by Portuguese President Mario Soares, who said Castro was "a man  beyond suspicion."    Soares expressed respect and admiration for President  Castro,  saying "the Cold War ended, and the Berlin Wall fell; therefore,  there are no reasons whatsoever why Cuba could not help abate  the isolation it is in."    Caldera said the current conditions are propitious for the  island to rejoin the OAS, but "it is also the time for Cuba to  revise its domestic policies."    The Venezuelan president decried the blockade against Cuba,  "because any unilateral blockade harms the people rather than a  certain government."    Answering questions from the media, the Venezuelan chief of  state said "neoliberal policies carried out at any price and  policies of structural adjustment rigorously carried out in an  orthodox manner have made us pay a very high social cost."    Caldera believes trade openings and processes of integration  have benefited all nations, but "the exaggeration with which the  neoliberal doctrine has been implemented has deteriorated  society, and those peoples who elected us are demanding better  and more humane living conditions," he said.    Caldera, along with 21 chiefs of state and government (in  addition to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso),  are attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will end  on 15 June at this port, located 1,200 km from Santa Fe de  Bogota along the Colombian Caribbean coast.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Liar' that's lasted BILLY LIAR opened in 1960 at the Cambridge Theatre with Albert Finney in the lead, succeeded by Tom Courtenay. Lindsay Anderson directed. Now, a National Theatre production is touring the UK. When it reaches London (Cottesloe Theatre, December 15) it will be the first London revival since that original. This sad comedy by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall has spawned a film, musical, TV series and an American sitcom. The hero, Billy Fisher, would now be in his 50s. Why has a tall tale about a liar lasted so long? At Manchester's Contact Theatre, Billy Liar is part comedy and part social history, class envy and emulation in the 1950s north. This fable of England is set in a riot of 1950s design colour and the wasteland of 1950s monochrome attitudes. The tone of this production, like Billy's mind, is undecided; it looks patchy. Billy Fisher, 18, grammar-school educated and poised between working and middle class, is, as his fiance says 'a miserable, lying, rotten, stinking git.' He lies to aggrandise himself, and weaves deception only to be ensnared. He lives with rough, decent parents, and courts women en masse. Eventually his tall stories, his pilfering from work, and his two fiances - Barbara and Rita - catch up with him. Billy's way out is south for London, encouraged by Liz, the one who intuitively understands his pathology. But his failure to leave the damaging environment is a painful moment. Opportunities are rare, and Billy has wit enough to know a missed one. The production serves the play well enough. The 1950s design (Bunny Christie) is a cacophony of patterns and styles of the kind on sale in New York's SoHo chic antiques dealers; Billy's grandmother (Elizabeth Bradley) shows taste in addressing the furniture rather than the family. The parents (June Watson, James Grant) keep brawling distance from Billy, conveying but rarely feeling their limitations. As Billy, Paul Wyett jokes too much to appear wise, and underplays the adolescent, arrested development which makes Billy's imaginings part of everyone's past. The 1992 version of the play would find Billy in care, or working in Virtual Reality. The 1960 version offers the excruciating sight of someone being untrue to himself: lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds. Tim Supple's direction clogs the action in the cluttered travelling set, but draws good performances from Billy's fiances and in particular from Sally Rogers as Liz: one actually believes in her hope and ability to save Billy from himself. Back in 1959, with unemployment around 2 per cent, a new M1 motorway, hula-hoops and hovercrafts, the world had looked bright for Billy. But in the broader picture, Billy pales alongside his real-life North American contemporaries Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady; to read On The Road (1957) is still to anticipate the 1990s, whereas to see Billy Liar is to look back towards Victorian England. This comedy is a serious play about England. Unfortunately it still feels current. On Tour until 6 March 1993: Sponsored by BP</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Emergency Food Aid Relieve Rice </F> Shortage"]    [Text] Over 400,000 people suffer from rice shortage in the  country after severe drought last September devastated crop  yields in parts of southern and northern Laos. People who may  traditionally have to cope with three month or so annual  shortage face the prospect of no rice at all for six to eleven  months until the next harvest in October or November.    With no other income source than agriculture, they depend on  the ever diminishing resources of their neighbours or relatives  and the shrinking number of small animals, rodents, insects and  tubers hunted and foraged in the forests. Many farmers have  already been forced by hunger to consume the seeds set aside for  the 1994 planting. For most families, sale of buffalo -- the  main source of energy for ploughing -- would represent an act of  desperation. There have not been widespread livestock sales thus  far.    In 1993, the Lao PDR's [People's Democratic Republic]  production of rice, the staple food of the country, was 1.25  million tonnes, some 17 percent below the previous year's  harvest. The provinces of Savannakhet, Saravane, Sayaboury, and  Houa Phan were particularly hard hit. In Savannakhet Province,  normally a premier rice producer, ten of thirteen districts  produced a deficit. Some districts face, on average, an eleven  month shortage and some people have had no reliable source of  food since the last harvest.    As the magnitude of the problem became known, the Government  of Laos acted swiftly to seek assistance from the international  community through the United Nation's World Food Programme  (WFP). A joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)/WFP  assessment in February recommended food aid amounting to 43,000  tonnes of polished rice to supply the people of the worst  affected districts in the four hardest hit provinces. Those  enduring the most severe food shortage would each receive 72 kgs  of rice to tide them over the final six months before the 1994  harvest.    Ms. Ameerah Haq-Perera, United Nations Development Programme  resident representative, explains that the situation is not  comparable to a famine of the proportions experienced in  Ethiopia or Somalia: "The effects are not of people starving to  death but more of hunger and disease."    The impact of the food shortage on the long-term development  plans of the country is a concern: "It is difficult to switch  from a subsistence economy when farmers are out foraging for  food and their energies cannot he diverted to more productive  ventures," says Ms. Haq-Perera.    WFP's temporary office, which was opened in February 1992 to  help the Lao government and people cope with the after-effects  of the 1991 floods which devastated the rice-bowl provinces of  the south, is now entering its third emergency operation. Last  year 3,000 tonnes of WFP aid was distributed to drought-stricken  northern provinces of Luang Namtha, Houa Phan, Xieng Khouang,  and Phong Saly.    In response to this year's emergency appeal, a total of  around 19,000 tonnes of rice has so far been pledged by WFP,  Canada, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, and the European Union.  Non-Governmental Organisations [NGO], including World Concern,  Care, and World Vision, are assisting with distributing the rice.    The biggest task now facing those involved in the emergency  operation is getting the rice to the villagers before the worst  affected communities are cut off by the monsoonal rains. "Many  areas will be cut off for months when the rains set in in a few  weeks. The NGOs we work with in some areas fear the rains will  leave them with stocks they cannot deliver or distribute," says  WFP emergency coordinator Steve Keller. Donor assistance is now  required for the administration, logistical support, and  monitoring.    The 1,000 or so inhabitants of Nasenoi village recently  received delivery of 55 tonnes of WFP rice. World Concern  efficiently supervised the distribution and district  record-keepers took thumb prints as eligible people collected  their correct allocation.    However, the long-term solution to this chronic food  shortage  problem, explains Ms. Haq-Perera, is the Government's  agricultural policy to bring more land into cultivation with  small scale irrigation schemes and by encouraging crop  diversification. This will ensure that the food supply  situation is no longer so vulnerable to the vagaries of the  weather.</p>

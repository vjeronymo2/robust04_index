			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Conductor on peak form - Richard Fairman finds Jansons bringing out the best in the LSO The London Symphony Orchestra has taken to printing quotations from reviews in its programmes of late. Carefully-edited snippets lauding an orchestra's 'beauty' and 'grandeur' are the sort of one-upmanship liable to test one's patience, especially if the playing leaves something to be desired, but nobody is likely to have complained to the LSO on Thursday. The orchestra is finishing the 1993-4 season in what must be its best form for many years. Three closing concerts with Mariss Jansons are scheduled within the space of a week and the only regret after this first one was that these will be Jansons's last appearances with the LSO, at least for a while. As from this autumn he has undertaken to conduct in London exclusively as principal guest conductor for the rival London Philharmonic, an agreement that must have been signed a year or more ago. Now we learn that the London Philharmonic is to say goodbye to its music director, Franz Welser-Most, so where does this leave Jansons? The London Philharmonic's management said last week that it would take some time for a new appointment to be made, but it is difficult to see why. In half-an-hour they could easily take the tube to the Barbican and head for the conductor's room with the words, 'Hello, Mariss. Do you want the job?' Assuming he does want it, that is: unfortunately Jansons may by now have higher ambitions elsewhere. How his star has risen in the last ten years. From his regular visits to London with three of the capital's orchestras he has shown himself to be unrivalled as an interpreter of Russian music and big showpiece scores. On Thursday, with the LSO, he turned to the standard German classics and gave us Beethoven and Bruckner, thought-out and delivered to an exemplary standard that may well have surprised even his most ardent admirers. In Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto he accompanied Alfred Brendel in a typically alert fashion, balancing the romantic leanings of Brendel's lyrical playing with neatly-sprung classical phrasing. From both of them it was a marvellously concentrated performance, which always knew what it wanted to say, and said it with wit and tenderness. Those same qualities shone through in Bruckner's Seventh Symphony too, where they might not necessarily be thought so appropriate. Jansons's Bruckner was never going to be distinguished by the wisdom that is learnt patiently over long decades by the composer's most illustrious interpreters, because that is not his nature. What he brought to the music was the keenest possible intelligence and a fine ear. If the symphony in the end added up to less than the sum of its parts, that did not stop every part of it being riveting. Sometimes in the past, when faced with a big work, Jansons has been seduced by volume for its own sake, but thankfully not here. In the long opening movement one could have been listening to chamber music, so clear was every strand of the music. Like the best international orchestras, the LSO has found a natural internal balance of its own, so that the brass no longer raucously drown their colleagues at climaxes as they used to. To judge from the flute and oboe solos, even more the first violins' work above the stave, the players are now technically well ahead of any other British orchestra. Their two remaining concerts with Jansons are highly recommended. Sponsored by Toshiba. The other two concerts are on July 3 and 5</p>

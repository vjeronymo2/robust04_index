			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Crisis threatens in Poland over cabinet post dispute Poland's two-month search for a finance minister threatens to blow up into a political crisis following the refusal of President Lech Walesa to accept Dr Dariusz Rosati, a 47-year-old economist, for the post. Mr Marek Borowski resigned as finance minister after a dispute with Mr Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister, over control of the economy. The lack of a successor has left policy-making in a state of flux just as the government faces new talks with the International Monetary Fund on a standby agreement. Dr Rosati, currently employed by the United Nations in Geneva, said yesterday he was considering withdrawing his candidature, which was put forward by the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), the senior coalition partner. The president's decision appears to mark the start of open hostilities with the SLD which could paralyse the government. At the weekend, Mr Walesa threatened to dissolve parliament after Mr Borowski suggested that the president's constitutional powers to block government appointments might be curtailed. Mr Pawlak, who leads the farmers party (PSL), the junior coalition partner, yesterday issued a statement supporting Dr Rosati's candidature 'for as long as the SLD or Dr Rosati maintain it'. However, Mr Pawlak has not been happy with Dr Rosati's candidature and the president's veto is aimed at widening the rift between the two coalition partners. Mr Walesa particularly wants to weaken Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the youthful SLD leader who is a serious challenger for the presidency in elections due in the autumn of 1995. At the root of the dispute over the finance post is an attempt by Mr Pawlak to establish his primacy over the cabinet and redefine the original coalition agreement which handed responsibility for economic and financial policy to the SLD when the government was formed last autumn.</p>

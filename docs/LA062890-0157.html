			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> THE LION I'S;  </P> <P> REGGAE ROCKERS;  </P> <P> THE VENTURA COUNTY BAND WILL BE OPENING ACT AT LA CASA DE LA RAZA IN SANTA  BARBARA.  </P> <P> So where's the beat? Right here with The Lion I's, a group of seven Ventura  County locals who do reggae right. They do original rockin' reggae that keeps  the dance floor packed whenever and wherever they play.  </P> <P> So infectious is The Lion I's beat that they could probably make a statue of a  guy yawning in the opera get up and dance.  </P> <P> Along with Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads, The Lion I's are probably the best  draw among local bands. They play the usual places, such as Charlie's in  Ventura. But they also have played The Ventura Theatre, a few places in Santa  Barbara and San Luis Obispo and also at the recent Fiesta del Sol at the  Ventura Marina.  </P> <P> This Saturday, the band will open for the Jamaican reggae hot guy, Halie  Maskel, at La Casa de la Raza in Santa Barbara, home to hardwood floors, cheap  beer and killer burritos.  </P> <P> The Lion I's feature Bobby Galyan on vocals, Guy Jeans on keyboards, Dave  Spasiano on guitar, Robert Cadeel on drums, Brian Conaway on sax, Bruce Conaway  on bass and Tony Soria on trumpet.  </P> <P> "When we first started, Bobby and I used to do all these old blues covers,"  said Jeans, who is studying to be an elementary school teacher. "Then we met  Dave and started doing a lot of parties, at least, until the cops came. We met  Bruce and Brian, hit it off real well, and they joined and the band became  better. Tony is the newest member. He joined two months ago."  </P> <P> "We became a reggae band because we all like reggae," Galyan said. "We all like  Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, the English Beat and Bob Marley. We only do about  four covers -- we've got over 20 originals, maybe three albums worth of stuff.  We practice twice a week and play at least once a week. We're working on a tape  right now, or maybe it'll be a CD. Anyway, whatever it is, it'll have about 10  tunes on it."  </P> <P> "We just want to get a tape out and get signed," Spasiano said. "Right now,  everyone has a day job. I'm a Realtor, and a waiter at night. Guy delivers gum  to machines; Bobby's in construction."  </P> <P> The band is an example of democracy with a beat. "Everyone in the band has  input, but I do a lot of music, and Bobby writes a lot of the lyrics," Jeans  said.  </P> <P> Some of the tunes that inevitably pack the dance floor are "Closer," "Time Will  Tell," "Gimme Some Time" and "Who to Trust." All of these songs are at least  five minutes long, sometimes longer, and guaranteed to get the dancers in shape  -- or kill them off.  </P> <P> "We haven't played our best gig yet," Galyan said, "but last December when we  opened for Bamiki Bandula at The Ventura Theatre, we sounded pretty damn good.  We love that big stage.  </P> <P> "When we play, we want people to have a good time," Galyan said. "I just tell  everybody to chill out. We don't want no violence; violence can ruin a band."  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: On Saturday, The Lion I's will open for Halie Maskel at La  Casa de la Raza at 601 E. Montecito St. in Santa Barbara. Tickets are $10. For  more information call 965-8581.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] THE GHANAIAN DEMOCRAT and THE INDEPENDENT comment  on relations between Ghana and Togo. THE DEMOCRAT recounts  atrocities meted out Ghanaians living in Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire  and, recently, Togo, and says in addition to killing Ghanaians,  the Togolese have, for the first time, violated Ghana's  territorial integrity. THE DEMOCRAT therefore calls on the  government not to continue toeing what it calls the soft line in  the face of the savage acts perpetrated against Ghanaians in  Togo. It hopes this is the last time lives of Ghanaians would  have been wantonly lost.    On its part, THE INDEPENDENT says it believes that Ghanaians  do no want to go to war with Togo. An internationally arranged  meeting between Presidents Rawlings and Eyadema on a neutral  ground could therefore bring about peaceful coexistence.</p>

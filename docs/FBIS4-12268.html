			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] Thousands of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] reservists  have recently been issued special call-up orders to reinforce  the Army's presence in Hebron and to replace some of the regular  Army units that have been stationed inside and around the town  since the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs over one month  ago.    The commanders of these units have been receiving dozens of  requests from soldiers asking to be released from reserve duty  because of personal or business-related problems. Yesterday,  IDF sources explained that were it possible, they would have  been glad to do without the service of these soldiers, and  promised that these soldiers will be the first of those in the  field to be released from duty.    The call-up orders were issued without giving the soldiers  the required advance notice. They were based on a special  authorization issued by Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the  IDF Manpower Branch, in light of the situation. According to  senior military sources, "the situation made the call-up of  reserve soldiers necessary. We cannot freeze the education and  training of the regular soldiers for long periods. The  detrimental effect this has had on the regular soldiers is  already untenable." The sources added that employing the  reservists will involve thousands of reserve duty days and  constitute a difficult burden for the reserve soldiers.    Over the past few weeks, reservists from the Artillery and  Infantry Corps have received thousands of call-up orders for  special operational activity in the territories. The call-up  orders were issued without the customary 44-day advance notice.  At this stage, call-up orders have been sent to reservists who  were not supposed to serve in the territories in the current  workyear. The units called up for special reserve duty have  done long periods of reserve duty in the territories over the  past two years, and the IDF had originally intended to refrain  from using these units this year.    The call-up orders were sent to the soldiers several weeks  ago, in the wake of a situation analysis conducted by the  General Staff's Operations Department. The commanders of the  reserve units met with Maj. Gen. Yoram Ya'ir over the past few  days to protest the decision to break the promises made earlier  to their soldiers.</p>

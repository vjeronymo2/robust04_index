			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> CLEANUP OF TAINTED SOIL  </P> <P> Builders Emporium has begun removing contaminated soil from its warehouse site  on Surveyor Street after a Pomona Fire Department inspection found that used  motor oil and solvents had been dumped on the ground.  </P> <P> Lyn LaRochelle, division chief and fire marshal, said Builders Emporium shut  down its vehicle maintenance garage and hired a hazardous waste cleanup company  after the Fire Department discovered the problem last week.  </P> <P> John Kearney, executive vice president, said employees in the garage failed to  follow proper procedures for the disposal of used oil. He said that the company  immediately closed the garage but that operations in the adjoining warehouse,  which has 140 employees, were not disrupted.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Skopbank cuts operating losses to FM1.7bn The crisis at Skopbank, the state-controlled Finnish bank, eased last year after a halving of operating losses to FM1.70bn (Dollars 309m) from FM3.59bn a year earlier. However, the bank expects to make another loss this year and it is likely to require further state support. Skopbank is the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis. The bank has received a total of FM17.03bn in government assistance since it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991. Last year's improvement was largely the result of a 40 per cent drop in credit losses to FM1.7bn from FM2.8bn. However, the group benefited from a 69 per cent rise in income to FM728m and a 41 per cent fall in expenses to FM649m. Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has changed following the sale of the Savings Bank of Finland to four other Finnish banks last autumn. Skopbank continues to service domestic corporate customers and represent the savings banks in wholesale markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Rexrodt Wants To Upgrade Taipei </F> Politically, Too"]    [Excerpt] Taipei, 26 Apr -- After talks with leading  politicians in Taipei, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt sees  "very good chances" for the export of the German high-speed  train, Intercity Express [ICE], to Taiwan.    The parliament in Taipei wants to make a basic decision in  the period between May and July on the construction of a 350-km  high-speed link between the capital in the north of the island  and the industrial town of Koahsiung in the south, which would  cost $17 billion.    Not only the success of the Intercity Express in Germany and  the advanced technology speak for the German system, but also  the fact that a German consortium is offering a private  financing and operating scheme in accordance with the wishes of  the Taiwanese parliament. Under the leadership of the Daimler  subsidiary AEG, the German enterprises are prepared to make a  comprehensive technology transfer, so that the Taiwanese  industry, too, will profit from this project.    Rexrodt also stressed Germany's interest in the export of  air  buses, of short-distance traffic systems for the conurbation  centers of the island, and of power plants and energy supply  systems.    Basically, the government is interested in an  intensification  of economic relations, the economics minister stated during his  talks with State President Lee Teng-hui, Economics Minister  Chiang, Transportation Minister Liu, and leading  parliamentarians.    Rexrodt welcomed the plan to establish a Taiwan center in  Frankfurt and promised German support for the Taipei  Government's wish to rejoin the United Nations and to be  accepted by the newly founded World Trade Organization.    The Chinese partners demanded that Taiwan be deleted from  the  "H list" for exports, which includes countries that need a  special permit for the export of goods that can be used for  military and civilian purposes. Rexrodt stressed that the  Federal Government is currently considering reducing this list  from 36 to 8-12 countries.    A decision will be made by the summer. The German economics  minister promised his partners in Taiwan that he will examine  whether the next of the FRG's Asian economic conferences can  take place in Taipei in 1996. [passage omitted]</p>

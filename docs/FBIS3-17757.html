			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington March 29 TASS -- The Russo-American  relations are resting on a solid foundation, but their  "honeymoon" is over. This is how some White House officials, who  preferred to remain anonymous, have described the present state  of relations between the two countries. They held a briefing  for a group of Russian journalists on Monday.    The officials stressed that normal relations, and this is  how, in their opinion, the current level of the  Washington-Moscow dialogue can be described, do not exclude  difficulties and problems. Moverover, the number of such  problems and difficulties has lately increased.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about the reasons behind these  difficulties, one of the White House officials said that he  could only repeat what was already said in Moscow and Washington  -- the "honeymoon" in American-Russian relations is over. This  "honeymoon" began after the end of the "cold war", he stated,  and America's assessments of Russia then differed sharply from  its assessments of the Soviet Union. In his opinion America had  then established excessively close relations with Russia which  could not be kept up. Speaking about the end of the  "honeymoon", the official said he was not referring to any  crisis. Normal relations envisage differences too, he said. In  solving its domestic political problems Russia is again  beginning to play an active role on the world arena -- in Europe  and the beyond its bounds. He said he believed some differences  between the two countries were quite normal in these conditions.    It is an open secret that the results of the parliamentary  elections in Russia were a surprise for the United States,  another White House official said. The administration had  closely followed the developments in Russia, but it did not  foresee such an outcome, he added. The resignation of two main  architects of the Russian reforms -- Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov -- were a shock not only for many officials of the  administration, but also for the congress, the press, and the  American public at large. The official said that this shock was  explained by the fact that America had cultivated its relations  with Russia largely relying on the presence of reformers in the  Russian Government. Analysing the latest events, the American  side has arrived at the conclusion that strong American-Russian  relations should be developed irrespective of personalities, on  the basis of the mutual understanding of bilateral interests.  The results of the parliamentary elections and of several events  that have occurred lately on the international arena have,  without doubt, increased differences in America's and Russia's  approaches, but have not unsettled their bilateral relations.</p>

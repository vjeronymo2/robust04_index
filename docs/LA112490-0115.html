			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES PUZZLED BY OUTBREAK OF HOLIDAY VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The outburst of holiday violence continued in Los Angeles County on Friday, as  the Thanksgiving period death toll from gang-related shootings, arson and  random gunfire reached 14.  </P> <P> "I just keep seeing a lot more violence," said Sheriff's Lt. Joe Patterson,  stationed in Norwalk. "It's something that's going on in our society. It just  seems to be getting worse. The weekend's not even begun yet. Here it is only  Friday, and we've had this many victims already."  </P> <P> A 17-year-old gang-tattooed youth died after being shot in the back of the head  during an apparent drive-by shooting early Friday in Norwalk, sheriff's  officials said. The victim, Antonio Rivera, of Norwalk, was pronounced dead at  a local hospital where he had been brought by friends who said they found him  lying in the street, bleeding, near his car.  </P> <P> At 9:15 Friday night, Long Beach police reported a man fatally shot on Nevada  Street. Officers said the shooting did not appear to be gang related. The man  died at Long Beach Memorial Hospital shortly after.  </P> <P> In another killing, Edward Babb, 27, a construction worker, was walking north  of downtown Los Angeles on his way to a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner  when he was accosted by two men demanding money.  </P> <P> "He told them he didn't have any, and he was shot" and killed, said Los Angeles  Police Detective Sam Catalfamo, who quoted witnesses.  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Northridge youth was fatally shot at a party in Chatsworth,  reportedly in a dispute over his beeper, Los Angeles Police said Friday. Marc  Squires was shot while attending a party Wednesday night on Bryant Street, said  Detective Michael Brandt. He died Thursday at Northridge Hospital Medical  Center.  </P> <P> Police said the gunman apparently wanted the youth's beeper. "It seems kind of  hard to believe that that's something worth fighting over," Brandt said. No  arrests had been made but police were interviewing several witnesses.  </P> <P> Late Thursday, a man and woman were discovered shot to death in a Montrose  apartment, apparently the victims of a murder-suicide that occurred more than  two weeks earlier, authorities said. Deputies were sent to the apartment in the  2300 block of Mira Vista Avenue at the request of the woman's father. The  father called authorities after unsuccessfully trying to contact the daughter  for 10 days, sheriff's officials said.  </P> <P> Deputies found the couple, whose names were not released, on the bedroom floor  of the apartment they shared, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. A semiautomatic  handgun and two discharged shell casings were found nearby.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies were responsible for at least one casualty on the holiday  victim list. Deputies saw Palema Tonga Matangi, 27, of Long Beach, crossing the  street at Orcutt Avenue and 67th Way in north Long Beach, near where a 1989  robbery occurred. One unidentified deputy, thinking that Matangi fit a  description of a robbery suspect, shot and wounded him when he did not keep his  hands in his pockets as ordered.  </P> <P> Matangi, who was unarmed, was struck by bullets in the torso, the right arm and  the right leg. He underwent surgery Friday at Long Beach Memorial Medical  Center and was in critical condition. No charges had been filed in either the  shooting or the robbery.  </P> <P> In Hollywood, an emotionally distraught man blasted the back wall of his home  with more than 70 shotgun rounds, prompting a neighborhood evacuation. He held  deputies at bay for four hours, before surrendering without a struggle.  </P> <P> A young mother and her 7-month-old baby were killed in an apparent arson fire  in the 7300 block of Petrol Street in Paramount early Thursday. The names of  the victims were not released. Five other residents in the apartment were  injured by flames and smoke that engulfed the apartment. Fire investigators  found a three-gallon plastic gasoline can in the hallway.  </P> <P> "The gas can led investigators to believe the fire was intentionally set," a  sheriff's spokesman said.  </P> <P> Early Friday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the front window of a house  in Pasadena, igniting a fire that injured a man and forced a family, including  several small children, to flee, authorities said.  </P> <P> The firebombing, which occurred shortly after midnight, may have been the  result of a family argument, county fire officials said.  </P> <P> "Thanksgiving generally had been one of the quieter holidays in terms of  crime," said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ross Moen, watch commander in the  department's Pacific division, which saw its first Thanksgiving Day homicide in  five years when Paul Yanez, 22, of Venice, was shot to death on Westminister  Avenue late Thursday. No witnesses to the killing had been identified and no  motive had been determined, Moen said.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan deals go ahead after coup delay THE PRICING of two Venezuelan deals launched before the failed coup earlier this month went ahead last week, after being postponed. Dealers said the market had now stabilised, though recovery so far had been slight and sentiment remained nervous. The pricing indicates that, despite a 20 per cent fall in the local stock market in the wake of the coup, the market for new issues remains open. A Dollars 110m global offering of shares for Sivensa (Siderurgica Venezolana), a large manufacturing company, was due to be priced two days after the coup attempt, on February 5. The shares were finally priced earlier this week at Dollars 9.50 per unit. The deal has been fully placed, according to adviser Samuel Montagu. An offering of 5m global depositary receipts in Venepal, a paper and pulp company, was being promoted at a US roadshow on the day of the coup. The price was set on Tuesday, after a short delay, at Dollars 10 1/2 , and the paper has been sold out, according to co-ordinator Lehman Brothers. The Mexico Fund, a closed-end investment company listed on the New York and London stock exchanges, announced a rights issue entitling shareholders to acquire one new share for every three they currently hold. This will allow the issue of up to 6.57m new shares at a slight discount to the market price, which yesterday was Dollars 26 7/8 , suggesting the offer will raise roughly Dollars 180m.</p>

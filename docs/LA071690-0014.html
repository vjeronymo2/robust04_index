			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOIS M. YOUNG; STAR IN SILENT'S 'STELLA DALLAS'  </P> <P> Lois Moran Young, a dancer at the Paris Opera at age 13 and a film star two  years later as the daughter in the silent version of "Stella Dallas," died  Friday at a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz. She was 81 and had retired to Arizona  many years ago.  </P> <P> Said to have been F. Scott Fitzgerald's inspiration for Rosemary in "Tender Is  the Night," Mrs. Young, who acted as Lois Moran, was last before the cameras in  1954 when she played May Herrick, wife of Capt. John Herrick (Preston Foster)  in the TV series "Waterfront," based on the adventures of a tugboat captain in  San Pedro.  </P> <P> Mrs. Young, born in Pittsburgh, was given dancing lessons at an early age,  studied in France and danced with the Paris Opera. She was photographed by Man  Ray and made two films in Europe when Samuel Goldwyn discovered her.  </P> <P> Originally, he wanted her for the lead in "Romeo and Juliet," but she became  Laurel in his 1925 "Stella Dallas" with Ronald Colman. She appeared in more  than two dozen movies, among them "Reckless Lady," "The Road to Mandalay,"  "Mammy" and "The Men in Her Life."  </P> <P> She then studied singing and made her Broadway debut in "This Is New York"  before starring in George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind long-running satiric hit  "Of Thee I Sing."  </P> <P> While in Hollywood, she had become friendly with Fitzgerald and his wife,  Zelda, and was said to have been his model for Rosemary Hoyt, the film starlet  in Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical novel of disillusioned Americans living  in the decadence of post-World War I Europe.  </P> <P> In 1935 she married Clarence M. Young, a vice president of Pan American World  Airways who was a year younger than her mother. She told Richard Lamparski in a  1985 interview for his "Whatever Became of . . . ?" series of books on former  stars that they were "wonderfully happy" until his death in 1972.  </P> <P> In the 1950s she taught drama and dance at Stanford University and then  co-starred in "Waterfront," retiring after that.  </P> <P> She is survived by a son, Timothy.  </P></p>

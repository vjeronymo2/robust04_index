			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TARGET OF DRUG TASK FORCE SUES;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: HE ACCUSES OFFICERS OF ABUSING HIM AND PLANTING EVIDENCE ON  SUSPECTS.  </P> <P> An alleged South-Central Los Angeles drug dealer, once the target of a special  crime task force, has filed suit against several law enforcement officers,  saying they violated his civil rights in their attempts to send him to prison.  </P> <P> One of the officers cited in the complaint filed by Ricky Donell Ross is former  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Sobel, the key government witness in  the current money-skimming trial of seven sheriff's narcotics officers. He has  testified in Los Angeles federal court that deputies abused and planted  evidence on numerous drug suspects, including Ross.  </P> <P> The civil suit filed in federal court alleges that from March, 1987, to about  November, 1989, several sheriff's deputies and Los Angeles police officers  violated Ross' civil rights by denying him due process and subjecting him to  excessive force -- including beatings and a mauling by a police dog.  </P> <P> The complaint, which seeks unspecified general and punitive damages, also  charges the officers with assault, battery, false arrest and false  imprisonment.  </P> <P> Also named in the suit are Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, and the  city and county of Los Angeles, which the complaint accuses of having  maintained an "official" policy that permitted the civil rights violations to  occur.  </P> <P> Ross, currently imprisoned for a drug conviction, could not be reached. His  attorney, Robert Mann, also could not be contacted.  </P> <P> The plaintiff's brother, David Ross, 38, said Tuesday he was aware of the  lawsuit and shared its sentiments.  </P> <P> "This is to compensate for all the brutality the police did to my brother and  all the harassment my family has suffered," said David Ross, who, with his  mother, was attending the trial of the seven deputies accused of stealing $1.4  million from drug dealers and money launderers.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth declined to comment on the complaint.  </P> <P> A sheriff's deputy named in the suit denied that he and his colleagues had done  anything wrong and questioned the credibility of a suspected drug dealer.  </P> <P> "We did our jobs effectively and professionally," said Deputy Ed Jamison, a  former member of a task force that targeted Ross and other suspected drug  dealers. "It doesn't surprise me that (Ross) would come up with these  allegations. . . . He's responsible for putting hundreds of pounds of poison on  the streets."  </P> <P> Jamison was a member of the joint Sheriff's-LAPD Southwest Task force, a unit  once dubbed the "Freeway Rick Task Force," because it initially was formed in  January, 1987, to build a case against Ross.  </P> <P> In testifying recently against his fellow officers, Sobel -- who once headed  the task force -- recalled how some of his crew members allegedly attempted to  set up Ross in April, 1987.  </P> <P> The former sergeant, who has pleaded guilty to money-skimming and tax-evasion  charges in the case, said he and other law enforcement officers once pursued  Ross in an auto chase to a residential area, where Ross abandoned his car and  climbed a fence to escape.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CANYON IN CONTROL EARLY IN VICTORY OVER SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Canyon High School played one solid half of basketball Wednesday night, but it  was enough to take over sole possession of second place in the Century League.  </P> <P> After playing to near perfection in the first half, Canyon turned its big lead  into a 57-52 victory over Santa Ana at Canyon. The victory moved the Comanches  a game ahead of the Saints with one regular-season game remaining.  </P> <P> "This was a big, big win for us," Canyon Coach Steve Sabins said. "I thought we  played an excellent game."  </P> <P> For one half, anyway. The Comanches (13-10 overall, 6-3 in league) disrupted  the Saints' offense early on by denying forward Chauncey Woolridge the ball.  </P> <P> Woolridge came into the game averaging 17 points a game, but was scoreless in  the first half Wednesday. He finished with 13 points, but made only four of 12  shots.  </P> <P> Without Woolridge, the Saints appeared confused on offense. Octavio Medina was  the only consistent player. He scored eight points in the first half and  finished with 21.  </P> <P> Santa Ana remained close until early in the second quarter, but was held  scoreless for the final 6 minutes 5 seconds of the half. Canyon scored 11  consecutive points during that span to take a 30-15 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "We took Woolridge out of the game and held them to 15 points," Sabins said.  "We can't play any better. That's as good of a half as anyone can play."  </P> <P> The Saints, who had won four consecutive league titles entering the season,  opened the game in a box-and-one defense in an effort to control Canyon's Kevin  Wilborn. For the most part it worked. Wilborn, who averages 16 points a game,  had only four at halftime.  </P> <P> However, Eric Oliver picked up the slack. He scored 11 points in the first half  and finished with 19.  </P> <P> Foothill 61, Santa Ana Valley 43 -- Center Fred Amos scored 22 points and  forward Mark Wilkinson added 20 points as Foothill won its ninth consecutive  game.  </P> <P> El Modena 46, Villa Park 45 (OT) -- El Modena's Gregg Gottlieb made a  three-point field goal with less than 10 seconds remaining in regulation to  send the game into overtime. He also scored four of the Vanguards' six points  in overtime.  </P></p>

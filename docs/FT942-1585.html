			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Police seize papers at Ferruzzi unit Police yesterday seized documents from the Milan headquarters of Gaic, the finance company controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria and the family of Mr Camillo De Benedetti. The move was ordered by Ravenna magistrates investigating the parallel accounting and alleged illicit financial operations of the Ferruzzi group that forced its collapse last June. It is a potentially important development, in that part of their investigation concerns the behaviour of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, which was given a mandate to restructure the Ferruzzi group's L30,000bn (Dollars 18.7bn) debts on June 4 1993. Until a year ago, Gaic held a majority stake in Fondiaria, the insurance group. The documents seized relate to a board meeting of June 29 1993, which decided to raise L1,000bn for Fondiaria. Since Gaic lacked the funds to subscribe to the issue, the capital move in effect removed Fondiaria from Ferfin's control. The Ravenna magistrates are trying to establish at what point Mediobanca was given full control over the Ferruzzi rescue, and the role played by the merchant bank in the Fondiaria affair. Executives at Mediobanca and three other banks involved in the Ferruzzi rescue have been questioned as to whether they had prior knowledge the group's accounts were false, concealing losses of L430bn. All have denied improper banking conduct.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (4): Packages versus bespoke systems - Software Debate / Alan Cane explains why bespoke systems still have an important role in business operations LARGE software projects involve a level of complexity which is invariably difficult to manage. It is all too easy to lose sight of the original business objectives which led to the decision to initiate a new software development. That danger is multiplied several times over when the work extends in time, and headcount rises. Kit Grindley of the London School of Economics quotes a typical complaint in his book Managing IT at Board Level*: 'As a programming manager, you need to rewrite Parkinson's Law. Programming work expands to fill the capacity of the computer enhancement you were foolish enough to mention, this year's budget plus any of next year's you can bring forward, and the user's patience to bursting.' People and ideas change. The longer a software development is in gestation, the greater the chance that the original purpose for which the software was designed will have altered - or disappeared. The original champions of the project may have changed jobs, lost their enthusiasm or simply moved on to the next opportunity. These are some of the cultural - as opposed to practical - reasons why packaged software has increasingly replaced bespoke software in large as well as small organisations. The practical reasons are well understood. Packages sold in volume cost a fraction of a bespoke development. They can be installed in a fraction of the time needed for a bespoke system. And they bring a sense of discipline to many organisations in that the company's business processes have to be adapted to the package, rather than the other way about. All of this explains why consultants such as Mr Alan Braithwaite, a partner in Logistics Consulting Partners argues: 'The days of developing custom software have almost gone'. Yet as this issue of Software at Work illustrates, there is still a place for bespoke programming although at a much reduced level than hitherto, (see next page). Mr Braithwaite, whose company specialises in the management of materials - storage, handling and transportation - is chiefly concerned by the complexity of large projects, especially where a multinational company, that is, one with separate operations in a number of different countries, is attempting to become an international operation sharing business processes and systems across all its activities. One of the great barriers to integrating separate operations internationally, he points out, is the difficulty of matching dissimilar systems with separate ways of, for example, describing data or managing interfaces. The striking success of SAP, a German software house which has developed a highly integrated software package to support manufacturing, distribution and financial management, illustrates the point. It is used by a number of the world's largest companies including ICI, Esso, Mobil and British Rail in the UK. Of the 100 largest industrial corporations in West Germany, 70 are SAP users. ICI, in fact, has decided to standardise on SAP software worldwide. It has established global remits for the key components of information technology. These include data languages and codes, integrated applications for core business functions and computer hardware. SAP fits the requirement of ICI and other global players by providing a single data repository, consistent data definitions, one-time data input and real-time operation across all critical business functions. SAP represents, therefore, the best of breed in large integrated packages. Touche Ross, the management consultants, surveyed SAP users and found only 17 per cent of customers unhappy with the package while 67 per cent would choose SAP again. But the effort to implement SAP was substantial, Touche Ross found. Typical users devoted 21 man-months to the selection of the package and of the order of ten times as much to implementation. This was a consequence of the complexity of the package and the fact that most users were moving to SAP from a bespoke system. The greatest potential benefit from a bespoke system is that it should match the customer's requirements exactly, unlike a package which is always a square peg in a round hole (for the purposes of this argument, ignore personal computer packages. Personal computer users have traded low cost for the right to demand what they want from a package.) THE benefits of performing according to specification are of little value, however, if the system is delivered too late to take advantage of the market opportunity. There is a strong case, therefore, for installing a package and trimming it around the edges until it fits. Mr Braithwaite argues that because no single package will ever give the user exactly what he or she wants, it makes good sense to buy more than one and take the best bits from each, again using bespoke software techniques to provide the glue between the various elements. There are hidden advantages in this approach. A wholly integrated package, because of its complexity and comprehensive nature, may camouflage business processes ripe for rejuvenation. The essence of improving efficiency and therefore competitiveness is to overhaul the processes which determine the way the business operates. Without business process redesign, computerisation simply automates a legacy of inefficiency. Bespoke software work at the interfaces may show up inefficiencies inherent in traditional practices and point the way forward to better methods. *Managing IT at Board Level, Pitman, 1991.

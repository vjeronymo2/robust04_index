			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: The intelligent car hits the road - Crumbling highways and congestion have forced the US to re-think transportation The experience of driving down a US highway has not changed much over the last 40 years. The car models may be far more sophisticated, but motorists feel the same, often bumpy surface under their wheels and pass through toll booths which could easily serve as a backdrop to a film set in the 1950s. But new technologies are about to shake up the staid world of highway transportation in the US. In the pipeline are such innovations as stronger, more durable concrete surfaces and automatic sensors which collect tolls simply by debiting a motorist's bank account. After trailing behind Japan and Europe for years in the area of transportation technology, the US is finally catching up and, in some cases, moving to the cutting edge of highway innovations. The new attention being paid to transportation is triggered by necessity. Traffic problems are worsening, bridges and highways continue to crumble and the cost of repair is mounting. These factors are forcing the federal and state governments to take a hard look at longer-lasting infrastructure. If they succeed in extending the life of US highways, the savings could be tremendous. The National Research Council, a privately funded research group, estimates that improving the durability of the country's roads and bridges by just one percentage point would yield savings to the federal government of between Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) and Dollars 30bn over a 20-year period. One reason that new highway technologies have been slow to take hold is that spending on infrastructure is ultimately controlled by bureaucratic state and federal governments. However, the private sector, lured by government grants for research and the promise of a mass market for transportation products, is beginning to take on more responsibility. State-of-the-art technology, known as 'intelligent vehicle highway systems' (IVHS), is set to revolutionise the way Americans use their cars. This new technology would allow car computers to gather and give off information on everything from road conditions to the number of passengers in the vehicle. Private and public-sector groups have formed a Washington-based association, known as the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Society. Among the association's long-term goals are the installation of computerised sensors on all federal highways to limit the number of stops a vehicle is forced to make. These sensors would aim to eliminate toll booths by debiting users' bank accounts as they passed through invisible borders. The sensors would also be equipped to weigh trucks in motion and offer computerised cargo inspection. Once the system was in full operation, a truck could move across the country, petrol permitting, without making a single stop. The new sensors would be useful, not only on highways, but on urban streets as well. In Los Angeles, a new IVHS project plans to install sensors at 4,000 intersections. The sensors would aim to minimise 'wasted green time' - the period of time a traffic light stays green without any vehicle passing through. When the flow of cars slowed down, the sensors would tell the traffic light to turn red, giving other cars at the crossing a chance to move ahead. According to IVHS, over Dollars 200bn will be spent on these types of systems over the next 20 years. Some 80 per cent of that investment is set to come from the private sector and the remainder from federal and state governments. 'The US is the only country in the world with a 20-year plan for IVHS,' says Fred Tucker, head of the automotive division at Motorola. Private companies, hopeful that the US can take the lead in this area, have been moving ahead with IVHS tests, and related products, such as self-navigation systems, should be on the market later this year. In Orlando, Florida, General Motors and Avis, the car rental group, have just completed a market test for self-navigating vehicles. Drivers using the Avis cars were amused by voices that spit out directions, such as 'Turn right at the next set of lights,' and 'You are three miles from Disneyland.' General Motors specially produced 100 cars for the project, all equipped with 'talking' devices to give drivers directions and computer screens featuring maps of the area. Sensors on the cars let the computer know the exact location of the vehicle, enabling them to guide drivers. The experiment was so well-received that more comprehensive navigation tests are being organised in several regions of the country. In a project in the Chicago suburbs, about 5,000 vehicles will be equipped with computers which will not only give directions but will also try to keep drivers away from traffic jams. The Chicago experiment, sponsored in part by Motorola, will not rely on specially made vehicles but, instead, on the installation of systems similar to those the group eventually hopes to sell on the mass market. Motorola will collect information from the cars' computers about their movements and relay traffic reports to their drivers. 'We'll use the computers to tell drivers about road conditions, traffic congestion and other information,' said Joseph Ligar, who is heading the project. Even the most sophisticated navigation systems, though, will not help much if the US does not move quickly to improve the condition of its roads. A congressional report has warned that, in two years, 35 per cent of the country's interstate roads will have outlived their useful life. Rather than patch up the problems in piecemeal fashion, the government is investing in new technologies to improve the roads' durability. 'The price of concrete, cement and other building materials is very small compared with the overall cost of construction,' says Surendra Shah, a professor of engineering at Northwestern University and a leading researcher on innovative building materials. 'So it makes sense to use the best material available, even if it is a little more expensive.' Construction groups are working with a slew of new materials to expand the lifespan of roads and bridges. Some new concretes, by using fibre and chemical additives, are attaining strengths 10 to 25 times higher than every-day concrete. One of the problems with concrete is that it is porous and thus sus-ceptible to moisture-produced cracks. Many companies have begun to use microfine particles to fill in the holes and, thereby, to 'waterproof' roads. 'Micro-silica is extremely effective in eliminating the permeability of concrete,' says Kenneth Rear, technology manager at WR Grace, a big concrete maker. Concrete is also an extremely brittle material, highly suscept-ible to cracking. To improve bonding at an atomic level, some groups are experimenting with polymer additives such as carbon, steel, glass fibres and poly-propyline. These additives improve the flexibility of concrete, enabling construction companies to use thinner layers of the material in road construction. 'This new product is just as cheap as asphalt to use and far more durable,' says Leet Denton, president of Denton Construction in Detroit. There are many other innovations to improve the quality of concrete. One chemical group, Arco Chemical, is working on a chemical product which would pre-shrink concrete before it is laid down, reducing cracking later on. And Denton Construction has championed fast-drying concrete which, through the use of high-grade stone and insulation blankets, can support traffic within four hours of being laid down. Many of these products have come into use only recently in actual construction; others are still in the experimental phase. However, most transportation authorities predict an avalanche of new innovations over the next few years. If they are right, US highways could soon leap from 1950s' technology into the 21st century.</p>

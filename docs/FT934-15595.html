			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Report questions charities' automatic right to tax relief CHARITIES should lose their automatic right to tax relief, according to a Home Office sponsored report due to be published tomorrow which is spreading alarm through the voluntary sector. The report will conclude that charity is a medieval concept that has become meaningless now that many voluntary organisations provide welfare services under contract to public authorities. It will argue that charities must choose between becoming publicly funded agencies delivering services or free-standing campaigning organisations. Under the proposals, charities operating public contracts might receive tax refunds if they met annual performance targets, rather than guaranteed tax relief because of their charitable status. Although the report does not represent government policy, its research was directed by three former advisers to the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit. The Home Office, in addition to publishing the report, helped to finance it, and other funders include the Scottish Office and the Northern Ireland Office. The report is based on one of the most extensive research studies of Britain's voluntary sector since Beveridge's famous work on the welfare state in 1948. Voluntary sector leaders who have seen advance copies fear the report will immediately acquire semi-official status. Campaigns against its proposals are being planned even before publication. In recent years, charities have been encouraged by the government to take on a growing range of welfare services previously provided by the public sector. Some charity directors have been concerned that this could create ambiguity over the real purpose of charity. The report, by arguing in effect that charities must decide whether to become state-financed agencies, will help bring these issues to a head. An initiative to create greater cohesion between non-profit organisations will be launched at a forum for the social economy in London tomorrow. Sir Dennis Landau, chairman of Unity Trust Bank, who is responsible for the initiative, said: 'We are seeing the rise of credit unions, housing associations and trust hospitals; trade unions becoming service providers to their members; charities supplying services for local authorities. The common thread is the growth in service providers which fall outside the public and private sectors.' Charities face competition in social market, Page 6</p>

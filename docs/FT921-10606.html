			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Lauda Air may choose GE engines LAUDA AIR, the Austrian airline owned by Mr Niki Lauda, is expected to announce this week it has chosen US General Electric GE90 engines to power its new Boeing 777 widebody aircraft instead of the Rolls-Royce Trent and the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, Paul Betts writes. The deal is expected to be worth over Dollars 150m (Pounds 82m). Lauda Air is the second airline after British Airways to opt for the new GE90 heavy thrust engine for its new Boeing 777 fleet. The Austrian airline placed orders last year for four Boeing 777s, with delivery between 1997 and 2000. The three leading aero-engine makers are in fierce competition to win customers for their new heavy thrust engines to power the new Boeing 777s. The market for large engines is expected to account for an increasingly important share of the commercial engine business over the next 10 years as airlines expand their widebody fleets. With the Lauda Air order going to GE, the field has levelled out, with Rolls-Royce placing its Trent engine with two Boeing 777 customers (Thai International and Emirates), and Pratt &amp; Whitney winning Boeing 777 engine orders with United Airlines and All Nippon Airways.</p>

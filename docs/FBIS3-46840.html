Companies  employing ex-MPT officials received public work orders from the  MPT amounting to nearly 90 billion yen in fiscal 1992 alone. It  was also learned that members of the Yukenkai petitioned with  incumbent MPT bureaucrats to win bids, and they also helped in  compiling lists of supporters for Diet members who were formerly  from the MPT. This is another indication of the long  established collusion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and  businesses."    The Yukenkai is said to have been organized in the second  half of the 1950's, and its membership had remained a secret.  MAINICHI has been able to uncover membership details for the  first time after obtaining an internal document. Only  "individuals who have worked with the MPT, and who are presently  employed by construction firms" were qualified to join the  group, and membership had to be approved by a general meeting of  the association after an applicant personally expressed an  intention to join. The membership fee was 4,000 yen a year, and  the total number of members was over 100.    One ex-MPT official had even joined the Yukenkai while he  was  still an employee of a life insurance company, prior to his  eventual transfer to a construction firm two years later. There  is a rule that bureaucrats cannot join a company related to his  area of jurisdiction within two years after retirement.  Apparently, he was nominally affiliated to another company for  the duration.    Companies employing ex-MPT officials did not include the big  four general contractors (Kajima, Taisei, Shimizu, and  Obayashi-Gumi), but consisted of around 70 second-tier,  middle-ranking, and local construction companies, such as  Sumitomo Construction Company, Fujita Corporation, and Muramoto  Construction, which virtually went bankrupt in November 1993.    The chairman of Yukenkai was traditionally a former head of  the MPT's Building Department, who is the top technical official  in the ministry.    According to a list of orders placed by MPT or local post  offices for projects to construct or renovate post office  buildings and other government offices, companies employing  ex-MPT officials were given almost all the orders, except for  small-scale local projects. These projects cost around 70  billion yen each for fiscal 1991 and 1992.    Furthermore, nine out of the 10 companies participating in  the JV (joint venture) to build the Osaka Parcel Post Office, an  ongoing large-scale project extending over several fiscal years,  are construction firms employing ex-MPT officials. Adding the  appropriations for this Osaka project, the annual cost of orders  placed would be around 90 billion yen each for the two fiscal  years. Since the MPT's total annual budget for construction  projects is estimated to be just over 100 billion yen, employers  of Yukenkai members took up the lion's share.    A managing director of Kochi-Gumi, who used to be a Yukenkai  member, says, "as part of marketing operations, there were  instances where we would request incumbent MPT senior officials  to include our company in the bid winners," admitting the  existence of close links with incumbent bureaucrats.    A vice president of Tokyu Construction Company, also an  ex-Yukenkai member, reports that he was once directly asked by  an incumbent MPT senior official to make arrangements to acquire  land to locate a post office building, and land was subsequently  bought from a company affiliated with Tokyu, with Tokyu  pocketing the construction contract. This vice president also  testifies that "when I was Yukenkai chairman, we were asked by  Diet members who were formerly MPT officials to compile their  lists of supporters." This shows that ex-MPT officials were also  involved in elections.    As our investigation of the Yukenkai was in progress last  October, the group was suddenly disbanded. The only explanation  given by Choichiro Kurokawa, then chairman, was: "It was my  personal decision to disband the association."    On the other hand, Isao Ojima, head of the MPT Construction  Department, says, "Requests for inclusion in bids come from  former ministry officials as part of regular marketing  activities. However, I believe there has been no "dango" [bid  rigging] in the bidding process. Moreover, it is quite  impossible that the MPT would have asked its former officials to  arrange for land purchases."</p>

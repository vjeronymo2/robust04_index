			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Small cash shortage CASH rates in the sterling money markets ended softer yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a far smaller shortage than the market had expected. The Bank's forecast of a Pounds 500m shortage, later revised to Pounds 600m, was nearly half of what most dealers had anticipated. The news brought relief in a market where three days of expensive money had left the overnight offered rate on Wednesday at 25 per cent. There was less cheer from sterling's performance on the foreign exchange markets, however, with the pound sinking to a low of DM2.8587. Although it closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day, this was less than could have been expected given a dramatic rise yesterday by the dollar. The pound's dramatic drop by nearly two pfennigs in Wednesday's overnight trading in Asia forced cash rates to firm when London opened. Sterling futures were also sharply depressed. The September short sterling contract reached a low of 90.06 in the morning, underlining the market's view that a base rate cut is unlikely before the autumn. Confidence was then restored by the low shortage forecast from the Bank and comments from a UK Treasury minister that the pound would enter the narrow band of the European Monetary System 'in due course.' The September sterling contract eventually closed 1 tick down from its previous close at 90.12, while the December contract finished 3 ticks higher at 90.41. In the cash market, 1 month money ended unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent and 3-month money, a key indicator of where rates are moving, was  1/32 per cent softer at 10 1/32 per cent. 1 year money was  1/16 per cent softer at 9 29/32 per cent. The overnight closed at the far more relaxed level of around 9 3/4 per cent. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 500m of Band 1 bank bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent, and bought a further Pounds 100m of these in the afternoon. Dealers remain bearish about a base rate cut. A suggestion in a German newspaper yesterday that the Bundesbank may engineer another interest rate rise rattled the market. As one London money market dealer put it: 'I don't think such a rise is likely, but where would such a rumour have come from if there was no basis for it?'</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Aid of Dollars 500m pledged to protect ozone layer INDUSTRIALISED nations have pledged up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) on top of Dollars 240m already committed to help developing countries phase out chemicals which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere, writes Bronwen Maddox in Copenhagen. Ministers and officials at a three-day United Nations conference in Copenhagen, who are trying to tighten the terms of the 1987 Montreal protocol on ozone-depleting chemicals, have agreed to put between Dollars 340m and Dollars 500m into a fund for developing countries between 1994 and 1996. In return, developing countries look set to agree to phase out some chemicals by 2006, four years earlier than under the existing treaty. They are also likely to agree to controls on methyl bromide, a previously unregulated fumigant used in preserving fruit and grain. Countries including the UK and France have been criticised for not paying their full contribution to the fund.</p>

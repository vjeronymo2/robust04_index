			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Probably not a gambler Sir, Re the article 'Hand in hand' (Technology, September 6), I was surprised by Prabha Fernandes's interpretation of the probability theory applied to gambling, 'the more you play, the better the chances of getting a hit'. Any seasoned gambler will know that the odds of any random event occurring are not influenced by the history of that event. Either Mr Fernandes is a successful research executive or an unsuccessful gambler. Chris Adam, Glaxo Research and Development, Stockley Park West, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB11 1BT</p>

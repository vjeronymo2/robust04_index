			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (22): 'Sark lark' legislation - The island is a feudal fiefdom with a system of government and taxation still independent of the British mainland Sark may no longer take seriously its feudal obligation to provide 40 men with muskets to defend the English Crown, but the tiny island still feels the effects of its obligations to the British government. Sark - which is just a 40-minute ferry ride from Guernsey - remains a feudal fiefdom with a system of government and taxation still resolutely independent of the British mainland. Gone is the corvee or requirement of every male resident to offer labour each year for local public works. Gone too are the droits de seigneur, requiring islanders to seek permission to marry and to hand over every tenth sheaf of wheat grown on the island. Britain recently offered Sark the chance to buy out its lingering sixteenth century requirement to pay one twentieth of the cost of a knight's fee each year: currently Pounds 1.79. But Mr Michael Beaumont, 66, the Seigneur of Sark since the death in 1974 of Dame Sibyl Hathaway, his grandmother, has more important worries. He believes the feudal system continues to work well. He is more concerned about the ever-extending grasp of international bureaucracy. He raises his hand a foot above a table, indicating the volume of forms and documents which arrived in the latest despatch from Whitehall. 'It's frightening to see the paperwork coming through,' he says. 'I worry about the international agreements and regulations. They insist on such fine detail. It is putting a strain on our means.' Ten years ago, Sark dumped most of its litter into the sea. Now most must be sent to Guernsey for disposal. New EC requirements have called for no milk produced locally to be sold unless it is pasteurised. That would mean sending it by boat to be treated. 'We can no more afford that than to fly to the moon,' he says. 'It's absurd.' Such issues seem far removed from the impression of a traditional way of life on Sark, with its craggy cliffs, dusty roads and tractors. Cars are banned. Just 560 people live in often crumbling pre-fabricated buildings on an island of only two square miles. In fact, Sark has long maintained strong links with the outside world. Only about two-fifths of its residents were born on the island and there is a constant stream of new arrivals. Tourism is a mainstay of the economy. There is also another, infamous source of income, which until recently explained the vast number of faxes coming to the island, and the many executives in suits who crammed in with the tourists on the ferries, returning to Guernsey on the next boat. It was called the 'Sark lark'. By recruiting a number of Sark-resident directors, and holding formal board meetings on the island, companies were able to be Sark-based for tax - or offshore even from the Guernsey tax authorities. The Bailiwick has reduced that scope with a recent law which allows its own resident companies to be tax exempt. But some jurisdictions, such as the British Virgin Islands, still use Sark as an offshore centre. Many vestiges of the ancient feudal system do remain. The island is divided into 40 freehold lots of about 30 acres each which cannot be further subdivided. None can be sold without the permission of the seigneur, they can only be bought by British citizens, and the heir to the land has the right to repurchase it if it is sold to someone else. Leaseholders can live on the land, but they must be resident on the island for 15 years before they may build a house. Sark is entirely self-financing. It raised about Pounds 220,000 last year, a lot of which went on teachers' salaries and much of which was raised by excise duties and landing fees on visitors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich at </F> the Kirov plant in Minsk; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Unfortunately, the  termination of political opposition between East and West did  not make the world absolutely safe or stable. Differences and  contradictions are currently beginning to appear between large  and small states, those which have the potential for raw  materials and those who depend on shipments of the latter [words  indistinct]. In light of this, the nature of Belarusian  conditions for reforming the economy is quite specific; it  cannot be understood without taking into account the role of the  Belarusian economy in the single economic complex of the former  USSR. Under the conditions of a centrally administered planned  economy, huge enterprises were concentrated on Belarusian soil,  engaged in the processing of raw materials and semifinished  products, as well as the manufacturing of end products. Those  enterprises used to be linked with suppliers in all regions of  the USSR within the framework of a single national system.    Then the collapse occurred and brought about a dramatic  disruption in existing economic relations. As a result of this,  the Belarusian economy found itself overnight in dire straits.  Administrative levers have been, for the most part, lost, while  the structure of market motivation has not yet been created.  Unfortunately, economic reform, a need for which has matured in  our society, actually turned into a curse word for many people,  just as with the word perestroyka. Our numerous compatriots  cannot psychologically accept reform, because who needs reform  when it encroaches on the vital interests of the people? It is  a well-known fact that territorial-ethnic conflicts on the  territory of the former USSR, and not just conflicts but wars  too, were primarily caused by the dramatic plunge in people's  living standards. With regard to this, I would like to point  out that certain politicians in our country, driven by unknown  motives, are trying to transform economic reform into interstate  conflicts and prevent natural civilized rapprochement between  Belarus and Russia. As you know, ideological cliches -- which  are absolutely alien to Belarusians -- are being used to block  this process: Russia is depicted as an imperial state that is  heading in a different direction. I want to state this with  full responsibility: We have been carefully examining all new  trends in the theory and practice of contemporary interstate  economic relations. Yes, we, earlier than anybody else,  assessed the so-called economic theories of our local opponents,  who envision reorienting the Belarusian economy from the  traditional union with Russia along the East-West axis, toward  the allegedly new North-South axis, also called the Baltic-Black  Sea belt. I would put it this way: The obsoleteness of this  theory becomes evident given that as long ago as the turn of the  20th century the geopolitical senselessness of such views and  their economic and political deficiency were proven, as well as  the impossibility to implement this idea in light of the  existing balance of forces in the world arena. Our economy's  current problems and hardships were not caused by its internal  incongruities, but rather by dependence on external factors.  [passage omitted]    We were finally demonstrated who feeds whom. We once used to  holler that all the republics feed Russia. We were shown the  contrary quite fast. We were trying to (?discuss) the Orsha  defeat [reference to victory of Lithuanian-Belarusian troops  over Russia in the mid-16th century]; meanwhile, our gas and oil  supplies were cut off. It was not in 1500 or so that we lost or  won that battle; we lost the battle now, following the economic  sanctions that had been used against us. Let us not forget  this. [passage omitted]    Let us look at Europe, which has came close to creating the  European Union in the form of a single state structure built on  the basis of federalism. What do we see? We see the evident  striving by European states to secure free movement of people,  products, services, and capital. They have decided to adopt a  common monetary unit, introduce single European citizenship, and  (?form) the European Parliament. Thus, Europe, having lived  through two world wars, has chosen a new path of development --  one of economic and political integration. We are actually  dealing with the formation of a powerful integrated structure of  a single European state. Nobody says that the expansion of  supranational powers among the European structures will in some  way limit state sovereignty. I am quite positive that in the  near future we will also come to realize the prospects and  actual advantages of the integration of the newly independent  states, and find ways to achieve closer rapprochement.  Otherwise, we will not survive. We will collapse. That is why  I clearly state that as long as I am the head of the Belarusian  Government, the latter will not change the course of integration  with Russia, Ukraine, and other independent states. Yes, we  support the economic union and the single ruble zone. The  creation of supranational structures similar to the European  Parliament may become a natural continuation of this process.  At the same time, dear colleagues, I am not speaking about  surrendering our Republic's sovereignty and independence.  Simplicity and primitivism of such views on state construction,  as represented by People's Deputy Lukashenka, are alien to me.  The wheel of history can only roll forward and cannot be  reversed. I will never, nor under any circumstances agree to  surrender sovereignty and give up the state independence of  Belarus. Never.    I am sure, however, that the union will be revived in a new  form and Belarus will enter it as an independent, sovereign  state. Speaking of preserving our sovereignty -- for there is  much criticism on this issue -- I want to point out that it is  easy and simple to declare sovereignty. State sovereignty,  however, must be protected. Without protection there can be no  sovereignty. I am more than positive that if today we are left  without Russia, no matter who is at the helm, we will be thrown  10 to 15 years back into the past, or even face economic  collapse. Believe me, we calculated these things both on  computers and by other means -- various options. Go to Europe?  Who is admitted into Europe? Great Russia is not admitted into  Europe! There are just promises and nothing but promises. All  markets were divided long ago. Both oil and gas used in Europe  come from Russia, and not from any other state. Shall we go to  the West to buy Russian oil from middlemen at a higher price?  No! We would rather look to the East. All products and raw  materials will be supplied to Belarus duty-free. This will lower  prices by 35 to 40 percent, lower productions costs, and retail  prices, which swelled solely due to customs duties and not due  to our inability to work. [passage omitted]    Russia's economy is sick, but it is not dead and buried.  Many times in its history Russia has surprised the world with  the power of its spirit, with its might, and always risen up  from the ashes. This time, these processes are also beginning in  Russia. We are facing difficulties, but let us not dash aside;  history, future generations, our conscience, and dignity would  never forgive us this. [passage omitted]    The Constitution adopted in March by our legislature  preserved the vertical system of soviets. History has proven  that this system corresponds to the national and political  traditions of our people better than other variants. The  history of the last two years has taught us what may come of  neglecting those traditions. Workers and farmers have  practically been pushed out of the soviets. Their voices cannot  be heard there. They were replaced by photographers,  archaeologists [reference to Popular Front Chairman Zyanon  Paznyak], and Leopold cats with doctorate degrees [reference to  former Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich, who, like the  cartoon character, often appealed for accord]. Whose interests  these people represent, I do not have to explain to you.  [passage omitted]    Why do Paznyak and Shushkevich so furiously attack our union  with Russia, accusing me of everything short of national  treason? Despite their mediocre organizing skills and total lack  of economic and technological experience, they understand all  too well that there will be no place for them on the political  field of the Belarusian-Russian union. However the provincial  [word indistinct] of one of them and the taste for cushy  executive jobs of the other, urge them to engage in adventurist  irrational activities. That is not a big deal. We, the people  who grew up in plants and factories, have strong nerves. We  will withstand both ridiculous political aspirations and  primitive slanders. [passage omitted]</p>

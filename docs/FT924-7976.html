			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: Chief secretary who stays dry in a downpour - Michael Portillo has won plaudits in this year's public spending negotiations There are not many ministers who can cheerfully write themselves out of a job and be confident of a sparkling future. But then Mr Michael Portillo is among that rare group of politicians who manage effortlessly to set themselves apart from their peers. At 39, the chief secretary to the Treasury is the youngest and the most junior member of the cabinet. He is one of its most assured performers, smart enough to know that even if Mr John Major's luckless government does hit the rocks, he will find a privileged place in the lifeboat. If the Autumn Statement does not live up to its claims, Mr Norman Lamont will bear the opprobrium. The beleaguered chancellor is still living on borrowed time. If the package does allow the government to regain a grip on the nation's finances, Mr Portillo, deservedly, will derive much of the credit. Perhaps he foresaw such a situation earlier in the summer when he enthusiastically backed the complete restructuring of the annual public spending negotiations. Some say it was Mr Portillo who dreamed up the new system. Mr Lamont insists it was his idea. Either way the effect has been to reduce significantly the role of the chief secretary in deciding who gets what in the Whitehall share-out of the public spending cake. Instead, much of his role as holder of the Treasury purse-strings has been taken over by something with the appropriately sinister name of EDX, the new cabinet committee established to consider the competing departmental claims. Mr Portillo was the committee's representative not its master. Ultimately, the important decisions - on the council tax, on public sector pay, on social security benefits - were hammered out in several exhausting sessions of the full cabinet. But if the new system changed his role from that of a principal to that of an agent, Mr Portillo can claim justly that the system delivered the objective he started out with when he took the job after the April general election. After several years during which the government in practice abandoned its commitment to tight controls on public spending, Mr Portillo's starting point was that it had to begin again to face up to tough decisions. In contrast with many of his colleagues, the chief secretary believes in the practice as well as the theory of cutting back the role of the state and the amount of money it demands of its citizens. An intellectual Thatcherite in the Nigel Lawson mould (he worked for the former chancellor before entering parliament in a 1984 by-election), Mr Portillo pays more than lip-service to the economic ideals and achievements of the early 1980s. He judged in the summer that a return to relative austerity would not be easy. Cabinet colleagues had become accustomed to winning more cash each year to expand their Whitehall empires. The recession was, and still is, wreaking havoc with public finances by forcing up demand-led expenditure. He concluded that the cabinet would agree to break with tradition and stick to previously agreed spending targets only if ministers were given a collective voice in setting priorities. He was right. Though the numbers are slightly different he can claim that the government has broadly met the remit he set back in July. The other key element in this year's reforms of the system - a switch to a new control total for spending which excludes those programmes most vulnerable to the economic cycle - has set the government's medium-term objectives in a more rational perspective. It must not be assumed that the government will stick to those objectives. The reintroduction yesterday of a 1970s-style pay policy underlined that U-turns come cheap after the turmoil of the past few months. But Mr Portillo can claim that the settlement he has mapped out  - much tighter in the second and third years than in the first and with the cuts biting deeply on areas such as defence - has at least provided a coherent framework. In the process the chief secretary has won himself plenty of plaudits. His confident, sometimes stubborn, negotiating style has impressed cabinet colleagues. His diligence and grasp of detail has prompted one senior Treasury official to remark that he is the sharpest minister he has worked with since Mr Lawson. Mr Portillo's illiberal instincts are not to everyone's taste. He is in favour of hanging, and an apparent believer that many of the poor and disadvantaged have no-one to blame but themselves. He has blind spots; he believed that the poll tax represented a rational approach to local authority finance. His approach to Europe - he is publicly loyal about the Maastricht treaty but privately hates it - comes strangely from one born of a Spanish father. But if the chief secretary is the standard-bearer of the Tory right, he is also a politician looking to the future. He is ready to smooth if not smother his ideology with the politics of realism. He wants to be prime minister. In five or perhaps 10 years time he may well achieve his ambition.</p>

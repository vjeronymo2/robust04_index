Deputies attending the  Second Session of the Eighth NPC reported that a sharp rise in  the prices of chemical fertilizers, diesel fuels, and other  means of production, as well as a slow increase in grain  procurement prices in recent years, have caused the gap between  the prices of industrial and agricultural products to widen  progressively.    Deputy Ge Lanmei, a peasant from Jiyang Town in Fujian  Province's Jianou City, cited her home town as an example: The  price of quality chemical fertilizer supplied by the  agricultural materials department according to grain output  suddenly surged to 1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 538 yuan  in 1992, registering a sharp rise of 142 percent; while that of  quality chemical fertilizer for centralized distribution rose to  1,300 yuan a metric ton in 1993 from 775 yuan in 1992, up as  much as 68 percent.    Figures provided by the state statistics departments also  can  illustrate a host of facts: Chinese peasants' per capita net  income for 1993 was 921.4 yuan, an increase of 3.2 percent in  real terms from the previous year. This growth rate represented  a 2.7 percentage point decline from the previous year and was  lower than that of agriculture and the rural economy.    Although their grain harvests piled up like small hills, the  peasants' wallets did not expand simultaneously. The production  enthusiasm of quite a number of peasants was thus dampened. A  deputy from Liaoning Province said: Last year more than 500  farming households at the province's Changtu County gave up a  total of 110,000 mu of farmland they had contracted. A Zhejiang  deputy put it in an even more acute way: In the past, the  peasants were trying by hook or by crook to get more farmland,  but now they are asking again and again to return the land  instead. If things go on like this, who is going to farm in the  future? With what are we going to fill up our rice sacks and  vegetable baskets?    How should we solve the problem of slow growth in peasants'  income? Deputy He Zhukang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial  Party Committee, believes that the key to increasing peasants'  income lies in further improving the overall efficiency of  agriculture, in addition to rendering supportive policies and  state protection. Deputy Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the  Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, said: At present we should  concentrate our efforts on solving four problems: First, we  should strictly control the margin of increase in the prices of  capital goods. Second, we should stabilize and develop grain  and cotton production and develop a diversified rural economy.  Third, we should coordinate well the relationship between input  and output and implement as quickly as possible the central  policy of emphatically aiding 500 major counties for commodity  grain and 150 major counties for quality cotton. At the same  time, we must increase input into agriculture, especially in the  central and western regions where we should give some policy  preferences. Fourth, handle well the relationship between the  primary industry and the secondary and tertiary industries,  consolidate and develop village and town enterprises, and  vigorously develop the tertiary industry.</p>

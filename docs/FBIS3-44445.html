			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- Since China's nuclear  industry embarked upon its second pioneering undertaking of  "converting military installations to civilian production" at  the beginning of the eighties, it has given equal emphasis to  research and development. China not only has leaped to a new  height in scientific research in the nuclear field and in the  peaceful use of nuclear technology, but at the same time it has  also achieved a new glorious round on the major front of the  national economy.    At a news conference held today by the China National  Nuclear  Corporation, its President Jiang Xinxiong summarized the  achievements the nuclear industry made in 1993 as follows: The  nuclear power industry has developed steadily; new progress has  been made in the nuclear fuel industry and in related scientific  research; civilian production has achieved relatively large  growth; the nuclear industry has further developed domestic and  foreign markets; and scientific research has yielded a number of  significant achievements.    Nuclear power construction, being the main focus and  strategic objective of the second pioneering undertaking, has  achieved major progress since the beginning of the nineties.  Since it started to generate power after hooking up with the  power grid two years ago, the Qinshan Nuclear Plant, the first  nuclear plant designed and built by China itself, has  successfully increased its generating power in stages to full  capacity, and fulfilled all its trial assignments. Currently,  it is in a stage of safe, reliable, and high-power trial  operations, which signifies that China's nuclear technology has  entered a mature stage of development. The Daya Bay Nuclear  Plant is one of the largest Sino-foreign joint ventures since  the implementation of reform and open policy. The No. 1  generating unit, which successfully generated power after  hooking up with the power grid in August this year, and  fulfilled full-capacity operations in November, is expected to  go into commercial production in February next year. The No. 2  generating unit will also be completed and put into operation in  June 1994. It has been learned that when the two generating  units are wholly put into commercial production, their annual  generating capacity can reach 10 to 12.6 billion kw-hours. The  designing of the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant is in  full swing, and gratifying progress has been made in site  preparation work, with the recent opening of nearly 1,000 meters  of tunnels. This shows that nuclear power has become an option  for clearing the energy "bottleneck" in China, especially in the  southeast coastal provinces and regions.    The achievements in nuclear scientific research have been  remarkable. Over the last 10 years, the nuclear industrial  established has won state-class science and technology prizes  for 330 projects. Research and designing work on the 300,000-kw  Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, research into controlled nuclear  fusion for China's No. 1 convector, the construction of a tandem  accelerator laboratory, ground heap leaching technology in  mineral and metallurgical fields, and the technology of  separating uranium isotopes through centrifugal means have all  yielded a number of significant scientific and technological  achievements. It is learned that the key scientific research  project for constructing a 600,000-kw nuclear plant is making  good progress. Research into the disposal of radioactive wastes  generated by nuclear installations has yielded results in  various stages. What is even more eye- catching is that new  breakthroughs have been made in enriched uranium production  technology and equipment. The production line for producing  components for a 900,000-kw pressurized water reactor imported  by the 812 Plant from France has already been completed and has  been appraised and examined by the French side. It will acquire  production capacity next year and provide replacement fuel for  the first furnace in the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant.    Our country has also actively developed and utilized  nuclear and related technologies to serve national economic  construction. At present, our country has developed a number of  pillar-type nonmilitary industries by using those technologies,  including chemical fertilizers, titanium dioxide, metal  magnesium, and fire alarms. The output value of items for  nonmilitary use now accounts for more than 70 percent of the  total output value of the nuclear industry. The application of  radioactive isotopes in agriculture, industry, and medicine has  created "nuclear agriculture," "nuclear medicine," and other  specialized sciences. The radiation processing industry is  developing in our country with an annual output value of more  than 400 million yuan. All these have shown that nuclear  technology has unnoticeably entered our daily lives.    Meanwhile, our country has also actively strengthened  economic and foreign trade work in the field of nuclear  technology. Our country has exported nuclear products, nuclear  technology, and nuclear engineering for peaceful use. We have  exported nuclear power stations and nuclear reactors for  research purposes to Pakistan, Iran, Algeria, and other  countries [deng guo jia 4583 0948 1367], and China's  nuclear-electric technology is now entering the international  market.</p>

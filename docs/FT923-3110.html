			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Quest for plugs to fill City's leaky sieve: A law on UK insider dealing is soon to be introduced. Richard Waters and Robert Peston ask whether it will catch all offenders Sometimes it seems as though the City leaks price-sensitive information like a sieve. Two marketmakers overhear a conversation on their banks' trading floor that Grand Metropolitan, a leisure group, is about to make a bid. A secretary at the Office of Fair Trading learns of several bids about to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A young banker hears from a colleague that there is about to be a bid for Pleasurama, a leisure group. These are all cases that have led to insider dealing prosecutions in the past two years. In each, the defendants were acquitted of trying to profit from their inside knowledge. The British government is about to try again to plug the holes in the sieve. An EC directive will make insider dealing a criminal act in all Community countries for the first time. This has prompted Mr Anthony Nelson, the treasury minister who recently took over responsibility for City regulation, to introduce into parliament in October new insider dealing legislation as part of the Criminal Justice Act. The thrust of the Treasury's changes is to broaden the scope of what constitutes insider dealing. At present, it applies only to trading a particular company's securities on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information about that company. The information also has to come from someone closely connected to the company (a 'primary insider'). The scope will be widened in several important ways. First, the law will apply not only to company securities. Trading in the gilt market on the basis of confidential market-moving news would also be caught. Such trading is alleged to have happened 10 days ago, shortly before the British government announced extensive moves to shore up sterling. However, the law will still not cover the foreign exchange markets, or dealings that are made outside what it calls a 'regulated market'. Second, all information that affects a company's share price will be covered, not just information about the company itself. So information about a company's competitor or information about an industry could be inside information. In addition, the need for a 'primary insider' will disappear. That should make it easier to prosecute City advisers who learn of price-sensitive news through others they work with, rather than directly from a company. Finally, the new law makes it illegal for the possessor of inside information to encourage someone else to deal in shares, even if that person is not told the inside information. This proposed widening of the act has caused consternation in the City. At the end of July the government took the unusual step for primary legislation of circulating a draft of the new law to interested organisations, including the British Merchant Banking Association, the Securities and Futures Association and the Stock Exchange. Nonetheless, regulators, market authorities and brokers are *something in here (HP) * worried that far-reaching changes are being rushed into law without a full assessment of their impact. The City is concerned that the law will interfere with its proper function of helping to get important information out to investors and the public at large. If, as planned, the act catches any information that may affect a company's prospects that has not already been 'made public' (another broad phrase in the proposed law), brokers' analysts could find themselves treading a minefield. The BMBA has been concerned that the law might define as inside information even those conclusions drawn from publicly available information. However, the Treasury has taken great pains to ensure that analysts' research based on such information will not be caught by the act. On the other hand, almost all conversations with companies will probably put the analyst in possession of inside information, because the definition of inside information has been broadened so much. In reality, the law may not have such a big effect on analysts. Their relations with companies are already governed by the existing legislation. If companies seek to influence their share prices through a series of nods and winks to analysts, then in theory that is already covered by the act - although no prosecutions have been attempted. Analysts may actually find themselves less open to prosecution in some cases. As required by EC legislation, the new UK law will apply only to information that is 'precise'. So if a finance director nudges an analyst to alter his or her conclusions about a company's trading prospects, without actually giving out hard information, it would be more difficult to mount a prosecution. However, the Treasury does not believe that analysts will escape lightly. It says that the word 'precise' refers to information with a direct provable relationship to share price movements, such as guidance on a company's profits, as opposed to 'general' information, such as inflation or trade figures which have a less easily demonstrable effect on share prices. In general, the proposed changes may bring more deals into the scope of insider dealing. However, they may give the authorities only marginal help in achieving a higher success rate in their prosecutions. In 28 insider dealing trials over the past 11 years, almost half the defendants have been acquitted. Of those who have been convicted, more than half pleaded guilty - including Mr Geoffrey Collier, the Morgan Grenfell director convicted in 1987 and the biggest City figure caught by investigators. The need to prove 'intention' in insider cases is a great problem. Cases have often collapsed because of the difficulty of proving beyond any reasonable doubt that someone dealt in securities precisely because he or she was in possession of inside information. In other words, proving that someone has been 'knowingly' dealing as an insider has been difficult. However the new law should help prosecutions in that it puts the onus on the defence to prove that any dealing was not prompted by inside information - rather than on the prosecution to prove that it was, as at present. The weakness of the prosecution record has in recent years prompted calls both from the City, in the shape of the Securities and Futures Authority and the London Stock Exchange, and Westminster (the trade and industry select committee) for an overhaul of the way insider dealing is investigated and prosecuted. There have been suggestions that investigators should be given greater powers, that a new body should be created to centralise the fragmented investigatory system, and that additional civil sanctions should be introduced for cases where a criminal prosecution seems unlikely to succeed. By rushing through the changes this autumn, the Treasury may have pre-empted discussion. A chance to plug more holes in the sieve may have been missed.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARM AFI TRIBUTE TO DAVID LEAN;  </P> <P> MOVIES: CREATOR OF 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA' AND 'DR. ZHIVAGO' MIXES HUMOR WITH  CRITICISM OF COMMERCIALISM.  </P> <P> Lectures, like loin of lamb, are best served warm, and those people at the  American Film Institute's tribute to David Lean at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on  Thursday night got both.  </P> <P> The 81-year-old Lean, whose wide-screen masterpieces include "Lawrence of  Arabia," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Doctor Zhivago," mixed wry British  humor with the stern tone of a schoolmaster in lecturing his high-powered and  captive Hollywood audience for its cautious, commercially homogenized films.  </P> <P> Lean, asking to be forgiven his presumption, said that he got the green light  for his long-planned adaptation of Joseph Conrad's "Nostromo" just two hours  before arriving at the hotel, and it was high time, indeed.  </P> <P> "After months and months of talk," he said, "(it's) sort of asinine (to get the  go-ahead for a film) only two hours before receiving this great honor."  </P> <P> Lean -- taking the podium after a parade of tributes from old friends and such  contemporary film makers as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Lawrence  Kasdan -- tempered his scorn for the greed that he says governs Hollywood with  his own passion for the medium. "I speak from the heart and because I love  movies," he said, before delivering his apparently off-the-cuff lecture.  </P> <P> Lean quoted Noel Coward, with whom he made his directorial debut in the 1942  wartime drama, "In Which We Serve," as telling him to "always come out of  another hole," to be surprising and daring. "We don't come out of any more new  holes," Lean said. "We come out with Parts One, Two, Three and Four, and I  think it's terribly sad."  </P> <P> Lean said a staple diet of repeated themes "will sink us" and urged the studios  to take risks, especially with young talent.  </P> <P> "I don't mind for old birds like me -- we can take it -- but we have to protect  our young. Please, you chaps in the money department, look out for the young  ones. . . . This business lives on creative pathfinders."  </P> <P> Coming from Lean, especially in the wake of clips from such films as "Kwai,"  "Lawrence," "Brief Encounter," "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist," the  blunt criticism of current film making was taken enthusiastically. Lean had  made similar comments during a tribute at Cannes last year and left that  audience aghast.  </P> <P> Thursday night's industry crowd was treated to one of the briskest and most  seriously reverent tributes in the award's 18-year history. John Mills, whose  David Lean films included "Ryan's Daughter" and "Great Expectations," flew 22  hours "with no pay at the end of it" to honor Lean in person. Also on hand was  composer Maurice Jarre ("Dr. Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia"), who spoke of  Lean's lessons in "humility, tenacity and perfectionism."  </P> <P> One of the evening's highlights was the appearance -- live via satellite from  London, where it was 4 a.m. -- of Omar Sharif, who portrayed Zhivago, and Peter  O'Toole, who co-starred with Sharif in "Lawrence of Arabia."  </P> <P> Steven Spielberg told Lean and the audience that "Bridge on the River Kwai" and  "Lawrence of Arabia" were the two films "that most made me want to be a film  maker." Lawrence Kasdan told of how he and his brother had arrived seven  minutes late for a showing of "Lawrence" and decided to wait six hours for it  to begin again rather than go in late because "every moment" of a David Lean  movie mattered. Martin Scorsese spoke of Lean's "landscapes of the spirit --  there's no such thing as an empty landscape in a David Lean film."  </P></p>

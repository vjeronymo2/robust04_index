			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Grudging Vatican backs global agenda The vast majority of the world's governments yesterday ended nine gruelling days' negotiations by endorsing a far-reaching global programme to stabilise population growth into the next century which places enhanced womens' rights at its heart. The Vatican and a core of hardline Roman Catholic states said they could not embrace critical parts of the International Conference on Population and Development's 113-page final document bearing on abortion and other issues anathema to Roman Catholicism. Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Malta and the Dominican Republic joined the Holy See in its reservations. In a statement to the closing plenary, Archbishop Renato Martino, head of the Vatican delegation, said the Holy See wished 'in some way to join the consensus even if in an incomplete or partial manner,' but could not endorse substantial parts of the text, particularly those governing abortion and those 'seen as accepting extra-marital sexual activities'. 'Nothing the Holy See has done in this consensus process should be interpreted as an endorsement of concepts it cannot support for moral reasons. Especially nothing is to be understood to imply that the Holy See endorses abortion or has in any way changed its moral position concerning abortion, or on contraceptives, or sterilisation or the use of condoms in HIV AIDS prevention programmes.' Several Moslem countries, including Iran, Libya, Algeria, Syria and Afghanistan, stated reservations to parts of the final text, especially references to 'reproductive health' services for 'individuals', holding such language to endorse adolescent and extra-marital sex. The document was greeted by womens' rights activists as a big advance on the 1974 and 1984 UN population conferences. 'I think we won a victory here,' said Mrs Francis Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, a US lobby group.</p>

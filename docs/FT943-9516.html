			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Scholes open to new bid despite Hanson's Pounds 96m offer Scholes Group, the UK electrical equipment maker which last month agreed to a Pounds 96.1m takeover bid from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday took the unusual step of saying it was open to higher offers. Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said: 'Clearly I want the best possible deal for shareholders and if there are any other potential bidders out there it is obviously in their interests for all the information to be presented.' He denied he was directly soliciting a higher offer, but said the board had recommended the Hanson bid only so it could present its own case to shareholders, particularly regarding its relationship with ABB, the Swedish-Swiss electrical giant, from which it licenses key technology. Scholes revealed that ABB had warned that it would end the agreements if Hanson's offer were not successful. ABB supports the Hanson bid and has given an irrevocable undertaking to accept the offer in respect of its 4.3 per cent stake. Originally Scholes wanted to buy Hanson's Crabtree business. But Mr Riches said Scholes could not accept the conditions ABB had placed on its support for a rights issue. After ABB's warning, Scholes started discussions with Felten &amp; Guilleaume, a German electricals group, to replace ABB's technology. Mr Riches said he was confident that Scholes could reach an agreement if the Hanson offer were not concluded. This 'would be in the best interests of Scholes'. Although the Scholes board judged the offer 'fair', he said it had only recommended the bid because a hostile offer document would have given 'an unfair view of the company's situation'. Scholes yesterday reported a 63 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7m for the year to June 30. Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 66m with UK volumes slightly down. It said in the absence of the Hanson offer, it would have recommended a 25 per cent increase in dividends reflecting 'confidence in Scholes' prospects for the future'. Hanson's offer of 250p a share in cash represents 20 times earnings, which rose 60 per cent to 12.3p. Lex, Page 14 News digest, Page 17</p>

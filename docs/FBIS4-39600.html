			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin is  satisfied that the lower house of the Federal Assembly approved  the federal budget for 1994 in the second reading. However, he  is very critical about the attempt of the Federation Council to  considerably increase defense spending.    In an exclusive interview with Interfax on Wednesday evening  Rybkin said the swift approval of the budget by the Duma was no  surprise for him. "I believed that the Duma would have the will,  reason and endurance to do that", the speaker said. For the  first time in three or four years the parliament tried to pull  together the scattered financial resources of the country.    The speaker said that certain figures in the Federation  Council did not want this to happen and they might attempt to  tear up the budget. If anyone in the Council of the Federation  tries to destroy the budget, Rybkin said, he is ready to tell  the public who they used to be and why they have been  undermining the budget for four years.    Last week the Federation Council spoke in favor of  considerably increasing spending, in particular earmarking 55  trillion rubles instead of 37.1 for defense.    On Wednesday the Duma approved in the second reading the  federal budget without making any changes to the revenue,  spending or deficit.    The Duma accepted the proposal of its budget committee to  increase defense spending from 37.1 to 40.6 trillion rubles  through a redistribution of resources in the budget.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- The Council of Ministers  today approved draft agreements on settlement of Bulgaria's  commercial foreign debt and authorized Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov to sign them. At the Boyana Residence on June 29,  Mr. Aleksandrov will sign an agreement on exchange, an agreement  on fiscal agency for front-loaded interest reduction bonds, an  agreement on fiscal agency for collateralized discount bonds, an  agreement on fiscal agency for past due interest rate bonds, and  an agreement on collateral security. The documents will also be  signed by officials of the closing agent, Deutsche Bank, and of  the fiscal agent, Citibank.    The London Club banks will also sign the agreement within  one  month, after which it has to be ratified by the National  Assembly, Mr. Aleksandrov told reporters. The document on  finalization of the deal should be signed after the  ratification, and then payments will start.    The agreement on exchange is the key one because it  regulates  an exchange of the creditor banks' receivables within the  balance of debt of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank for  government securities or discount options, said Deputy Finance  Minister Dimitur Kostov. By this agreement the state takes over  the obligations arising from the issue and servicing of the  respective types of bonds. The agreement is made between  Bulgaria and Deutsche Bank in its capacity as closing agent on  behalf of the creditors. After this agreement is signed, a  document-signing procedure will start with each commercial  creditor bank which has declared that it will take part in the  deal.    The agreements on fiscal agency for the different types of  bonds define the bonds and Bulgaria's interrelations with the  fiscal agent Citibank in connection with the servicing of the  issues.    The agreement on collateral security defines the relations  between Bulgaria and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in  connection with the institution and maintenance of the required  security for the different types of bonds.    Bulgaria owes its London Club creditors some 8,000 million  U.S. dollars, Mr. Kostov recalled. In addition, this country  has a 2,000-2,500 million U.S. dollars outstanding debt to the  Paris Club governments and a 1,500 million U.S. dollars debt to  the international financial institutions.    Stoyan Aleksandrov said he had asked central bank officials  to consider a strategy and take the necessary measures to  prevent tensions on the currency market in connection with the  finalization of the deal.</p>

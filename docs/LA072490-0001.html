			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOUTER CONCURRED IN RULING ON LISTING ABORTION AS AN OPTION  </P> <P> David H. Souter, who is expected to face questions about his views on the  abortion issue now that he has been nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court, has  participated in one major abortion ruling.  </P> <P> The matter came before the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1986, when Souter  served on that state's highest court.  </P> <P> In that case, Souter ruled with the majority that doctors have a responsibility  to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of abortion.  </P> <P> "We recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves controversial and  divisive social issues," the opinion said. "Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of  the United States has held that a woman has a constitutionally secured right to  terminate a pregnancy."  </P> <P> In a concurring opinion, Souter wondered what impact the ruling might have on  doctors who oppose abortion but who are bound to advise patients of it as an  alternative. The court did not rule on that issue. He suggested that such  doctors could tell patients of their religious or moral scruples and refer them  to other doctors in time for such testing.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> A case of mistaken identities led Escondido youths into a gang fight late  Friday night that injured five and caused police to arrest two men, Escondido  Police said Saturday.  </P> <P> Shortly before midnight, a group of youths began fighting in the parking lot of  the Chuck E Cheese Restaurant in the 600 block of West Mission Avenue in  Escondido, said Lt. John Wilson.  </P> <P> Zachary Hollis left, saying that he was going for help. Hollis, an 18-year-old  Compton resident, returned with a gun but misidentified the group of youths  with whom he had been fighting.  </P> <P> A second fight erupted in the parking lot of K Mart, near the restaurant. About  24 people fought with tire irons, baseball bats, broken beer bottles, a knife  and a pistol, Wilson said.  </P> <P> Police arrested two men in connection with the brawl. Louis Arbee, a  33-year-old Escondido resident who lives in the 400 block of North Midway, was  charged with assault with a deadly weapon, Wilson said. Police also arrested  Hector Salgado, a 20-year-old Vista resident who lives in the 1200 block of  Monique Court, on charges associated with a New York state warrant.  </P> <P> Five people were injured and taken to Palomar Medical Center. The injured  included: Hollis, who suffered stab wounds in the back; Brenda Hollis, 37, of  Econdido, who had leg scrapes; Gregory Borders, 17, of Escondido, who had  facial scrapes; David Gomez, 23, of Escondido, who had a gunshot wound in his  side; and Gerardo Romero, 18, who had a gunshot wound in his arm.  </P> <P> Police did not disclose whether Brenda Hollis and Zachary Hollis are related.  Reached by the Times, Brenda Hollis declined to answer any questions about  Zachary Hollis or the Friday night fracas.  </P> <P> Police are asking anyone with information about the episode to call 741-4713.  </P></p>

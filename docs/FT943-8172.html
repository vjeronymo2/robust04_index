			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Telefonica arranges Latin American swap Spain's Telefonica group is set to reinforce its position in Argentina in exchange for relinquishing one of its shareholding interests in Chile. Telefonica Internacional, its foreign investment arm, said it had reached agreement on the swap with Chemical Venture Partners, a unit of Chemical Banking of the US. Under the deal, worth more than Dollars 200m, Chemical Venture Partners is to take over the Spanish company's 20 per cent stake in Chile's Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (Entel-Chile) in exchange for a 4.33 per cent stake in Cointel of Argentina and Dollars 46m in cash. The deal is still subject to approval by the Chilean central bank and the US Federal Reserve. The reshuffle of interests in Telefonica's growing Latin American empire was forced by anti-trust court decisions in Chile, which ruled that the Spanish company could not hold stakes in both of the country's main telecommunications concerns and must therefore shed either the 20 per cent stake in Entel or its holding of almost 44 per cent in Compania de Telefonos de Chile. The deal will increase to 33 per cent Telefonica's stake in the Cointel consortium, which controls 60 per cent of the operator Telefonica Argentina. The state-controlled Spanish group, which has been discussing a link with GTE as a shareholder in its international arm, also has interests in Venezuela, Peru and Puerto Rico. It has been studying further opportunities in Nicaragua. Bolivia and Ecuador. Nestle, the food and drinks group, has reached an agreement with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish conglomerate, for the purchase of BBV's ice cream and frozen foods units, AFX reports from Madrid. No terms were disclosed. The Swiss group said BBV's food subsidiary Sociedad Anonima de Alimentacion would sell its shares in the companies operating under Miko, Avidesa and Castillo de Marcilla trademarks.</p>

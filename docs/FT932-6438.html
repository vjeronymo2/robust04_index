			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: From submarines to samovars - Russian military contractors are diversifying to attract western business Life at the St Petersburg Marine Engineering Bureau is hard these days. Twenty years ago the nuclear submarine builder was a power house of Soviet military-economic development. Today it is touting for business in the west, offering to build anything from underwater tourist vehicles to luxury yachts. The conversion from military submarine maker to civilian ship builder has not been easy, complains Vladimir Barantsev, chief designer at the Bureau. But change the Bureau must. Barantsev misses the funding and government assistance which the Bureau used to enjoy. All new customers have to be found by the organisation itself, he says. The biggest problem is lack of funds. At the Bureau's stand at the Conversion '93 exhibition in Birmingham this week, the first significant exhibition of Russian military technology in western Europe, Barantsev's dilemma is clear. The centre piece is a scale model of a 30,000 tonne underwater supertanker, which would cost Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) to build; a bargain by US or western European standards. Barantsev simply does not have the cash. 'The customer is ready to buy the finished product but he is afraid to pay for the production,' he says. 'We haven't got enough money for the construction.' Barantsev has had some success diversifying into non-military craft. Until 1987, only 10 per cent of the Bureau's turnover came from civilian projects, mainly in the Soviet oil, gas and fishing industries. Now that figure is up to 35 per cent, but the customers are still in the same sectors and almost entirely within Russia. The submersible tanker plan also relies largely on the proposed exploitation of oil and gas fields off Russia's Arctic coast, where extreme conditions would crack pipelines and ice prevents year-round exploitation by surface tankers. Barantsev hopes some large private-sector company in Europe or the US will fund the tanker, possibly as part of an oil exploration package. In the short term, Barantsev's best hope lies in glass-sided submersible crafts, for theme parks or seaside resorts. He stresses that the Bureau has developed, and can make and sell, the submarine's contents, from the radar to the first-aid kit. 'People have to work there, eat there and rest there,' he says. The St Petersburg Marine Engineering Bureau is not alone in selecting low-technology products as a means of making its way in the new Russian economy. The maker of Kalashnikov rifles has now turned its skills to hunting rifles, the wooden handles engraved and inlaid. And the Vavilov State Optical Institute has adapted its expertise in laser technology for engraving crystal tableware. The Institute is famous for its holography techniques, and has demonstrated the world's largest colour hologram, which can be reconstructed using a single incoherent light source - a white spot light. Other techniques rely on coherent light sources - lasers - for their reconstruction. Victor Puchkov, general director, believes the large colour holograms may replace traditional travelling art exhibitions, where priceless exhibits have to be moved from country to country under tight security. But Puchkov is reluctant to talk about the possibility of bringing images of Russian art treasures to a wider audience. Like Barantsev, he cites the financial difficulties. Elsewhere at Birmingham were even more bizarre examples of diversification. Many stands featured decorated teapots and other bric-a-brac more reminiscent of a country craft fair than a high-technology exhibition. The aviation industry stand boasted clocks, samovars, and fridge freezers. One defence company has applied expertise in optical fibre technology to produce floral ornaments with rigid fabric petals which twinkle colourfully when connected to the electricity supply. With the domestic goods were established examples of military technology spin-offs: such as tennis racquets made from carbon fibres. Bullet-proof glass had also been moulded to make gemlike multicoloured rust-proof glass nails. There were examples of truly innovative technology. The Ekranoplan, a cross between an aircraft and a Hovercraft, the Russians hope to sell as an air-sea rescue aircraft or airborne ambulance. Converting expensive, sophisticated military technology for equally sophisticated use in peace time is a task which appears to have largely foxed the Russians as it has companies in the US and Europe. Yurii Krasnoshchyokov, director of the Central Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, and an explosives expert, is the exception. 'Everybody tries to run away from explosives, but we try to use them,' he explains. He has developed explosive 'bombs' which can be dropped from the air to control avalanches. Another technique uses small, controlled explosions to break up parched and furrowed agricultural land and so increase crop yields. Most impressive of all has been the production of large diamond-like superhard materials for use in industrial applications. The process involves high temperatures and pressures to form boron nitride crystals. The pressure is twofold: static and explosive; hence the diversification from Krasnoshchyokov's original speciality. The diversification, he says, is one of the most difficult attained by Russian scientists. His eyes gleam with pleasure as he explains that one day he hopes to produce superhard materials with the same aesthetic qualities - and the same structural properties - as natural diamonds.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN APPRECIATION;  </P> <P> EDWIN LESTER: A BENEVOLENT RULER OF MUSICAL THEATER  </P> <P> The age of chivalry in the arts may well have ended Thursday with the death of  Edwin Lester. Not only was Lester, 95, the founder of the Los Angeles Civic  Light Opera and the undisputed prince of musical theater in this city, but he  was a man universally respected for the classy way in which he conducted his  business and his life.  </P> <P> Like the organization he ran for almost 40 years -- a phenomenally successful  commercial musical venture -- Edwin Lester was always slightly larger than  life, more grand opera than operetta, but with a sense of humor that tempered  the grandiloquence and a keenness of mind that stayed with him until the very  last days.  </P> <P> He brought musical theater to Los Angeles in the mid-1930s and remained its  reigning monarch until his self-appointed retirement in the late '70s -- an  empirical, benevolent ruler who ran his domain with the ironclad ethics and  impeccable manners that earned him respect, even from those -- perhaps  especially from those -- who did not necessarily share his musical tastes.  </P> <P> "He lived his theater, the Civic Light Opera was his mistress," said singer  Patricia Morison, who had auditioned for him as a young woman. "Musical theater  was fun when he did it. He employed people in this town. He gave young people  breaks. He could be old-fashioned and opinionated but also very loyal."  </P> <P> Loyalty was a hallmark. A gentleman of the old school, Lester got as good as he  gave. He was surrounded most of his life by stalwart associates, such as  Eleanor Pinkham and his longtime secretary, Joan Gilmore, who were as devoted  to him as they were to his causes. But Lester, who could be surprisingly  high-handed in his unquestioned self-assurance, paradoxically never let success  spoil him. He was a hands-on producer who personally answered all his mail and  had absolute regard for his subscribers.  </P> <P> Musical tastes were another matter. His were often questioned and did not  change with the changing times. He made no secret of preferring operettas and  "book musicals with happy endings." He believed the test of time to be the only  true measure of successful musical writing and was no fan of the new style of  musicals ushered in by Stephen Sondheim.  </P> <P> That didn't stop him from respecting what others saw in Sondheim and bringing  "Company" (1971) and "Pacific Overtures" (1976) to the CLO.  </P> <P> When "Cabaret" -- considered racy for his audience -- had come to CLO in the  late '60s, Lester had acknowledged it was not his kind of show but that he  respected it, adding that he would have made some changes had it been up to  him. What changes? Well, instead of those buxom German dancers, he would have  substituted svelte and beautiful women -- precisely what "Cabaret" was not  about.  </P> <P> After he had ceded the reins, LACLO was never the same. But Lester either never  let its decline bother him or never admitted that it did. As far as he was  concerned, the Edwin Lester Civic Light Opera began and ended with Edwin  Lester. What he couldn't help or couldn't change he would not allow to affect  him. He never uttered a word of criticism or leveled a single complaint.  </P> <P> Only once, when the LACLO was going through a particularly bad patch at the  hands of his successors did he venture the opinion that he had perhaps retired  a little too soon.  </P> <P> As he grew older, and especially after his retirement, he became more and more  relaxed, engaging and delightful. We maintained a lively correspondence and had  dinner from time to time. Mostly, my husband and I were his guests. Only once  were we able to lure him to our home. He clearly preferred it the other way.  Playing host had become his occupation of choice and he did that too in style.  </P> <P> While he was still at LACLO, he once shipped a box of chocolate-covered  pretzels to our home for Christmas. Not wanting to seem to curry favor, he  signed the card with an X. But it wasn't hard to track down the gift-giver and,  playing along with the mystery, I responded with a thank-you note signed with a  Y. This became our private joke and annual conspiracy.  </P> <P> Every year thereafter a box of chocolate-covered pretzels arrived promptly at  our door for the holidays. They were, he said, his favorite. Christmas won't be  the same without them.  </P></p>

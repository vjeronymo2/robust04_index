			<p>940419 FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness offshoot chief receives Pounds 670,000 pay-off Mr Crispin Davis, former managing director of United Distillers, the Guinness spirits division, who resigned from the group in October by mutual agreement, will receive cash and non-cash benefits worth Pounds 670,000 over the two years to October 1995. Details of the compensation package for loss of office are contained in the Guinness group accounts. Under the terms of the agreement Mr Davis will remain available for consultation by the company. His departure, after little more than a year as head of UD, was said at the time to be due to a personality clash with Mr Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman and chief executive. Mr Greener was the highest paid Guinness director in 1993, receiving Pounds 648,000 in total remuneration. Sir Anthony Tennant, his predecessor, was paid Pounds 777,000 in 1992.</p>

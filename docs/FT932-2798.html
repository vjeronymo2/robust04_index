			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fresh chapter for retailers - WH Smith's schools initiative If schools are short of books, computers and other equipment, it is a problem for pupils and teachers. But it is also an opportunity for companies that want to enhance their corporate image and sell products at the same time. This opportunity is being increasingly exploited. Several leading retailers are now implementing promotions where schools will get the benefit from the incentive to purchase. This week WH Smith launched its 'Free books for schools' initiative, the company's largest promotion. Until 10 September customers will receive a voucher worth 10p for each Pounds 2 they spend. Primary schools can collect these vouchers and redeem them via WH Smith for a maximum of Pounds 500 worth of books. Following Tesco's highly successful 'Computers for schools' scheme, WH Smith's approach reflects the rapid development of 'cause-related' or 'social' marketing in the UK. One in four primary schools has already registered for the scheme, put together by sales promotion agency LGM. WH Smith expects to distribute up to Pounds 5m worth of books. If so, the promotion will have to drum up a lot of extra business to be worthwhile. 'We are confident it will work,' says Julia Nolan, marketing services manager at WH Smith. 'It's nice to be able to do something which meets our commercial objectives and gives benefit to the community.' Next month WH Smith's rival John Menzies will launch a parallel programme. Vouchers will again be given on a Pounds 2 spend, although only on purchases of books or stationery. However, the Menzies scheme will also allow secondary schools to collect and redeem vouchers. In the autumn another books-for-schools plan will be launched by Boots, based on a Pounds 5 spend. This rush of copycat schemes has been inspired by the Tesco initiative, in which schools could redeem vouchers for Acorn computers and software. The supermarket chain is now employing this idea for a second year. Last year 8,000 schools received Pounds 3m worth of equipment. And according to Tesco even more schools are involved this year. Distribution of vouchers has ceased, but schools have until early July to send them in. 'Many people thought the Tesco scheme was a good idea, combining customer loyalty and community benefit, so we are now getting lots of 'me-toos',' says Susan Short, secretary general of the Institute of Sales Promotion. The institute provides a copy clearance service and she adds: 'This time last year we had no such schemes. In the past three months we've had six or seven proposed. Most come from retailers, but there is also a major, fast-moving consumer goods manufacturer of leading brands.' The attractions of such programmes are clear. They are loyalty schemes which aid a good cause. Tesco describes them as incentive promotions driven by community rather than personal needs. They boost sales while creating a valuable association and generating good publicity. This is part of a trend in which corporate do-gooding is more closely tied to business objectives. Andrew Wilson of Ashridge Management Centre, who has been investigating the motivation behind companies' community involvement, says: 'Our research shows that most large companies are moving away from old-style philanthropy, and are looking for a business-related pay-off. They are trying to be more cost-effective and professional in their community involvement.' But will returns diminish as such promotions become more widespread? Tesco, which is cagey about publicly quantifying the pay-back, recognises it will have to improve its scheme if it is to retain its reputation as a leader in this field. Short thinks others will respond with wider diversification: 'The idea may well be taken further into other areas of social needs such as health or community care.'</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Brazilians celebrate vote to impeach Collor THOUSANDS of Brazilians poured on to the streets of Brasilia, the capital, last night, firing rockets in celebration after a landslide congressional vote in favour of impeaching President Fernando Collor de Mello for corruption. The scene was repeated in state capitals throughout the country as Brazil registered relief at the end to months of uncertainty which has unnerved the financial markets and severely impaired the president's ability to govern. Mr Collor, who took office in March 1990 as the first directly elected president for 30 years, becomes the country's first head of state to face an impeachment trial. He will now be suspended from office for up to 180 days while he is tried by the Senate on charges that he profited from a multi-million dollar corruption scam. His lawyers are preparing an appeal. Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president, will take over. He faces a tough task in trying to reduce the inflation rate from over 20 per cent a month but the backing of a wide coalition of opposition parties from both left and right will initially help him to push important projects through Congress. Nine ministers in Mr Collor's cabinet resigned last night following the vote, including Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the much-respected economy minister, and the foreign and justice ministers. The rest are expected to follow, allowing Mr Franco to appoint a new cabinet which, however, is not likely to include Mr Moreira. Mr Franco will today meet leaders from the main opposition parties who have led the impeachment campaign to discuss policy. Inside a packed Congress the mood was jubilant as vote after vote was registered in favour of Mr Collor's impeachment. As the 336th vote was registered, signifying that Mr Collor had been defeated, an enormous cheer went up on the floor and there was a standing ovation along the galleries on which were gathered state governors, union and political leaders. The house stopped for an emotional rendering of the national anthem. Earlier in the day Mr Collor's advisers had been so confident he would survive that a victory speech was prepared. But once voting started it was clear the tide was going against him and the main Sao Paulo market closed 7.7 per cent up on the assumption he would be defeated. Many Collor supporters switched sides and after 137 minutes the voting closed with 441 votes in favour of impeachment and only 38 against. Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest state, said after the result: 'We must now institutionalise these lessons so this never happens to Brazil again.' The 43-year-old former governor of Alagoas state had been elected, ironically, on an anti-corruption platform. His downfall was prompted by charges by his brother Pedro that he was running a corruption scam, an accusation against which he has presented no real defence.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Magnesium imports 'harmful to US groups' The US International Trade Commission, examining foreign exporters' dumping of magnesium at below cost, said yesterday US companies appear to have been damaged, Reuter reports from Washington. The finding was the first step of an anti-dumping inquiry involving magnesium imports from China, Russia and Ukraine. The case now goes to the commerce department, which will investigate whether the metal was sold at unfairly low prices in 1993. If it decides dumping occurred, the ITC would be asked to make a final determination of injury and countervailing duties could be collected. The complaint was brought by Magcorp and two labour unions at the end of March. Magcorp and the unions say the fair price for magnesium from the three nations was from Dollars 1.41 to Dollars 1.49 per pound, but Russia sold magnesium for as low as 41 cents per pound. The ITC said imports of pure and alloy magnesium from China and Russia should be investigated. They also supported an investigation of pure magnesium from Ukraine but rejected an investigation of alloy-grade magnesium from that country. Pure magnesium is used in making aluminum and in desulfurisation. Alloy-grade magnesium is used in die casting. Imports of magnesium surged from 1991-93 and prices fell. Shipments from the three nations totalled 23,758 metric tons in 199. The complaint was the second time US producers have moved against a flood of metals exports from former Soviet states. In the other instance, they acted in concert with other nations to curb voluntarily global aluminium production.</p>

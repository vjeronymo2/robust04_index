The guerrillas attacked government troops guarding the  bridge  along Route 5 at Phum O Snguot, south of Sisophon, in Banteay  Meanchey province, a military official in the capital Phnom Penh  said.    A government officer told reporters on the Thai-Cambodian  border that one government soldier was killed and three injured  in the 30-minute firefight -- one guerrilla was also killed.    The guerrillas proceeded to use landmines to destroy a  5-meter (16.5 foot) stretch of the bridge, the military official  said.    The bridge was renovated by Thai military engineers and is  just some 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of another bridge at  the Thai- Cambodian border, which Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai will official open Thursday, the government officer  said. [passage omitted]    The ceremony would not be affected by Wednesday attck as  Chuan, along with co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen, were scheduled to arrive here by helicopter.    Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were moved into Poipet  as protection for the visit, a government officer at the border  said.    As preparations were being made to boost protection for the  visiting dignitaries, fresh fighting erupted in Phum Takong Krao  about 18 kilometers to the south, the latest in a series of  clashes between the government troops and the Khmer Rouge in the  area.    In northern Preah Vihrear province, Khmer Rouge guerrillas  burnt more than one thousand acres (400 hectares) of ricefields,  Ministry of Information spokesman Sieng La Presse said.    "This is the harvest season and they try to sabotage the  economic system of the royal government by burning rice,  threatening the lives of peasants and cutting the roads so they  cannot move their produce to the market," he said.    Sieng La Presse said guerrillas were operating a "hit and  run" strategy, attacking a village at night and burning the  houses, killing livestock and destroying paddies. [passage  omitted]    Earlier, Prince Ranariddh said he had "a very good meeting"  with the Thai premier, commenting: "There's progress when the  Thai side says they never provide any support for the Khmer  Rouge."

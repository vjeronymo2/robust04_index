			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mid-term turnround at Metra METRA, the Finnish industrial group, returned to profit, after financial items, of FM92m (Dollars 16.1m) in the six months to the end of August from a loss of FM65m in the same period last year. It was helped by rapid sales growth at Wartsila Diesel, its diesel engine division. Sales at the unit were ahead by 98 per cent at FM2.8bn, pushing up group sales to FM5.52bn, a 48 per cent increase over the previous year's figure of FM3.74bn. The weaker value of the markka, heavily devalued following its flotation last autumn, contributed, but Metra said it had benefited from a surge in worldwide demand, especially for its power plants. Metra said it held more than 20 per cent of the world market for power plants over 1MW. Demand was strongest in Asia Pacific. Metra said penetration of the Chinese market was paying off. Almost one-third of Wartsila's FM3.5bn order book was accounted for by China. Metra said sales in its Sanitec household ceramics business were up by one-third to FM1.24bn. The third core division, the locks and security device maker Abloy, increased sales by 28 per cent to FM849m. Metra said it expected similar profits growth to continue in the rest of the year. Amer, the Finnish consumer group which includes Wilson Sporting Goods in the US, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of FM41m in the six months to the end of August, up sharply from FM25m the previous year. Sales were ahead, by 13 per cent, to FM3.76bn. But Amer said the figures were flattered by the lower value of the Finnish markka following its effective devaluation last autumn. Some 68 per cent of the company's sales are outside Finland, with North America making up 46 per cent. Excluding exchange rate factors, sales were down 5 per cent. This included a 4 per cent decline in dollar terms in its sporting goods division.</p>

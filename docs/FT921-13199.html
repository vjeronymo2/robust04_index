			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates stable UK money rates were stable yesterday, with the market facing a smaller liquidity shortage than in recent days and sterling steady on the foreign exchange markets, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 650m in early morning, later revised up to Pounds 750m. The main factor was maturing treasury bills and earlier assistance totalling just over Pounds 500m. With overnight money rates retaining the softer tone seen on Monday, market participants did not rush for liquidity and the Bank of England refrained entirely from morning assistance. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 138m band 1 bank bills and band 2 bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds 435m, bringing the total injection of liquidity for the day to Pounds 573m. This was sufficient to keep short-rates near Monday's closing levels. Overnight unsecured funds traded at around 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent against a close on Monday of 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent. Longer cash rates were also steady. Three months inter-bank funds traded at 10 5/8 - per cent, unchanged from Monday. One month inter-bank money traded at 10- 5/8 per cent, from 10- 9/16 . The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange traded at around 89.75 for most of the day and closed at 89.71. This implies base lending rates of 10.39 per cent from a current rate of 10.5 per cent. In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade around 9.40/50 per cent, unchanged from the levels seen on Monday. Today the Bundesbank is expected to set repurchase agreements to replace an expiring DM13.3bn pact. Funds are being drained from the market at 9.55 per cent and the Bundesbank is expected to inject new funds at 9.4 per cent, the rate set at last week's repurchase operations. The Bank of Japan did not operate in the money markets yesterday, in spite of a Y210bn surplus of liquidity and a slide in three months certificate of deposit rates. In the past the authorities have been keen to stop short-rates from falling. However, the weakness of the stock market this week may be an overriding concern. Call money traded at around the 5 9/16 per cent levels seen on Monday. Three months CDs traded at 5.20 per cent, from 5.25 per cent.</p>

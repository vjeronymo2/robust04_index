The store stocks such lines as  William Britains Ltd., Bill Hocker, Imperial Productions of New Zealand and  Alymer.  </P> <P> Pieces range from $6 to $100; sets begin at $45. Connolly also buys and swaps  old toy soldiers.  </P> <P> Every glass case in Connolly's shop displays myriad adventures to titillate the  imaginations of both the casual observer and the seasoned collector. In one, a  Zulu chief sits proudly on his steed with an outstretched arm clasping a spear  as he leads his warriors into battle against the British army.  </P> <P>  Bill Connolly's Toy Soldier Exchange, No. 10 The Burlington Arcade, 380 S.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Car importer leaves Pounds 27m in will Mr David Brown, the former mechanic who founded Proton Cars (UK), the importer of Malaysian cars, left an estate of more than Pounds 27m. Mr Brown, a friend of the Malaysian royal family who is believed to have played an informal mediating role between the British and Malaysian governments over the Pergau Dam affair, died of a cerebral haemorrhage while riding an exercise cycle at his home in Grappenhall, Cheshire, in April. He was 45. His estate was valued at Pounds 27.1m gross, Pounds 25m net, with bequests in his will to various members of his family. Mr Brown, a burly, extrovert figure with a robust sense of humour seemingly at odds with his reputation for secrecy, was on the point of taking Proton into a new market. Having turned Proton Cars (UK), in which he was the majority shareholder, into the fastest growing new car franchise ever launched in Britain - it has already sold about 70,000 units since its start in 1987 - Mr Brown was poised to lead Proton into continental European markets. He was to do so as majority shareholder of Proton Cars Europe (PCE), a joint venture with the manufacturer and EON Corporation, its distributor in Malaysia. The fate of his 55 per cent shareholding in PCE is not yet clear, but Mr Peter King, Proton UK's managing director, said yesterday that PCE was pressing ahead with co-ordinating the Continental debut of Proton cars, starting with the French market in October. Unlike the conventional import and distribution operations of Proton Cars (UK), PCE will choose and co-ordinate the activities of independent distributors in mainland Europe. Mr Brown started his career with a garage under railway arches at Warrington, building up a chain of dealerships under the umbrella of the Mainland Motor Corporation. He was awarded Malaysia's highest national honour for foreigners, the Johan Setia Mahkota.</p>

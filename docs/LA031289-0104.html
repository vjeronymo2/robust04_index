			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: CENTRAL CITY WEST: DON'T TELL US, SHOW US  </P> <P> The long-awaited urban design and land use plan for Central City West is in the  last throes of preparation, not unlike a concoction of raw meat being readied  for a cage of hungry tigers.  </P> <P> What makes the plan so tasty for the tigers is the potential of the area,  encompassing 355 acres from the Harbor Freeway west to Witmer Street and  Glendale Boulevard, and from Olympic Boulevard north to the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> Given the proximity to downtown, the rolling hills with views, and swaths of  vacant and underdeveloped land, the area is variously viewed as a natural  extension of an office-tower-dominated downtown, a thriving residential  community serving the city's need for more housing near jobs and a collection  of choice sites for inner-city schools.  </P> <P> More generally, and idealistically, the area also contains the potential of an  urbane village, serving downtown but also serving itself with an imaginative  mix of uses. These would include sensitively scaled offices, shops, schools,  and, in particular, a range of housing, from rehabilitated bungalows and  affordable apartments to upscale condo complexes, set in a network of  pedestrian friendly streets, plazas and parks.  </P> <P> This enlightened vision appears to be the thrust of the so-called specific plan  now being prepared by the design firm of Meyer &amp; Allen, aided by a bevy of  consultants, including Barrio Planners. It places most of the offices on the  eastern edge of the area and along the Wilshire Boulevard corridor, while  taking advantage of the Crown and Temple-Beaudry hills for housing and parks.  Scattered throughout would be stores and schools.  </P> <P> Although the planning effort is being paid for by a consortium of major  property owners in the area so as to expedite required -- and desired -- design  guidelines and zoning changes, it has been a relatively public process, thanks  to the insistence of Councilwoman Gloria Molina and an emerging vocal resident  population. Most of the estimated 17,000 people who live there are tenants,  Latino and poor, including a wary few who have been displaced by redevelopment  projects elsewhere.  </P> <P> Out of a series of neighborhood meetings has come a plea that no existing  housing -- however deteriorated -- be demolished until replacement housing at  reasonably comparable rents be constructed, and that generally, what is left of  the neighborhoods there, after years of being nibbled away at by speculators,  somehow be rehabilitated and made more attractive, and livable.  </P> <P> It all sounds good, but few persons who have watched the Central City West saga  believe it will be developed according to the plan. Indeed, even if it is  eventually adopted, given muscle through zoning and embraced by Mayor Tom  Bradley, in the end it will just be prey for the tigers, the meat consumed and  the bones spit out.  </P> <P> Dampening hopes that the redevelopment of Central City West will be different  from other efforts, such as California Plaza, is the presence of a gaggle of  lobbyists representing some major investors with political clout, a school  board insensitive to the community, some shortsighted absentee landlords and a  sprinkling of well-meaning but naive neighborhood organizers.  </P> <P> Like tigers, each out for himself, they promise to pull apart whatever plan is  presented. Setting an unfortunate tone among the lobbyists has been former  Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, who represents developer Ray Watt. Snyder is  remembered for, among other things, trying as a councilman, to sink a community  effort to save a Hollywood bungalow court. Most recently, he represented a  developer who on New Year's Day attempted through a misrepresentation of an  address to demolish the historic McKinley Mansion.  </P> <P> Among other well-connected lobbyists and lawyers of note representing  developers with holdings in the area are George Mihslten, former city Planning  Commission chairman Dan Garcia, and former Bradley aide Norman Emerson.  Although they generally have been more reasonable than Snyder in recognizing  the need for a balance of commercial and residential, their presence is viewed  warily by the community.  </P> <P> Seemingly oblivious to the protracted planning process has been the school  board.  </P> <P> Its building committee recently indicated that it was seeking to locate several  schools in the area, including a junior high school, and might resort to the  use of eminent domain to obtain the sites -- regardless of whatever community  plan is eventually adopted.  </P> <P> The waters were further muddied when developer Leonard Glickman embraced and  embellished the school board proposal as a way to clear 50 acres and, along  with the schools, to build several square block of apartment houses.  </P> <P> There is nothing like the phrase "eminent domain" to send a shiver of fear  through residents and property owners alike, and a shiver of frustration  through the planners and officials trying to work with them.  </P> <P> And then there are the well-meaning community organizations, who according to  their leaflets, want "affordable housing, quality schools, more parks, less  traffic and a stronger voice in decisions," and do not want "more skyscraper  office buildings in our back yards."  </P> <P> That sounds nice. However, it doesn't recognize the harsh reality in this  lingering age of Reaganism (meaning no public funds for such needs) that the  only way projects such as affordable housing and parks are going to be financed  is to tie their construction in some way to the approval of the more lucrative  office development. The concept is known as linkage, and has produced needed  housing in Boston and San Francisco.  </P> <P> But given the history of promises unkept in Los Angeles, communities do not  want to be told what may happen if they allow a particular office development  to move forward. Instead, they want to be shown, and not just pretty  renderings.  </P> <P> With this in mind, and given the many vacant parcels in Central City West, the  consortium of property owners wanting a reasonable plan to move forward would  be wise to consider undertaking -- before anything else -- a demonstration  project incorporating the promises that have been made.  </P> <P> The demonstration project could be a well-scaled, sensitively designed complex  with a variety of housing types and subsidies that could serve as a relocation  resource for the inevitable demolition of some of the more decrepit buildings  nearby.  </P> <P> Included also as a demonstration of innovative programming and design could be  supportive commercial and community facilities, such as a so-called vest-pocket  school whose playground can double as a park, its library open to all after  hours and a host of other mixes and matches that have been successfully tried  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Los Angeles begs for such a planning and design demonstration, and Central City  West would be as good a place as any to begin. It is time to tame the tigers.  </P></p>

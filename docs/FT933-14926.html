			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Ex-BA adviser fights back MR BRIAN BASHAM, who was sacked at the start of the year as public relations adviser to British Airways for his part in the alleged dirty tricks campaign against Virgin Airways, has launched a campaign to clear his own name and embarrass Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman. His campaign brings him into conflict with one of his oldest rivals, Sir Tim Bell, who succeeded him as BA's PR adviser and is best known for his close relationship with Lady Thatcher. Mr Basham has submitted four questions to be answered at BA's annual meeting, which he has reproduced in a letter to Sir Colin. Mr Basham believes that BA's account of Sir Colin's role in the dirty tricks campaign has been misleading and he is demanding an independent inquiry into the affair. He admits that he commissioned research into Virgin and spoke to journalists about Mr Richard Branson's airline but he denies that this was improper. He was not, however, involved in BA's use of computer data about Virgin passengers, which BA has admitted was wrong and has caused greatest concern to Mr Branson. The BA board has also denied involvement in this misuse of Virgin passenger information, which was said to have been carried out by junior BA staff. Mr Basham says in his letter to Sir Colin that 'it remains entirely implausible to me . . . that you could not have known' of the misuse of computer data. He also alleges that Mrs Gail Redwood, the company secretary, offered her resignation after directors signed a disclaimer denying all knowledge of the alleged dirty tricks campaign. Mrs Redwood yesterday refused to comment, but BA said that Mr Basham had misunderstood what had happened. BA said that Mrs Redwood offered to resign because she wanted to work part-time but felt the company might not agree to this change. Her resignation offer was in no way connected to the signing of the dirty tricks disclaimer, BA said. In the event, Mrs Redwood was persuaded to continue working for the company full time. BA's annual meeting will be held tomorrow at London's Barbican theatre. The company has received questions from 2,000 shareholders, a third of which relate to the Virgin affair.</p>

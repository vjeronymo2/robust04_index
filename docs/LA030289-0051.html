			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALALAIKA ORCHESTRA TOUR OF WEST COAST CANCELED  </P> <P> The West Coast portion of the tour by the Osipov Balalaika Orchestra, including  performances at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim March 3 and at Ambassador  Auditorium in Pasadena March 4, has been canceled. The producers, Classical  Artists International, say that the company will be back in 1990, with a  restructured tour of three- or four-performance engagements, rather than the  single night stands of the tour now ending after the East Coast leg.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Sport: Twickenham without beers - Rugby Union, Five Nations / Tom Fort used to spend lunch in a pub and the match in agony. He is wiser now In my feckless youth, the notion that international day required strategic planning never entered my head. We simply went to a pub - any pub - and drank beer until it was time to go to the match. Afterwards we went to a pub  -any pub - and drank beer until it closed, or we could drink no more. We went home feeling hilarious, woke up feeling vile, and ran it off on the rugby field on Sunday afternoon. With the passing of years, shortcomings were exposed in this approach. Increasingly the pre-match pub side of things palled. You would stand for ages crushed on all sides by red-faced prop forwards and hulking second row men, deafened by patriotic bawling and thunderous denunciations of selectorial idiocy. Fighting your way to the bar was bad enough; getting back to your chums without pouring the ale down someone's neck required an improbable degree of resilience and dexterity. Then there was the matter of the bladder, which I will not go into in detail for fear of giving offence. Suffice it to say that of the 50,000 or so attending a rugby international, three-fifths at a conservative estimate will arrive with bladders full; that of these, three fifths will need to relieve themselves again before the game is over; that no sporting arena on earth boasts the facilities to cope with such demands; and that the inevitable consequences are distasteful to sensitive souls like myself. In addition, in those days we used to stand, and once you are jammed into the crowd there is simply no escape however urgent the desire to do so. I shudder at the memories. Twenty years ago, we went to see England play France at Twickenham. As always, it was the game of the season, and we had standing tickets for the east side enclosure. We made our way first to the Orange Tree at Richmond. It was my eldest brother's first trip to Twickenham, and I advised him to restrict himself to a couple of pints. In the annoying way eldest brothers have, he ignored me and drank six. We got the the ground in good time, and by the time the ref blew his whistle, we had battled our way to a first rate vantage point on the halfway line. Scarcely was the ball in the air than my brother gave an anguished cry. He turned, was swallowed by the throng, and was not seen again that day. Paris showed us there could be a better way. In the absence of heaving pubs, we developed the habit of lunching expansively on oysters, andouillettes, choucroute and wine at the Brasserie Du Gard Du Nord, before travelling in orderly fashion to the cauldron of frenzy known as Parc des Princes. Afterwards, admittedly having had a beer or three somewhere, we would dine in a Michelin approved restaurant and discuss the match like the civilised men we were. We decided to see if we could duplicate this refinement in west London. Another of my brothers, a man steeped in foodyism, was deputed to find somewhere suitable. He took us to a little restaurant called well, actually I don't think I will tell you, for obvious reasons. It is close to a railway station, and opposite a tolerable pub, for those unable entirely to shake off the old ways. The advantages are that the crowds are absent, and there is parking, and peace. The restaurant is a rum establishment. It opens only at lunchtime, and has no licence which makes it extremely cheap, as you bring your own wine. The dishes have not changed in a dozen years. Each time, I seem to eat liver in the provencale style, and each time I think what a thoroughly decent dish it is. There we gather, eat, drink, explore shared memories, organise the sweepstake on the score, analyse the prospects, make a certain amount of noise but not too much, I trust. Then to the match, with passably clear heads and blessedly unstrained bladders; then to the pub, where the scene tends to become somewhat less decorous, and sometimes not decorous at all; then home by train and taxi. In all this there is the satisfaction of having a good day, without behaving like an oaf. It is a pleasing routine, which lightens the darkness of dreary winter. And never let anyone try to kid you that sitting at home and watching the game on TV can come within a mile of matching it.</p>

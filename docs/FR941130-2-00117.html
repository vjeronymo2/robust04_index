Investors is a stock life insurance company which was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1963. Investors changed its state of domicile to the State of Washington in 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In September 1982, Investors established Account I as a separate investment account to fund certain flexible premium and single premium variable annuity policies (the ``Account I Policies''). Account I is organized and registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Account I currently has five divisions, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a designated portfolio of the CIGNA Annuity Funds Group (the ``CIGNA Funds''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Each such division contains two subdivisions, one for the allocation of tax qualified and one for non-tax qualified net payments made under variable annuity contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Before October 1985, the underlying funding vehicle for Account I was the CIGNA Annuity Fund, Inc. On October 16, 1985, the CIGNA Funds acquired the assets and liabilities of CIGNA Annuity Fund, Inc., pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization which had been approved by the shareholders of CIGNA Annuity Fund, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The underlying investment vehicle for Account I is the CIGNA Funds, a Massachusetts business trust organized on April 10, 1985, which is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management company of the series type. The CIGNA Funds currently consist of five portfolios, each with its own investment objectives and investment portfolio. Before November 29, 1993, the investment adviser to the five portfolios of the CIGNA Funds was CIGNA Investments, Inc. (``CII''), a subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In June 1980, the Investors established INA/Putnam Account as a separate investment account to fund certain single premium variable annuity policies (the ``INA/Putnam Policies''). The INA/Putnam Account is organized and registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The INA/Putnam Account initially had five divisions, each of which invested exclusively in shares of one of the following mutual funds (collectively, the ``Putnam Funds''): Putnam Income Fund; Putnam High Yield Trust; Putnam Equity Income Fund (formerly known as Putnam Strategic Income Trust and Putnam Option Income Trust); Putnam Daily Dividend Trust; and Putnam Investors Fund. Each division of the INA/Putnam Account contained two subdivisions, one for the allocation of tax qualified and one for the allocation of non-tax qualified net payments made under variable annuity contracts. Putnam Investment Management, Inc. (``Putnam'') currently serves as investment adviser to the Putnam Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Following the issuance of Revenue Ruling 81&hyph;225 by the Internal Revenue Service on September 25, 1981, Investors discontinued offering the INA/Putnam Policies. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  For owners of INA/Putnam Policies issued prior to Revenue Ruling 81&hyph;225 who were adversely affected by that Revenue Ruling, Investors added an additional division to the INA/Putnam Account, for which the underlying investment vehicle is the CIGNA Funds. Those INA/Putnam Policy owners were able to transfer contract values from the Putnam Funds to the CIGNA Funds. The CIGNA Funds initially offered a money market option (the ``CIGNA Annuity Money Market Fund''); subsequently, the investment options were expanded to include the CIGNA Annuity Income Fund and the CIGNA Annuity Equity Fund as well. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The Putnam Funds have remained available under INA/Putnam Contracts issued prior to the cut-off dates described in Revenue Ruling 81&hyph;225. Accordingly, there currently are eight divisions of the INA/Putnam Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Revenue Ruling 81&hyph;225 pertains to variable annuity contracts offered through insurance company separate accounts holding shares of mutual funds which also offer their shares to the public. Revenue Ruling 81&hyph;225 questioned the tax treatment of variable annuity contracts when the underlying mutual funds are not managed by the issuing company or an affiliate, or when the policyholder may initially allocate, and subsequently reallocate, the contract values among several underlying funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, the CIGNA Funds currently consist of five portfolios. However, shares of two of those five portfolios (the CIGNA Annuity Growth and Income Fund and the CIGNA Annuity Aggressive Equity Fund) have not been made available to owners of the INA/Putnam Policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

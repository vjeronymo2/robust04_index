			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Davy wins furnace contract Davy International, part of Trafalgar House of the UK, said yesterday it had won a contract worth about Pounds 75m to design and supply a blast furnace for China Steel in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The contract was awarded after more than two years of technical and commercial discussions with China Steel, in the face of intense competition from Japan and Germany. The work will be handled by Davy's office in Stockton, northern England, and includes supervision of erection and commissioning and training services. Davy said a key factor in its selection was its track record in South Korea, where it supplied five blast furnaces to Posco, the steel producer.</p>

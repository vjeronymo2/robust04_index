			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"; passages within quotation </F> marks are recorded]    [Text] Point by point, the authorities involved in the drug  fight refuted the prosecutor general's assessments.    [Colonel Jose Antonio Gallego, chief of the Narcotics  Division] "I personally and professionally respect all  observations made by the prosecutor general, but I cannot share  that statement because it is very obvious that following the  death of Gonzalo Rodiguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar, drug  trafficking in Colombia was completely reduced to zero by the  national government."    As for the increase in the amount of cultivated areas:    [Gallego] "That is not completely true because, as regards  coca plantations, we have seen an increase since last year that  is not more than 5 or 7 percent. The same is not true for  marijuana or poppy plantations."    As for the small number of drug and money confiscations:    [Gallego] "We can say that we have confiscated plenty of  drugs of different types in the country."    As for the small number of drug traffickers in jail:    [Gallego] "The National Police, alone, in the first four  months of 1994, have arrested 450 Colombians and 42 foreigners  involved in the trafficking of drugs."    As for the increase in drug consumption:    [Gallego] "An increase in consumption is relative. If it is  indeed happening, it should not be in significant numbers  because indicators show that, at this time, there is less  availability of the substance than in previous years."</p>

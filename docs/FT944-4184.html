			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Observer: Saucy ganders What do John Major, Douglas Hurd, Michael Heseltine and Sir Edward Heath have in common? Why, all are committed to putting Britain at the heart of Europe, of course. How curious, then, that not one of the four saw fit to support the government when the Commons voted to give the European Union finance bill a third reading in the early hours of yesterday morning. And what happens to members of parliament who defy the government in confidence votes? Well, last time, the eight Conservatives who defied the whips over the bill's second reading were suspended from the parliamentary party. Quizzed as to why the four bigwigs did not vote yesterday, Downing Street swiftly pointed to the size of the government's majority - an admittedly hefty 272. But one of last week's rebels, Michael Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth, was stripped of the whip after abstaining on a confidence vote the government won by 285 votes. Grounds for a choicely worded letter to the chief whip?</p>

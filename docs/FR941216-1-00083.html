			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Transport vehicles will be heavily damaged, probably to the extent of total loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Direct propagation of explosion between two explosives locations is unlikely when barricades between them intercept high-velocity, low-angle fragments (see &sect;184.43(a)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Improperly designed barricades or structures increase the hazard from flying debris; further, their probable collapse threatens personnel and equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Exposed structures housing personnel or containing equipment that is monetarily valuable or critically important to the mission, may require hardening. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) At blast overpressure of 3.5 psi (0.24 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 18W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see Appendix B to Subpart F of this part): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Direct propagation of explosion is not expected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Delayed communication of explosion from fires, or equipment failure at the exposed site (ES), is possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain serious damage, approximating 50 percent of the total replacement cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Personnel will be critically injured or killed by fragments, debris, firebrands, and so forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) There is a 1 percent chance of eardrum damage to personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Aircraft will be severely damaged from blast, fragments, and debris. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Transport vehicles' body panels will be dished and shatter-resistant window glass will crack. Though extensive, this damage will not prevent the vehicles from operating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Overpressure control by suppressive construction at the PES, or by protective construction at the ES, is recommended if it is more economical than distance alone, or if distance cannot suffice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) At blast overpressure of 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 24W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (for quantities up to 100,000 pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 20 percent of their replacement cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Occupants of exposed structures may suffer temporary hearing loss or be injured by such blast effects as building debris and being bodily thrown about. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Fragments and debris could, however, cause injuries, depending on the PES structure and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Vehicles on the road should not be damaged unless hit by fragments or the operator loses control during the blast wave. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Aircraft appendages and sheet metal skin could be damaged by blast and possibly fragment penetrations, but should be operational after minor repairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Barricading at the PES reduces injury and damage from fragments from limited quantities of explosives. Suppressive construction at the PES or protective construction at the ES are practical ways of controlling blast over-pressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) At blast overpressure of between 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) and 1.7 psi (0.1 bars) effects and controls are intermediate between those described in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(7) of this section (for quantities between 100,000 and 250,000 pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) At blast overpressure of 1.7 psi (0.1 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 30W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (for quantities over 250,000 pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 10 percent of their replacement cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Occupants of exposed unstrengthened structures may suffer injury from secondary effects, such as building debris. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Aircraft landing and taking off could lose control and crash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Parked military and commercial aircraft, with minor damage due to blast, should remain airworthy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Depending largely upon the PES structure and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within, however, fragments and debris could cause injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Barricading at the PES or application of minimum fragment distance requirements may reduce injury or damage due to fragments from limited quantities of explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) At blast overpressure of 1.2&hyph;0.90 psi (0.08&hyph;0.06 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 40W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;50W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see column 5, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 5 percent of their replacement cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Personnel injuries are principally caused by glass breakage and building debris. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Depending largely upon the PES structure and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within, however, fragments and debris could cause injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Both orientation and limiting the surface area of exposed glass panels can reduce breakage and structural damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.43  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Permissible exposures to blast overpressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 12 psi (0.7 bars) occurring at 9W <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1/3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see column 3, Appendix B to Subpart F and Appendix C to Subpart F of this part), barricade required unless otherwise indicated (see &sect;184.42(c)(3)(vii)), the following facilities or operations are permitted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Buildings housing successive steps of a single production, renovation, or maintenance operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Breakrooms and change houses, if part of an operating line and used exclusively by personnel employed in operations of the line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Temporary holding areas for trucks or railcars containing explosives to service production or maintenance facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Field operations in magazine areas, when performing minor maintenance, preservation, packaging, or surveillance inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Taking health to heart - How much cholesterol is too much? Continuing a series on drug discoveries, Paul Abrahams explores the debate Until recently, cholesterol-lowering drugs were the fastest-growing sector in the pharmaceuticals industry. The market's expansion - 34.3 per cent a year for the last five years - was phenomenal even by drug industry standards. But cholesterol-lowering drugs have become dogged by controversy. Earlier this year a study in the British Medical Journal suggested that although patients taking these medicines may benefit from a fall in coronary heart disease mortality, they may also suffer an overall increase in mortality. The US market for cholesterol-lowering drugs is now flattening out, says Jonathan Tobert of the clinical research department of Merck, the world's largest drug company. According to industry analysts, the growth in the number of prescriptions in the US has slowed from 33 per cent last year to only 22 per cent this year. At stake is more than pharmaceuticals companies' earnings growth. Coronary heart disease is the developed world's biggest single killer. In the UK alone, as many as 300,000 people suffer a heart attack each year. Of these more than half die. In the US, 600,000 people die every year from coronary heart disease. There is little doubt of cholesterol's role in increasing the risk of heart disease and mortality. The question is whether cholesterol-lowering drugs are safe. Cholesterol, a natural lipid or fat, is almost insoluble. In order to move cholesterol around the body, the liver attaches it to protein molecules to create lipoproteins. These lipoproteins come in a number of different types, but the most important are high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). HDL carries cholesterol out of cells and is therefore known as 'good' cholesterol, while LDL carries cholesterol into cells and is associated with increased risk of heart disease. Perversely, too little cholesterol can be as dangerous as too much. William Sigmund, senior director of medical research at Warner-Lambert's pharmaceuticals division Parke-Davis, explains that too little HDL is a risk because less cholesterol is carried away to the liver for disposal. Conversely, too much LDL leads to cholesterol being deposited in cells that become trapped in blood vessels. Other cells then attach themselves and form scar-tissue. This tissue is capable of creating a blockage that prevents oxygen reaching the heart, a process known as atherosclerosis. The heart muscle then dies from lack of oxygen. Other risk factors implicated in heart disease include smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise and genetic traits. But cholesterol remains a prime target. Tobert explains that for every 1 per cent reduction in blood cholesterol levels there is a 2 per cent reduction in coronary events, such as heart attacks. The available treatments include: Bile acid sequestrants. These drugs bind to the bile acids in the gastro-intestinal tract and prevent them from being reabsorbed into the body. Since bile acids include cholesterol, the amount reabsorbed is reduced, leaving the liver to find cholesterol elsewhere in the body. Richard Stokvis, group product manager for Lescol at Sandoz, the Swiss drugs company, says these drugs can reduce blood cholesterol levels by between 15 and 20 per cent, but cause problematic gastro-intestinal side-effects. Fibrates. These limit production of very-low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the liver. Since VLDLs are precursors of LDLs, their reduction limits production of LDL. The most common drug in this class is Parke-Davis's Lopid. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins. These block the production of hydroxymethylglutary coenzyme A (HMG CoA), a key enzyme required for cholesterol synthesis in the liver and intestine. This is the latest and most effective class of drug, reducing LDL blood levels by up to 40 per cent. They also increase levels of HDL - good cholesterol - up to 15 per cent. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors include Merck's Mevacor and Zocor, and Pravachol, a drug developed by Sankyo of Japan and licensed to Bristol Myers Squibb in the US. For some, the case for pharmaceuticals appears proven. Even the drugs' critics would agree that they are essential for those who have already had heart attacks and therefore have a high risk of further attacks. Those of a certain age with abnormally high cholesterol levels because of their genetic make-up should also be treated. But it is unclear whether patients with high cholesterol levels who have not had heart attacks and have few or no other risk factors should use the drugs. Desirable levels of cholesterol are between 200 and 239 milligrams per decilitre in the US and between 5.2 and 6.2 millimoles per litre in the UK, according to the Family Heart Association, the British charity. The problem is that although the drugs reduce coronary heart disease mortality, they may increase mortality through other causes. Take an on-going study of Finnish businessmen. The trials have shown so far that of 2,051 people taking the drug only 16 died of coronary heart disease, compared with 28 of 2,030 in the control group. This suggests the drugs reduce heart disease-related mortality. However, 43 of those on the drugs died from other causes compared with only 27 in the control group. Overall, 59 of those on drugs have died, compared with 55 of those not taking them. The evidence is not conclusive. Although large numbers of patients are involved, the trials are small, with few mortality figures to evaluate. Sigmund at Parke Davis says immense studies would be required to find an answer. The critics contend that on the basis of available evidence it is difficult to justify the rapid expansion in the number of prescriptions issued by doctors for these drugs. Healthy people enter the doctor's surgery and leave as patients, possibly for life, even though they may not be ill. About 3.5m people in the US take cholesterol-lowering drugs. In an editorial last month in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association, Stephen Hulley, professor of epidemiology at the University of California, called for a change in the US government's cholesterol reduction policy. He asked for a reduction in universal cholesterol screening and in the use of drugs prescribed to healthy patients to prevent coronary heart disease. 'Until we know for sure that they have any benefit, we shouldn't be giving people drugs, especially when it involves decades of treatment for otherwise healthy people,' says Hulley. Tobert says that in the US about 40 per cent of patients presently on the drugs have coronary heart disease, while a further 40 per cent have other risk factors. He estimates that only 11 per cent of patients have high cholesterol but no diseases creating the symptoms. Scrip Reports, the market researchers, estimate that worldwide sales of cholesterol-lowering drugs would reach Dollars 3.8bn next year and Dollars 5bn by 1995. Merck should increase its sales of Mevacor, its best-selling hypolipaemic, from Dollars 1.1bn last year to Dollars 1.6bn next year, according to Mehta and Isalay, the New-York analysts. Although the overall market is slowing, sales of Merck's Zocor are growing as the drug takes market share away from older medicines, says Tobert. Large studies are required to resolve the drugs' overall efficacy and safety. Such a study, involving 20,000 patients, is being planned at the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford. The clinical trial service unit has been looking for money for two years. So far it has received only partial funding. Meanwhile, there are concerns that fears about the drugs' safety may put off doctors and patients from using them even when they are clearly beneficial. Anthony Keech, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the Radcliffe Infirmary's clinical trial service unit, explains: 'Most drugs carry some risk. You have to weigh up the benefits with the expected risk. Many people who ought to take these drugs just aren't being given them, particularly those who have sustained heart attacks or have congenitally high cholesterol levels.' The series will continue next month by looking at the latest methods of fighting infection.</p>

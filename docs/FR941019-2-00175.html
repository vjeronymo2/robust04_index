			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes the CBOE's proposal to ``bring up'' new at-the-money series of Q&hyph;CAPS every three months and/or after significant market movements is consistent with the Act because it will not result in a significant proliferation of options series. Finally, the Commission notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same margin requirements as CAPS. Due to the economic similarities of the two products and because the Commission has previously approved the margin rules applicable to CAPS, no new or unique regulatory concerns are raised by extending this margin treatment to Q&hyph;CAPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same position and exercise limit requirements that currently apply to CAPS. In particular, Q&hyph;CAPS on the SPX will be aggregated with SPX CAPS, SPX QIX options, and all other A.M. Settled SPX contracts, subject to a 45,000 contract limit under Rule 24.4(b), with a 25,000 contract limit for index arbitrage. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  Q&hyph;CAPS on the OEX, under Rule 24.4(c), will be aggregated with OEX CAPS, OEX QIX options, and all other A.M. Settled OEX contracts, subject to a 25,000 contract limitation, however, with no telescoping requirement. The Commission also finds that, consistent with the treatment of CAPS, it is appropriate to exclude Q&hyph;CAPS from exercise limit requirements because holders have no control over when their positions will be exercised, except on the last business day before expiration of the options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, CBOE Rule 24.4(b) states that no more than 25,000 contracts may be used for the purpose of taking advantage of any differential in price between the S&amp;P 500 Index and the securities underlying the S&amp;P 500. See also Amendment No. 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that Q&hyph;CAPS will have their exercise settlement value based upon the closing prices of component stocks on the last business day of the quarter. Although the Commission continues to believe that basing the settlement of index products on opening, as opposed to closing, prices on Expiration Fridays helps alleviate stock market volatility, <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  these concerns are reduced in the case of Q&hyph;CAPS, since expiration of these stock index options will not correspond to the normal expiration of stock index option, stock index futures and options on stock index futures. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31330 (October 16, 1992), 57 FR 48408. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In particular, Q&hyph;CAPS will never expire on an ``Expiration Friday'' or any other ``Expiration Fridays'' in March, June, September and December, thereby diminishing any impact that Q&hyph;CAPS could have on the market. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that Q&hyph;CAPS will not compromise the protection of investors or have an adverse market effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Amendment No. 1 addresses aggregation concerns with respect to P.M. Settled FLEX options by amending CBOE Rule 24A&hyph;7 to require aggregation of positions in P.M. Settled FLEX options with positions in Q&hyph;CAPS and QIXs based on the same index with the same expiration date. This amendment helps to prevent any resulting increase in position limits relating to P.M. Settled FLEX options and should help prevent an investor from using FLEX options for the purpose of avoiding the position limits applicable to QIXs and Q&hyph;CAPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment No. 2 states that Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same rules that currently govern CAPS regarding position and exercise limits and margin requirements. Additionally, the amendment provides that the listing of Q&hyph;CAPS with expirations greater than 12 months will require the filing of a rule proposal with the Commission, and approval of such filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 helps to clarify the rules and procedures applicable to the listing and trading Q&hyph;CAPS and contains only minor variations from the original proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment No. 3 explains that Q&hyph;CAPS, CAPS, QIXs and standard options positions on the S&amp;P 100 and 500, respectively, will be aggregated for determining position limit compliance. The Commission believes this amendment clarifies existing CBOE Rule 24.4 and helps to ensure that Q&hyph;CAPS comply with the existing position limit framework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment No. 4 incorporates the substance of Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 into the CBOE's Rule book. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe the amendment raises any new or unique regulatory concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

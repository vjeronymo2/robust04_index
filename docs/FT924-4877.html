			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Alexanders makes Pounds 1m write-downs ALEXANDERS Holdings, the car sales and leasing group, has revealed accountancy discrepancies which have led it to make write-downs of over Pounds 1m. Alexanders announced on Friday that Sharles, the group's auditors, had resigned two weeks ago and that Clark Whitehill has been appointed to the position. It is believed that an independent report by Clark Whitehill brought the discrepancies to light. These included premises which the Alexanders board said should have been valued at Pounds 370,000, which instead had a book value of Pounds 788,000. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 418,000 is to be made in the restated accounts for the year ended September 30 1991. A provision of Pounds 700,000 is also being made against its contract rental business, most of which relates to the period ended September 30 1990. Alexanders' shares, plunged 5p to 12p on Friday. The group, which is the main Ford dealer in Scotland, is controlled by the Clayton family which has over 50 per cent of the shares.</p>

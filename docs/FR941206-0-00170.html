			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases, the owner or operator of a facility in interim status at the time this rule becomes effective may not be able to implement the requirements of the rule before EPA (or an authorized state) issues the facility its RCRA permit. In this case, the EPA will generally incorporate the facility's implementation schedule into the permit, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 270.33, which allows schedules of compliance in RCRA permits. Consistent with this approach, 40 CFR 270.27(a)(7) requires permit applicants to submit their schedules of implementation with their permit applications, if the owner or operator cannot implement the requirements of this rule before permit issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the EPA develops new hazardous waste listings or characteristics in the future, new containers, tanks, and surface impoundments will become subject to subpart CC standards. For these units, the effective date of the standards will be the effective date of the new listing or characteristic. Owners or operators of these units must institute controls by that date. In cases when owners or operators cannot comply with the applicable requirements of the subpart CC standards by this date, they must install and operate required air emission control equipment no later than 30 months after the effective date provided that they prepare a implementation schedule (as described above) for this control equipment by the effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Reporting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final subpart CC standards in 40 CFR part 264 require a TSDF owner or operator to submit reports to the EPA only when circumstances occur at the facility resulting in noncompliance with certain provisions of the rule. There are no reporting requirements under 40 CFR 265 subpart CC for owners and operators of interim-status TSDF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each report required under the final subpart CC standards in 40 CFR part 264 is to be submitted to the EPA Regional office having jurisdiction for a particular TSDF location. The report is required to be signed and dated by an authorized representative of the facility owner or operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A TSDF owner or operator subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 264 subpart CC must report to the EPA all circumstances resulting in placement of a hazardous waste in a tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to the rule and not using air emission controls required by the rule when either of the following conditions occur: (1) The hazardous waste has a volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as determined on a mass-weighted average basis at the point of waste origination, or (2) the process used to treat the hazardous waste fails to meet the applicable conditions specified in the rule. The owner or operator must submit a written report within 15 calendar days of the time that the owner or operator becomes aware of the circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A TSDF owner or operator subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart CC and using a control device in accordance with the requirements of the rule is required to submit a semiannual written report to the EPA. This report is to describe each occurrence during the previous 6-month period when a control device is operated continuously for 24 hours or longer in noncompliance with the applicable operating values defined in 40 CFR 264.1035(c)(4) or when a flare is operated with visible emissions as defined in 40 CFR 264.1033(d). A TSDF owner or operator is not required to submit this report for a 6-month period during which all control devices at a facility subject to the subpart CC standards are operated by the owner or operator so that during no period of 24 hours or longer did a control device operate continuously in noncompliance with the applicable operating values defined in the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. TSDF Miscellaneous Unit Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA permits miscellaneous units at TSDF on a case-by-case basis with terms and provisions as needed to protect public health and the environment through generic performance standards specified in 40 CFR 264.601. Today's rule amends &sect;264.601 to include the air emission controls required by the standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC among the ``appropriate'' controls a permit writer may require for a miscellaneous unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of the air standards under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC to subpart X miscellaneous units will require determining which one of the waste management unit categories (e.g., tank, surface impoundment, container), if any, is most similar to the miscellaneous unit. As an example, hazardous waste is sometimes stored or treated in a miscellaneous unit consisting of a flexible, synthetic liner supported by an above ground metal frame (instead of a depression formed of earthen materials as is the case for a surface impoundment). Placing hazardous waste containing organics in this type of miscellaneous unit could result in significant organic emissions from the exposed waste surface comparable to those resulting from placing the waste in a similar size surface impoundment. Using the types of air emission controls applicable to surface impoundments (e.g., floating membrane cover) would reduce organic emissions from this type of miscellaneous unit. Therefore, in the case where the miscellaneous unit is determined to resemble a surface impoundment, a subpart X permit may be issued that includes air emission control requirements for surface impoundments under the subpart CC standards. The same application of the rule would be true for a miscellaneous unit used to manage organic-containing hazardous waste and determined to be similar to a tank or a container. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

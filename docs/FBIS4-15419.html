			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- "The committee for conventions on  chemical and biological weapons under the Russian president  agreed to the transportation and storage of poisonous substances  in a major populated area. That is why its chief Anatoliy  Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree." This was the  explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal "for a  single gross violation of duties" given by the head of state's  press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin  today.    Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich  had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons  and "it is difficult for a person to part from his child even if  the child is dangerous." For this reason, the president's press  secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of the  chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its  creation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma  Ying-jeou on Monday [23 May] hailed a group of investigators and  prosecutors in charge of unraveling the scandal surrounding the  March 1 elections for city and county council speakers and  deputy speakers, and encouraged them to continue playing an  active role in preventing a similar occurrence in upcoming local  elections.    "History will make it known that we're the terminators of  graft and vote bribery," Ma said in a speech to the group.    As of Sunday, 398 suspects, including 13 speakers, nine  deputy speakers, and 184 councilors -- a third of all sitting  councilors -- had been charged for either buying votes or  accepting bribes in the elections for speakers and deputy  speakers of the 23 county and city councils.    The ruling Kuomintang won all speaker and deputy speaker  seats.    Ma asked the group to keep rooting out corruption to make  sure the June and July elections for village and township chiefs  will be clean.    Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office in the central city of  Taichung charged Councilors Chen Jen-hsun, Chen Jui-teh and Ho  Wen-hai with accepting bribes worth between NT$7 million and  NT$7.4 million (US$261,200-US$276,120) from Speaker Kuo  Yen-sheng in exchange for their votes in the March 1 election.    The prosecutor recommended 30 months in jail for the three  defendants if they are found guilty.    Twenty-nine people have now been charged with graft  surrounding the Taichung City Council election.</p>

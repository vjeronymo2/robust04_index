			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Errors and omissions WE APOLOGISE to four schools mistakenly omitted from our table. These were Dr Challoner's High in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, which achieved an FT score of 1.12 and a rank position of around 272nd; Jewish Free School in Camden, London, a comprehensive which opted out this September, with an FT score of 1.05 which placed it around 378th; Southend High School for Boys, a grammar school with an FT score of 1.01, placing it around 430th; and The Emmbrook School, a comprehensive in Wokingham, Berkshire, with an FT score of 0.91, placing it around 598th. Questionnaires were sent to the 1,100 top performing state schools according to last year's government statistics. State schools which did not co-operate with us would therefore not have appeared although we hope that they will change their minds next year. However, this meant that a few schools with sharply improved performance were omitted. These included the Weald of Kent Grammar School, in Tonbridge, which last year only managed 11 UCAS points per pupil. This year it scored 18, which would give an FT score of 1.08, placing it around 318th. The questionnaire for Lady Margaret School, in Parson's Green, London, appears to have gone astray and the school did not appear in the FT list but it scored the highest GCSE pass rate for any state school in inner London. On fees, the annual boarding cost for UK students at Carmel College in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, is Pounds 12,450. The fee of Pounds 16,410 given in our table is for foreign students. A mistake in the other direction incorrectly put New College, Cardiff, at the top of our 'value for money' table. In fact it should not even have appeared in the top ten, and the best value school by our rough criteria was St Gerards, Bangor. No school featured in the survey has raised any query about the exam results printed.</p>

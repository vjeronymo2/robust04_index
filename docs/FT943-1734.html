			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Belgium mulls DM1bn offering The Kingdom of Belgium is thought to be close to launching a DM1bn eurobond offering but is undecided whether to go for a floating-rate or fixed-rate structure. Some banks are advising Belgium that an issue of floating-rate notes (FRNs) would get a better reception from investors in the light of current market conditions. They also say an issue of FRNs would be cheaper. However, other banks believe that Belgium would be wiser to opt for a fixed-rate offering so as not to collide with the Bundesbank's issue of 10-year floating-rate bunds which is scheduled for next week. If Belgium chooses to do an FRN offering, the most likely maturity would be between five and seven years, syndicate managers said. They expect a discount margin of around five basis points over Libor which would produce a coupon of Libor flat. With respect to the likely pricing of a fixed-rate offering, syndicate managers said Belgium would have to offer a yield spread of between 20 to 25 basis points over bunds for a five-year issue and a spread in the low 30s for a 10-year issue. Belgium is expected to make a decision today but the issue is not likely to emerge until next week. Another issue in the pipeline is a debut Hungarian forint offering from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) which will be offered to domestic and foreign investors. Mr John Borthwick, principal financial officer, said the IFC put in place a Ft5bn medium-term note programme this week, arranged by CS First Boston. The IFC plans to use the programme to fund back-to-back loans to its clients in Hungary. Mr Borthwick said it would be the first time the IFC made loans to its clients in their local currency. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Hungary is seeking to raise FFr1bn through an offering of eurobonds with a maturity of six to eight years. The issue, via Credit Lyonnais, is expected to be priced to yield around 235 basis points over French government bonds. Sterling-denominated issues dominated yesterday's offerings, with the Japanese City of Kobe raising Pounds 200m through a 10-year offering. Syndicate managers said the pricing of 40 basis points over 10-year UK government bonds was fair but that investor demand for that maturity was low. Nestle Holdings took advantage of the arbitrage opportunities at the shorter end of the curve, raising Pounds 75m through an offering of three-year eurobonds.</p>

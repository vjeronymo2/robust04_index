			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / US bonds fall on inflation worries Long-term US interest rates rose to their highest levels for almost two years yesterday as Wall Street expressed its disappointment that the Federal Reserve had decided not to tighten monetary policy. After last Friday's stronger-than-expected April employment report had deepened concern on Wall Street that the US economy was growing too fast, bond market investors were hoping the Fed would raise interest rates to prevent a revival of inflation. However, when the Fed failed to signal a rate increase during the morning, bond prices quickly fell. In late trading in New York, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond was down almost a full point, and its yield - the best measure of long-term interest rates - had risen to 7.62 per cent, its highest level since mid-1992. The rise in bond yields upset the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 40.46 at 3,629.04. The European government bond markets opened on a weak note in response to the decline in the US Treasury market on Friday afternoon, and spent most of the day 'Fed-watching', as did the foreign exchanges. With the Fed holding a Dollars 29bn (Pounds 19.8bn) quarterly refunding auction over the next two days, there were expectations that it would lift rates. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of global currency research at J P Morgan in London, suggested that without such a move 'they will be faced with a falling bond market and a collapsing currency, and that will not induce foreigners to participate in the auction'. In these circumstances, Mr Persaud predicted that the dollar would fall to the levels at which central banks were forced last week to intervene. Figures released in Japan yesterday gave encouragement to the dollar. The unadjusted current account surplus for March fell 16.1 per cent to Dollars 15.76bn from Dollars 18.79bn a year earlier. Figures also released revealed a long-term capital surplus of Dollars 21.92bn in March, the highest on record. This was the result of Japanese companies selling US and European bonds before the March financial year-end, and foreign buying of Japanese stocks. Mr Persaud said the figures, which explain the strength of the yen, were a one-off. World stocks, Page 35 International capital markets, Page 27</p>

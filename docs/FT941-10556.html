			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / BT and Mercury under attack: Competition will hot up with the launch of another telecoms network The most significant telecommunications announcement yesterday was not BT's price cuts, long trailed and necessitated by an agreement with the regulator. It was the launch of a telecoms network in the City of London by MFS, the largest national provider of urban networks competing with the local Bell telephone companies in the US. The entry of MFS into the UK will greatly intensify competition in the business telecommunications market, with ramifications far beyond. MFS operates fibre networks in 14 US cities, including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It provides 'last-mile' connections for large urban users, allowing them to link up to long-distance networks without going through the local Bell companies. Nynex, the Bell company covering New York, estimates that it has lost about 40 per cent of its private-line traffic - mostly from Wall Street and the business sector - to 'competitive access providers' including MFS. MFS timed its launch to coincide with BT's price cuts, claiming that even after them it would offer City companies large savings on their telecoms bills. It will levy no rental fee or connection charge, and has only four charge bands, all highly competitive with BT and Mercury prices. But users must have an annual telecoms bill of at least Pounds 600 per line, limiting the likely take-up to large corporate customers. MFS's competition is as much Mercury as BT, an indication of the pressure being exerted on the BT/Mercury duopoly, formally abolished in 1991 but still largely intact. Mercury is estimated to have about two-thirds of the City's outgoing long-distance traffic. With the entry of MFS the City becomes one of the world's most competitive telecommunications markets. In addition to BT and Mercury at least four companies - Worldcom, Sprint, ACC, and Esprit - are reselling long-distance and/or international lines leased from BT and Mercury. Worldcom, subsidiary of a large US operator, is making particularly fast progress. It has more than 300 UK customers, most in the City, reselling international lines to them. Mercury's position in the long-distance market will come under further assault later this year from Energis, the subsidiary of National Grid erecting a national network on electricity pylons. Like Mercury, Energis will reach customers in three ways: by direct connections, by indirect access through BT or other local operators, or by leased lines. Meanwhile, Colt, another US-owned company, is building a local network in the City and plans to offer a public service, connecting to the public network, from mid-March.

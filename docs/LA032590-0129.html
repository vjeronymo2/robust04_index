			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PHILOSOPHY OF DOG &amp; MAN  </P> <P> by GARY SOTO  </P> <P> Stray dogs come with the rain,  </P> <P> Two hours before the garbage men  </P> <P> And their elephant noise of truck  </P> <P> Crushing eggshell and tuna can,  </P> <P> Light bulbs with their bleak rattle.  </P> <P> Or so I hear.  </P> <P> I struggle into slippers,  </P> <P> Part the curtain: a tall dog,  </P> <P> Paws up on the heap, is  </P> <P> Working on a sour casserole,  </P> <P> The noodles marching into his mouth,  </P> <P> And a moist nose sniffing  </P> <P> For chicken bone and week-old stew,  </P> <P> For pie tins with buttery crust.  </P> <P> I've never seen happiness  </P> <P> Over a bone with little meat,  </P> <P> Happiness in rain. This  </P> <P> Is what I want, to be up before light,  </P> <P> To be in rain with garbage men  </P> <P> On the back porch, I snap  </P> <P> A finger, call 'Here boy,'  </P> <P> And the dog throws down its ears,  </P> <P> Ashamed to be caught eating.  </P> <P> I show him the pink emptiness of my palm,  </P> <P> But what am I to him? He doesn't know me.  </P> <P> I'm a man in a robe, not a friend  </P> <P> Of green alleys and poor days,  </P> <P> A man in slippers clomping  </P> <P> Pathetically down wet stairs.  </P> <P> Hurried love trots away on three legs,  </P> <P> The hurt paw touching ground  </P> <P> Only when he looks back.  </P> <P> From "Who Will Know Us?: New Poems by Gary Soto" (Chronicle Books: $8.95; 69  pp.). 1990, reprinted by permission of publisher. Soto, the author of five  poetry collections, won the Before Columbus 1985 American Book Award for his  prose memoir, "Living up the Street." He teaches at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> </P></p>

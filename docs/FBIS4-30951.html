			<p>BFN     [Text] An Indian army delegation led by Defense Minister  Mallikarjun arrived in Slovakia today on a three-day official  visit. Here is our colleague Miroslav Milar with more  information on the visit of the Indian guests.    [Milar] The official welcoming ceremony took place at the  Defense Ministry shortly after 1500. Slovak Defense Minister  Pavol Kanis welcomed his Indian counterpart. Shortly  afterwards, the Indian army delegation took part in the first  round of talks with the representatives of the Slovak Defense  Ministry and military command. Pavol Kanis briefed journalists  about the agenda of the talks.    [Begin Kanis recording] Our negotiations focused mainly on  the possibilities of cooperation in armaments production and on  contracts relating to the sale of Slovak arms and armaments  systems to India. It must be said that the Slovak Republic is  continuing in the tradition of all the positive contacts we have  had in the past, i.e., the contacts between the former  Czechoslovakia and India. The Indian Defense Ministry and  representatives of the Indian Army are seriously interested in  contracts with Slovak armaments producers. We exchanged views on  some areas in which India might be interested, for example spare  parts and other products, but definitive steps will be taken in  the next few days. [end recording]    [Milar] After the talks at the Defense Ministry, Indian  Defense Minister Mallikarjun was received by Slovak President  Michal Kovac and afterwards by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan.</p>

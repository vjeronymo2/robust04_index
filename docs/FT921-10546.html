			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hill Samuel to sell Australian stake Hill Samuel, the merchant banking and investment arm of the TSB, is to sell a 15 per cent stake of non-voting shares in McQuarrie Bank, a leading Australian merchant bank. No purchaser has yet been identified but Hill Samuel, which had full control of McQuarrie until 1985, expects to complete the deal by the year end. The sale will leave Hill Samuel with a 15 per cent stake of voting shares in McQuarrie. Hill Samuel is shedding the non-voting shares to comply with a pledge it made in 1985 to the Australian banking authorities to reduce its stake in McQuarrie by the end of 1992.</p>

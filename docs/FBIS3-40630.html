			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Krishna Dutt Paliwal: "Was Gandhi's Swadeshi </F> Movement a Mistake?"]    [Text] One feels very depressed seeing our independence and  swadeshi campaign at risk. If we look back at the decisions made  during the last two years, we feel these to be very painful. We  are beating the drum of progress and development by inviting  multi-national companies here. India's modern history where the  East India Company started the loot-oriented trade and made us  slaves is not yet forgotten. Nor is how the British destroyed  Indian crafts, arts, trade, and industry, and made this country  depend on agriculture. Nor how the British loaded away raw  materials and took over our markets. Now, we are opening our  markets to the foreigners and are talking about progress. Were  the decisions we had made during the earlier awakening of Indian  society, and the swadesh movement on which our freedom campaign  was depended, illogical, anti-national, and wrong? Can we  determine a new direction and avoid our experience? The Indian  campaigns of nineteenth-twentieth century were against  imperialism, colonialism, neo-feudalism, capitalism, and  westernization. We never felt worried and threatened at that  time as we are now.    The main goal of our swadeshi campaign and boycott campaign  was to gain independence. We wanted to be free in thinking,  working, and in all spheres of life and wanted to reinstall  those moral values that the British were destroying. The main  call of awareness of these campaigns was to get rid of mental  slavery and join the creative and independent currents. However,  we forgot our promises after the independence during the Nehru  era. The storms of westernized modernism labeled the Indian life  style backward. All the blocks that dulled the Indian thought  such as learning English, westernized education, universities  organized on foreign models, desire for consumer culture, and  neglect of Indian philosophy endangered the feeling of being  Indian. Our independent thinking, which had been blocked for 200  years, became more helpless after independence. The burden of  the slaverish dependence on English increased for Hindi and  other Indian languages. Every area of Indian creativity was  operated upon, and its nerves were severed. No embarrassment was  felt when our country was made a mimic of the West. The Nehru  era continued to show us the dream that if we became  industrialized like the West and expanded our development  mechanism, all our caste-related problems would be resolved. Not  only this, even India's left-wing politicians supported this  economic model. However, the hollowness of this model was  evident after 1970. This economic model made a few leaders,  officials, and industrialists rich overnight, and tied the  majority of our society in the knot of poverty.    It is difficult to estimate what price the Indian people  have  had to pay for it. The whole society reeks of stagnation. The  philosophy of existence emerged in the area of creativity, and  the Indian face of self-reproachment was formed. The average  man, who had dreamed about happiness after independence, was  covered with the thick sheet of disillusion. We learned that the  assurance of self-respect we had earned during the independence  movement was disappearing in darkness. The plans for development  and progress became brutal and our villages were destroyed.  Blind industrialization and the demonic structure of the  mechanical age deprived Indian life of its natural atmosphere  and tied the foreign blindfold on the eyes of Indian cultural  values. All our cultural and religious symbols were seen to be  useless and helped only the regressive kind of thought. The  broad trust we had developed in creativity and thinking, despite  our poverty, during the independence struggle was strangled by  the westernized modern beliefs. The extraordinary era of  creativity and thinking led by Dadabhai Nauroji, Tilak, Bipin  Chander Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Arvind, Vivekananda, Gandhi,  Ravinder Nath, Jai Shankar Prasad, Lohia, and Narender Dev is  neglected now. The whole system got engrossed in the illusion of  inhuman, barren, and parodoxical pandemonium of modernism. In  Hindi literature, Bhartendu who had started the new literature  and started the swadeshi movement, Mahavir Prasad Divavedi, Prem  Chand, Ram Chander Shukla, Maithilisharan Gupta, Makhan Lal  Chaturvedi, and Nirala who had followed him could not even  imagine how the swadeshi movement would be destroyed on such a  large scale under an organized plan after the independence. Our  builders worked hard sacrificing their body, soul, and property  for nationalism and worship to get rid of western slavery. They  never once thought that their whole work could be ground to dust  after independence. We remember a line from Jaya Shankar  Prasad's KAMAYNI over this tragedy, "All the invaluable stars  were decomposed in the dark gale." The situation is now that  "this crazy society is running around in the dark." In our  craziness, we had insulted Gandhi so much that he was ready to  let a foreign company take over the job of making salt in Gujrat.    The crocodiles of international economic organizations and  multi-national companies have surrounded us to devour India's  swadeshi movement. Our government, in the name of economic  liberalization and foreign investments, is conspiring to invite  those notorious foreign companies that have been causing havoc  by exploiting poor nations. The mask from the face of a  government that chants the mantra of progress through  development plans with foreign loans and economic slavery is  easily lifted; it cannot be self-dependent and proud. "My great  India" is not eager to accept the slavery of economic  imperialism and be their agent, but is mentally preparing  itself. The conspiracy to expand the open plan of looting by  inviting the multi-national companies is being hatched.    The fact is that under the pressure of U.S. multi-national  companies, natural seeds from all over the world are being  researched and developed using biotechnology and "new artificial  seeds" are being created and forced on all developing countries.  U.S. companies have developed such seeds and they want markets  for it. These markets are poor nations such as India where the  swadeshi movement led by Nauroji, Tilak, and Gandhi has lost its  direction. The United States imposes the right of intellectual  property and India bows down. The life of these artificial seeds  is not more than three or four years and after three or four  years, they become useless. Thus, the farmers cannot make their  own seeds. Obviously, these foreign companies want to control  India's agricultural system, and we are raising the slogan of  "Great India!" The greatest challenge we have now is to analyze  this tragedy happening to our country, our language, our pride.  We should think about Bhartendu's desire for India to understand  itself and think about what kind of India are we making. Was our  Indian pride in the struggle for independence a deception? Do  not we love our nation now? What is the use of prosperity that  depends on begging? Indian poet Rahim had said that begging  makes even the greatest person inferior. Even Lord Narayan had  to become a dwarf in one incarnation because of begging. Our  repeated contemplation makes us hear one thing: Begging, be it  by a person or a nation, makes one low and destroys one's  self-respect. It distorts one's racial and cultural identity.  This international begging is not appropriate just to make India  modern.    Those who have the responsibility of protecting the esteem  of  even the most common person in the country should learn  something from the proud tradition of India's freedom struggle.  They should get out of the political chaos for a while and try  to understand the thoughts of Tilak, Gandhi, and Ravinder Nath.  They will learn that the 20th century began with the swadeshi  movement in India. This movement strengthened India's  independence campaign, and sowed the seeds of patriotism, unity,  and sacrifice in the people in villages and cities. This  movement also strengthened socialist movements. It was not just  a political movement; it was a resolution to free the nation  from economic and cultural imperialism in the areas of  literature, art, philosophy, music, science, and industry. This  movement awakened us with the call to boycott cloth from  Manchester and salt from Liverpool. This movement also raised  the slogan to boycott foreign goods. It was this movement for  which Tilak, Bhagat Singh, and Lala Lajpat Rai sacrificed their  lives. Gokhale and Arvind Ghosh also took softer steps. The  women in enslaved India stopped using foreign-made bangles  because of this movement. Even holy men stopped using foreign  sugar for worship offerings. This movement spread much political  awareness and created thousands of patriotic songs resulting in  the shake- up of British imperialism. This movement helped open  training centers for domestic industry.    Living during that period of wave must have been unique. The  swadeshi movement had spread with the support of Indian  festivals, auspicious days, traditions, fairs, folk music, and  folk drama. The swadeshi movement had spread in every village in  Bengal through the folk play tours. It was the first time that  modern political thought had explained to the people the meaning  of patriotic awakening. The swadeshi movement grew with  self-dependence and inner strength, and sparkled as national  pride. Ravinder Nath Tagore, Arvind, Avninder Nath and Nand Lal  Bose got their inspiration from the swadeshi movement and blew  the conch shell calling for cultural awakening. They taught the  lessons of nationalism. independence, and united political  struggle that revitalized Indian life. Today, we are trying to  prove that this whole lesson was wrong!</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> TERM LIMITS RESCINDED  </P> <P> The City Council has reversed its decision to limit city commissioners to four  consecutive two-year terms.  </P> <P> The council Tuesday rescinded the limits, imposed earlier this month, after  members could not agree on how to implement them.  </P> <P> At issue was when the clock should start running for commissioners now serving.  After two motions on the subject died for lack of seconds, Councilman Patrick  Froehle moved to repeal the limits altogether. Councilwoman Mary Manning  seconded the motion, and because there was no objection, Mayor Thomas Breazeal  ordered the limits rescinded.  </P></p>

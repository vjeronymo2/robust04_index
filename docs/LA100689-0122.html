			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Three Charged in Penny Stock Fraud: Three men were accused of bilking investors  of more than $10 million, U.S. Atty. Samuel A. Alito Jr. charged in a case he  said was the first to name a penny stock brokerage as a racketeering  enterprise. The men manipulated the prices of six companies by issuing bogus  research reports and bribing fund managers to invest in them, and profited by  secretly trading in the stock, according to an indictment returned in Newark,  N.J. Indicted were New York-based Monarch Funding Corp.'s president and owner,  Leo M. Eisenberg, 68, of Woodmere, N.Y.; Newark-based financial consultant  Richard O. Bertoli, 56, of Rye, N.Y., and Richard S. Cannistraro, who pleaded  guilty to related charges in 1987. Cannistraro was an analyst at Woody Gundy  Inc.  </P></p>

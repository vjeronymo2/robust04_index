			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Christoph Bertram: "Upon a Thread"] </F>   [Text] Not to get bogged down in the "mire of the Balkans"  -- this has been the West's motto ever since the beginning of  the war in the former Yugoslavia. This is why there was no  early military intervention that would probably have prevented  the war; this is why the West has deceived itself believing that  it had met its international responsibility with its  "humanitarian aid" for those who were threatened by guns and  displaced with bayonets; this is also why the UN Security  Council has churned out resolutions by the dozen, resolutions  that sounded but were hardly meant seriously as far as their  potential effect was concerned.    Yet, instead of keeping firm ground under its feet, the  international organization and the West were more and more drawn  into the mire as a result of their half-hearted actions; they  were made to pay for earlier mistakes. When, last weekend, the  Muslim enclave Gorazde threatened to fall into the hands of its  besiegers, the Bosnian Serbs, after 10 days of fighting, NATO  for the first time in its history intervened in a ground war  with combat aircraft. And the U.S. President, the secretary  generals of the United Nations and NATO declared in unison that  the Serbs would have to expect further strikes of this kind if  they continued their bombings -- not only in Gorazde, but also  the other ruined cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina declared as "safe  heavens" by the United Nations, which have long since become  huge refugee camps.    He who has got stuck in the mire no longer has a choice.  Therefore, there is no alternative to the air strikes against  the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde and, unless they stop, to  further such actions. After all, the fall of Gorazde would not  only have surrendered 65,000 Muslim refugees to "ethnic  cleansing." It would also have led to the collapse of the  ingenious structure of negotiations and compromise opportunities  that the United Nations, the United States, and Russia as  negotiators, in particular, have been trying to put together for  two months.    Yet -- and this also makes up the tragedy of the belated  action -- the military operation necessary for the success of  the negotiations, has, at the same time, threatened to thwart  these chances. It has instigated the Serbs, although being  tired of the war, to act defiantly. It encourages the Bosniaks  to continue to pursue the war option. And it has irritated the  Russians: Boris Yeltsin was not even informed let alone  consulted about the UN punitive action in advance.    So what is to be done to prevent the chances for peace,  which  opened thanks to the NATO ultimatum for Sarajevo in February, to  be now spoiled again by the NATO bombing for Gorazde?    One thing is that Russia must not only be involved in the  strategy of the negotiations, but even into that of military  pressure. True, the Russian representative in the UN Security  Council almost one year ago agreed to the resolutions on which  the United Nations and NATO can base their action. Yet, Russia  has now become indispensable for the success of the negotiations  in the Balkans. The government in Moscow wants to be taken  seriously, which means that it wants to be a partner with equal  rights in the UN team. Otherwise, what the supreme war criminal  in the Balkans, Serb President Milosevic, is obviously  speculating, might really happen: that Moscow becomes a stooge  for Serbian interests.    The other thing is: Should the negotiations in the Balkans  be promoted, then military sanctions would have to be  predictable for the addressee, which, for too long, they were  not. On the contrary, the actions of Western fighter bombers at  Gorazde could have probably been prevented had the UN  authorities in Bosnia and the U.S. Government in Washington not  initially conveyed the impression to the Bosnian Serbs that the  city had virtually been awarded to them.    The conditions for the military intervention have now  finally  been unequivocally defined. Had they been as unambiguous  before, the chances for peace would not hang upon a thread  today. After all, it remains the only rope by which the West  can pull itself out of the mire in the Balkans again.</p>

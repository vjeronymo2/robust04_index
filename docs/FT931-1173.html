			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Searching worldwide to cure angst: Management changes at the top of loss-making UK bank Wanted: senior manager of a bank or financial services company who has achieved sweeping change in established enterprise. To take over a loss-making UK bank in state of internal angst. Must work well with recently-appointed management team, none of whom is being considered for the post. 'I would like to do it as quickly as we can, but it is not going to be that easy. There are not that many candidates,' says Sir Denys Henderson, the non-executive director of Barclays who is leading the effort to find a new chief executive. If anything, that is an understatement. The first effect of Barclays' decision to look outside for a new chief executive to serve under its chairman, Mr Andrew Buxton, emerged yesterday. A day after it had announced the start of a worldwide search, it disclosed the resignation of Mr Peter Wood, its well-regarded finance director. Mr Wood, who earlier this month sat alongside Mr Buxton to explain a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss for 1992, has been talking to Standard Chartered since January. But the move from Britain's largest bank to a smaller - and traditionally more troubled - one would hardly be natural under other circumstances. Sir Denys says the bank has 'some very competent' people at the top. But the decision to look outside sends a signal to the heads of Barclays' three divisions. These are the huge banking division, which has Pounds 98bn of the bank's Pounds 149bn assets, the BZW investment bank, and service businesses. Barclays devised this structure of responsibility in 1991 to balance its tradition of having a single chairman and chief executive. At the same time, it appointed Sir Peter Middleton as both deputy chairman of the bank and chairman of the BZW division to offer advice to Mr Buxton. Two immediate tasks face the new chief executive. One is to avoid alienating the other senior executives: Sir Peter, Mr Alastair Robinson of the banking division, Mr David Band of BZW, and Mr Joseph De Feo of service businesses. The second is to find a role in the middle of the structure. Morale in the bank is already stretched. One senior manager says one of his main tasks is to buoy the spirits of the managers under him. 'We're not exactly in a battle at the moment because we're not doing any shooting. It's everyone else who is shooting at us,' he says. Carving out a role may be just as hard. Mr Buxton says he wants to hand over 'a significant part' of his job. But this risks two strains: one between him and Sir Peter as he takes on wider overview of policy, and another between the new chief executive and Mr Robinson. Then there is Barclays' culture. The bank's creation from family-run regional banks 96 years ago has given it a tendency to look inwards. Some investors also believe that because four of its 11 non-executive directors have served for more than six years the board may not be sufficiently independent from management. Sir Denys believes the successful candidate will probably come from a bank or a financial services company. 'If some genius appears who had done a good job elsewhere, and could cope with the change of industry, then we would consider him,' he says. In the search for someone familiar with the difficulties, it could look to a direct competitor. When Midland was seeking a successor to Sir Kit McMahon as chief executive in 1991, it chose Mr Brian Pearse, Barclays' finance director. Mr Pearse is perceived as having done well at Midland. Several names are talked about. National Westminster's head of US operations, Mr John Tugwell, and head of credit risk Mr John Melbourn; Standard Chartered's chief executive Mr Malcolm Williamson; the TSB Group's chief executive Mr Peter Ellwood; or Midland's Mr Pearse if he was persuaded to return. Appointing someone from a competitor would carry a risk of offending the remaining senior managers. That might make it tempting to bring in the senior manager of a large US bank that has already recovered from similar difficulties with property-related lending. One American banker argues that a US manager would face two problems coming to a British bank. One is the difficulty of convincing British managers of the need for change. 'US banks have been under pressure for longer, and have driven out more of the old ways of doing business by now,' he says. The second problem is that Barclays is more diversified than even a US bank such as Citibank. It has a large securities business in BZW, and a national branch network. A better fit might be a manager of a Canadian bank with a national network. This has not precluded recruitment of several Americans by British banks. NatWest acquired its chief financial officer, Mr Richard Goeltz, from Seagram last year, while Midland took on the management consultant Mr Gene Lockhart in 1987. But to be chief executive of a British bank needs broad expertise. The 1980s' fashion for banks recruiting retailers to reform branches and marketing has been curtailed by renewed emphasis on improving risk management. All in all, Sir Denys' caution about recruiting an ideal candidate quickly to soothe the troubles of Barclays appears to be prudent.</p>

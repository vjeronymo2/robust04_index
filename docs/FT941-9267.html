			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Russia and Britain 'de-target' nuclear missiles Russia and Britain yesterday signed an agreement to 'de-target' nuclear missiles directed at their respective countries as part of a series of measures to strengthen bilateral relations, writes Philip Stephens. With Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, claiming that ties between London and Moscow were now better than he could ever recall, he also agreed with President Boris Yeltsin that the Russian leader would visit London later this year. After talks at the Kremlin, the two leaders signed a double taxation agreement designed to promote British investment in Russia and a framework accord to provide for joint military exercises next year. Those agreements will be followed up today by the announcement of increased British technical aid for Russia's economic modernisation programme when Mr Major visits Nizhny Novgorod, the province at the forefront of the shift to a market economy. British officials voiced optimism that the enhanced co-operation resulting from the visit could lead to the early signature of a number of large contracts by UK companies.</p>

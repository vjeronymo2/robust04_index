			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn shares hit 52-week low on earnings warning SHARES in Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group, tumbled to a 52-week low yesterday after the company warned that second-quarter earnings would not exceed last year's. The damage done by the Halcion sleeping pill controversy was partly to blame. In the 1991 second quarter, Upjohn had net earnings of Dollars 124.4m, or 70 cents a primary share, on sales of Dollars 859.4m, compared with income of Dollars 111m, or 62 cents, on sales of Dollars 751.7m in the same period of 1990. Upjohn is offering voluntary early retirement to about 1,100 employees, taking charges against earnings in the third quarter. On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 in heavy trading. The stock, which has been subject to merger rumours in recent months, was quoted above Dollars 47 before concern about possible side-effects of the world's fastest-selling sleeping pill exploded into an international debate over the drug's safety late last year. Although Halcion will probably remain on the market in the US, it has been banned in the UK and the negative publicity has cut sharply into sales. These dropped 39 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Last year, Halcion brought in Dollars 237m of Upjohn's Dollars 3.4bn in sales. Upjohn's troubles, however, run deeper than the problems surrounding Halcion. Mr Theodore Cooper, chairman, said Upjohn's weak second-quarter outlook also reflected softness in the company's US prescription pharmaceutical business. a The company said a move by pharmaceutical wholesalers to keep fewer inventories on hand was an industry-wide problem. Upjohn's agricultural businesses has also been hurt by the recession and drought. Mr Cooper does expect earnings and sales gains for the whole of 1992. The warning and the job cuts come on the heels of an announcement of a temporary freeze on hirings and salary increases earlier this month. Analysts have been concerned about Upjohn's prospects for many months, citing the lack of new drugs in the company's pipeline and the number of important drugs losing their patents by the end of 1994. These include Halcion and the Xanax tranquilliser. Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said: 'Upjohn faces a bleaker and bleaker future. It will lose at least half its sales and the equivalent in profits when its products of off-patent." Although Upjohn expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve as many as six new product or product line extensions this year, Mr Isaly does not believe these drugs are big enough to compensate for the drugs coming off-patent.</p>

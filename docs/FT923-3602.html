			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Iran opens rift with Arabs over islands AN OPEN row has broken out between Iran and the six Arab members of the Gulf Co-operation Council over the control of three islands near the mouth of the Gulf. Iran repeated yesterday its claim of sovereignty over Abu Musa, together with the Great Tumb and Lesser Tumb Islands. The statement from Tehran came in response to an earlier communique from the GCC states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar) deploring what they described as the 'virtual annexation' by Iran of the islands. Since 1971 Abu Musa has been jointly administered by Iran and Sharjah, part of the UAE. However, earlier this year Iran began pressing expatriates employed by the UAE to leave the islands and increasing the number of its own nationals. Last month Iran turned back a ship carrying passengers from the UAE. Iran added yesterday that 'residents of Abu Musa holding Sharjah citizenship can continue their life there with their Iranian brothers and sisters.' Diplomats were at loss to explain Iran's provocative action at a time when it was generally improving relations with the other Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia, and promoting a more pragmatic image around the world. The renewed claim to Abu Musa may in part reflect Iran's eagerness to exploit the relative weakness of the Arabs in the Gulf in the wake of Iraq's defeat. It could also be designed to test the US which now dominates the region militarily. Iran has deplored the increased US presence in the region, but will probably be looking to take political advantage of the allied air exclusion zone over southern Iraq by aiding the Shia population. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has moved additional forces to the border to deter infiltration.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Naydyonov, doctor of economic sciences, </F> professor: "The Exchange Rate and Inflation"]    [Text] Inflation is the greatest social evil affecting  Ukraine. It is ruining production and reducing the working  population to poverty, while concentrating wealth in the hands  of speculators, usurers, and swindlers. nflation is an economic  mechanism of the mass plunder of the people and the primary  accumulation of capital.    Recall, for example, how state enterprises were prohibited  from establishing commercial banks under the guise of  restricting commercial activity and were even forced to take out  their shares after the banks had increased their starting  capital many times over. And so they threw the pike into the  river! No longer regulated, banks are growing rich on the  usurious accumulation of capital. Every time that the need for  regulating prices arises, the regulatory documents begin with  provisions that benefit "liberalization." This is why the  decrees on prices issued by the Cabinet of Ministers in December  1992 and in December 1993 led to sharp price rises.    The banks and middleman dealers are making a fortune on  inflation. As a result, they are pressing hard for the removal  of anti-inflationary measures. The government is being subjected  to harsh attacks in the mass media.    The state is being reviled most harshly for regulating the  currency exchange rate and instituting foreign trade controls.  Any attempt to curb the all-permissive activity in this sphere  is labelled as "antimarket." Despite the fact that both these  forms of state regulation are applied now, and have been applied  in the past, by many countries with market economies.    Regulating the exchange rate of the national currency and  foreign trade has a significant effect on the dynamics of  domestic prices. The starting proportions for exchange of the  currencies of different countries depends on the relations  between the prices of goods that arrive as imports. Basically,  the currency exchange rate should be such as to leave the seller  indifferent in which currency he is paid for his goods. Thus, if  the market price of a metric ton of oil is 100 dollars in one  country and 10,000 rubles in another, the rate of exchange will  be 100 rubles to the dollar. On the average, this ratio should  be in effect for all goods. If you take the average correlation  between U.S. and Ukrainian prices for a selection of 140 goods,  the exchange rate (according to data for January 1993) should e  254 karbovantsi to the dollar. This is the real base proportion.  Then why is the actual karbovanets exchange rate much lower: at  the end of March, 40,000 karbovantsi to the dollar at banks and  43,000 on the black market? Because there is a growing,  market-driven demand for the dollar.    Market business fluctuations are natural in a normal  situation and do not deviate very far from price parity. Central  banks and states can do away with undesirable disparities by  means of currency invervention, interest rates, and other  economic measures. But if the market rate deviates very far from  the parity described, it has an increasingly opposite effect on  domestic prices. If the exchange rate of the national currency  has fallen by a factor of 1.5 and the dollar costs 381  karbovantsi rather than 254, the price of all goods imported  from abroad will increase by a factor of 1.5. If the government  wants to lessen the effect of imports on domestic prices, it  must act to stop the exchange rate of the national currency from  dropping.    When goods are scarce and production volumes drop, market  conditions cause the exchange rate of the national currency to  fall as a result of an increased demand for imports. With its  clumsy (or perhaps deliberately inspired?) actions, the state  can escalate the demand for imported goods and foreign currency.  This has been precisely the effect of the internal  convertibility introduced by the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government.  Given the existing shortage of goods, it is causing the demand  for foreign currency to grow.    Should the government regard this play of exchange rates as  inviolable if it wants to curb inflation? No, it should use  every available means, including administrative measures, to  halt the fall of the exchange rate of the national currency. In  other words, it must regulate the exchange rate. To be sure,  without disturbing the fundamental price parity and taking into  account market conditions.    A second important factor that sharply increases demand for  foreign currency is the fact that it circulates in the form of  cash. The owners of foreign currency do not suffer from  inflation. Because it is more stable, demand for it is growing.  As a result, the price of the national currency is falling at an  accelerated rate. The dollarization of monetary circulation is  another factor that contributes to inflation.    In the year since the policy on foreign currency has been  "liberalized" and the interbank currency exchange was opened,  the rate at which the dollar is traded on the exchange has  increased more than 90-fold (from 340 karbovantsi on 22  September 1992 to 31,150 karbovantsi on 5 November 1993). This  has had a marked effect on the rise of prices. During this same  period, enterprises raised prices 85-fold. The fact that the  rate at which the currency exchange rate is falling exceeds the  rate at which prices are rising indicates that the exchange rate  is not dependent on price parity but the other way around. This  being the case, the exchange rate is of an opportunistic, even  speculative, nature.    Russia raised the price of its energy supplies, setting  itself the goal of bringing them up to world levels. The fall of  the karbovanets exchange rate greatly intensified the effect of  imported inflation. The steep jump in the exchange rate, which  augurs catastrophe (from 5,970 to 19,050 karbovantsi to the  dollar), occurred on 20 August 1993. In an attempt to neutralize  this factor, the government and the National Bank of Ukraine  established a fixed rate of exchange for the karbovanets. This  was an inflexible decision that drew criticism. It was followed  by the introduction of a regulated -- that is, deliberately  fluctuating -- exchange rate, and the currency auctions were  halted.    Unfortunately, however, this measure designed to halt the  continued fall of the exchange rate was not applied  consistently. Instead of the interbank currency exchange, the  commercial banks were permitted to trade in foreign currency.  This created something like a decentralized exchange. The  interests of exporting enterprises have been disregarded. They  are obliged to sell half their export receipts at the official  rate of exchange (12,610 karbovantsi), yet buy the currency they  need to purchase raw materials, materials, and components at the  bank rate of exchange (37,000-40,000 karbovantsi).    When the Cabinet of Ministers was deliberating on the draft  of the presidential decree, the recommendation was made to  either establish individual quotas for enterprises for the sale  of foreign currency (depending on the nature and structure of  shipments of products under subcontracting arrangements), or  sell hard currency to exporters at the same rate at which they  had bought it. However, for some reason, there is no mention of  this in the decree.    The dual system of exchange rates creates losses for  exporters and produces dissatisfaction among them. Some circles  deliberately interpret this as dissatisfaction with the  principle of state regulation of the exchange rate, even though  this is not the case at all. Is this another mistake or a  deliberate gap? I cannot state for certain, but I suspect that  it is the worse of the two. In fact, it is not the regulation of  the exchange rate that should be opposed, but the retention of  two different rates (at least not for exporters). But it is  precisely regulation that public opinion hotly opposes.    Another inconsistency in the policy of regulating the  exchange rate is the failure to make any attempt to put a stop  to the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine.    The paramount task in the war against inflation is to use  every available method to curb the rise of prices. The thing is  that price increases are no longer the result of inflation and a  feature of it, but the cause of rising inflation. The rise of  prices increases costs, creates a shortage of working capital,  and results in the chain of nonpayments. This leads to a decline  and halt in production, which causes prices to climb even  higher. Or it makes it necessary to supplement working capital  with credits, which increase the money supply and also cause  prices to rise. No matter what kind of anti-inflationary  measures are applied, they are nullified by the momentum of  price increases. That is why it is necessary to resort to direct  administrative restrictions on price increases. Especially on  the price of a specific commodity -- foreign convertible  currency. The government has done precisely that. And it was  right to do so. But this measure must be implemented in a  comprehensive and consistent manner.    Many countries resort to mandatory state regulation of  foreign currency exchange rates. At present, 73 countries link  the exchange rate of their own currencies to the exchange rate  of one of the hard currencies, six rely on a flexible link using  a number of indices (Ukraine could join this group), and eight  countries regulate floating rates of exchange. As we can see, by  far not all countries allow unregulated floating exchange rates.  A country has to protect its economy.    There needs to be a will to fight the crisis. If we indulge  in theoretical whining, we will not overcome the problem.    In all fairness, we have to admit that Yu. Zvyahilskyy is  succeeding in curbing the rate of inflation by applying an  aggregate of measures. In January, inflation measured 19  percent, in February, 13 percent. Estimates show that it should  be down to nine percent in March as against 90 percent at the  end of last year. And the regulation of the foreign exchange  rate is a vital factor in this stabilization. Attacks on the  egulation of currency exchange rates are organized by those who  are living off inflation. This is an assault on the people by  robbers. But the government, too, needs to correct the purchase  and sale of foreign currency so as not to oppress exporters and  not increase the demand for foreign currency.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Agency at Lloyd's acts to lift funds MERRETT Group, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's insurance market, yesterday announced the launch of a company formed to reinsure exclusively business underwritten by its nine syndicates. The deal - involving JP Morgan, the US investment bank, Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, and other international investors - represents the first step by any agency to attract corporate capital to the Lloyd's market, following recommendations last year by the Rowland task force. Merrett Group itself will have no stake in Underwriters Capital (Merrett), which will be Bermuda-based. But Mr Dennis Purkiss, chief executive, insisted that the company represented 'a new source of capital' for the group. JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan will each invest Dollars 7m in Underwriters Capital (Merrett). It will start with Dollars 70m in capital. The new company will provide quota share reinsurance - reinsuring a certain percentage of risks underwritten by Merrett syndicates in return for the same percentage of the premium - for a minimum five-year period. Many Lloyd's agencies are examining ways to attract outside capital as the number of Names - individuals whose assets back the market's underwriting - has declined. Mr Purkiss predicted that the deal might be the first of a number at Lloyd's. He said: 'There is not much doubt that Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan will use it as a blueprint.' Some syndicates have already taken advantage of new rules introduced by Lloyd's last year allowing them to make greater use of quota share reinsurance deals, but Merrett is the first agency to have negotiated arrangements of this type. Merrett Group's capacity - the maximum amount of premium it can underwrite under Lloyd's rules - will amount to about Pounds 400m. Under the revised regulations Merrett can underwrite an extra 25 per cent of that amount if premiums in excess of this capacity are ceded to an outside quota share reinsurer. The government now has powers of intervention over underwriters in the troubled Lloyd's of London insurance market, Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour frontbencher told MPs last night as the Commons passed regulations bringing a single European market in insurance closer to fruition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In protest against the criminal deed of ruthless  monafeqin and mercenary agents of global arrogance in planting a  bomb inside the holy shrine of the eighth Imam Reza -- peace be  upon him -- various strata of the Muslim people of Zahedan, both  Shiite and Sunni, staged a march today.    The Central News Unit reports that along the route of the  march the mourners, by chanting such crushing slogans as "Death  to America," "Death to Israel," "Death to hypocrites," "Today is  the day of mourning," and "The leader Khamene'i is in charge of  the mourning ceremony," renewed their eternal allegiance with  the leader and the guardian of the Muslims' cause. They  stressed their unbreakable unity. They also demonstrated their  hatred and anger against this inhuman and anti-Islamic crime.    The concluding resolution of the rally, in part, while  announcing readiness to obey and carry out the instructions of  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the guardian of the Muslims'  cause, says: We, the Muslims and border guards of the Sistan va  Baluchestan Province, declare our heartfelt hatred against all  enemies of Islam, particularly the hireling monafeqin, and we  call upon the authorities of the Islamic Republic to punish the  perpetrators of this heart-rending tragedy.

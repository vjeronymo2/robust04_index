			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Popov: "Anti-Zhirinovskiy Pill, Or the </F> Art Of Empty Diplomatic Mumbling"]    [Text] The "Segodnya" television program showed Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev's press conference on the  occasion of the arrival to Moscow of the cochairmen of the  conference on Yugoslavia, Owen and Stoltenberg. In answer to the  question as to whether Zhirinovskiy's shadow is hovering over  the negotiations, Kozyrev joked in his usual manner: The Russian  MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], he said, proposes to announce  a competition to invent an anti-Zhirinovskiy pill, since this  is, he said, a medical rather than political matter.    Behind the attempts at lightheartedness, however, there was  easily detectable irritation caused by the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] leader's trip to Yugoslavia, which  reverberated widely around the world. Many thousands of people  flocked to Zhirinovskiy's rallies in Beograd, Belica, Vukovar,  and Podgorica. Serbs like people who are not at a loss for words  and express their thoughts straight, without subterfuge, albeit  in a paradoxical manner. Judging by the comments in the  international press and Western radio programs, Zhirinovskiy was  clearly at his best; he was especially successful in variations  on the Pan-Slavic theme that is very popular here.    At the beginning of the 1980's, when I happened to work in  Yugoslavia, I heard more than once from my interlocutors--and  especially frequently in Serbia and Montenegro--the same popular  expression on blood ties with Russians: "Mi smo jedna porodicha  ot Japana do Jadrana!" In Russian this means: "We are one  family--from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Jadran"--this is  what they call in Yugoslavia perhaps the bluest and warmest sea  on our planet--the Adriatic Sea.    One may assume that the LDPR leader, too, heard (and most  likely more than once) this folksy geopolitical formula in his  travels through formerly splendid parts which now, alas, have  become the arena of horrible endless bloodshed. By the way,  increasingly more international analysts are coming to the  conclusion that had the Soviet Union not disintegrated, the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have continued  its prosperous existence, too, glorifying in Serbian and  Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian, Albanian and Hungarian, and  many other languages the tightly knit family-"porodica."    Should we be surprised then that Zhirinovskiy, with his  predilection for geopolitical issues, did not pass up the topic  of "Japana and Jadrana" at Yugoslav rallies? According to a BBC  radio commentary, the LDPR leader described his vision of a  Pan-Slavic state from Vladivostok to Knin, the capital of the  not-yet-recognized Serbska Krajina republic, causing a  diplomatic demarche on the part of Croatia, which does not  recognize this territory, populated by Serbs since time  immemorial, as an independent Serbian state. But the Krajina  Serbs have their own opinion on the subject. As Milan Martic,  recently elected president of Krajina, said: "We need Russia's  help; we need Russia to say its word!"    Whether Kozyrev likes it or not, Zhirinovskiy was treated in  Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Serbska Krajina  as a representative of Russia, who finally--for the first time  in the past few years, since the beginning of the  perestroyka-reformist nightmare!--says exactly what the Great  Brotherly Russia should have said! Let the West rail over  Zhirinovskiy supporting the idea of Great Serbia, but what is  there actually so seditious in it for a Serb, a Russian, or a  Slav in general?!    I can imagine the storm of elation Zhirinovskiy's words  caused at a rally in the city of Belica: "Serbs can always count  on Russia to protect them. Air strikes against Serbian positions  would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia!"    One can only regret that these words were not said by the  president of Russia! The Western mass media emphasize in  connection with Zhirinovskiy's tour that his views do not  reflect the position of the Russian MFA. Meanwhile, it would be  more correct to put it this way: The current position of the  Russian authorities does not reflect the will of the voters  expressed in the elections of 12 December 1993.    Let us look, however, at how promising Kozyrev's idea  regarding a competition to come up with an anti-Zhirinovskiy  pill may turn out. One would assume that the ideal effect of  this medication, in Kozyrev's mind, would be the phenomenon of  that particular "refined diplomatic mumbling" which was  identified and described in detail in his book "If in doubt,  mumble!" ("The Bureaucrat's Handbook") by James Boren, a former  U.S. Department of State functionary turned sociologist and  political scientist. The hero of his tale is Probur  (professional bureaucrat), a master of "decisive shelving" and  "constructive red tape." The apotheosis of Probur's art is  enthusiastic mumbling, which allows him "to use empty language  forms to express great concern, deep thinking, and absolute  competence."    It remains unknown whether it is with the aid of already  secretly produced pills or simply by lucky inspiration, but  refined diplomatic mumbling is already widely used in Kozyrev's  MFA. At that same press conference after the negotiations with  Owen and Stoltenberg, the Russian minister demonstrated empty  mumbling of the highest international class. For instance,  delivering a soliloquy that the "peace process in Yugoslavia is  not dead; it will continue, and there is a chance to  reinvigorate this process." Next, however, in discouragingly  destructive dissonance to the above, came a cheerful  journalistic commentary: "The meeting participants did not  preclude the use of air strikes in Bosnia."    The Russian MFA is as usual obscuring the issue, trying to  drown the substance of its position in obfuscation, widely using  "yes" in which one keeps hearing "no," and "no" with an easily  detectable "yes" in it... U.S. Secretary of State Christopher,  on the other hand, does not find it expedient to keep things  close to his chest and says, for instance, absolutely straight  that he approves the report of the UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali since "it opens the way for potential use of  military might."    What the very first manifestation of this military might may  be was stated in the television report for "Segodnya" by the  journalist Sergey Gryzunov: One of the first two targets for a  NATO aircraft bombing raid is Tuzla, where, by the way, a  battalion of Russian volunteers is fighting on the side of  Bosnian Serbs, and thus, said the journalist, who has not yet  mastered the art of empty diplomatic mumbling and therefore  still calls things by their proper names, "a situation may  develop whereby Americans will be bombing Russians."    The Russian MFA, meanwhile, is talking about an  anti-Zhirinovskiy pill! Perhaps the LDPR leader should announce  a counter-competition--for the best medicine against Proburs who  disregard the national interests of the country they represent.  <H5>  Meanwhile, Americans Rejoice </H5>   If Russia begins to conduct a policy that will return us to  the period of the "cold war," this will inflict irreparable  damage to the national security of the United States. This  thought was put forward on Tuesday by the (U.S.) President's  National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in an interview to the  CNN television company.    Commenting on the statement by LDPR leader V. Zhirinovskiy  that a NATO air strike against Serbian positions in Bosnia and  Hercegovina will be tantamount to a declaration of war against  Russia, A. Lake said: "I think we should be glad that  Zhirinovskiy is not speaking on behalf of the Russian government  and does not participate in the formulation of Russia's foreign  policy. Had it happened, we would now be arguing with Russia  about who owns Alaska. Seriously speaking, our assessment of the  parliamentary elections in Russia tells us that in voting for  Zhirinovskiy the Russians voted against the economic situation  in the country and not for nationalism. We should not, however,  underestimate nationalist moods in Russia. Therefore our  'Partnership for Peace' initiative assumes not only expanding  NATO membership by adding East European countries and the  integration of Russia into a new unified Europe, but also  provides the former communist countries with a security  guarantee in the event of the potential ascension to power of a  nationalist leader in Russia. We do not think that this will  happen. We do not think that Zhirinovskiy speaks on behalf of  the majority of Russians."</p>

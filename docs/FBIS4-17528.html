			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 24 April TASS -- Chinese State Council  Premier Li Peng, currently on an official visit to the Central  Asian state of Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], said after talks with  President Askar Akayev that China did not seek to fill a sort of  vacuum in the wake of the former Soviet Union's collapse, and  intended to oppose any form of chauvinism.    In his turn, the Kirgiz president said the current visit by  the Chinese State Council premier to Bishkek was to open good  prospects for the Republic.    As concerns issues of border territories, the two leaders  noted they would be solved in the spirit of mutual understanding  and good-neighbourly relations. Expressing sympathy with the  Kirgiz people that suffered greatly in recent natural  calamities, China intends to provide humanitarian aid to the  Republic and a 50 mln yuans credit.    On Sunday, the Chinese premier had a rest on Kirgizia's  famous lake Issyk-Kul.    Li Peng is to return to the Kirgiz capital tomorrow and  visit  the Chinese Embassy. He will go to the airport at 1530 to fly  off to Alma-Ata [Almaty].</p>

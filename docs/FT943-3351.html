			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Acquisition will boost Gambro's US presence Gambro, the new Swedish recruit to the Wallenberg domain, said yesterday it was expanding its US operations through the purchase of Dial Medical, a Florida-based company which produces and markets dialysis concentrates. The move increases Gambro's share of the US market for dialysis concentrates, which are used in dialysis machines for kidney treatment, to around one-third from 7 per cent. The purchase will also lift annual sales of Gambro's COBE US subsidiary by Dollars 30m from last year's Dollars 500m level. COBE Renal Care said the purchase, on undisclosed terms, would broaden its product range and provide a production capacity it had lacked. It said Dial Medical had an extensive distribution system for its products.</p>

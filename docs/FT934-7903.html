			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / 'Sophisticated' Pounds 100m fraud deceived banks THE CHAIRMAN of Wallace Smith Trust Company, the collapsed London merchant bank, swindled about Pounds 100m from other banks in a sophisticated fraud which deceived both the Bank of England and Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, the bank's auditors, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. Mr Wallace Duncan Smith used and re-used certificates of deposit to obtain loans for several million pounds from different banks, said Mr Timothy Barnes QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Smith also defrauded the Discount Bank and Trust Company of Dollars 37m (Pounds 25m) by entering into 'repo' transactions with the bank using non-existent Canadian bonds. The bank lost all the money when Wallace Smith Trust collapsed in 1991 owing Pounds 100m, Mr Barnes said. Mr Smith denies two charges of obtaining the Dollars 37m by deception, three charges of the theft of certificates of deposit worth Pounds 4m, two charges of false accounting and one charge of fraudulent trading with intent to defraud creditors. By 1990 the merchant bank had started to run into financial problems, Mr Barnes said. To keep trading, Mr Smith, who was also joint managing director, raised funds by illegally using the same certificates of deposit as security for further loans from institutions including Life Assurance of Scotland. Much of the money was then routed into two shell companies in Canada operated by Mr Smith. He claimed these companies had substantial assets in the form of land, oil and gas interests, and a wide-ranging portfolio of shares. Both companies were complete shams, Mr Barnes said. They had no assets, operated out of one-room offices and employed no staff. Nevertheless, the Wallace Smith Trust charged substantial fees to the Canadian companies for investment advice and other services. 'To both the Bank of England and Deloitte, it appeared that the bank was properly managed by people of integrity, was trading profitably and had substantial capital behind it,' Mr Barnes said. By late 1990 senior staff within Wallace Smith Trust were challenging Mr Smith about his methods. But in April 1991 he carried out the largest single fraud, raising Dollars 37m from Discount Bank using the bogus Canadian bonds. In April 1991, however, the bank's senior staff, led by Mr Michael Hamilton, its other joint managing director, challenged Mr Smith to prove the existence of the bonds, Mr Barnes said. When he was unable to do so they prompted Mr Smith to go to the Bank of England. Mr Smith was arrested and the bank liquidated within two days. The trial, expected to last several months, continues.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Watchdog gives tacit support to press coverage of Mellor THE Press Complaints Commission, meeting in the wake of reports about the private life of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, said yesterday that the public had a right to be informed about private behaviour of politicians which might affect the conduct of public business. However, Lord McGregor of Durris, commission chairman, insisted there had been no adjudication of the Mellor case at the hastily convened meeting, as there had been no complaints from the parties involved. Instead, the commission had discussed the whole issue of privacy and had decided to conduct a review of the industry's voluntary code of practice before deciding whether there should be any amendments or additions. Nevertheless, the meeting, attended by 10 of the 15 members of the commission, was widely seen as supporting the publication at the weekend of reports of an alleged affair between Mr Mellor and an actress, Miss Antonia de Sancha. The unanimous statement, in effect confirming support for a voluntary code policed by the industry and opposing any form of statutory legislation, could bring the commission into conflict with the government if min privacy. The commission said the holders of public office must always be subject to public scrutiny, and Lord McGregor said after the meeting: 'In the case of politicians, it is right for the public to be informed about private behaviour . . . direct intervention by the government would destroy the freedom of the press.' The review of the code will be submitted to Sir David Calcutt, QC, who was asked by Mr Mellor earlier this month to review the commission's work. The commission's statement was attacked by Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP, who intends to introduce a bill to make the commission statutory. 'They are putting a nail in their own coffin. They won't please Tory MPs and they won't please people like me, simply because they have not studied the (Mellor) case and they are suggesting that no one in public life has any privacy at all,' he said. Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People, which first published the reports on Mr Mellor's private life, said that although the commission's statement was 'a little woolly', it had decided the story was in the public interest. The 10 members of the commission at the meeting were Lord McGregor, Mr William Anderton, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, Ms Patsy Chapman, Sir David Chipp, Lord Colnbrook, Dame Mary Donaldson, Mr Brian Hitchen, Sir Edward Pickering and Professor Robert Pinker.

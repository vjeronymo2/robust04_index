			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Domestic institutions spur Bank's gilt auction to success UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied following the success of the Bank of England's Pounds 2.75bn gilt auction yesterday, its largest auction of UK government debt. demand from domestic institutions for the latest auction stock - 9 per cent Treasury due 2012 - whereas overseas investors largely stayed away because of concern about the prospects for convergence of European interest rates and lack of interest in long-dated issues. Bids amounted to Pounds 4.45bn, giving a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.62. The ratios on the Bank's previous auctions have ranged from 1.82 to 2.28, but dealers pointed out that the low cover ratio at yesterday's auction still compared 'reasonably favourably' with previous auctions given the large amount of debt being sold. The lowest accepted price was 98.31, yielding 9.11 per cent, while the highest accepted price was 99.02, yielding 9.10 per cent. 'The auction generally went much better than some people had expected', said one dealer, adding that the long end of the gilt market bounced after the auction results emerged. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 21/32 at the opening to trade at 115 27/32 by late afternoon. Turnover in the futures market reached over 60,000 contracts with the Liffe gilt contract rising from 97.11 to 97.24. EUROPE'S main government bond markets ended the day slightly higher, helped chiefly by the rally in the US Treasury bond market. The German government bond market opened on a weak note, following the release on Tuesday of worse-than-expected M3 money supply data for May which has wiped out hopes of a cut in interest rates by the end of the year. The bund futures contract tested the important support level of 87.60, falling to 87.52, but ended at around 87.69 on a volume of over 40,000 contracts. News that consumer prices in North Rhine Westphalia rose by 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-June and by 4.3 per cent from June 1991 had little impact on the market as the figures were in line with expectations. The French government bond market closed on a firmer note, helped by the US Treasury bond rally and news that a decision is likely to be taken next week to set the date of the French referendum on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Speculation about the date of the referendum and news last Friday of a large bond exchange programme by the French Treasury led to some weakness in the French market recently. The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2023 ended with a yield of 8.78 per cent, against its opening of 8.81 per cent. US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday in the wake of an unexpected drop in May durable goods orders and a successful five-year note auction. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 101 31/32 , yielding 7.82 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  7/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 4.95 per cent. Prices rose when the Commerce Department announced that durable goods orders fell 2.4 per cent in May. The decline in orders was broadly based, and contrasted with the 0.6 per cent increase expected by economists. The most worrying aspect of the figures, said analysts, was the ninth consecutive decline in order backlogs, which suggests that manufacturers are unlikely to boost production in the near future. The durable goods numbers immediately sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. Sentiment was helped by yet another call for lower rates from the White House. In an interview with the New York Times, President George Bush said he would like to see another monetary policy easing, and that fears of higher inflation did not justify keeping interest rates unchanged. Prices received a further boost later in day when the Treasury's auction of Dollars 10.5bn in five-year notes met strong demand from retail investors, with demand exceeding supply by almost three to one. JAPANESE government bond prices closed higher, helped by a 10-year bond auction and a pick-up in buying interest in the debt market as the Nikkei stock index fell through the 16,000 level. The Finance Ministry sold Y472.67bn of a Y800bn new 10-year bond issue at auction yesterday. The new No 149 issue has a coupon of 5.5 per cent, and was sold at an average price of 99.64 to yield 5.556 per cent. Dealers reported some hedge-selling in the morning as supply concerns weighed on the market, but as the Nikkei index dropped, ending the day 253.32 points lower at 15,853.67, traders noted renewed buying interest.

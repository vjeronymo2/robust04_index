			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Observer: Cloudy A price can be placed on more or less anything in this cost-conscious age. Not to be outdone is the Met Office, which has proudly come up with the fact that its weather forecasts save the UK nearly Pounds 1bn a year. Chief beneficiaries are apparently transport (Pounds 251m) and construction (Pounds 107m). Sadly, the method by which the Met-sponsored survey managed to arrive at such accurate numbers has not been disclosed. Nor is there any mention of the cost of inaccurate predictions. The Met's own service costs Pounds 38m per year to run, by the way, which either means it is a bargain - or that officials are massively undercharging for this immensely valuable service.</p>

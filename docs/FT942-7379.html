			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Concern for Bosnian Serbs Only 41 per cent of Bosnian Serbs live in territory controlled by their self-proclaimed leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, according to a representative of the Serb community in Sarajevo. Out of 1.3m Serbs in pre-war Bosnia-Hercegovina, 600,000 had left the country since the war began, Mr Goran Simic, president of the Sarajevo-based 'Serb citizens' council' told a meeting yesterday at London's Institute for War and Peace. A further 100,000 had died, and 200,000 were still living 'under the legitimate Bosnian government,' 70,000 of them in Sarajevo. The Serb citizens' council was formed in Sarajevo last March at an assembly of 500 delegates from the government-held area. Mr Simic said one of the main objectives of his council was to lobby for amendment of the proposed Moslem-Croat federation 'to include the Serbs as a constituent people.' This proposition had been well received by the Bosnian parliament, but the government had yet to respond to it officially.</p>

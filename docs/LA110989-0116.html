			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROAD TAX HIKES IN TWO CONGESTED AREAS REJECTED;  </P> <P> ELECTION: VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WERE IN NO MOOD FOR NEW  LEVIES, BOND ISSUES OR SALARY BOOSTS.  </P> <P> In an apparent paradox, voters in two heavily congested areas of Southern  California -- Orange County and the Santa Clarita Valley -- rejected tax  increases to finance road improvements in Tuesday's elections, while voters in  outlying, less-congested areas were approving such increases.  </P> <P> In Orange County, a half-cent sales tax boost for traffic improvements,  including a six-lane widening of the often-jammed Santa Ana Freeway, lost,  getting a 53% negative vote. In the Santa Clarita Valley, a measure to add $75  to $200 to residential property tax bills for $285 million to build and widen  roads went down to a 79.7% defeat.  </P> <P> At the same time, voters in relatively less-congested San Bernardino, Santa  Barbara and Imperial counties all approved half-cent sales tax increases to  build better roads.  </P> <P> In other significant election results around the state:  </P> <P> * Voters in San Francisco narrowly rejected, by 50.5% -- or less than 2,000  votes -- a proposal to issue bonds to build a new downtown baseball stadium for  the San Francisco Giants. The city's bitterly disappointed mayor, Art Agnos,  promptly predicted that the Giants would leave town.  </P> <P> * San Franciscans, however, approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax for  traffic improvements by about a 2-1 margin, and 87% cast ballots for a  $59.7-million earthquake safety bond issue that had been placed on the ballot  before the Oct. 17 earthquake.  </P> <P> * San Diego voters gave environmentalists apparent control of the City Council,  rejecting two pro-developer candidates. It was the first time in decades that  council candidates ran in separate districts.  </P> <P> * With scattered exceptions, voters in municipalities up and down the state  rejected special-purpose property or utility tax increases ranging from  providing more money for law enforcement to financing school and sanitation  improvements.  </P> <P> Despite the many anti-tax votes, however, some observers said Wednesday they  detected a slow trend in California toward less resistance to tax increases.  </P> <P> For instance, a spokesman for the County Supervisors Assn. of California, Dan  Wall, pointed out that, adding the new county sales tax increase votes to past  ones, 16 of California's 58 counties have now approved taxes in excess of the  state's basic 6 1/4% sales tax rate.  </P> <P> "I think the basic message that has been going out from county supervisors for  the past five years now is that the revenue we're getting from the state is not  sufficient to do the job," Wall said.  </P> <P> Even in Orange County, the vote this time against the proposed sales tax  increase was less one-sided than on an earlier try for an increase, in 1984,  when voters rejected a proposed 1-cent hike by a massive 70%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Competence of Leaders  </P> <P> In both Orange County and the Santa Clarita Valley, some activists said, a lack  of confidence in the competence and integrity of elected officials might also  have been major factors in rejection of the tax-increase proposals.  </P> <P> In San Bernardino County, by contrast, the Board of Supervisors worked with  considerable political skill to reshape a previously rejected road improvement  tax increase to ensure that a substantial amount of the money went to  improvements in the High Desert areas that had voted massively against the  proposal the first time.  </P> <P> The most expensive campaign was waged in Orange County, with proponents of the  tax increase spending an estimated $2.5 million compared to only about $10,000  for the victorious opponents. That campaign brought the voter turnout to 22%, a  record for an off-year election in the county, but it could not put the road  improvement program over.  </P> <P> Generally, across the state, regardless of any trend toward less decisive  defeats of tax, salary and bond measures, most such proposals still were  defeated. Some examples:  </P> <P> * In San Diego County, voters in Encinitas defeated a $25-million park bond  issue, in Imperial Beach a 5% utility tax measure, in Vista a $38.8-million  school improvement proposal and in Ramona a $2.2-million bond issue for the  water district.  </P> <P> * In Modesto, 63% of voters turned down a proposal to raise the salaries of the  mayor and council members.  </P> <P> * In Selma, 72% voted against increasing utility bills up to 5% for added  police and fire protection.  </P> <P> * In Arvin, 88% rejected a property tax increase of $100 for homes and $400 for  businesses.  </P> <P> * In Chowchilla, voters refused, by nearly a 2-1 margin, to form a hospital  assessment district.  </P> <P> * Sales tax increases for roads were rejected decisively in Nevada County and  trailed by only seven votes among 42,000 cast in Monterey, with 500 absentee  votes remaining to be counted.  </P> <P> But there were exceptions. For example, in Tulare, voters narrowly approved a  six-year extension of an earlier-voted property tax increase for the schools.  </P> <P> One of the angriest reactions to an election outcome in the state came in San  Francisco where municipal officials vowed to investigate $50,000 in what they  termed suspicious contributions that came in in the final days for a mail  campaign against the proposed Giants baseball stadium.  </P> <P> Mayor Agnos has charged that some of this money came from Gregg Lukenbill,  owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball franchise. Lukenbill is the organizer  of moves to acquire both the Los Angeles Raiders football franchise and,  ultimately, a professional baseball franchise, for a new outdoor stadium to be  built in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Lukenbill denied Agnos' charge. Executives of one company that had helped build  the Lukenbill-operated Arco Arena in Sacramento and contributed $12,500 to the  mail campaign against the San Francisco stadium did not return calls asking for  comment. Another $12,500 contributor denied any relationship to Lukenbill.  </P> <P> But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said he would investigate the matter.  </P> <P> While Agnos despaired of keeping the Giants in San Francisco, saying, "I don't  know if we can be competitive anymore," the owner of the baseball team, Bob  Lurie, said the team will play in Candlestick Park, its present home, in 1990.  </P> <P> But Lurie refused to commit himself beyond that, saying, "What happens after  next season is simply not known."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interested Parties  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Sunnyvale Mayor Larry Stone said a consortium of officials in the  so-called Silicon Valley stands ready to dust off an offer to construct a  Giants stadium in Santa Clara County. Tampa, Denver and Vancouver, B.C., are  among cities that have also expressed interest in the team.  </P> <P> "Most cities will want to wait, as they say, for the body to get cold," said  Corey Busch, Giants vice president and aide to Lurie, adding that he expects  several cities to contact the Giants in coming days.  </P> <P> There were suggestions by officials Wednesday that more than 10,000 absentee  votes had been cast in the days immediately after the Oct. 17 earthquake, when  sentiment was strong that San Francisco would have to devote all its resources  to earthquake repairs, and that these may have tipped the narrow vote against  the stadium. With a relatively few absentee votes still to be counted, the  tally was 86,732 against the stadium and 84,755 for it.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Steve Padilla and Jeffrey A. Perlman contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

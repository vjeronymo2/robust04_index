			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Lisbon socialists elect new leader PORTUGAL'S opposition Socialist party (PS) yesterday chose Mr Antonio Guterres, an energetic 42-year-old pragmatist, as its new leader in an effort to revive its fortunes after last year's election defeat, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Mr Guterres, who replaces the dry intellectual Mr Jorge Sampaio as secretary-general of the centre-left party, was overwhelmingly elected by 1,800 delegates at a three-day party congress. He immediately challenged Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva to a televised debate on the budget  - presented earlier this month  - which imposed value added tax on food. The congress also elected a new 200-member National Commission dominated by Mr Guterres' supporters. Mr Guterres challenged Mr Sampaio for the leadership after the PS, out of power since 1985, lost badly to Mr Cavaco Silva's centre-right Social Democrat party (PSD) in elections last October. the PS won only 29 per cent of the vote. Mr Guterres has said he wants to rejuvenate the PS leadership and make the party more attractive to young people, whose interest has slid away from politics to making money in Portugal's economic boom. He also promised to widen the party's appeal to voters in the middle ground of the political spectrum.</p>

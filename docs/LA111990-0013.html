			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE CIRCUS  </P> <P> Good-by to the Big Top: Animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams performed in  places like Madison Square Garden more times than Frank Sinatra and lots of  other big names. But after 11,697 shows and 44 years working in circuses,  Gebel-Williams performed his last death-defying act Sunday in Pittsburgh with  the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.  </P> <P> "I want to step down when I am really good," Gebel-Williams, 56, said. Plus, he  says, training tigers is getting a little riskier because he has lost some of  his quickness and his eyesight is not what it used to be. Known for his  soft-spoken training methods based on mutual respect, Gebel-Williams announced  two years ago that he would retire at the end of the 1990 season. He plans to  settle at his winter home in Venice, Fla., with his 20 Bengal and Siberian  tigers, and will yield the ring to his 20-year-old son Mark. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

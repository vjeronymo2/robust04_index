			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA WATER SAVINGS DOWN SLIGHTLY IN JUNE  </P> <P> The city of Ventura has cut back water use by more than 25% since conservation  became mandatory two months ago, official figures show. But those same  statistics show that residents have slipped a bit with the arrival of hot  summer days.  </P> <P> Ventura posted a 26.1% reduction in water use in June contrasted with the same  month last year. City residents consumed 1,621 acre-feet of water in June this  year, down from 2,195 acre-feet in June last year, said Carol Green, a  spokeswoman for the city Public Works Department.  </P> <P> But Ventura residents saved less water in June than they had the month before,  according to the statistics released Friday. City residents used 1,558  acre-feet in May, contrasted with 2,144 acre-feet in May, 1989 -- a 27.4%  reduction.  </P> <P> One acre-foot of water equals 325,851.43 gallons, a typical yearly supply for a  family of four.  </P> <P> The four-year drought has created a water shortfall equivalent to roughly  one-fourth of what the city normally consumes. For that reason, city officials  have set a goal of reducing water consumption by 30% to more than compensate  for the dry spell.  </P> <P> City officials said they were not concerned with the small increase in water  consumption last month and that they were optimistic that Ventura would reach  its goal of a 30% reduction sometime soon.  </P> <P> "June is a hotter period and it is more difficult to save water," Green said,  "But if you look at the overall picture, it is clear that we're headed in the  right direction."  </P> <P> Mayor Richard Francis was equally pleased. "The people are responding," he  said. "They realize we are in a serious crunch and they are willing to do their  part."  </P> <P> Ventura adopted a mandatory conservation ordinance in April after the drought  depleted the city's aquifers and dried up the Ventura River. River water had  been the main water source for the city's west end.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, which went into effect April 12, residents living in  apartments, condominiums and mobile homes are limited to 196 gallons a day for  each household. Single family homes are limited to 294 gallons a day.  Businesses, farms and government offices must reduce consumption by 15% to 20%.  </P> <P> Large families, fruit-tree growers and other customers who can prove the water  restrictions would cause them undue hardship are eligible for extra  allocations. Green said that since the ordinance went into effect almost 2,500  customers have requested extra water and the city has approved more than 2,300  requests.  </P> <P> Although mandatory conservation began April 12, city officials consider the  first two months an "adjustment period." For that reason, the city had not been  penalizing customers who exceeded their allotments. But since June 12,  violators are being charged up to 10 times the normal water rate for excess  use.  </P> <P> The first bimonthly bills with penalties assessed for excess use will be mailed  Aug. 12, Green said. To make its paper work more manageable, the city has  divided its water customers into eight billing groups, with bills staggered  over an eight-week period. The last group on the rotation will not be charged  for excess use until Oct. 12, Green said.  </P> <P> Francis said residents' civic awareness -- and not the threat of penalties --  was the driving force behind the city's conservation drive.  </P> <P> "There's always a segment of the population that needs to be hit by the  proverbial 4-by-4 to face up to reality, but I think most residents understand  the need to conserve," he said.  </P></p>

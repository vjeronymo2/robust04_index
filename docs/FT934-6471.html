			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Euro Disney loses a sixth of its stock market value Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group desperately trying to negotiate a financial rescue, lost a sixth of its stock market value yesterday. In heavy trading, its shares closed FFr6.20 lower at FFr27.20 in Paris and fell 62p to 318p in London. The decline may complicate efforts by the company to restructure financially. In Paris, the shares slid after heavy selling from convertible preference holders. More than 4.14m Euro Disney shares, or 2.4 per cent of its equity, had changed hands by the end of the day. The Paris stock market authorities were forced three times to suspend the shares when the price breached the official trading limit. Ms Rebecca Winnington- Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'It's pure panic. Investors are now very, very nervous about this company.' Yesterday's decline followed steady selling since Euro Disney, which is burdened by heavy debt, disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 900m) for the year to September 30. The latest fall in the share price, which peaked at FFr160 in April 1992 and was FFr43.70 before the announcement of last year's loss, comes at a sensitive time. Euro Disney, with Walt Disney, the US group that owns 49 per cent of its equity, began negotiations last week over the restructuring with the 60 international banks that own its FFr20.3bn net debt. Further share falls may limit the scope to raise capital through a rights issue. The Disney camp is believed to hope to reduce Euro Disney's net debt to FFr10bn.

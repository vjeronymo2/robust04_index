			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (4): Still the south's staging-post - Nikki Tait finds the city's historic role as a hub little changed since the mid-1800s TAKE ONE look at a map of the United States, and Atlanta's role as a communications centre becomes obvious. The city stands at a staging-post between Florida and the mid-west, and at the end of the Appalachian Mountains' swing down the eastern seaboard. This geographical advantage has given import to Atlanta ever since its formal founding in 1837. During the Civil War the city became a main distribution point for troops and supplies; after the south's defeat, it was the federal headquarters for the 'Reconstruction' effort. In 1866, shortly after the Civil War ended, four railroads - the Macon &amp; Western, the Georgia Railroad, the Atlanta &amp; West Point, and the Western &amp; Atlantic - converged at the town. Over a century later, although different modes of transport dominate, the picture remains remarkably similar. Three important highways intersect in Atlanta, making the city a main trucking and distribution centre. Interstate 75 runs north-south, from northern Michigan to Miami; 1-20 runs west-east, from western Texas to South Carolina; and 1-85, which runs parallel to the Appalachians, links Richmond, Virginia with Montgomery, Alabama. Today, however, Atlanta's most reknowned communications role is probably as an air operations centre. In terms of aircraft landings and take-offs, its main Hartsfield International Airport ranks fourth in the world (after Chicago's O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles International Airport). In terms of passengers handled, Hartsfield drops a couple of places in the rankings; overtaken by Tokyo's Haneda airport and London's Heathrow. But in 1991, in spite of the US airline industry's problems, Atlanta handled 37.9m passengers - only a shade below Heathrow's 40m. And Hartsfield still claims to provide the world's largest passenger terminal complex, capable of handling up to 75m passengers once its new international concourse is built. Such boasts notwithstanding, there is no question that a little of the sheen has been rubbed off Hartsfield's gloss in recent years. During the 1980s the picture was remorselessly upbeat. The new Hartsfield terminal opened in 1981 and although it weathered its share of consumer gripes - the robotic voices on the 'people-mover' and the unimaginative concessions - traffic was generally on the rise and Hartsfield proved a functional success. In 1990 it handled 48m passengers and 790,000 take-offs and landings: an average of over 2,000 a day. Part of this growth came from the expansion of Delta Air Lines, which has its headquarters in Atlanta and uses Hartsfield as its foremost hub. Today, Delta is generally regarded as one of the nation's three 'mega-carriers,' but during the 1980s it was laying the foundations for this role. It expanded in part by acquisition - including the purchase of the West Coast-oriented Western Airlines - but also by the building and developing facilities at its Atlanta base. Gleaming hangers, a new (as-yet-unopened) reservations building, and a state-of-the-art cargo facility all stand as testament to this policy. Unfortunately, two events in the 1990s have had an adverse impact on the airport's fortunes. The first is the general economic recession, which has depressed the level of air traffic both on the business and the tourist fronts. This has meant problems for Delta, compounded by the carrier's decision to purchase the transatlantic routes of Pan Am - an acquisition which has proved hugely difficult to integrate. The carrier recently announced 'downsizing' moves - including a 5 per cent cut in its workforce - and has already reduced its previously-ambitious capital spending plans for the rest of the decade. The second was the demise, in early 1991, of Eastern Airlines, the only US carrier besides Delta to use Atlanta as a hub. The grounding of Eastern planes threw thousands of people out of work in the city. Today, almost two years later, empty Eastern facilities still give a ghostly aura to parts of the airport. The combined result of these events was a sharp drop in traffic at Hartsfield last year. The number of passengers using the airport fell by 21 per cent; take-offs/landings slumped by 25 per cent. This year has shown little improvement: the increase in aircraft operations during the first half of 1992 was less than 5 per cent, and the rise in the number of passengers only about 3 per cent. Eastern's failure also left the airport with a pressing practical problem: 33 spare gates on one of the four concourses. Interestingly, despite Atlanta's attractive geographical position, no airline showed itself anxious to snap these up, and concourse B became largely 'dark' as a result. Aside from a handful of gates which were recently re-employed by Trans World Airlines, these are still on the market. The Atlanta Airport Commission admits that the chances of leasing these to a single occupant are slim, but it remains optimistic that renewed future expansion by carriers at Hartsfield will finally produce takers for the gates on a piecemeal basis. The slow take-up of the Eastern gates has caused critical fingers to be pointed at Delta. Atlanta, say the critics, is 'Deltaland,' and other carriers have veered away from the airport because of its entrenched position. Travellers, meanwhile, objected angrily when the surviving airline raised prices in the wake of Eastern's demise (Eastern had been aggressively cutting fares in its final months). Delta has heard the arguments many times. It does not dispute its dominant position at the airport: it currently accounts for about 80 per cent of all passengers boarding at Atlanta, compared with less than 60 per cent in 1990. The airline does, however, point out that much of this is traffic which is simply 'hubbing' through the airport (that is, passengers coming in on one flight and switching to another). Its share of passenger traffic which originates in Atlanta is closer to 30 per cent - and it claims that the bulk of these passengers have the choice of another airline. The net result is to leave the airport commission still talking of growth in the years ahead, but at much more modest rates. The building of the fifth concourse, for international flights, is still on, scheduled to open in 1994. At present the fifth runway project is still being assessed for its environmental impact. And there is some consideration being given to a 'second airport' project, although one official describes this as being 'on the back-burner'. In the meantime, the expansion of cargo facilities continues apace, with a new perishables/equine centre coming on stream. Finally, in the era of high-tech communications, Atlanta has become something of a centre for telecommunications and associated industries. BellSouth, the largest of the 'Baby Bells' resulting from the AT&amp;T break-up, is based in Atlanta, while AT&amp;T also retains a significant presence in the city.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Germans confirm worst evasion fears of taxman THE German taxman's worst fears of tax evasion appear to have been confirmed: instead of getting DM24bn (Pounds 9.7bn) this year from a controversial new tax on investment income, the likely receipts are expected to be less than half, around DM11bn. The figures have emerged in the latest tax estimate published by a special working group of finance officials. They show a new drop in overall public sector revenues this year of DM2.7bn and next year of DM9.3bn. As a result, the federal government's budget deficit is expected to reach DM73bn-74bn this year and DM75bn-76bn in 1994. While the most important element in the overall shortfall is the slowdown in the German economy and the steady decline in interest rates, tax evasion is also thought to have played a significant role. In particular, officials believe there has been a big rise in the transfer of investment income from German bank accounts to foreign accounts, above all in neighbouring Luxembourg, where bankers don't tell tales. Opposition politicians called yesterday for tighter banking controls to close the obvious loophole in the taxation of investment income, which has taken the form, since last January 1, of tax withholding on interest income paid into German bank accounts. A red-faced Finance Ministry in Bonn confirmed the tax estimates for investment taxation yesterday, but insisted that the net effects of the miscalculation were not as bad as they might appear. A spokesman explained that the original estimate of a gross income of almost DM24bn was based on the assumption that some DM17bn was already paid on investment income in the form of income and corporate taxation. Thus the net revenues were assumed at only DM7bn. A further DM4bn had to be deducted because of the high tax thresholds introduced, precisely in order to discourage the ordinary income earner from switching his money to offshore bank accounts. Thus the final net income assumed in the Finance Ministry model was only DM3bn. The spokesman said that the real miscalculation appeared to be the figure of DM17bn as the assumed amount of investment income tax paid under the old regulations, before the new tax was introduced.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government held the first meeting of the  Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council presided  over by Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok this morning. It was  decided to hold a meeting of this council every Friday to  coordinate the government's position on the North Korean nuclear  issue and other security-related issues. It was also decided to  promptly call a special meeting whenever it is needed to cope  with changing situations.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok; Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Kim Tok, head of the  Agency for National Security Planning; Pak Kwan-yong, chief  presidential secretary; and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential  aide on foreign and security affairs -- who are core figures in  charge of unification and security affairs -- were present at  the meeting. They have decided to seek an effective way to  actively cope with unification and security matters by pursuing  a one-voice policy [hanmoksori chongchaek] through close  coordination of related offices' opinion, being reminded of the  fact that this council was organized mainly because the people  have come to distrust the government's confused unification and  security policy.    In today's meeting, they shared the view that the  Unification  and Security Policy Coordination Council will play the role of a  virtual control tower in charge of generalizing [tonggwal] and  coordinating opinion to prevent confusion in government policy,  and that high-level strategic meetings and unification-related  ministers meetings will be held continuously.    In addition, after determining that a working-level body is  needed to support the council's activities, they decided to form  a working-level organization chaired by the deputy minister of  the National Unification Board.    In particular, the participants reconfirmed in today's  meeting the government's fixed position [chongnidoen ipchang]  that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held  unless North Korea allows nuclear inspections and complies with  the exchange of special envoys.</p>

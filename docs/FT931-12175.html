			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Out of the ERM and into clover - Sterling-based investors had a splendid final quarter. For UK fund managers and internationally-minded retail investors, the great escape came with Black Wednesday, which led to a very happy new year WHAT A difference currency changes can make] Sterling-based investors had a field day in the last quarter of 1992. The 24 markets making up the FT-Actuaries World Indices produced a combined total return of almost 18 per cent; profits for the US dollar investor were zero. Total return for the UK itself was some 14 per cent, but the market was also a lossmaker for American funds investing in Britain. For UK fund managers and internationally-minded retail investors, the great escape came with Black Wednesday, when sterling quit the ERM, interest rates and the value of the pound dropped sharply and equities powered ahead. The total return on the UK subset of the World Index was a negative 2.3 per cent in the year to September 16; in the three-and-a-half months to year-end, the outcome was some 23 per cent and a very happy new year indeed for most fund managers. The story, but again only for sterling holders, was much the same across the investment world. Total return on the 2,200-plus components of the World Index to the middle of September was a negative 3 per cent; over the remaining 15 trading weeks of the year the return was over 20 per cent positive. Europe excluding the UK was 15.5 per cent; the Pacific region excluding Japan saw almost 20 per cent. Towards the end of December, London, New York and Tokyo all hit their high point of a turbulent investment year on most exchanges, although the US stock market was uncharacteristically rock steady throughout 1992. Dollar investors across the 520-odd US stocks in the index had a last-quarter return of 5.3 per cent, against a virtual standstill outcome for the narrow Dow, but they had a poor time in Europe, excluding Finland and Italy, and had hefty losses in Austria, Denmark, Germany and France. However, the global dollar portfolio got a huge 35 per cent return in Mexico. The Japanese market, still a major headache for many UK fund managers who bought it expensively at the start of 1992 (or late the previous year), went nowhere in the final quarter in local terms, but sterling investors who got their timing right had an almost 14 per cent total return. The small Irish market showed a higher than 7 per cent local return in the October-December period, despite a strong currency and high interest rates. But if timing was of the essence in some markets, sector (as against all-important stock) selection was less vital in the last quarter. No sector in the World Index produced a negative return, and many showed impressive gains: banks, utilities, media, electronics, retail and forestry/paper produced returns better than 20 per cent, with automobiles and chemicals at 16 and 14 respectively. Precious metals just managed it into positive territory. And the immediate future? Uncertain. Money market rates are headed downwards, at least for the moment, and the retail investor needs to take some calculated chances elsewhere. Pension funds have their long-term liabilities to match, so they have little option other than a sizeable holding in equities, although the balance in favour of international bonds may be changing, European economic conversion or not. The Clinton White House should see some enhanced US economic activity - the year-end signs were already encouraging - but immediate equity prospects in continental Europe and Japan may not be great. UK companies with heavy US exposure (and there are many in the big league) will benefit from growth in the American economy, but more competitive export prices may run up against recessions in many traditional British markets. France could be a buy in the medium term, subject to a small currency risk, and also some of the Pacific Basin markets. Smaller companies in economies coming out of recession, notably the US, were showing healthy signs early on this year. Stock-picking could be a short term imperative.</p>

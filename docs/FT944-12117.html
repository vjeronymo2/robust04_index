			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Mixed success for Sotheby's contemporary art sale Sotheby's sale of cont - emporary works of art in New York on Tuesday night well illustrate the current state of the world art market: buyers were willing to pay reasonable prices for the best paintings but there was no interest at all in the second rate, writes Antony Thorncroft. The auction totalled Dollars 12.145m (Pounds 7.48m) but 40 per cent of the 66 lots were unsold. One of the icons of 'Pop' art, Roy Lichtenstein's 'I ..I'm Sorry' (pictured above), showing a comic strip blonde shedding a tear, complete with balloon caption, sold, on estimate, for Dollars 2.47m to the Californian collector Eli Broad. 'Pop' art has been the main casualty in the collapse of the contemporary market since 1990 and this was a reassuring price. There was an artist record in the Dollars 805,500 paid for Ellsworth Kelly's 'Green, Red, Yellow, Blue', four panels of those colours. Estimates and reserves had been kept low but judging by the results even more caution will be needed next time. There were encouraging signs. 'Let us now praise famous men,' a silkscreen by Andy Warhol based on portraits of the artist Robert Rauschenberg and his family, was fought over by seven bidders and eventually went for Dollars 1.058m, ahead of estimate, while a drawing by de Kooning, 'Monumental Woman,' which the artist gave to the late Harold Rosenberg, art critic of The New Yorker, on his birthday in 1954, also beat its forecast, making Dollars 695,500. Its provenance made it desirable, as did the eight paintings sold by the New York publisher SI Newhouse, seven of which found buyers. However, the failure was the most important lot, 'Untitled,' by Cy Twombly, which was expected to make around Dollars 1m.</p>

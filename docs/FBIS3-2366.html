This was the first formal meeting between  the leaders of the two countries since Hosokawa became Japanese  prime minister. The meeting was aimed at resolving trade issues  between the two countries, but ended in failure without any  agreement. The United States indicated its readiness to take  retaliatory steps. Thus, U.S.-Japanese trade frictions will be  further aggravated.    At a press conference after the meeting, Clinton directly  criticized Japan by saying that Japan is still unwilling to open  its market to U.S. products, it was the G-7 country with the  most tightly closed market, and proposals raised by Japan at the  meeting could not even meet the criteria provided by the  "framework agreement" concluded by the two countries in Tokyo  last year. Hosokawa stressed that although no trade agreement  had been reached at the summit meeting, both sides agreed that  "this result should not be allowed to undermine the solid and  friendly relations between the two countries," adding that both  sides maintained that cooperation in the political and security  fields had developed and strengthened.    Since the Clinton administration assumed office, U.S.  foreign  policy toward Japan has changed noticeably. The United States  no longer puts U.S.-Japanese security relations in primary  position in U.S. policy on Japan, but stresses the importance of  U.S.-Japanese trade relations. For a long time, the United  States has registered a huge adverse balance of trade with  Japan. Although both sides have signed almost 30 different  trade agreements since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan  keeps increasing. Last year, the deficit with Japan rose by 20  percent, standing at almost $60 billion.    The Clinton administration has always exerted pressure on  Japan on the trade question. It has asked Japan to open its  market to U.S. products and reduce the huge trade deficit to  provide more job opportunities in the United States and  stimulate U.S. economic development. In the "framework  agreement" concluded last year, the United States asked Japan to  work out detailed quotas to import U.S. products. The United  States calls this "target criteria."    Prior to the summit meeting, Hosokawa sent a special envoy  to  meet Clinton and ask the United States to give Japan more time  on the trade talks, to put aside their differences during the  summit meeting, and to prevent the first summit meeting between  Clinton and Hosokawa from breaking down. However, Clinton  replied that the seven-month period from July last year had been  adequate and that differences were better than an agreement  where nothing had been achieved. Subsequently, Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomo Hata arrived in Washington to hold talks with  U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and Treasury Secretary Bentsen.  The talks went on from 10 February until the early hours of 11  February without result. Japan indicated that the "target  criteria" were actually "numerical quotas" to "manage trade,"  which did not correspond with Japan's basic principle of free  competition. Japan could not accept this U.S. demand.    On 12 February, at a press conference prior to his departure  from the United States for Japan, Hosokawa stressed that Japan  would not ease its stand in this respect and "we will not accept  numerical quotas." He said that after a "cooling down period,"  both sides would be able to resolve all kinds of differences.  In the meantime, Hosokawa hoped that the United States would  not take retaliatory measures unilaterally against Japan, as  this would violate GATT principles.    While the United States could possibly take this step, U.S.  congressmen and some influential leaders in U.S. business  circles keep asking the Clinton administration to take a  hard-line attitude on Japan. In their opinion, over the last  20-odd years, the United States has tolerated Japan's trade  surplus with the United States, out of consideration for  U.S.-Japan security relations. But the United States should not  make this mistake any longer. Some U.S. officials say that  after the summit talks failed, they were no longer interested in  resuming trade talks with Japan, unless Japan changed its  stance. The Clinton administration has prepared a series of  specific programs to force Japan to open its markets, which  include meting out trade sanctions against Japan. According to  some reports, if the United States takes retaliatory measures,  the first thing it will do is to raise import tariffs on  Japanese telecommunications products and vans, apart from  restricting imports of Japanese products. In addition, it could  possibly list Japan as a country engaging in unfair trade and  apply corresponding measures.    In some analysts' opinion, if the United States takes  retaliatory measures, this will cause Japan to retaliate also.  In such a case, a trade war would break out between these two  big economic countries. This is something the United States is  unwilling to see, because not only would a trade war damage the  interests of the enterprises and consumers in the two countries,  but also endanger U.S.-Japanese political relations. Apart from  this, it will also undermine the achievements the United States  has made in promoting global free trade through the GATT and  NAFTA [North Atlantic Free Trade Association]. This would be  unfavorable to the United States. However, if the United States  does not take strong measures, Clinton will be criticized and  his policy toward Japan will be regarded as the same as that  toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: "Loud thunder but small raindrops."  Furthermore, U.S. credibility in trade negotiations would be  much decreased.    Clinton has indicated that the United States has no  alternative but to take action. This may be announced next  week. On 13 February, THE WASHINGTON POST disclosed that the  Clinton administration had decided to impose retaliatory  measures on some Japanese products. Evidently, the aggravation  of U.S.-Japanese trade frictions is inevitable.</p>

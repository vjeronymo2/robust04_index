			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / SG Warburg reveals its hidden reserves THE FULL hidden reserves of SG Warburg were revealed for the first time yesterday as the UK's leading merchant banking group reported full-year profits in line with expectations at Pounds 166.3m. Warburg said that a year ago its hidden reserves totalled Pounds 70.9m, equivalent to nearly 10 per cent of its disclosed shareholders' funds of Pounds 719m at the time. European legislation would have forced disclosure two years from now, but Lord Cairns, Warburg chief executive, said the group preferred to pick the moment that suited it best to make the announcement. Most of the larger UK merchant banks have now voluntarily disclosed their secret reserves, a traditional tool used by banks to smooth out profits. Warburg said it had never used secret reserves to bolster its profits, though losses on Rolls-Royce in the mid-1970s and local authority swaps two years ago had been set against these reserves. Had it maintained the reserves this year, reported profits would have been Pounds 3m less. The level of reserves, above most expectations, eased the mild disappointment that the stock market felt at the group's performance in the year to March 31. After reporting profits of Pounds 89m in the first half, Warburg slipped to Pounds 77m in the second, due in particular to the lack of corporate finance activity before the UK general election in April. It had issued a profits warning in February. Profits for the year as a whole were up by nearly a quarter from the restated Pounds 135.2m of the previous year. This was largely because of the spate of rights issues by UK companies in the first half, followed by an international equity raising later in the year, including the Pounds 5bn sell-off of BT shares by the government. Mercury Asset Management, the majority-owned fund management group, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds 65.1m. Lord Cairns said: 'A large number of decisions were quite clearly being deferred due to uncertainty about the election.' The group managed a return on its enlarged disclosed reserves of 18.9 per cent, up from a restated 16.4 per cent the year before and still well short of the average 25 per cent it hopes to achieve in the long-term.

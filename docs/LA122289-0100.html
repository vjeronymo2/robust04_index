			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRONTERA;  </P> <P> VAN HOUTEN DENIED PAROLE FOR 8TH TIME  </P> <P> Leslie Van Houten, one of Charles Manson's "girls" convicted in the savage  Tate-La Bianca murders 20 years ago, was denied parole for the eighth time at a  hearing at the California Institution for Women at Frontera. A three-member  Board of Prison Terms panel found the 40-year-old former beauty queen  unsuitable for release because of her crime, her "unstable social history" and  her need for further alcohol and drug rehabilitation. Van Houten was convicted  of participating in the August, 1969, murders of grocery executive Leno La  Bianca and his wife, Rosemary. The La Biancas were the sixth and seventh  victims in two nights of murder, including actress Sharon Tate, who was more  than eight months pregnant.  </P></p>

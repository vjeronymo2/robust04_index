			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran June 29 TASS -- President of Azerbaijan  Geydar Aliyev arrived in the Iranian capital Tehran on a  four-day official visit today. At Tehran's Mehrabad airport,  Aliyev told journalists that "Azerbaijan regards Iran as a  powerful and influential neighbour, and is ready to develop  cooperation with it in all spheres."    Aliyev said he will hold talks with Iranian President 'Ali  Akbar- Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders to discuss issues of  regional and world policy as well as prospects for expanding  bilateral relations between the two countries.    Receiving Aliyev, Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasised the  historical, religious and ethnic closeness of the two people.  The Iranian head of state noted that many accords, which were  achieved during the Iranian president's visit to Baku last year,  are in the stage of implementation, and the remaining will  require some time to be put into life. The Iranian president  also expressed concern over the unabated bloodshed in the  Trans-Caucasus region.</p>

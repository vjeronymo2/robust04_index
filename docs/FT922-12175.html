			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: When cash flow is king The flood of annual reports from UK companies in the past few weeks has confronted investors with a new phenomenon: the cash flow statement. If they are slightly puzzled over what to do with it, they cannot wholly be blamed. The old source and application of funds, which the cash flow statement replaces, was largely ignored by investors. This was chiefly because its content was so loosely defined that companies could use it to prove what they liked. The point about the cash flow statement, though, is that its more rigid format makes the bad news harder to hide. Its simplest and most useful application is to check the quality of profits. The profit and loss account does not concern itself with cash going out of the business to finance working capital. It thus does not address the question of whether stocks are worth what was paid for them, or whether debtors are good for repaying their debts: or whether the outflow can be financed. The quick way to determine whether this is an issue is to compare operating profit with operating cash flow. Last year, for instance, ICI had trading profits of Pounds 1bn and operating cash flow of Pounds 1.5bn. Hanson had trading profits of Pounds 941m and operating cash flow of Pounds 934m. In both cases, no problem. British Aerospace, on the other hand, had operating profits of Pounds 354m and operating cash flow of minus Pounds 95m, which makes its surprise rights issue in the latter part of the year rather more intelligible. The most extreme case of this is Polly Peck. Its farewell set of accounts showed pre-tax profits up 44 per cent to Pounds 161m. Its source and application of funds statement showed funds generated from operations of Pounds 172m. But a new-style cash flow statement, as calculated by County NatWest, would have shown an operating cash outflow of Pounds 129m, chiefly because of a staggering Pounds 288m increase in working capital. On the other hand, the figure of Pounds 288m was clearly displayed in Polly Peck's source and application of funds. This suggests what is in fact the case: that the novelty of the cash flow statement lies not so much in disclosure as in presentation. As the example shows, presentation can be vital. That suggests in turn that most investors have been too busy or too slothful to dissect the accounts for themselves. But that is partly because British financial statements, the balance sheet included, had become so corrupted as often to be meaningless. The overhaul of the system, when complete, will mean that investors can no longer allow themselves to settle for single crude yardsticks such as earnings per share. It also means that the spivvier kind of company will have to devise fresh ways of hiding the truth. The extent to which the latter succeeds in time for the next boom will be the chief test of whether the new Accounting Standards Board has the stamina for the job.</p>

Economic Affairs: </H5>   As part of the policy of economic freedom, administrative  units will compete with each other to establish their own  economic bases with their known components: Production,  distribution, job opportunities, investment opportunities, and  improvement of social services and care for citizens in each  administrative unit. Competition will prompt local government  agencies to do their best, and they will be directly responsible  for their actions. Performance will be measured in accordance  with these agencies' handling of their tasks and  responsibilities. In case of failure, the local government  authorities will not shirk responsibility by blaming the central  authority, which would happen if there was a confusion of  responsibilities. The government will devote its efforts to  planning within the framework of the general and main  objectives. The government will also monitor implementation, a  task which will be facilitated by two factors:    1. The general objectives that it will define will be based  on the needs of each administrative unit.    2. Monitoring the implementation will start from within each  administrative unit through the voters. This will ensure the  achievement of the set objectives.  <H5>  4. Police and Security: </H5>   Security will be among the direct responsibilities of the  local government in various administrative units. Each  administrative unit will be responsible for running the affairs  of its police and security force within the national general  security plan. The police and security forces will carry out  their responsibilities in accordance with the Interior  Ministry's regulations and rules. These forces will receive  orders from the local authorities. Their armament will be  unified and their rights and obligations will be set in  accordance with the law. Their size will depend on the need of  each administrative unit. The local authority will be directly  responsible for security within the boundaries of each  administrative unit. The general security plan supervised by  the Interior Ministry will coordinate security activity among  the administrative units and will monitor security activity in  all administrative units in accordance with the law.  <H5>  5. Education: </H5>   A. A unified national educational plan will be worked out.  Local government councils in administrative units will see that  this is implemented on the basis of positive interaction among  them to offer the best proposals regarding both the educational  institution and curricula.    B. Technical schools and training centers are under the  direct responsibility of the local government. This  responsibility will also cover the training of teachers and  meeting schools needs for teachers.    C.

Health and Other Services: </H5>   A. With the exception of combating epidemics nationwide and  following a national medical policy according to unified  standards, the local government will be responsible for health,  doctors, supervision of hospitals and health units and devising  a system for controlling them, granting licenses, controlling  and encouraging private clinics, laboratories, and therapy  centers, and appointing specialized cadres.    B. The same standards will apply to the relationship between  the central departments and the local government agencies in the  fields of services and other social activities and those working  in these fields.  <H3>  7. The Civil Service System, Public Service, and Work  Rules: </H3>   A. All civil servants and other employees will be subjected  to unified laws.    B. These laws will be implemented within the framework of  administrative units.

These will be governed by a law.    2. An executive office will be formed in each province. It  will be elected by the local administration council in the  province from its members or from outside. It will be headed by  a person elected by the local council. A presidential decree  must be issued on its formation. The law will define its  organizational structure in accordance with the nature of the  tasks assigned to it.    3. The local government's council decisions are binding  within the administrative unit. It shall not make decisions  that exceed the limits of its administrative area.    4.

The appointment  of the office heads will be announced in a prime minister's  decision.  <H5>  Rebuilding and Reorganizing the Armed Forces </H5>   Rebuilding and reorganizing the Armed Forces is one of the  primary issues. The Armed Forces are directly affiliated with  the Government. No military or paramilitary force belonging to  any other side shall be formed. The general plan to reform,  merge, reconstruct, and reorganize the Armed Forces will be  prepared in accordance with the following principles:    1. The Yemeni Armed Forces are defense forces responsible  for protecting the Yemeni Republic's borders, waters, and air  space, and to defend national sovereignty.    2. The Defense Ministry's budget must be controlled to  enable it to play its role in accordance with the requirements  of defending the Yemeni Republic.    3. The size of the Armed Forces will be confined to three  arms: land, sea, and air. No force will be allowed to exist and  no units will be allowed to be formed in contravention of that  and outside the three aforementioned arms.    4. The required formations of the Armed Forces, which will  be suitable to the operations theater, will be defined in  accordance with what the competent authorities see fit within  the conditions and in accordance with requirements of defending  the sovereignty and independence of the Yemeni Republic.    5. The material and human resources and the proposed  formations will be completed after they have been defined by  reconstituting and reorganizing the current formations.    6. After determining their size and formations and  completing their material and human resources, the Armed Forces  will be positioned in accordance with the following priorities.    A. Deploying units at border areas.    B. Protecting sites of economic activities for operating  companies.    C. Reorganizing and redeploying the rest of the units in  the inland regions according to needs and to function as a  reserve. This is in line with the principle of reducing the  current size of the Armed Forces, based on the following:    -- Retirement according to the terms of the service and the  bonus and salary law.    -- Retiring military officials employed by civilian  government institutions.    -- Opening the door for early voluntary retirement.    7. Abiding by the Political Parties and Organizations Law by  disallowing party activity in the Armed Forces and the security  agencies.    8. Dividing the republic into military zones.    9. Reformulating the Military Service Law to stress the  following:    -- Joining the Armed Forces is a national right and duty for  all the sons of Yemen. This principle must be embodied through  the composition of the Armed Forces, without any discrimination  or preferences.    -- Senior Armed Forces and security officials shall spend  five years maximum in senior posts.    -- The Armed Forces should set an example of national  unity. Its staff are to be selected based on qualifications and  experience, away from party and political congresses and family,  rural, regional, ethnic, and religious affiliations. The Armed  Forces shall be reorganized on these bases until there is no  military unit subject to the above influences.  <H5>  2 - 4 The Official Media </H5>   A national body shall be formed comprising qualified  national  media figures to supervise it and to do the planning for the  official media agencies. This body shall replace the ministry  to ensure that it will serve the community, away from  discrimination against any political side and to enable it to  perform its media and educational role and message.  <H5>  2 - 5 Education </H5>   Stressing the unification of curricula in all schools,  colleges, and universities and removing the distortions in these  curricula. Also, making intensive efforts to modernize academic  curricula to catch up with modern developments and working to  build up a Yemeni generation that has a unified national vision  and creed.  <H5>  2 - 6 The Higher National Security Council </H5>   1. A higher national security council shall be established  in  Yemen. This council will be responsible for doing research,  conducting studies, and making recommendations for the  presidency of the state and the government. The purpose is to  protect national sovereignty and enhance our country's relations  with Arab and other countries in light of new world  developments. The council will also carefully study ways to  spare our country disasters, crises, and upheavals witnessed in  most Third World nations.    2. The council shall have duties and bylaws to govern its  activity and shall be established by a law.    3. The council shall comprise specialists in political,  military, security and socioeconomic affairs.  <H5>  2 - 7 The Control and Accountability Agency </H5>   The role of the Central Agency for Control and  Accountability  should be activated as a control agency independent of the  executive branch and that is directly linked with the  legislative branch. This agency should be committed to its  public reports. The government will have its own tool for  advance and future control of local and central executive  agencies.    The control agencies should have strong, qualified, and  neutral elements that can withstand all pressures and any  attempts that obstructs their duties or try to use them for  political purposes or favoritism.  <H5>  2 - 8 Civil Service Reform </H5>   Civil service reforms must be subject to a thorough study of  the current situation, including regulations, practical  measures, and measuring performance. Since the human is the  foundation of administration, reform should be geared toward  human resources in the first place. Also, regulations and  practical measures should be reformulated in line with the  following:    A. Simplicity and clarity of regulations to facilitate their  understanding and implementation.    B. A precise and sound definition of duties,  responsibilities, and powers.    C. Laying constant foundations to delegate powers on all  central and local levels.    D. Preparing administrative bylaws and work regulations  precisely.    E. Preparing a working guide for citizens' formalities in  all  fields.    In addition to the importance of preparing bylaws, the  significance of the human element in administration should  require the following:    1. Enhancing the continuous training process of scientific  and technical leaderships and the administrative cadres.    2. Providing a suitable environment for work and finding new  job opportunities.    3. Stressing the disinterestedness of the administration and  considering civil service as both a right and duty.  Appointments to all administrative posts will be subject to the  terms of the civil service and the valid bylaws, laws, and  regulations. Posts of deputy ministers and above will be  considered political posts.    4. Forming specialized administration courts to resolve  issues of administrative violations within a period not  exceeding six months from the signing of the document.    5. Forming a general civil service organization instead of a  ministry. This will be affiliated with the cabinet.  <H5>  Economy and Financial Organization </H5>   The failure to complete the structure of the Yemeni state  has  directly affected economic and financial conditions. One of the  most obvious effects of the absence of the unity of the state's  political establishment is that the country has been left  without a clear financial and economic policy to organize this  vital sector. Clear economic policy has been missing since the  first day of our experiment in unity, despite the fact that our  declared policy was economic freedom. However, this policy was  not been consummated to allow the economy to be built within its  framework. Trouble and concern grew and anarchy displaced  organization. With the absence of political unity and decisive  measures, general expenditure became a source of increasing  anarchy that was reflected in the national currency and led to  the deterioration in the rial's purchasing power. It led to a  disruption in productive economic activities such as agriculture  and industry. Prices soared and the real value of people's  income dropped because of the deterioration of the national  currency. All this was in addition to the rampant deficit in  the general budget. Therefore, the economic reform process,  within the policy of economic freedom and through a number of  urgent measures to stop the deterioration, becomes very  important.    Based on all this and in order to come up with an integrated  policy that will be combined and completed within a process of  reforming the entire system of government, the following steps  should be taken:    1. Abiding by a general state budget that specifies  expenditures and revenues and seeks to end the growing deficit  resulting from the huge gap between expenditures and revenues.  This can be achieved by emphasizing increasing revenues and  curtailing and organizing expenditures, within the limits of  what is needed;    2. Following balanced development plans and annual  investment programs to guarantee balanced economic and social  development;    3. Adjusting the monetary system to stop the deterioration  of the national currency and activating the role of the Central  Bank and organizing its functions in a way that does not run  counter to the functions of the commercial banks; also, taking  the necessary and practical measures to protect the currency,  including the issuing of the new currency that was agreed upon,  regulating money exchangers' activities, and fighting currency  counterfeiting;    4. Fighting corruption, bribes, and administrative  negligence and uncovering smugglers of goods, commodities,  weapons, and drugs and punishing them in accordance with the  valid laws;    5. Implementing the decisions pertaining to the  establishment  of a free zone in Aden; executive measures must begin  immediately and all measures must be completed by the end of  this year;    6. Organizing and supervising the activity of public  institutions and public companies, especially activity that  affects the foreign currency that may be used to finance  activities that exhaust the economy;    7. Making a quick decision about which of the raw materials  needed for basic national industries, and the resources needed  in agriculture, fisheries, and other production activities, are  to be treated the same way as foodstuffs financed by the Central  Bank, in order to stop the increase in the price of these  materials and the deterioration of this vital activity of the  national economy.   <H5>    4. Constitutional Amendment: </H5>   As the Constitution is a document of great importance in our  people's present and future life, the following should be  observed:    A. Abiding by the current Constitution until it is amended.    B. In order to Implement the content of the accord document  and to make the necessary Constitutional amendments, serious  efforts should be exerted to carry out these Constitutional  amendments within three to five months. A national committee  consisting of ulema, parties to the Political Forces Dialogue,  some specialists from Aden and Sanaa universities, and some  social figures should be formed to draft Constitutional  amendments, taking into account the fact that draft  Constitutional amendments should not conflict with general  principles and fundamentals, as well as the missions and powers  of bodies and ways of their formation in the accord document of  the Political Forces Dialogue. The committee will take full  time to do its work within the fixed period.    C. Reconsidering the overall parliamentary and local  production system, particularly election by list in light of a  scientific study of Yemeni and other human experiences. The  election law will be reconsidered in light of the results of  that study.  <H5>  5. Implementation Mechanism: </H5>   To ensure the implementation of this national document,  which  is aimed at correcting the course of unity and building a modern  Yemeni state, a state of order and law, every national official  and popular energy should be mobilized. Therefore, the  following mechanism should be adopted:    A. The government shall have full power and be free from  interference in its work in order to allow it to carry out its  duties.    B. The government will draw up timetables to carry out  specific duties within one month.    C. Anything in the document requiring a Constitutional  amendment should be observed as soon as the Constitutional  amendments are approved. Some duties should also be prepared  along with the preparation of the draft Constitutional  amendments. An issue that does not require a Constitutional  amendment will be carried out immediately.    D. Measures by the government to implement the document and  the policy statement should be taken publicly.    E. A monthly news conference should be held to define  progress in implementing the duties; a government spokesman will  be appointed.  <H5>  6. The Follow-Up Mechanism </H5>   1. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall follow up  and supervise the implementation of the decisions enshrined in  the accord document signed by the parties to the Political  Forces Dialogue to build a modern Yemeni state.    2. Executive decisions will be made granting the committee  the following:    A. The right to obtain information from any source,  particularly to the extent that it will help the committee carry  out its duties.    B. The right to have access to the media to propagate  statements detailing progress in the implementation of the  document, the obstacles hindering it, and those who may by  obstructing it, whether individuals or bodies.    C. The government shall make available to the committee its  official and administrative capabilities to help it fulfill its  functions.  <H3>  7. The Security Arrangements and Circumstances Needed for  Signing and Implementing the Agreement. </H3>   A committee is to be formed from among the parties to the  dialogue to work out security conditions for signing the  document and guarantees for initiating implementation in  coordination with the president and his deputy. The date shall  be fixed in accordance with the agreed arrangements.    Conclusion: The completion of such work must be the result  of a powerful political will to engage in vigorous work and  honor promises and obligations. The aim is to safeguard unity  and protect the republic and our democratic choice and confirm  our people's will to achieve their objectives--security,  stability, and the affluence of the individual.</p>

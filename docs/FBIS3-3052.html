[video  shows pan shot of the interior of a garage where soldiers are  seen working on machinery, then cuts to show five technicians in  white coats servicing some instruments]    Using computer software and modern (?earthquake-sounding)  technology, aircraft maintenance troops have developed simulated  training and instructional systems complete with images, texts,  and sounds. To train maintenance crews in simulated  maintenance, assembly, disassembly, and debugging services, and  to cultivate high-level aircraft maintenance personnel, they  have established an aircraft maintenance management network  whose scope ranges from various large Air Force units to  divisions and regiments. This has effectively improved the  accuracy and timeliness of equipment maintenance.

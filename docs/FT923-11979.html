			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: EC packaging laws tied in red tape The European Commission last week extended its influence into the murky depths of the Euro-dustbin when it published its long-awaited directive on the ticklish issue of how best to avoid packaging waste. The EC put forward far-reaching proposals aimed at harmonising environmental laws across the Continent and reducing the 50m tonnes of packaging waste produced in the Community each year. Its hierarchy of preferred solutions is: minimisation of the packaging used in particular products, followed by recovery and recycling, with final disposal in landfill sites remaining a last resort. The directive sets the seemingly staggering target that within 10 years of implementation 90 per cent of all packaging waste by weight should not reach the waste stream and 60 per cent of each packaging material recycled. It expects that within five years of implementation the member states will have set up appropriate systems to collect packaging waste from the consumer, enabling them to ensure that it is effectively re-used or 'recovered'. The concept of recovery is a loose one - much to the packaging industry's relief - allowing for the 'value' of any product to be recovered by the most efficient means possible - a process known as valorisation. So, for example, it will be considered equally valid either to recover the energy from a product by burning it and utilising the heat or composting products for agricultural use. However, few sectors of the packaging industry in any European country come near to the required rates of recycling. The targets, therefore, represent a formidable challenge. At present, only 20 per cent of the waste produced in the EC is recycled. Nevertheless, many industry representatives have reacted favourably to the ambitious proposals, believing they will help forestall discriminatory national legislation and create a flexible framework enabling the best environmental solutions to emerge in each of the member states. Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment in the UK, says: 'We welcome anything that is a step towards greater certainty.' But some still have reservations. The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment, which represents many international companies involved in producing multi-layered cartons, says it still has 'serious concerns' about the unrealistic targets that have been set, which run the risk of creating mountains of waste. But there is a surprising degree of flexibility even on this score. The EC accepts that its targets are 'aspirational'. A clause in the directive suggests they may be modified if research shows that other processes of recovering waste prove to have greater environmental advantages. Jacques Fonteyne, managing director of the European Recovery and Recycling Association (Erra) which represents 31 companies directly or indirectly involved in the packaging industry, says: 'Everybody seems to forget that there are still at least two more years before the directive will be implemented.' Although there are many battles still to be fought before the proposals are enacted in national laws, there appears to be a growing consensus across Europe about the priorities that the directive enshrines and the solutions it prefers. Last weekend, Klaus Topfer, Germany's environment minister, spoke about the creation of a 'circulation economy' where the components of every manufactured product are re-used at the end of their useful lives. As environmental campaigners are fond of saying: 'We have to stop thinking in terms of straight lines and start thinking in circles.' The EC directive on the avoidance of packaging waste may be wobbly around the edges but at least the outline of such a circle is beginning to take shape.</p>

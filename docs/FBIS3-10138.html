			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abnor Gondim: "Army Can Build Roads, Says Lula"] </F>   [Text] Santarem--Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT's  [Workers Party's] potential candidate for president, said during  a meeting with civic groups at the Federal University of Para in  Santarem, Para, yesterday that the Army could replace  construction firms on such public works projects as road  construction.    According to him, it is necessary to give the military more  work to do so they will stop concerning themselves with other  things. Lula said he also believed that the military could  fulfill an important mission in the field of public health in  areas such as the Amazon Region.    Lula also said that if he is elected, the result after five  years of his administration will be that "no child of school age  will be out of school, no one will go to bed without having had  three meals that day, and we will carry out agrarian reform, no  matter who gets hurt and no matter who cries about it."    Lula refused to support establishment of the State of  Tapajos  at a meeting with Santarem businessmen at that city's yacht  club. He said it was necessary to be cautious when considering  the establishment of new states in our country in order not to  repeat the mistakes that were made in connection with the States  of Roraima and Amapa.    The PT's potential candidate said that physicians belonging  to the Citizenship Caravan along the Amazon River, such as  Antonio Fontelles (PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], Para), could  not do anything to save a terminally ill child in the  municipality of Juruti on the border between Para and Amazonas.  According to Lula, there was no hospital in the municipality,  and the doctors could not do anything.    The meeting by the PT National Executive Committee that was  scheduled for today has been postponed until next week. Until  then, there will be no ruling on the appeal by the party's bloc  in Congress against a decision by the party's officers banning  participation by the deputies in constitutional revision.</p>

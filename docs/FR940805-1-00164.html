			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 901(a)(3)(D)(i) of the FAAct provides that before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against a person acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman, the FAA must advise the person of the charges or any reasons relied upon by the FAA for the proposed action. The FAA must also provide the person with an opportunity to answer the charges and be heard as to why an order should not be issued. The person against whom an order assessing a civil penalty is issued may appeal the order to the NTSB. These procedures are substantially similar to those provided for by section 609(a) of the FAAct (49 U.S.C. App. 1429(a)) regarding certificate actions (such as suspension and revocation of airman certificates). The procedures for taking certificate actions are found in &sect;13.19. Proposed &sect;13.18 would provide procedures for civil penalty actions in these cases in a manner substantially similar to those now used for certificate actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;13.18 procedures are different from those in &sect;13.16. Under the statutory authority for cases against persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, and repairman (new section 901(a)(3)(D) of the FAAct), the order that assesses a civil penalty is issued first, with an opportunity to appeal to the NTSB. Under the statutory authority for cases against others (former section 905 and new section 901(a)(3)(E) of the FAAct), the opportunity for a hearing is given before an order is issued and the appeal is not to the NTSB, but to DOT administrative law judges and then to the FAA Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;13.18(e), the FAA would initiate a civil penalty action against a person acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman by issuing a notice of proposed assessment. The notice would contain a statement of the charges and the proposed amount of the penalty. The person charged with the violation would be given the opportunity to respond using informal procedures, such as a written response or an informal conference with an agency attorney. This notice would satisfy the requirement under section 901(a)(3)(D)(i) that the person be advised of the charges and be given an opportunity to answer them and be heard. This procedure would be substantially the same as that used for certificate actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;13.18(b), an order of assessment may be issued following the notice and opportunity to respond. Thereafter, the person has the right to appeal the order to the NTSB under section 901(a)(3)(D)(iv) of the FAAct. Under that section of the FAAct, an appeal stays the effectiveness of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 1006 of the FAAct, a petition for review of an order of the NTSB or the Administrator may be filed with the courts of appeals of the United States or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Proposed &sect;13.18(j) would provide that the Administrator's order of assessment is not a final order of the Administrator for purposes or judicial appellate review unless it is appealed first to the NTSB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compromise of Civil Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13.16(l)(1) currently provides agency attorneys with the authority to compromise a civil penalty action with no finding of violation. Proposed &sect;13.18(k)(1) would continue to provide this authority in civil penalty assessment actions against persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, and repairmen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency attorneys may issue compromise orders after discussions and deliberations with the person charged with the violation. Frequently an agreement is reached verbally and the agency attorney issues the compromise order that reflects the agreement. The civil penalty amount agreed upon may be less than that proposed in the notice of proposed civil penalty. The person charged generally is not required to sign the compromise order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13.16(l)(1) does not specifically require the person charged either to pay the civil penalty or sign a promissory note before an order is issued. The FAA has experienced problems with this approach. When no payment is received before the issuance of a compromise order, in some cases the person fails to pay the civil penalty and debt collection procedures must be initiated. If the person has not signed a promissory note agreeing to the amount of the penalty and a payment schedule, there is a risk than the person will dispute whether the amount in the compromise order is the amount agreed upon, complicating collection proceedings. Collection procedures often are time-consuming and costly, and may not result in recovery of the full amount of the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA is proposing to require that no compromise order will be issued under &sect;13.18 unless the civil penalty is paid or a promissory note providing for installment payments is signed by the person charged. In most cases the full amount will be paid before the compromise order is issued, eliminating the possibility that collection proceedings will be needed. In those cases in which a payment schedule is used, the promissory note will show specifically what has been agreed to, which should simplify collection proceedings if they become necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the current rules do not address issues relating to debt collection after issuance of a compromise order, the approach described above has been used successfully by many agency attorneys. Furthermore, it appears to be well-accepted by the persons who agree to compromise orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Penalty Assessments Against Persons Other Than Those Acting in the Capacity of Pilots, Flight Engineers, Mechanics, and Repairmen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

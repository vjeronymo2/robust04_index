			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Come Back, Mary  </P> <P> Every holiday season for the past six years, Sheryl Mertes, a secretary at  Rocketdyne, has turned into a director-producer.  </P> <P> This year is no different.  </P> <P> The annual children's Christmas program is one of her chores as director of the  Sunday school at Our Savior's First Lutheran Church in Granada Hills. She finds  the material, enlists a musical director, gets the costumes together, casts the  40 or so parts, then turns into a nervous wreck.  </P> <P> Every year, she said, there is at least one day when she asks herself how she  could have gotten into this. That time is the Saturday before the Sunday  performance when the sanctuary, where the youngsters will perform, is the scene  of some confusion as the four-hour dress rehearsal proceeds.  </P> <P> Joseph is complaining that Mary is always walking away from the altar and  leaving him up there by himself. One of the narrators beheads some of the  poinsettias in an attempt to get the microphone cord to follow her down the  altar steps. Someone's little brother falls down and bashes his head. Several  angels have taken off their halos and are chewing on them. And there is a  rising sound of unrest from the wise men, shepherds, singers, narrators and  others in the cast of "The Story of Giving" that is not unlike the sound of  feeding time in the zoo.  </P> <P> Mertes decides that this is a good time to take the youngsters to the  recreation hall for some popcorn and punch.  </P> <P> With the help of assorted Sunday school-teaching parents, she has the cast  march single file to get their goodies. It is a wondrous sight as the 40  youngsters, ages 3 to 13, politely and quietly head on out in their First  Christmas finery.  </P> <P> Once the goodies are given out, Mertes has a moment to catch her breath.  </P> <P> She has been a member of the church for 35 years, since her parents brought her  to the San Fernando Valley from Wisconsin as a little girl. Back then, she  said, the church was just a small wooden building and there were only about 30  members. Now the church is a series of impressive buildings, including a  weekday school, and has a membership of 600, including her husband, John, a  Catholic convert, who is going to play the Voice of God in the children's  program, and her son, John Sturgis, 17, whom she has enlisted as an all-round  trouble-shooter.  </P> <P> Mertes was confirmed at this church, and her son was baptized and confirmed  there. He also did time, he said later, as a shepherd for many years.  </P> <P> Son John said he doesn't mind the Christmas program craziness at his home but  that his mother gets a bit stressed. "She gets tense, real preoccupied," he  said, "because the program is a big responsibility."  </P> <P> "I start every year in the spring getting the material and costumes so that by  the fall, we are ready to go into rehearsals," Mertes said.  </P> <P> She doesn't discuss the problems of casting the program every year, but trying  to match the expectations of the 80 or so parents and the performance abilities  of the 40 or 45 children is probably a delicate exercise.  </P> <P> Erin Carey, 6, does not have a speaking part, but she is the Virgin Mary.  </P> <P> When asked if she auditioned for the role, she looked at her inquirer and said  pertly: "No, I did not."  </P> <P> When asked why she is always walking off and leaving Joseph on the stage by  himself, she said: "I do not."  </P> <P> When asked where she goes to school, she said, "I do not remember right now,"  in a tone that clearly indicates that she wishes to be through with this  tedious star interrogation so she can get to her popcorn and punch.  </P> <P> Lance Brown, 8, one of the narrators of the Christmas program, is more willing  to accommodate an interview request.  </P> <P> Incredibly handsome in a dark suit and tie, he said that he attends Our  Savior's school during the week and that he would like to be an elevator  repairman, like his dad.  </P> <P> He has a lot of lines in the performance because, he says, he is the one who  tells the story as the performance goes along. "Last year, I got to be a  shepherd and said something with the rest of the shepherds, but this is the  first time I get to talk alone."  </P> <P> Will he be nervous, standing at the pulpit in front of the whole congregation,  having all those words to say?  </P> <P> Lance considered the question for a moment and then said, "I don't think I  will. I get to tell people that God is good and that His gift of love is the  most important one. Besides, I can read it. I can have the words in front of me  so I won't make a mistake."  </P> <P> Mistakes, however, will be made, according to Mertes. Youngsters won't show up  because they are sick or whatever. Some will trip over their lines or their  feet. But in the end, said Mertes, it will be OK.  </P> <P> "It doesn't really matter what the kids do," she said. "The parents will love  it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buying Green  </P> <P> There's a shop in Valley malls where you can buy gifts and save the planet at  the same time.  </P> <P> Natural Wonders -- with stores in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, Topanga Plaza in  Canoga Park, Glendale Galleria and Northridge Fashion Center -- is full of  books, toys, mobiles, puzzles, tapes and equipment such as binoculars and  telescopes that allow you to explore the universe. And some of the items --  like the Greenpeace calendar with a winsome otter on the cover that sells for  $8.95 -- benefit their producers, who are dedicated to protecting and  preserving the ecosystem.  </P> <P> "People seem really glad to find a place where they can buy enjoyable gifts in  a wide price range that monetarily contribute to organizations they support,"  Sherman Oaks store manager Pat Dodd said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Santa Myth  </P> <P> Not everyone loves Christmas.  </P> <P> Many of us, says Dr. Michael Gross, medical director of Pine Grove Hospital in  Canoga Park, still carry an unconscious fantasy known as the Santa Myth that  makes us expect that Christmas will be perfect for us.  </P> <P> It almost never is, he said, and some of us really get down about it.  </P> <P> Gross said there are a number of things people can do to take the pressure off.  </P> <P> * If you are lonely, sad and depressed, acknowledge it to yourself. Don't  smother the pain with alcohol, pills or pretense.  </P> <P> * If you are dreading the loneliness of being away from family and friends,  don't be alone. Invite someone else to join you, as you might wish someone to  do for you.  </P> <P> * If you are on a tight budget, be honest with yourself and loved ones. There  is no shame in doing only what you can afford.  </P> <P> * If you feel tense whenever you think of everything you have to do, sit down  and think through your priorities. Organize, plan ahead and do only what you  can.  </P> <P> Gross said we would all be better off if we took better care of ourselves. He  suggested that during the holidays it is important to get enough sleep, eat  well and slowly, exercise, take vitamins, avoid excessive amounts of coffee and  tea, and remember that cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs actually increase  stress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "I wish it were Christmas every day of the year. That way I would never get the  bills."  </P> <P>  -- Two women talking in North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / BAe near Pounds 1bn sale of Hawks to India BRITISH Aerospace, the UK aircraft maker, is set to clinch a deal which could eventually be worth Pounds 1bn to sell Hawk jet trainers to India. Defence officials in Delhi said yesterday that the Hawk had been selected for the Indian Air Force. A contract for an initial batch of up to 100 aircraft is expected to be signed within weeks, and India will probably seek to set up its own production and assembly line. The officials said that India chose the Hawk after considering the Alpha Jet from Franco-German Dassault-Dornier, and the F-5F from Northrop Corporation of the US. The Indian Air Force already has BAe Jaguar aircraft which are maintained by the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics in the southern city of Bangalore. An official said: 'There is at least 95 per cent commonality between the Jaguar and the Hawk engine, so once we get the jet trainer Bangalore will be in a position to service and maintain the fleet with minimum additional costs and eventually to assemble and manufacture the components.' The Hawk uses a modified version of the Jaguar's Rolls-Royce Turbofan engine. The aircraft are built at Warton in Lancashire and Brough on Humberside, and the deal would help safeguard jobs at a time of cuts. BAe ousts executive, Page 27</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology: Holiday snaps make TV debut Another milestone in the onward march of multimedia will be passed in September with the worldwide launch of Kodak's much-trumpeted Photo CD system - conversion of 35mm photographs to digital images for display on televisions or personal computers. By then, two years will have passed since Kodak announced the system, but William Jack, vice-president for worldwide electronic imaging systems and consumer imaging, stresses the US company has not been twiddling its thumbs. What was a concept, based on an intensive 18-month effort pulling together all the technologies within Kodak, has become a product, with the help of know-how and hardware from outside the company. In the intervening period Kodak has been talking to software suppliers, hardware manufacturers and systems integrators to establish the Photo CD standard. 'There are no obstacles to the broadest participation by photographic and consumer electronics companies in this one standard,' says Jack. The consumer wishing to playback photos, new or old, via Photo CD will be able to choose between three Kodak Photo CD players manufactured by Philips in Belgium. But the disks and players will be widely available through the licensing of Kodak software and the Photo CD trademark. 'You'll be able to read Fuji Photo CD on a disk, and all our photographic competitors will be aboard at the outset,' says Jack. For the computer market, which Jack sees as equally important and in many cases overlapping, the ease of access and use of Photo CD is particularly important, and is being addressed through Kodak's Photo CD Access development toolkit and software. Kodak's discussions have been helped by the computer industry's need for something new to boost flagging revenues. In the high street, photographers will be able to pay Pounds 4.99 for a special Photo CD disk, and Pounds 7.95 for having 24 exposures written digitally on to it. Further exposures can be added, up to a maximum of 100. The Kodak Photo CD players will cost Pounds 299, Pounds 369, and Pounds 429 in the UK, and can also play audio CDs. Ravi Khanna, the UK product manager for Photo CD, believes the mid-priced model, which has extra functions such as zoom, crop and rotate, will prove the most popular. The Kodak system, along with other adventures into multimedia, has inevitably raised questions about consumer reaction. The advantage of the Kodak system is the simplicity of the system and the fact that the camera itself - and the routine visits to high street kiosks to get the film developed - is unaffected. Whether consumers will pay to watch still pictures via Photo CD players when they could watch moving pictures via camcorders remains to be seen. Jack is increasingly confident that they will, but Kodak has also been careful to 'future-proof' its investment - the picture quality is four times the standard that will be required for HDTV.</p>

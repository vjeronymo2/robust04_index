			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Nedlloyd under new pressure from Hagen NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, has come under renewed pressure from Mr Torstein Hagen, the dissident shareholder who forced the company to appoint him to its supervisory board in the autumn. He is seeking an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to make changes which would amount to a lifting of some of its anti-takeover defences. DNO, the Norwegian-based oil company of which Mr Hagen is chairman, said yesterday it wanted Nedlloyd to end the restrictions on voting rights, to abolish its priority shares, and to change the system of electing its supervisory board, all of which are common mechanisms in the Netherlands to protect a company from outside influences or takeover. Nedlloyd said it would consider DNO's request to call a meeting. Mr Hagen's company said the proposed changes were designed to make Nedlloyd more responsive to shareholders. A company official declined to elaborate, but said Mr Hagen would hold a press conference today in Oslo. It described Mr Hagen as feeling 'frustrated', after attending only a couple of Nedlloyd supervisory board meetings, about his inability to make a 'constructive impact'. It said the root of Nedlloyd's problems was its self-perpetuating supervisory board, which, similar to other big Dutch companies, appoints its own members. DNO wants the supervisory board to be elected by shareholders. 'Any refusal by the current supervisory board to go along with this proposal can only be seen as an effort by this body to protect its own and management's entrenched positions.' DNO said its proposals were supported by six other large shareholders, but it did not name them. Mr Hagen is believed to control up to 25 per cent of Nedlloyd's shares.</p>

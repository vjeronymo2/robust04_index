			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Officials of Contra Costa County, one of the wealthiest in the state, are  trying to persuade their affluent cities to contribute funds for temporary  homeless shelters. The officials are also fighting to keep National Guard  armories open until they can find temporary shelter for more than 650 people  who live on the county's streets. "We didn't have this uncaring attitude during  the Depression," said Larry Organ, an aide to county Supervisor Tom Powers.  "People brought people in need into their homes. Now they wander the street  while we're in the most expansive economic period in our history since World  War II." Powers and Richmond Mayor George Livingston led a rally at a local  armory to convince the governor and county residents that homelessness is  everyone's problem.  </P></p>

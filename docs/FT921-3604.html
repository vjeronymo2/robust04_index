			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia in disarray over Sakhalin oil RUSSIAN DEPUTIES are still in disarray over whether to block the award to a US-Japanese consortium of a feasibility study for the development of oil and gas reserves off the far eastern Sakhalin Island. But despite this latest illustration of the chaos involved in trying to do business in Russia, the consortium is optimistic that it will conclude a feasibility study agreement by an end-March deadline agreed with the Russian government. Negotiators from the various parties, including Sakhalinmorneftegas, the local oil and gas enterprise, are already in Moscow to finalise the terms and conditions of the contract - even though it is understood that the Russian government has yet to appoint its negotiating team. The government chose the consortium - made up of McDermott, the US engineering company, Marathon Oil Company, and Japan's Mitsui - as the winners of a much dragged out tender process at the end of January. The contract, which has yet to be signed, is to conduct a study into developing two oil and gas fields with estimated reserves of 90m tonnes of oil and condensate and 350bn cubic metres of gas. But after a protest from the island's governor, Mr Valentin Fyodorov, a special parliamentary commission was set up to investigate his claims that the deal would harm local interests and that the tender was badly structured. Following the passing of a Monday deadline for a parliamentary decision on the issue, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the deputy speaker who also heads the commission, said in a newspaper interview that a decision would be reached 'in a few days' time'. He suggested that the commission would clear the deal on condition that the government introduce anti-monopoly measures for the exploitation of reserves. But a colleague on the commission, Mr Sergei Mikhailov, said yesterday that some members, including himself, wanted to scrap the deal and start the tender all over again. To further confuse matters, it is not yet clear is what the two deputies mean when they talk of the need to divide up 'the territory' among rival consortia. If they mean sharing out the two fields - the gas-rich Lunskoye and the oil-rich Piltun-Astokhskoye, which are the subjects of the study - one executive from the consortium said the deal would probably lose its attraction. If they mean dividing up the whole 17,000 sq km off Sakhalin, thought to contain mineral wealth, of which the two fields represent a mere 5-10 per cent, the consortium would have no objections, even though a feasibility study into one part could not avoid looking at the long-term prospects for developing the whole area. Ukraine has found a partial solution to its energy crisis by signing a deal directly with the oil-producing Tiumen region in western Siberia, the Ukrainian prime minister's office announced yesterday, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Under the agreement, concluded in Tiumen on March 5 by Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister, and Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Tiumen region chief administrator, Tiumen will supply Ukraine with an emergency 3.9m tonnes of oil within the next two months. This is crucial for Ukraine because a cut in traditional supplies from Russia has jeopardised the spring sowing of crops. Tiumen has also agreed to provide an additional 2m tonnes of oil above and beyond the 40m tonnes Russia as a whole had contracted to supply to Ukraine in an earlier agreement. Inter-governmental economic deals within the former Soviet Union have been honoured most often in the breach and to prevent this Ukraine and the Tiumen region have agreed to create co-ordinating centres in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and the city of Tiumen. In exchange for the oil Ukraine has agreed to provide Tiumen with food, consumer goods and manufactured goods at 1990 levels. Ukraine has also promised to provide social guarantees for the 600,000 Ukrainians currently employed in the Tiumen oil fields. Tiumen officials have worried they might lose their workforce when the roubles they pay their Ukrainian workers are replaced by a different currency in Ukraine. Since becoming independent late last year Ukraine has sought to decrease its dependence on the Russian central government for costly oil. One avenue has been an agreement to purchase 5m tonnes from Iran.</p>

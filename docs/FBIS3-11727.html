CN coordinator Jose Miguel Uzcategui said the party  has already told the president their position. He also said,  however, that CN legislation experts have studied the empowering  bill proposed by AD and have found that financial and economic  outlines, which should have been included in the proposal, are  missing. He also said that analysts have been looking into past  experiences with previous empowering laws, particularly those  during former President Ramon J. Velasquez' time when he was  forced to apply measures, like the value-added tax, on consumers.    [Begin Uzcategui recording] Additionally, we must discuss  the  temporary nature of the law. Three of the previous experiences  lasted one year each and the last one lasted five months. We  believe some decrees can be drafted and enacted in 30 days. This  period of time, however, is too short for fiscal measures. [end  recording]    Finally, Uzcategui said it is the president which must  decide  on an empowering bill, providing the president is familiar with  the bill's definitive wording.</p>

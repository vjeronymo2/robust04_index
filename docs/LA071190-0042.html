			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SCAPAN' GETS OCEAN ACCESS IN DEL MAR  </P> <P> It's not possible to compete with an azure sky overlooking a crystalline ocean  rippling gently in the summer breezes in this town. All an open-air adaptation  of Moliere can hope to do is complement the weather.  </P> <P> And the setting. To say the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble performs in a shopping  mall is to say Van Gogh did oils. The Del Mar Plaza, current home to this  family-oriented theater, is one of the smallest and classiest commercial  enterprises of its sort, with lots of flowers, open space and elegant fountains  to take the edge off the commerce.  </P> <P> On one of these open decks, with the Pacific Ocean taking up all of stage left,  the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble is presenting "Scapan -- A Family Farce," adapted  from Moliere's "Les Fourberies de Scapin" by the director, Bill Ball.  </P> <P>  Bill Ball? The very same who founded and was artistic director of San  Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre (and who was last seen in a smiling  performance as Gaev in the recently closed La Jolla Playhouse production of  "The Cherry Orchard").  </P> <P> Ball has not permanently ventured into family theater (he now lives in  Hollywood), but Del Mar Ensemble artistic director Bonnie Tarwater, a former  Ball student, invited him to create this production for her year-old company.  </P> <P> Is this another one of Scapin's/Scapan's tomfooleries? Not exactly, but Ball is  up to some of his better old tricks with this "Scapan," which nimbly relies on  the slapstick of commedia dell'arte in much the same way that did his memorable  ACT production of "Taming of the Shrew," wherein the stage was a boxing ring  with the players sitting about its edges when it was not their turn to play.  </P> <P> In this tale of confused identities, the plot is standard. Scot Bishop is the  wily servant Scapan, who manages to rob a pair of miserly fathers of their  authority and money, reward their lovesick sons with the women they want for  wives, and come out of it all relatively unscathed.  </P> <P> With the actors eclectically garbed in yellow and white, like an omelet gone  berserk, this "Scapan" displays more spit than polish, but disappointed none of  its younger viewers, spellbound in pint-size chairs under the canopy that  covers the stage and sitting areas.  </P> <P> Bishop commands the tools of his trade, but lacks the natural playfulness of a  true comedian, executing Scapan's antics more by the book than the seat of the  pants.  </P> <P> Phony beards and mustaches conceal Randall Walton's and Dan A. Epstein's peach  fuzz as the glowering fathers, Geronte and Argante. Christopher Nelson  (Octavio) and Bradley Thompson (Leander) are their panting, smitten sons, with  Julie Ann Rogelstad (Hyacinthe and Erica Shaffer (Zerbinette) as the objects of  their obsessions. Mike Hockett does a worthy strut as Octavio's servant,  Sylvester, while Michael Murdoch fills in some significant gaps.  </P> <P> But fine points aren't the issue in comedy this broad. Swiftness, smiles and  simplicity are, and "Scapan" has them all.  </P> <P> Accessibility too. The good news is that the show will go on in this paradise  all summer. The bad news is that the company has just lost its indoor home,  which the Del Mar Plaza developers had made available in a corner of their  upscale mall (along with a $5,000 subsidy for each production).  </P> <P> "We are redefining children's theater and are more committed to it every day,"  Tarwater said. "Being in a shopping center has been part of that evolution.  People don't put their kids in their Volvos and drive downtown to take them to  the theater. We want to bring something of depth and importance to children.  They sell $700 dresses here and we're trying to sell $3 tickets for children's  theater."  </P> <P> First mistake.  </P> <P> Tickets should be free. Volvos or no Volvos, mall theater is street theater.  You can't control or contain an audience, and freeloading bystanders are a fact  of life.  </P> <P> But, look at it another way. The theater's presence attracts families to the  mall where they'll spend money, sooner or later, one place or another. Ergo,  the future for the Del Mar Ensemble must lie in getting developers -- not  necessarily these -- to provide shelter and funds to cover the whole cost of  production. That, to echo Tarwater, could be "a win-win situation."  </P> <P>  "Scapan" will play La Jolla's Golden Triangle Saturday 7 p.m. and La Jolla  Village Square Aug. 26,2 p.m. The regular schedule at Del Mar Plaza, 15th  Street and Camino del Mar, is Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. until July  22, then Saturdays and Sundays at 3 and7 p.m. until Sept. 2. $3-$5.  Information: (619) 259-6127.  </P> <P> </P></p>

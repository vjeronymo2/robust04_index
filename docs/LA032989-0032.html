			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 14-YEAR-OLD CHARGED WITH MURDER OF GIRL  </P> <P> A Newhall teen-ager accused of strangling a 7-year-old girl to death, then  hiding her body in his bedroom for four days, was charged Tuesday with one  count of first-degree murder, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said.  </P> <P> The 14-year-old, whose identity is being withheld because of his age, is  scheduled to be arraigned today in Sylmar Juvenile Court, said Deputy Dist.  Atty. Michelle R. Rosenblatt.  </P> <P> An autopsy has determined that the victim, Sara Nan Hodges, died of  strangulation, but test results were pending on whether she was sexually  assaulted, authorities said.  </P> <P> The suspect was arrested late Sunday after the girl's body was found stuffed  between a wall and the headboard of a water bed in one of two rooms the boy and  his mother rent in the 24900 block of Alderbrook Drive. Sara, who lived five  doors away, had been missing since Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> The girl's fully clothed body was found by the boy's landlady, who was looking  for the source of a sickening smell. Authorities said the boy had set up a fan  in the bedroom to blow the odor out an open window.  </P> <P> Because of juvenile privacy laws, Rosenblatt said she would not discuss reports  that the boy had committed burglaries in Florida, where he previously lived  with his father. The boy moved to Newhall in February to stay with his mother,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Rosenblatt said the youth will ultimately face an adjudication hearing before a  Juvenile Court judge. The hearing is similar to a criminal court trial except  that a judge instead of a jury decides the defendant's guilt or innocence,  Rosenblatt said.  </P> <P> Although he cannot be tried as an adult, the teen-ager, if convicted, could  serve time in the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Authorities said  to be tried as an adult in California, the defendant must be 16 or older.  </P></p>

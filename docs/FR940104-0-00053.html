Legal Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations are being promulgated under the authority of sections 2002(a) and 3001(b) and (e)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6921(b) and (e)(1), and 6922 (commonly referred to as RCRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 3001(e) of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required to make a hazardous waste listing determination for wastes containing chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. As part of this mandate, the Agency began an investigation in 1988 of dioxin-containing wastes from wood preserving and wood surface protection processes. Three categories of wastes from wood preserving processes were listed as hazardous wastes in 1990, (F032, F034, and F035, see 55 FR 50450). A final listing determination for wood surface protection process wastes were deferred due to lack of data (53 FR 53282). In 1991, the Agency began a separate study of the surface protection industry in an effort to obtain sufficient information upon which to base a hazardous waste listing determination. The Agency, upon obtaining and evaluating information, published a proposed rule on April 27, 1993 which proposed a concentration-based hazardous waste listing option and requested comment on an alternative option not to list these wastes as hazardous (58 FR 25707). Details of the options can be found in the following section to this preamble. A detailed summary of all Agency actions related to wood surface protection wastes was provided in the April 27, 1993 proposal (58 FR 25707). The reader is encouraged to consult that document for more information on the wood surface protection rulemaking history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with a proposed consent decree signed by EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Browner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, case no. 89&hyph;0591), the Agency has agreed to make a final listing determination for chlorophenolic wastes from wood surface protection processes by December 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of the Wood Surface Protection Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considerable review and study of the rulemaking docket for this action, including comments received on the proposal, the Agency has determined that listing as hazardous wastes from surface protection operations is unnecessary and will not yield the benefits intended by a hazardous waste listing under the RCRA program. This section summarizes elements of the proposed rule of April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25707), and details the conclusions reached in developing this final rule. The reader is cautioned that although some of the highlights brought up in the proposed rule are described below, the majority of information on the industry itself as well as the detailed risk assessment on which the initial proposed rule was based is found in the preamble and background documents to the proposed rule. The information contained in this final rule is primarily concerned with developments subsequent to the proposed rule. This rule describes, in detail, the Agency's justification for not listing wastes from surface protection processes that use chlorophenolic formulations. In addition, it summarizes the Agency's response to comments received on the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Overview of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The April 27, 1993 proposal discussed and requested comment on each of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Proposing a concentration-based hazardous waste listing for certain wood surface protection wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Proposing various testing, analysis, recordkeeping requirements and management standards for wood surface protection plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Adding six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261, (4) Amending of appendix VII of 40 CFR part 261 by adding F033 and the hazardous constituents found in the wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Modifying the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) list of hazardous substances to reflect the newly proposed listing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Amending SW&hyph;846 (``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) An alternative option not listing chlorophenolic wastes as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency proposed to list as hazardous at 40 CFR 261.31 only those wastes from wood surface protection processes using a formulation with a pentachlorophenate concentration greater than 0.1 ppm. Under this proposed option, surface protection operations using formulations with pentachlorophenate concentrations equal to or less than 0.1 ppm would not generate F033 listed wastes. The Agency proposed this concentration-based listing because it had information which suggested that many surface protectors who previously used chlorophenolics did not sufficiently clean out equipment prior to abandoning the use of chlorophenolics. Because of this, many formulations from past users of chlorophenolics exhibit ``cross-contamination,'' the contamination of current formulations by dioxins and chlorophenolic compounds from old formulations. The rule proposed the following hazardous waste listing description for the F033 waste code and included the following specific waste streams from process operations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> F033:Process residuals, wastewaters that come into contact with protectant, discarded spent formulation, and protectant drippage from wood surface protection processes at plants that use surface protection chemicals having an in-process formulation concentration of pentachlorophenate (expressed as pentachlorophenol during analysis) exceeding 0.1 ppm.

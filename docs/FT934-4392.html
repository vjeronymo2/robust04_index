			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's mining giant up for sale next year Centromin, Peru's state-owned mining and refining giant, will go on the auction block early next year, company president Mr Hernan Barreto told delegates to Metals Bulletin's Latin America conference, which opened in Lima yesterday. According to Mr Barreto, the company has a portfolio of 22 mining projects all over Peru 'waiting for investors to come along', in addition to the seven units currently operating. In all it has over 2,000m tonnes of proven and probable reserves, The most important projects are Toromocho and Antamina, which have pre-feasibility studies completed and are intended to replace Centromin's Cobriza copper mine, where reserves are expected to run out in six years. Centromin is a vast mining and metallurgical complex that has developed over 90 years (until 1974 operated by the US-based Cerro de Pasco Corporation). The decision has been definitively taken to sell it as a single unit. Mr Barreto was coy about the actual value he would place on Centromin, although he mentioned 'several hundred million (dollars)'. Assets total Dollars 1.6bn, he said, but the new owner would have to assume substantial company liabilities as well. The sale of what Mr Barreto admitted was a hugely complex asset will be facilitated if secondary debt paper is accepted. A new law, passed by Peru's Congress on 19 November, sets the framework for Peruvian debt to be used in privatisation - under this ruling a minimum 10 per cent will still have to be paid in cash. Precise details are to be worked out on a case-by-case basis but the prospect was viewed with 'great enthusiasm', Mr Barreto said. Twenty-four companies pre-qualified to bid for Centromin, but an unspecified number have pulled out as a consequence of the decision not to split the company into separate units. According to Mr Barreto, 'three or four' major international companies remain seriously interested and are forming bidding consortia - industry sources say these include Mexico's Penoles, Britain's RTZ, Cominco of Canada and South Korea's Daewoo. For all its problems - of which environmental pollution is perhaps the most daunting - Centromin looks a much more attractive investment prospect today than it did two years ago. Under a new, private-sector board, a 1991 loss of Dollars 163m was turned into pre-tax profits of Dollars 26m last year. Poor international minerals prices this year pushed profits to September down to just under Dollars 4m, however. But, says the indefatigably optimistic Mr Barreto, Centromin is a 'very attractive prospect'. It is polymetallic (40 per cent of current income comes from zinc, 28 per cent from copper, 20 per cent from silver and 11 per cent from lead) so income is diversified and partially protected from price fluctuations. It is a going concern with a wide range of assets and projects. And, importantly for the future owner, the workforce has been sharply reduced from 19,000 two years ago to today's 11,700, while at the same time output has been increased.</p>

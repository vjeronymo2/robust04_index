			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Music at the Barbican It must presumably be a coincidence that the Docklands Sinfonietta has looked to opera for its conductors to start the year. The week before last it turned to the Royal Opera's Edward Downes and at the Barbican on Monday to Sian Edwards, the newly-appointed Music Director in waiting at English National Opera - this orchestra has its eye on the future, too. To judge from this pair of concerts the Docklands Sinfonietta has a gritty determination to get to the top. At the first the technical strength of the strings had been well tested and on Monday we were introduced to no less impressive wind and brass sections. They make a hard-working young orchestra, forging their style through the sheer vitality and tenacity of their playing, as perhaps befits a group born into the difficult world of London Docklands in the 1990s. There was not actually any operatic music on the programme. For a chamber group of its size the Docklands Sinfonietta is ambitious to choose romantic scores by Ravel and Dvorak, especially in the Barbican Hall, where the small band of strings was compelled to spend much of the evening on overdrive. I felt that Ravel's Ma Mere l'Oye, its new-found simplicity of textures recalling the original piano pieces, came across better than the Dvorak, a bracing and rather hard-edged account of the Sixth Symphony. Nevertheless, the actual playing in both had some exciting moments. And in between came one wholly exciting performance, of Britten's Violin Concerto with Tasmin Little as the soloist. This was a meeting of minds, for neither Miss Little nor Sian Edwards is a musician who likes to deal in uncertainties, and the concerto came across with bold conviction. Completed in 1939, the work caught Britten at the apex of his dazzling early powers. Its writing, both for the violin and the orchestra, is unashamedly brilliant and yet it is not often that one senses the performers allowing themselves to revel in its virtuosity. Perhaps Tasmin Little makes less of the bitter-sweet lyricism than one would like; but as soon as speed and definition are called for, she drove the music on with real purpose and some fairly scintillating playing. The last pages of the score were not the questioning look back with a tear in the eye that they usually feel, but a defiant facing of impending wartime suffering head on, the violin part straining in its intensity, the orchestra brutally cold. In its own way it was the most convincing live performance of the concerto that I have heard. Just a month ago, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos led the London Symphony in a triumphant account of Strauss's Symphonia Domestica. At the Barbican on Sunday Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony was at least triumphal; also intelligent, and utterly controlled, but more interesting than deeply stirring, for all the noise it made. The London Symphony Chorus in full cry were admirable. Fruhbeck de Burgos preferred quadruple woodwinds for this symphony (no extra horns, though), and used them unstintingly: one interesting effect was that for much of the time they seemed to carry most of the main argument, with the strings almost in supporting roles. There were no 'visionary' effects, and very little aural theatre - unless one counted the low strings' beautiful sotto voce in the first appearance of the 'Freude' tune. The chorus, too, sustained a fine, unwavering pianissimo for the difficult 'Sternenzelt' music. The overriding impression nonetheless, mostly loud, was of a knotty, densely argued piece of severe cut (like the 'Hammerklavier' Sonata of the same time), vigorously expounded by someone who knows the score very well indeed. One admired; one wasn't moved, not even by the Adagio, excellently modelled and motivated though it was. For the solo team, the baritone Erich Knodt led off in stentorian style, passionate rather than sage. Though Lubica Rybarska's bright-edged, slightly shrill soprano was not well matched with Alfreda Hodgson's big, penetrating tones, the whole quartet - with Ben Heppner's elegant tenor - carried its weight and more. Before his Strauss last month, the conductor had planted a rivetting performance of neglected Sibelius, Night-ride and Sunrise. This time he chose the Schicksalslied of Brahms (after Holderlin): usually hard to programme, since it is shortish but requires substantial choral weight, but best-vintage Brahms, with its luminous Elysian idyll at the start and later its from-the-heart representation of the troubled modern conscience. The faithful art with which Burgos captured the tone and the piercing anxiety, no less than the distinguished work of the chorus, went a long way toward claiming a permanent place in the repertoire for the Schicksalslied.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Ex-Pact states in tank talks with Germany Krauss-Maffei, makers of the Leopard II battle tank, are in 'growing discussions' about delivering tank technology to members of the former Warsaw Pact in central Europe. Such deals are still forbidden under laws which prevent Germany from exporting to countries with which it is not allied, but there have been indications that restrictions on exports to central Europe will be lifted much sooner than similar bans on exports to sensitive areas in the Middle East. 'These talks are taking place not only at the defence ministry but also at company level,' Mr Gerhard Haas, the head of Krauss-Maffei's military hardware division, said in a recent interview. Such agreements would include exchange of information about all aspects of tank manufacture, including electronics and armour, the company said. The new Leopard II is now the main battle tank in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, while Sweden is shortly expected to sign a DM1bn (Dollars 628m) contract to buy 120 tanks with the possible purchase of a further 80 in the future. While about 75 per cent of Germany's arms building programmes are already undertaken in co-operation with several Nato allies, the closer links with Sweden are the first such initiative with a non-Nato member. The German defence ministry, however, said it had no knowledge about deals to deliver technology. A spokesman said there were several agreements with Poland, Hungary and other central European states to co-operate on education and other contacts designed to develop greater confidence between armies which faced each other, fully armed, for over 40 years. Military production in the former Warsaw Pact countries has been in steep decline since the 1989 collapse of communism, further exacerbated by the loss of markets and lack of funds to restructure or convert outmoded military hardware factories. Mr Burkhard Wollschlager, chief executive, said Krauss Maffei was also working with Mercedes-Benz and the French companies Giat and Panhard on a medium-sized armoured vehicle due for development in 1996. Krauss-Maffei, which is 71 per cent owned by the industrial conglomerate Mannesmann, has not produced any new tanks since April 1993 but is presently upgrading 225 Leopards for the German army and will begin work on another 180 for the Dutch armed forces.</p>

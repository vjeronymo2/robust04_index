			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Stability was the  watchword stressed by Chinese Premier Li Peng when he spoke here  today to an ongoing national conference of civil affairs  officials.    He stressed the need for all staffs to do their utmost to  help people overcome difficulties in their life and work,  maintain social order and promote material and cultural progress.    He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that without a stable  social and political environment, it would be impossible to  carry out reforms or construction.    "In the early period of establishing a socialist market  economic structure, it is of strategic importance to maintain  social stability," he told the delegates.    This was an invaluable experience which China has acquired  through reforms over the past ten-plus years, he added.    He praised civil affairs departments for their work over the  past decades to maintain social stability by solving various  kinds of social problems.    "The success in civil affairs work will help create a fine  social environment for China's economic construction, thus  promoting the coordinated social and economic development," he  said.    The premier also urged governments at all levels to pay  close  attention to solving the problem of poverty in rural areas.    He said that it was necessary to reform the present system  under which people relied solely on the government for relief,  and to institute a new system for relief work at different  levels.    He called on civil affairs staffs to make still greater  contributions to maintaining social stability and promoting  cultural progress by protecting the people's interests and  rights, regulating social relations and solving social problems.</p>

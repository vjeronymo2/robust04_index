			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by editorial staff writer Yasuhiro Tase: "The </F> `Nagano Statement' Was Expected--Nagano Appointed To Prepare for  Establishment of a `National Emergency Law'"]    [Text] In viewing the press interviews of the assumption of  office by the minister of justice, I was given the impression  that Mr. Shigeto Nagano clearly differs from other cabinet  members. The reason was that his sincerity could be sensed from  his facial expressions and he gave the impression that he was  expressing his own ideas in his own words.    I was surprised when he said, "I have had my own personal  thoughts on legislation concerning national emergencies." I  immediately felt that he would soon be fired for making a  problem statement.    In viewing his television press conference concerning  retraction of his statement, he was making the statement as if  he were doing so with great pain. As he said, "The statement was  inappropriate," he did make an apology, but his facial  expression reeked of the pain of having to make a statement in  which he had no true conviction.    This incident will be forgotten by society because of his  removal from the position, until someone else makes a problem  statement. Instead of considering the matter closed, there is a  need to thoroughly evaluate the significance of this statement.    There's the logical criticism asking, "Why did they appoint  an individual with such ideas as minister of justice?" But, I do  not agree. Perhaps they appointed him as minister of justice  because he was an individual who "embraced such ideas."    Mr. Nagano once served in the highest position in the Ground  Self-Defense Force as chief of staff. He also served as an  influential member of the Ozawa Research Council during the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] days. Accordingly, I feel that  his appointment as minister of justice was not unrelated to the  situation in the Korean peninsula.    The most controversial issue in the process of formulating  the basic policies for the coalition parties was measures to be  taken in response to the situation on the Korean peninsula. And,  even during the secret conferences held at the Prime Minister's  Official Residence during the Hosokawa government days, the  foremost issue tabled was "the legal basis for actions in the  event of an emergency."    The cabinet's Legislation Bureau asserted that actions  feasible under current law were very limited. For that reason,  legislation visualizing "emergencies" became a new issue for the  coalition government. The basic agreement of the coalition  parties reads, "The government will make provision for  responding to emergency situations under the provisions of the  Japanese Constitution." They made provision for possible new  legislation or revision of existing law by referring to the  "current constitution" rather than "current law."    Perhaps the foremost issue for the Hata cabinet includes a  response to the situation on the Korean peninsula and to use the  response as a basis for making provision for "national  emergencies." Even Koji Kakizawa, who accomplished the unusual  feat of being appointed as foreign minister immediately  following his resignation from the LDP, has stated, "We need to  consider what sort of issues will face us in an emergency and  what sort of legislation is necessary."    Accordingly, we should view Mr. Nagano's appointment to the  cabinet as designed to provide for preparation of legislation  reflective of security concerns. In the past, the minister of  justice's position attracted attention as being associated with  prosecutors in charge of investigation of corruption cases.  However, I cannot help but be amazed at the Nagano statement for  its brilliance in striking the blind spot of public opinion.    Such ulterior motives clearly conflict with Prime Minister  Hata's position in which he states that he shares former Prime  Minister Hosokawa's opinion about "responsibility for World War  II." The prime minister's response to the Nagano statement  reflected a kind of hesitancy most probably because the  appointment to the position of minister of justice was not Mr.  Hata's idea, but Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's way  of preparing for the establishment of a national emergency  system.    Mr. Ozawa is steadily making preparations towards realizing  his professed goal of a "normal nation." His consistency in  working towards that goal reflects no hesitancy whatsoever. The  problem is that most of the public and the political world,  including Prime Minister Hata, have not become aware of that  fact.    There is one more aspect to be considered. That aspect  concerns the question of whether Mr. Nagano who is a graduate of  the Army Academy, former Japanese army officer, and former chief  of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, qualifies as a  "civilian" as defined in the second paragraph of Article 66 of  the Constitution which reads, "The prime minister and other  ministers of state must be civilians."    Just like the controversy about whether the Self-Defense  Forces constitute a "military organization," there are a variety  of positions on the term "civilians." The pros and cons of this  issue should be debated as long as positions exist like that of  Nobuyoshi Ashibe, who states in his book, The  Constitution, "The growth of the Self-Defense Forces has  evolved into the strong theory that members of the Self-Defense  Forces are not civilians, meaning civilians must be those who  are not career military personnel and those who never served as  career military personnel."    Incidents encompassing "problem statements, unfavorable  reactions from Asian nations, and removal of cabinet officials"  concerning Japan's responsibilities for World War II continue  forever, because we have not arrived at a historical conclusion  as to exactly what we had done in connection with World War II.    Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of  World War II. Unless we complete an examination which accurately  portrays the facts, we will be prone to repeat the same mistakes  again and again. If we merely engage in a debate of  "aggression," it will not serve to resolve the issue in a true  sense. Perhaps, we should begin with the task of determining  just exactly what happened in Nanjing.</p>

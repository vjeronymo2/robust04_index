			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Earnings fall at S Korean electronic companies SOUTH Korea's leading electronic companies expanded sales last year but suffered a sharp decline in profitability, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. Samsung Electronics, the nation's largest electronics company and the second largest group overall, posted sales of Won5,220bn (Dollars 11.1bn) in 1991, up 15.9 per cent from Won4,500bn a year earlier. However, its net earnings fell 6.04 per cent to Won68.6bn from Won73.01bn in 1990. Goldstar, posted net earnings of Won18.5bn on sales of Won3,680bn. These represent a 23.5 per cent gain in sales from Won2,980bn in 1990, but a sharp 44.9 per cent decline in net earnings from Won33.6bn for the same period a year earlier. Daewoo Electronics posted a 20.6 per cent rise in sales to Won1,580bn from Won1,310bn for the comparable period. Its net earnings expanded 4.6 per cent to Won13.6bn from Won13bn. The poor performance in profits by these three large electronics groups was the result of losses of revenue from exports, particularly consumer electronics, the backbone of their business. Shares of the three companies have nose-dived in the local stock market late last year on a wave of speculation that they would report full-year losses for 1991 as they were losing money on exports of consumer electronics and computers.</p>

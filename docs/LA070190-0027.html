			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIQUE;  </P> <P> INTERSTATE TOWER: ART OF THE DEAL;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: DEAL MAKING IS THE PRIMARY ART FORM EXPRESSED IN THE WEST COAST'S  TALLEST BUILDING. IT WAS SHAPED BY A TANGLE OF AGREEMENTS THAT PUT ELEGANCE AT  A DISTANCE.  </P> <P> Looking north up Hope Street, you can see a radical change in the skyline of  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> One of Los Angeles' major urban vistas, once crowned by the charming tower and  tiled pyramid of Bertram Goodhue's 1920s Central Library, is now dominated by  the slim white cylinder of the 73-story First Interstate World Center.  </P> <P> Now the tallest building on the West Coast, the 1,017-foot First Interstate  tower looms over the Central Library, which is now undergoing a $150-million  renovation and expansion.  </P> <P> Designed by a team of New York City architects -- Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp;  Partners in association with Harold Fredenburgh -- the tower stands out on the  downtown skyline as a graceful beacon visible for miles, marking the center of  the city.  </P> <P> From close up, however, the tower is less elegant than it seems from a  distance. The soaring shaft's faceted circular volume, narrowing toward the  top, is too blandly detailed to hold the viewer's interest.  </P> <P> And a sharp drop in level between Hope and 5th streets at the tower's base,  marked by an outdoor grand stairway, adds to the feeling that the  1.3-million-square-foot building, squeezed onto a small site, is a little too  big for its boots.  </P> <P> The building's developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, believes that the  distinctive white tower is Los Angeles' "signature" skyscraper, the city's  architectural climax. But the building is an act of architecture only  secondarily.  </P> <P> The primary art form expressed in the shape and character of the First  Interstate World Center is not architecture, but a dizzying, seven-year  exercise in deal making.  </P> <P> The complex deals and trade-offs that made the tower possible limited the size  of its site, added 20 floors to its height and determined the upper-level  setbacks, which shaped its silhouette.  </P> <P> After this, the architects' options were confined to finessing the tower's  profile, detailing its skin and attempting to design a humanely scaled  street-level presence for the massive shaft.  </P> <P> This situation is analogous to having a painting's size, shape and composition  negotiated by art dealers, then hiring an artist to fill in the colors and  elaborate the picture frame.  </P> <P> The artful deal making made concrete in the First Interstate tower was founded  on a brilliant scheme to help pay for the Central Library's ambitious  renovation and expansion without -- at that time -- spending a penny of public  money.  </P> <P> The plan involved an agreement by the city to sell the potential development  rights presumed to exist in the air over the library to Maguire Thomas  Partners.  </P> <P> Shunted across 5th Street, this chunk of unbuilt air added the 20 extra stories  to the height the First Interstate tower would normally have been permitted  under current downtown zoning laws.  </P> <P> To finesse the deal, Maguire Thomas Partners then sold half the building's  equity to Pacific Enterprises and negotiated a further agreement with the  Community Redevelopment Agency to build another 52-story office high-rise on  5th Street across Grand Avenue.  </P> <P> This is a bare-bones outline of a financial and political process that involved  numerous city agencies and elected officials, First Interstate Bank, the major  law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, broker and developer John C. Cushman III and  a host of other players.  </P> <P> Pacific Enterprises President James R. Ukropina is reported to have said in a  moment of exhaustion that the complex wheeling and dealing "pushed people to  the edge of insanity."  </P> <P> But developer Robert F. Maguire III views the process differently. He says the  extra height added to the First Interstate tower was simply the result of a  need to raise extra funds for the ever-increasing expense of the Central  Library's expansion and renovation.  </P> <P> "Originally, we had envisioned no more than a 50-story building," Maguire said.  "However, as the CRA and library staff plans for the library grew, costs went  up."  </P> <P> The library's budget increased so much, Maguire said, that the CRA proposed  that he build the second building across Grand Avenue to provide additional  funding.  </P> <P> "We were never comfortable with having the tallest building in the city,"  Maguire insisted. "We are emphatically opposed to that kind of symbolism -- it  is not in our culture."  </P> <P> But now that the 73-story tower is a reality, Maguire feels it's "substantially  superior to the earlier versions of 50 stories, that looked like a stuffed  Polish sausage."  </P> <P> After the deals were done, the architects were left to make what they could of  the tower shape they were handed -- a challenge complicated by the awkward  change of levels at the shaft's base.  </P> <P> "Granting primacy at street level to Goodhue's great library was a major  concern," designer Henry Cobb said.  </P> <P> To emphasize this primacy, a dramatic "water garden" stairway, designed by  noted landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, will lead pedestrians down from  upper Hope Street to a point opposite the library's main entrance.  </P> <P> This grand staircase, to be topped by a walk-in pavilion resembling a giant  golden metal snake crafted by Frank Gehry, is intended as a "choreographed  experience that captures the life and vitality of the city," according to  Halprin.  </P> <P> A water wall cascading over terraces and along channels running down the middle  of the steps will form the backdrop for outdoor cafes and flower vendors. In  this "urban theater" it is hoped that mimes and musicians will entertain  lunchtime office workers.  </P> <P> Once the configuration of the tower's base was determined, the main cylinder of  the high-rise was designed.  </P> <P> To shape the tall shaft's floor plans, and give the tower visual interest as it  soared upward, principal designer Harold Fredenburgh played with variations of  a circle laid over a square.  </P> <P> "The aim was to enhance the tower's verticality and emphasize the skyward  perspective," Fredenburgh said.  </P> <P> The faceted circular surface that resulted from this circle-in-a-square design  fills out the tower's lower 45 stories. Above the 45th floor the shaft narrows  down through a series of setbacks, emerging as a pure drum shape in the top  five floors.  </P> <P> First Interstate World Center is a striking obelisk when viewed from a distance  through the windshield of a car approaching downtown along one of the freeways  that circle the central city. But as one comes close, the detailing of the  tower's faceted pale-gray Sardinian granite with beige accents and flush-tinted  windows, lack sufficient subtlety to interest the eye.  </P> <P> Seen from below, the shaft's complex geometries are hard to decipher. And its  horizontal banding seems at odds with Fredenburgh's aim to enhance a vertical  character.  </P> <P> The main lobby off 5th Street opposite the library is confusing. The tower's  columns, sheathed in illuminated glass cases, block the front doors. The  lobby's connection to the Hope Street entry four floors above is poorly thought  out, and the auto drop-off for visitors seems like an afterthought slotted in  at the back of the building.  </P> <P> Not even the vast and vivid lobby mural commissioned from artist David Hockney  will succeed in giving the space a visual coherence.  </P> <P> In the tower's interior the eccentric floor plans generated by the  squared-circle shape allow offices of a variety of configurations, from wedges  to octagons.  </P> <P> The relative smallness of the floors compared to most modern office high-rises  guarantees that few workers are far from a window. The top five circular levels  offer panoramic views -- on smogless days -- from the San Gabriel Mountains to  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Structurally, the tower is designed to withstand an 8.3 earthquake -- Los  Angeles' "Big One," predicted to strike within the next 30 years. The tower's  massively reinforced central core and lighter perimeter columns form a  framework flexible enough to resist violent side-to-side shaking, the  architects and engineers believe.  </P> <P> Looking back over the blood, sweat and tears of the past seven years, developer  Nelson Rising of Maguire Thomas Partners declares that he is "thrilled with  this beautiful building."  </P> <P> The venture has been, Rising said, "profitable and significant for Los Angeles  in the creation of a signature tower for the city."  </P> <P> If the First Interstate tower is indeed our urban signature, it can only be  said that our identity is smudged.  </P> <P> Given that the art was in the deal not the architecture, the First Interstate  World Center could still have been the landmark that crowned Bunker Hill and  redeemed the architectural mediocrity of most of our downtown towers.  </P> <P> It could have been our equivalent of Manhattan's Chrysler Building, with a  superb profile silhouetted against the sky and urbane proportions detailed to  delight the eye from near and far.  </P> <P> But the tower's designers and their patrons haven't quite risen to the  occasion. They haven't come together to create a tower whose verve and grace  might have made us forget the profits and the politics.  </P> <P> A major factor in this failure is that the First Interstate World Center  development, despite its present identification with a big bank, began its  complex life as a speculative commercial high-rise venture, not a corporate  headquarters meant to symbolize the pride of a major enterprise.  </P> <P> What this means can be seen by comparing First Interstate with another Maguire  Thomas Partners development on Bunker Hill -- the Wells Fargo Center,  originally the Crocker Center.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo/Crocker Center, designed as a corporate symbol, is a much more  graceful and urbane project. The towers are planned to create a pleasant plaza  at street level for people to sit and stroll and shop. Seen against the  downtown skyline, the eccentrically shaped shafts make an intriguingly composed  counterpoint.  </P> <P> In this achievement the architect's role was clearly central, not peripheral.  </P> <P> Here the designer was not called upon simply to do a cosmetic job on a done  deal, but to shape the project from the start, create it from the ground up.  This fact alone makes Wells Fargo Center a much better act of urban  architecture than First Interstate.  </P> <P> The fact that hectic horse trading, not architecture or urban design, is the  primary interest powering many speculative commercial high-rises -- by far the  large majority of our new towers -- explains why our proud new downtown has so  few buildings of distinction.  </P> <P> When even a respected and progressive developer like Maguire Thomas Partners  reduces its architects to a relatively minor role in the game of  make-me-a-city, what hope have we for an urban core that is more than a boring  collection of built deals?  </P></p>

The group, which owns McCann-Erickson and Lintas, the leading international advertising agencies, cited the acquisition of the Lowe Group, the London-based marketing company, as the main reason for the decline. Lowe contributed to an increase in Interpublic's gross income to Dollars 353.78m (Dollars 284.49m) but had a negative effect on net income. Interpublic's earnings per share fell to 22 cents from 26 cents 26) in the three months to March 31. However, the dividend was raised to 19 cents, against 17 cents last time. For the past year the international advertising industry has been depressed by recessions in the major markets of the US, UK and Australia.</p>

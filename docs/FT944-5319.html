			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Great art reproduced The 732-page, 8lb tome which I lugged round the 1990 Beccafumi show in Siena, it transpired, represented the good old days. At least the larger part of that weighty volume was devoted to the works of art on display. Recent catalogues are no less unwieldly but they are distinctly less user-friendly. These hybrid art-books-cum-catalogues are characterised by interminable essays - not always obviously relevant - with minimalist catalogue entries rather apologetically tacked on to the end. Take the gargantuan The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990, hands-down winner of the year's most muddle-headed and unhelpful example of the genre (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 36). The catalogue for the show first seen in Edinburgh, its 500 pages boast no fewer than 47 scholarly essays on subjects as diverse as, say, Romantic Irony, Landscape and the 'Irony of Nature', and Irony and the Grotesque. The 283 exhibits are squeezed into a mere 18 pages. Exhibition catalogues no longer serve the purpose of illuminating individual works of art. Thankfully, there still appears to be a place for the serious book. David Landau and Peter Parshall's seminal The Renaissance Print 1470-1550 (Yale University Press, Pounds 45) is a revelatory study of an oddly neglected subject. Prints have always been treated as the poor relation of paintings and drawings; this is the book to convince the unconverted that prints deserve equal consideration. No less refreshing was John Golding's Visions of the Modern (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 28). Golding is a rare beast, a writer and a distinguished painter. He brings to his scrutiny of 20th century art a formidable intelligence and visual sensitivity, and a rigour derived from an understanding of the art of the past. He is not afraid to convey this in language the layman can understand. David Sylvester's more recent Looking at Giacometti (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 25) must be the most lyrical critical biography of the year. Long in the making and endlessly revised, it is a thoughtful, highly personal and genuinely illuminating response to Giacometti's art. Mondrian: The Art of Destruction (Reaktion Books, Pounds 35) is more mainstream. Carel Blotkamp steers as clear a course as possible through Mondrian's theoretical writings, theosophical beliefs and the austere abstraction he termed Neo-Plasticism. Despite the exasperating art-speak, Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall's Tiepolo and the Pictorial Intelligence (Yale University Press, Pounds 35) offers a fascinatingly cerebral analysis of the masterpiece - the frescoes in the Residenz of the Prince-Bishop of Wurtzburg - of an artist not usually celebrated for his intellect. Benozzo Gozzoli's frescoes of the procession of the Magi for the small private chapel of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence rank among the most beguiling of the Renaissance - perhaps because the artist's heart remains firmly in the enchanted world of the Middle Ages. Cristina Acidini-Luchinat's sumptuous, 400-page Chapel of the Magi (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 55) reproduces the entire - recently restored  - narrative cycle and life-size details opposite blank, black pages in the finest, self-indulgent Italian style. Little doubt that this will be the season's favourite picture book. My favourite is the large-format Michelangelo: The Medici Chapel by James Beck, Antonio Paolucci and Bruno Santi, illustrated by the mouthwatering and masterly black and white photographs of the sculptures by Aurelio Amendola (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 36). A particular pleasure too is Paula Rego's Nursery Rhymes (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 12.95). The nightmarish terrors conjured up in Rego's powerful Goya-esque fantasies make this a volume best kept out of the reach of tiny hands.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Historic Dow peak on futures-linked buying Wall Street IN SPITE of a big fall in bond prices, which was triggered by bad inflation news, late buy programs linked to stock index futures trading lifted blue chip stocks into record territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.56 stronger at 3,482.31, surpassing its previous all-time closing peak of 3,478.61. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, was only 0.44 up at 444.80, while the Nasdaq composite lost 1.37 at 681.69. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 256m shares, and declines just outnumbered rises by 946 to 944. After Tuesday's solid gains, equities were expected to advance further yesterday morning. Some unexpectedly bad news on inflation, however, meant prices opened lower. The news came in the form of a 0.6 per cent rise in the April producer prices index. Not only had analysts expected an increase of only 0.2 per cent in the PPI, but the 'core' measure of producer price inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also worryingly strong at a 0.4 per cent rise. The bad inflation figures upset the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year issue quickly fell by almost  3/4 point, pushing the yield up to 6.87 per cent, although it recovered slightly later. This increase in bond yields, and a fear of rising inflation, depressed equities for most of the day. But late program buying, linked to a rise in stock index futures, gave shares a boost at the close. Retailers were in the spotlight after some of the industry's biggest groups reported quarterly earnings. Wal-Mart moved ahead Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 in volume of 4.6m shares after announcing first-quarter profits of 20 cents a share, up from 17 cents a year earlier. The company also said that first-quarter sales rose 19 per cent to a record Dollars 13.9bn. In contrast, Woolworth slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 after the company announced disappointing earnings of only a cent a share, down from 13 cents at the same stage of 1992. Federated Department Stores, however, fared better, rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/4 on news that first-quarter net income, before extraordinary items, was slightly higher than a year ago. Philip Morris, which posted strong gains last week on the news that its main rival in the domestic cigarette market was no longer offering discounts on its cheap brands, ran into further profit-taking and receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 in volume of 4.4m shares. Chevron climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 88 on news that it has already booked initial reserves of 1.1bn barrels of oil from its Tengiz venture in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Canada TORONTO finished higher in heavy trading after a sharp rise in the price of gold bullion sent gold-related shares surging. The TSE 300 index gained 16.2 at 3,796.5 and advancing issues outnumbered declines by 392 to 333 after volume of 65.7m shares. Nine of the 14 sub-groups ended firmer, with the golds sector rising 5.9 per cent. Gold bullion gained USDollars 4.90 an ounce in New York.</p>

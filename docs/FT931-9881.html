			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown accuses Tories of protecting big business MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday charged the Conservative government with failing to address abuses of power by the banks, privatised utilities and the food and farm sector. Accusing his Tory opponents of protecting the vested interests of big business to which many have personal links, he said Labour would champion consumers' efforts to fight overcharging and poor service. His attack signalled the second stage in the opposition's effort to project itself as the party of the citizen and as opposed to the influence of entrenched interest groups. This was first outlined by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, in Bournemouth on Sunday. Mr Brown used an open meeting of Labour's finance committee to highlight alleged abuses of power and privilege by what he described as 'cartels and cliques'. His chief targets were the high street banks which, he said, were still charging 20 per cent above base rate on credit card accounts. In addition, he said some 30 per cent of small businesses had not received the full benefit of recent interest rate cuts. At the same time, bank charges had risen by Pounds 2bn or 50 per cent during the recession while dividends and boardroom salaries rose by 80 per cent and 60 per cent respectively. Calling for a new inquiry into banking practice, he said its terms should examine the case for customer contracts, which would give legally enforceable rights to advance warning of increases in charges. Among a number of other proposals were the creation of a banks' ombudsman, regularly published comparative tables on bank charges to encourage competition and choice, a fresh look at how to promote long-term investment and efforts to increase Europe-wide banking competition. The shadow chancellor said: 'When people ask why, in the face of increased criticism, the Conservatives will not act, they should remember that much of the Tory party - in the Commons and Lords and even in the cabinet - comes from the banks, is of the banks and may soon be on its way back to the banks.' Broadening his attack to the privatised utilities and the food industry, Mr Brown went on to charge that electricity, gas, and telecommunications charges in the UK were far above those of Japan, the US and Germany. 'The dark recesses of private power needed to be opened up to scrutiny with rights of representation for the consumer,' he said. Citing a number of former cabinet ministers now on the boards of privatised companies, he added: 'The Conservatives will not act simply because they are too close to the boardroom of the utilities.'</p>

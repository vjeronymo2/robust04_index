Incidental take data have been collected by observers from about 2 to 13 percent of the fishing effort since 1991. No marine mammal mortalities have been observed. Because the incidence of take is rare and does not meet the criteria for categorizing fisheries in Category I or II, NMFS proposes that the WA Willapa Bay salmon drift gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recategorize  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the WA Grays Harbor salmon set and drift gill net fishery from Category I (Table 1) to Category III (Table 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marine mammal/fishery interaction and incidental take data have been collected in this fishery since 1991 under a marine mammal observer program that was completed at the end of calendar year 1993. Incidental take data have been collected by observers from about 4 to 10 percent of the fishing effort since 1991. Only one marine mammal mortality, a harbor seal, has been observed. Because the incidence of take is rare and does not meet the one take per vessel per 20 days criteria for categorizing fisheries in Category I or II, NMFS proposes that the WA Grays Harbor salmon set and drift gill net fishery be recategorized from Category I to Category III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recategorize  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> all California gill net fisheries (except the CA Klamath River gill net fishery, Table 2), based on mesh size of net, by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> adding  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CA set and drift gill net fisheries that use a stretched mesh size of greater than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category I (Table 1),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> adding  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> set and drift gill net fisheries that use a stretched mesh size of 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) or less to Category III (Table 3),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> dropping  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> all other CA set and drift gill net fisheries, including: the CA thresher shark and swordfish drift gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA halibut set gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA soupfin shark, yellowtail, white sea bass set gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA white croaker, bonito, and flying fish gill net fishery (Table 2), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> redefining  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the WA, OR, CA herring, smelt, shad, sturgeon, bottom fish, mullet, perch, rockfish gill net fishery (Table 3) to include only WA and OR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since 1989, the categorization of gill net fisheries in California has been based on the species being targeted and the frequency of marine mammal mortality. Reviews of information on the rate of marine mammal mortality in a range of gill net mesh sizes indicate that larger mesh sizes (greater than 3.5 inches or 8.9 cm stretched mesh size) entangle marine mammals at a much higher rate than smaller mesh sizes (less than 3.5 inches or 8.9 cm stretched mesh size) (Miller 1983, Vojkovich 1987, 1988, 1989, Barlow  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). Observer placement in Category I fisheries, as required by the MMPA, could be achieved more effectively by evaluating the type of gear that will be used instead of the intended target species. Therefore, NMFS proposes that all California gill net fisheries (except the CA Klamath River fishery) be reclassified based on stretch mesh size, rather than by target species. Set or drift gill net vessels that use mesh sizes greater that 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), such as the CA thresher shark and swordfish drift gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA halibut set gill net fishery (Table 1), the CA soupfin shark, yellowtail, white sea bass set gill net fishery (Table 1) would remain in Table 1 and be subject to the requirements of a Category I fishery. Set or drift gill net vessels that use mesh sizes less than or equal to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), such as the CA white croaker, bonito, and flying fish gill net fishery (Table 2), and the WA, OR, CA herring, smelt, shad, sturgeon, bottom fish, mullet, perch, rockfish gill net fishery (Table 3) would be subject to the requirements for a Category III fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recategorize  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the GME Atlantic salmon aquaculture (net pen) fishery from Category III (Table 6) to Category II (Table 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

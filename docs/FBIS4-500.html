			<p>BFN     [Text] Are you physically, intellectually and morally brave  and enterprising with self-discipline, an open mind,  objectivity, selflessness and dedication?    Would you like to work in a "new South African" organisation  with a non-racial, non-sexist recruitment policy, updated  management systems, formal labour relations practices and  specialist training which concentrates on developing human  resources to the utmost?    If so, you should join "one of the oldest professions in the  world". In case you have the wrong idea, this is intelligence-  gathering, according to a recruitment brochure of the National  Intelligence Service [NIS].    Under the heading "It's time for the true facts about the  National Intelligence Service," the glossy handout explains that  the NIS regularly distributes "products" to 150 "clients",  including the state president, state departments and  interdepartmental committees.    It says that because of the secrecy that surrounds it, the  intelligence profession is beset by "the most misperceptions and  ignorance."    In fact it renders a service that cannot be obtained  elsewhere, while its "systematic way of processing intelligence"  ensures that "the NIS does not spread unconfirmed rumours".    To reassure the tender of conscience, the NIS insists it is  not above the law and that "extensive legislation dictates its  activities", that it is "under no circumstances an instrument in  the hands of a political party", that it has no executive  powers, and that secrecy "does not imply a violation of human  rights; it is however necessary to safeguard sensitive  information".    It insists that it does not use "poisoned umbrella tips",  but  adds that advanced technology is an "important aspect of the  current intelligence world".    According to the brochure, the NIS has a defensive counter-  intelligence function which includes safeguarding information,  VIPs, installations and equipment, "as well as neutralising  foreign intelligence operations." It says brightly: "Although  South Africa now has more friends than earlier, we are not so  naive to believe that we only have friends."    Most information is obtainable from the media or is  collected  openly, the brochure says. But it concedes "we do snoop...",  explaining: "It is important to also obtain essential  information in a clandestine manner, employing covert agents and  technological capabilities."    If you are interested you will need, in addition to the  sterling qualities listed above, a tertiary education for most  posts. You will also be subject to security clearances and  psychometric tests. The brochure provides no address for  applications.</p>

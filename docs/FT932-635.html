			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Spending review takes low profile THE IMPACT of the fund-amental review of next year's public spending is expected to be limited to a scrutiny of forgotten corners of departmental budgets. It is unlikely to extend to radical proposals. The news is likely to dismay Tory rightwingers who have already expressed concern that the overall total of Pounds 253.6bn approved by the cabinet for next year's public spending is too high. Some have called for more drastic restructuring of departmental budgets instead of possible tax increases to tackle the scale of public borrowing. Whatever the long-term savings, ministers are unlikely to favour for next year those deeper changes - such as encouraging people to 'opt out' of entitlement to some welfare benefits - which carry immediate costs. Instead, officials suggest that the focus will be on low-profile areas of expenditure. Even so, individual spending programmes will still face cuts so that the overall Pounds 253.6bn total for next year can be met. Progress reports from the four departments in the first tranche of the fundamental spending review - the Home Office, the Department for Education, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health - are due to be sent to the Treasury by the end of next month. The first 'pathfinding' meeting of EDX, the cabinet committee on public expenditure which is chaired by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is pencilled in for the week beginning July 12. Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, hopes to complete his round of bilateral discussions with spending ministers over the next five weeks. He has already begun a series of meetings with Tory backbenchers to impress upon them the difficulty of decisions in the current spending round. Last year, the first EDX meeting was not until the second half of September, but this year a full programme of meetings is planned throughout September. The timetable for work on public spending has been brought sharply forward by the pressure on the Treasury of combining the tax and spending statements in the unified Budget in November.</p>

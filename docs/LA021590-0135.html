			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LOCKOUT: DAY 1;  </P> <P> A FAN'S GUIDE;  </P> <P> Q &amp; A: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  </P> <P> Question: Why is it called a lockout?  </P> <P> Answer: It's seldom that an owner of a corporation locks the office doors and  doesn't let the employees in. That's what is happening here. Baseball owners  are refusing to let the players come to work unless a Basic Agreement  (contract) is reached between the owners and the players' union  representatives. The last agreement expired Dec. 31, 1989. If the players  refused to report to spring training, it would be called a strike.  </P> <P> Q: Who is participating in the talks?  </P> <P> A: Negotiators for the Major League Baseball Players Relation Committee (PRC),  which represents the owners, and officials of the Major League Baseball  Players' Assn. (MLBPA), which represents the players. Also, Baseball  Commissioner Fay Vincent, who is hired and paid by the owners, joined the talks  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Q: How quickly would it take players to get ready for the regular season if an  agreement is reached?  </P> <P> A: Spring training runs six weeks for pitchers, catchers and injured players  and about five weeks for the position players. The consensus is that for  position players, the least amount of spring-season training needed would be  three weeks. But pitchers need almost the entire six weeks and would pitch  fewer innings at the start of the season because of a lack of stamina.  </P> <P> Q: How soon could camps open if an agreement is reached?  </P> <P> A: Owner representatives say it would take about a week to prepare camps to  open.  </P> <P> Q: Why can't spring training camps open while the owners and players continue  discussion?  </P> <P> A: Seemingly, the players union would allow players to report to spring  training while it continues negotiations with the owners. However, the owners  want an agreement before the season begins, and are trying to ensure that by  not opening spring training camps.  </P> <P> Here's why: The bulk of the money received by the owners comes from the  telecast of postseason events. The owners receive that money toward the end of  the season. The owners are fearful that if they start the season without a  contract the players will wait until July or August and strike. By then, most  of the players will have received the bulk of their annual salaries.  </P> <P> The union says it will not forfeit its right to strike during the season.  </P> <P> Q: How are the players paid?  </P> <P> A: The majority of players are paid their salary during the regular season.  Some players, though, elect to have their salary paid over a 26-week pay  period. Players do not get paid for spring training, but do receive expense  money.  </P> <P> Q: Does the entire agreement have to be in place before the owners open spring  training?  </P> <P> A: According to recent reports, no. Before Vincent joined the talks, the owners  said that revenue sharing must be agreed to by the union before the owners will  consider opening camps.  </P> <P> Q: What is revenue sharing?  </P> <P> A: The owners would use 48% of their revenue from ticket sales and television  and radio rights -- which produce 82% of their total revenue -- for players'  salaries and benefits. The revenue would be used to pay player salaries for  players with one to six years of major league service, and would be shared  equally by the 26 clubs. The salaries would be determined on a statistically  based, pay-for-performance scale.  </P> <P> Q: What about the salary cap?  </P> <P> A: A condition of revenue sharing would impose a salary cap on each team. Free  agents, players with at least six years of major league experience, could not  sign with teams other than their own if those teams' payrolls were above the  specified limit.  </P> <P> Q: Why is revenue sharing so important to the owners?  </P> <P> A: The owners want "cost certainty." They want to know how much revenue to  budget for salaries. They say revenue sharing isn't a means to ensure  profitability for all 26 clubs, but the best way to put stability in their  relationship with the players.  </P> <P> Q: Why is the players union so opposed to revenue sharing?  </P> <P> A: The owners' pay-for-performance system, as originally proposed, would  eliminate arbitration, which is currently available to players with three years  of major league service or more.  </P> <P> Secondly, for players with one to six years of experience, it would eliminate  guaranteed contracts and multiyear contracts that are executed when a player  nears free agency.  </P> <P> Third, salaries would be determined by statistical formulas based on numbers  from the players' previous two seasons. The union believes a players' value  cannot be measured on statistics alone.  </P> <P> Finally, the revenue-sharing conditions would impose a salary cap that could  restrict mobility for free agents. Players with six years or more would still  be free agents, but they could not sign with teams other than their own if  those teams' payrolls were above the specified limit.  </P> <P> Q: Have the owners softened their stance?  </P> <P> A: It's been reported that on Tuesday the owners modified their proposal to  keep arbitration but place a 75% ceiling on the amount of increase a player can  receive. The proposal would also dump the pay-for-performance system based on a  statistical table for determining the salary of players with six or fewer years  of major league service.  </P> <P> Q: Why can't the baseball commissioner stop this lockout?  </P> <P> A: The commissioner, who is hired and paid by the owners, can use his influence  to encourage a settlement. But he does not have authority over the players'  union, and therefore cannot order an agreement.  </P> <P> Q: What about tickets purchased for the regular season?  </P> <P> A: If you are holding a ticket to a game and the game is not played, Dodger  officials say you will be entitled to a refund. Procedures would be announced  at the appropriate time.  </P></p>

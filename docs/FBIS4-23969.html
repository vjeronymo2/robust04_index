			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Within the framework of French diplomatic  efforts a French delegation is in our country. It includes Mr.  Gerard Larome who deals with urgent issues at the French Foreign  Affairs Department. He held an interview with our colleague,  Emmanuel Mugunga.    [Begin recording] [Larome] I also had the honor of holding  talks with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] president,  Kanyarengwe. In Kigali, we met the government Army hierarchy.  [passage omitted]    [Mugunga] What did you discuss with the RPF president?    [Larome] I think you should put that question to the  president.    [Mugunga] But you can also answer since you took part in the  meeting.    [Larome] The president of the RPF explained to us his  concern  and his position. I gave him a message from Alain Juppe, the  minister of foreign affairs, and the humanitarian proposals of  [words indistinct] minister of humanitarian action [words  indistinct].    [Mugungua] Don't you think the declarations of Mr. Alain  Juppe, for whom you work, his latest declarations over Radio  France International will be interpreted by the RPF with whom  you have just had discussions as a declaration of war?    [Larome] No. It is not a declaration of war. I, myself  informed the president that there was no question of such a  thing. [Words indistinct] I know the intentions of the minister  and I know (?that the) president of the French Republic  expressed himself and that the media often wrongly translate  what one wanted to say.

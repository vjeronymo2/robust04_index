			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / County pacts hit Tories CONSERVATIVES have been excluded from power in most of the 26 English counties where no party has overall control. The pattern of control in the counties is uneven, and several councils are relying on informal arrangements between Labour and Liberal Democrats without electing a new council leader. A survey by Municipal Journal found eight counties which were formerly under Conservative control now with either Liberal Democrats or Labour forming, or set to form, a minority administration. They are: Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester, Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Warwickshire, and West Sussex. Since Municipal Journal went to press Norfolk, where the Conservatives are still the largest party, has also announced that Labour will take the chairs of its committees. Labour was unable, however, to strike a deal with the Liberal Democrats, so progress will need to be made on an issue-by-issue basis and the council has no formal leader. The most formal co-operation yet announced is in Berkshire, where Labour and the Liberal Democrats provide joint leaders. Municipal Journal adds that Liberal Democrats could run Devon and Dorset, where they narrowly missed overall control, with independent backing. Labour is continuing minority rule in Shropshire, following a suggestion of a three-way pact. The one exception to the Conservative rout so far is Wiltshire, where the Conservatives have provided the chairperson and Labour the vice-chairperson, even though the Liberal Democrats were only two seats short of an overall majority. Both parties have denied any formal Lab-Con pact, and administration will be on an 'issue-by-issue' basis. Changes in policy have been sharp. In Cambridgeshire, which now has a Liberal Democrat chairperson and a Labour vice-chairperson, the council has announced plans to abolish a transport charge for sixth-form students introduced by the outgoing Conservative administration, and to provide a 'cash injection' for education and social services. Counties which were hung before the election - Avon, Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire - are continuing the practice of not electing permanent committee chairpersons but allowing the jobs to rotate between the parties.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> SELLING OF SADDAM HUSSEIN A BRISK BUSINESS IN JORDAN  </P> <P> If Jordan had a president, and if this were an election year, Saddam Hussein  would seem to be the front-runner in terms of campaign paraphernalia.  </P> <P> Supporters of Hussein -- and it is difficult to find a Jordanian who is not --  have plastered pictures of the president of neighboring Iraq on just about  everything here that doesn't move, and on some things that do -- taxicabs, for  example.  </P> <P> Jordan's King Hussein gets little more than equal billing in this time of  crisis.  </P> <P> The Iraqi Embassy, just down Queen Zein Street from its American counterpart,  is a fount of posters, including the popular photo of King Hussein and Saddam  Hussein gripping a rifle in a carpeted reception hall.  </P> <P> Downtown dealers are doing a brisk business in lapel buttons. In dramatic Arab  style, they forgo "I Like Saddam" for a more trenchant message: "You Can Make  Us Hungry but You Can't Make Us Kneel," inscribed over the likeness of the  Iraqi leader.  </P> <P> "Actually, 90% of those are bought by Western tourists," said Fuad Afghani, a  Palestinian merchant. "Jordanians prefer a smaller button without the words."  </P> <P> Clearly the Iraqi government has a hand in the flood of political  paraphernalia, but Afghani says he creates his own.  </P> <P> "Every time Saddam makes a speech, we make a new button," he said. "We have  them made up here in Amman with the latest good phrase."  </P> <P> Afghani, too, is an admirer of the Iraqi president.  </P> <P> "He's decisive, a man who says yes and a man who says no," Afghani said.  </P> <P> If pressed, Jordanians will admit that Saddam Hussein is hardly a flawless  leader. He runs a ruthless regime, they concede, and his profession of Islamic  piety raises eyebrows here.  </P> <P> Still, his invasion and annexation of Kuwait have met with little criticism,  despite the Jordanian government's official condemnation. An Amman travel agent  dismissed the rulers of Kuwait as "$50-billion sheiks."  </P> <P> "Pro-Saddam sentiment goes right up to the top levels of government," a Western  diplomat said. It is particularly prevalent among the Palestinians, who  constitute more than half the Jordanian population, according to unofficial  estimates.  </P> <P> A schoolboy march the other day, organized by the Confederation of Jordanian  Women and very middle-class and non-militant, carried a mix of placards  supporting the king and the Iraqi president, along with banners calling for an  "Arab Jerusalem."  </P> <P> "The Palestinian attitude may change in time," the diplomat said. "When all  their brothers and cousins come back from Kuwait and tell their stories of  family fortunes gone forever, there will be second thoughts. But it hasn't  happened yet. Saddam and Iraq are riding high here. He's seen as a tough leader  who backs their cause."  </P> <P> If there's a weak wheel on the Iraqi bandwagon here it is the Islamic  fundamentalist movement, which increased its political clout in last spring's  parliamentary elections. The Muslim Brotherhood, the principal fundamentalist  organization, finds no comfort in Iraq's secular, socialist policies, or in the  invasion of Kuwait, which drew American-led foreign military forces into Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> But Saddam Hussein remains a prime piece of merchandise at Afghani's shop  across from the old mosque in downtown Amman.  </P> <P> "The people here have a belief in him," the Jaffa-born Palestinian said. "He's  not the best Islamic leader, but he's an Arab leader."  </P> <P> As Afghani discussed business and politics with a couple of American reporters,  a deliveryman came through the door of his shop with a bag full of new Saddam  Hussein buttons, hot from the factory. He spread them over the glass  countertop.  </P> <P> "We're selling about 400 a day," Afghani said.  </P> <P> The big ones, the size of a silver dollar, go for about $1.50, mostly to  tourists. The smaller ones, which the Jordanians favor, cost about half that.  </P> <P> On a rail outside the shop, the latest posters hang like laundry, beckoning  buyers. A popular one features separate photos of the king, the Iraqi leader  and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, all cradling  weapons.  </P> <P> At major intersections, teen-agers dash from car to car with posters, like  newsboys hawking the latest edition.  </P> <P> So far, the selling of Saddam Hussein has not reached the monumental  proportions it has in his own capital of Baghdad, where his portraits cover the  outside walls of buildings. The largest poster here is only 2-by-3 feet, but  the quantity has been more than enough to get the message across.  </P> <P> Nick Williams, The Times' bureau chief in Nicosia, Cyprus, was recently on  assignment in Jordan.  </P></p>

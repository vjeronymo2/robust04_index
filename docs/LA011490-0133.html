			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STATISTICS ARE HIS AMMUNITION IN THE BATTLE AGAINST CIGARETTES  </P> <P> He doesn't sport anti-smoking badges or constantly spout smoke-and-croak  warnings like his more militant comrades. Nonetheless, Gus Miller is relentless  in his campaign to snuff out what he considers America's No. 1 drug --  cigarettes.  </P> <P> His is a solitary, relatively quiet war. His ammunition is statistics.  </P> <P> "I'm a scientist. I'm also a pragmatist. And to me, the best way to do it is to  just chip away," Miller said.  </P> <P> The 65-year-old statistician has been poking into America's penchant to puff  since 1972, when he launched Studies on Smoking, a nonprofit research group,  from his Edinboro home in northwestern Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> Last summer, Miller quit his job as a math and computer science professor at  Edinboro University to devote all his time to seek out the perils of tobacco.  </P> <P> "Why is this so important to me? Because cigarettes are responsible for 400,000  premature deaths a year," he said. "I've seen so many of my family or my  friends die needlessly because they smoked."  </P> <P> He manages, he said, to push personal feelings aside.  </P> <P> "Yeah, it's an emotional issue," said Miller, an ardent nonsmoker who despises  cigarette smoke. "But I teach stop-smoking clinics, so you have to use  psychology. You can't get emotional about it."  </P> <P> More than 50 million Americans smoke cigarettes, according to a 1989 report by  then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. An additional 40 million would be smoking  if not for changes in an increasingly health-conscious environment, the report  contends.  </P> <P> Miller's efforts to publicize his message have been thwarted at times, he said,  because of who he is -- or rather who he isn't.  </P> <P> "If you're not a member of 'the club' and you're not an M.D. and you want to  get into medical journals, you've got problems," said Miller, who has a  doctorate in educational psychology.  </P> <P> "The club," he explains, "is the people who get all the grant money and  publish. That's the club."  </P> <P> Donald Shopland, public health adviser for the National Cancer Institute's  smoking, tobacco and cancer program, acknowledges most published data on  smoking is financed through federal grants.  </P> <P> Except for occasional, small donations from industry, Miller finances his own  research. He figures he's spent $60,000 to $70,000 over the years.  </P> <P> "They are a fairly rare bunch who are doing their own individual research with  their own individual funds," Shopland said.  </P> <P> Despite such obstacles, Miller has had several dozen articles published in  professional periodicals. He signs his work as G.H. Miller.  </P> <P> Miller also has presented his findings at scientific conferences around the  world, including a symposium on cancer prevention in France last April. There,  he reported an eight- to nine-times greater risk of cancer among nonsmoking  women who live with smokers than those in smoke-free homes. He based his  conclusion on a study of 906 nonsmoking women from surrounding Erie County who  died from 1975 to 1980.  </P> <P> In late October and early November, Miller attended the fifth General  Chautauqua Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations at the University of Pittsburgh.  He spent the week urging Soviet medical officials to adopt more stringent  no-smoking measures.  </P> <P> Dr. Yuri Lopukhin, director of the Research Institute for Physiochemical  Medicine in Moscow and an expert on addiction, was impressed with Miller's work  and would like him to visit the Soviet Union to share his views.  </P> <P> Although anti-tobacco education has been offered in Soviet schools the last  five to 10 years and stop-smoking programs are available for adults, the  efforts have not made much of a dent in the country's large smoking population,  Lopukhin said.  </P> <P> "I think he (Miller) is, yes, helpful. He is very active," Lopukhin said. "But  he maybe does not succeed so much in this very heavy problem in your country  and our country, too."  </P> <P> The Tobacco Institute, a trade association representing U.S. cigarette  manufacturers, has criticized Miller for being non-scientific in his collection  and analysis of data.  </P> <P> "And of course you get that from your fellow scientists who say, 'No, your data  is invalid' because it varies from what they have found," Miller said. "You  see, my problem is I'm always on the forefront."  </P> <P> Lawrence Garfinkel, vice president of epidemiology and statistics for the  American Cancer Society, is among those researchers skeptical of Miller's work  on secondhand smoke.  </P> <P> "Some people don't agree with the methods he uses," Garfinkel said. "He may  have done some of the early work (on passive smoking). I can tell you when they  cite the studies that have been done, they don't include his very often."  </P> <P> The surgeon general's 1989 report concludes that secondhand smoke can cause  lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers. In addition, children of parents who smoke  have an increased frequency of respiratory infections.  </P> <P> More than one in every six deaths in the United States is due to cigarette  smoking, according to the surgeon general. Smoking is responsible for an  estimated 30% of all cancer deaths -- including 87% of lung cancer deaths, 21%  of deaths from heart disease and 18% of stroke deaths.  </P> <P> "Cigarettes are much more deadly, much, much more deadly" than narcotics,  Miller said. "They're much more addictive.  </P> <P> "That's why we try to push for getting laws strengthened and churn out research  articles showing how bad active smoking is and how bad passive smoking is."  </P> <P> Like many Americans, Miller was unaware of all the risks when he decided in  1972 to take on smoking. He was prompted into action after talking to a nurse  about the varying life spans of men and women.  </P> <P> "I mentioned to her that to me it was pretty obvious smoking has something to  do with the male-female longevity difference, and the reason I knew that is my  father was a heavy smoker. He got emphysema. He tried to quit several times and  he got wiped out," he said.  </P> <P> "She said, 'Well, where's your data?' So I figured, well, let me go chase  around and look for data."  </P> <P> Miller began sorting through Erie County death notices in 1972 in his spare  time, noting those people who were at least 30 when they died. By the following  year, he was interviewing survivors to see whether the dead had smoked.  </P> <P> He found after analyzing the life styles of about 500 people that men and women  lived to about the same age if they did not smoke. There was a difference of 16  years, however, between smoking and nonsmoking women and a 12-year gap between  smoking and nonsmoking men. The Journal of Breathing published his findings in  1975.  </P> <P> "I knew there was more there," he said. "I started going full blast."  </P> <P> In 1976, after compiling data on 3,500 more subjects with the help of  volunteers, Miller issued a second report showing similar longevity results.  </P> <P> Miller ventured into the controversial area of secondhand smoke in the late  1970s and since has devoted most of his time to it.  </P> <P> In a particularly controversial study published in 1984, he reported a  significantly higher risk of cancer among unemployed women whose husbands  smoked compared to those whose husbands did not. He based his conclusions on  842 Erie County residents who died in 1975 and 1976.  </P></p>

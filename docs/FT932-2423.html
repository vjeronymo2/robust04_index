			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investors to face Royal Trustco managers DISGRUNTLED Royal Trustco shareholders will today confront managers of the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family over the circumstances which have led to the near-collapse of Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company. A committee, which claims to represent over 1,000 shareholders and subordinated debt holders in North America, Europe and Australia, has circulated a long list of questions which it plans to ask at Trustco's annual meeting in Toronto this morning. The meeting is likely to be Trustco's last. Royal Bank of Canada is in the final stages of negotiations to rescue Trustco's operations. The parent company will be left with a CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.1bn) loan portfolio. It plans to change its name to Gentra. Trustco's problems stem partly from the slump in the North American property market. They were exacerbated, however, by write-offs which flowed from the mishandled acquisition of Dow Chemical's financial services arm and a string of US west-coast savings and loan institutions. Trustco's shares have tumbled from a peak of CDollars 18.25 in 1990 to 35 cents yesterday. The losses suffered by shareholders have made Trustco a focal point of criticism levelled by the investment community against the Bronfman group's disclosure standards and corporate governance. Mr Raymond Budd, chairman of the public shareholders committee, said in a letter to the chairman of an independent committee of Trustco's board examining the deal that shareholders are in essence seeking an answer to the question: 'How can a company that in the late autumn of 1992 professes to be liquid, solvent, healthy and profitable . . . announce just a few months later a loss for the 1992 fiscal year of over CDollars 850m and the need to sell substantially all of its profitable assets?'</p>

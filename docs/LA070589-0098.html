			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FLA. GOVERNOR TO CALL LEGISLATURE BACK TO ENACT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Martinez announced today that he will call a special legislative  session to take advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to  place more restrictions on abortions.  </P> <P> The special session will come no later than a previously scheduled legislative  meeting in October to consider transportation and growth management issues and  could be sooner, Martinez, a Republican, said.  </P> <P> Before the ruling, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson had said abortion should  be dealt with in a special session so that it does not dominate next spring's  regular session.  </P> <P> Within hours of the high court's ruling, state Rep. Tom Banjanin filed a bill  that would enact many of the restrictions the high court allowed.  </P></p>

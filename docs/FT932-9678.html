			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / MPs call for Pounds 2 cut in price of CDs A CUT of at least Pounds 2 in the dealer price of compact discs and an inquiry into restrictions on CD imports were urged by a Commons select committee yesterday. The national heritage committee, chaired by the Labour MP Mr Gerald Kaufman, said that while it had 'found no evidence of formal or overt collusion, it considers that the major record companies and the retailers are effectively cartels, and indeed partly interlocking cartels'. It concluded that music companies which gave evidence to an inquiry by the committee last month had not provided adequate explanations why full-price CDs sold for between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds 2 less in the US than in the UK. The companies had been even less convincing in explaining why dealer prices for full-price CDs were Pounds 2.50 higher than the equivalent cassettes when production costs were the same. Mr John Deacon, director-general of the British Phonographic Industry, which represents UK music companies, said he was not surprised by the committee's report. He added: 'In the biased and prejudiced way the Kaufman committee chose to take evidence, there was never a likelihood that there would be a fair debate on the issues.' The committee's report is expected to be followed in the next few days by a recommendation by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that the music industry should be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The committee said a Pounds 2 cut in dealer prices 'is the minimum that is required'. It also criticised retailers for not using their power to demand lower prices from manufacturers. It asked the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate whether import restrictions and copyright law had an anti-competitive effect. The committee accepted that small independent companies had high costs and would not survive if they reduced prices substantially. It added that it had received evidence that some independent producers had seen their products sold by retailers at a higher price than they wished. Picking up bad vibrations, Page 21</p>

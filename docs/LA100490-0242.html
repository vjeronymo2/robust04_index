			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEF'S SECRETS: BREAKFAST IN A TORTILLA  </P> <P> Dinora Guzman is a mobile truck cook, catering mostly to hungry workers from  the garment district buildings in the Downtown area.

Arrange the  filling, tortillas and toppings -- beans, sour cream, cilantro and hot sauce --  separately on a table, and allow each guest to created his or her own machaca  burrito.

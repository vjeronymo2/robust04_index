			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Gentlemen's clubs where money is on tap - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery On Budget day three weeks ago the Treasury's economic measures were not the only talking point for a small group of Tory MPs from the west Midlands. A few hours before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, addressed the Commons the MPs trooped into the Hyde Park Hotel in London's Knightsbridge for lunch with 12 top industrialists from the region. Behind talk about road links and the engineering industry the gathering had a deeper purpose for Major Peter Poncia, a Conservative Central Office official. As the industrialists munched cheese sandwiches and sipped white wine Maj Poncia watched out for people he might tap for money - all in the cause of reducing the Tories' Pounds 15m overdraft and putting the party in good shape for the next general election. Maj Poncia is secretary of the little-known Midlands Industrial Council, which arranged the November 29 meeting and is one of 10 such groups organised by the Tory party. The councils are a curious hybrid of gentleman's clubs and money-raising agencies. They are the focal points in a secretive network of several hundred Tory-supporting business leaders, drawn from all strands of industry but with an accent on individualistic, wealthy entrepreneurs who identify with the free enterprise cause. Many of the councils have been active since the 1950s but the extent of their activities has not been fully revealed. Most meet several times a year, often over dinners or lunches with Tory ministers or MPs. The occasions give Conservative-leaning industrialists the impression that they are helping to guide policy. Money is rarely mentioned at these sessions. That comes later, when the secretaries or council members follow up contacts with discreet requests for cash. The councils accept gifts from individuals but most donations come in the form of corporate gifts. The councils are thought to have been behind about 40 per cent of donations to Conservative Central Office in recent years, equivalent to about Pounds 3.3m a year. Lord Laing, former chairman of the United Biscuits food company and joint Tory party treasurer between 1988 and 1993, said: 'The councils use the old boy network and peer pressure. Each council aims to have 10 to 12 members. Each person would know another 10 or 12 people and (suggest) they make a donation.' Membership lists of the 10 councils, which have never been published, include several self-made millionaires. Sir John Hall, the miner's son who developed the Gateshead MetroCentre, Britain's biggest retail park, is a member of the Northern Industrialists Protection Association, the industrial council for north-east England. Names linked with the network range from representatives of big, publicly quoted companies to less well-known private groups. They include, for instance, Mr Colin Hope, chairman of materials company T&amp;N, who is on the north-west council, and Mr Harold Williams, chairman of Practical Car and Van Rental of Birmingham, who is chairman of the Welsh council. The Birmingham-based Midlands council - there is a separate East Midlands council - is among the most productive, raising an estimated Pounds 500,000 a year. The chairman is Mr Gareth Davies, chairman of Glynwed, a big Midlands engineering company which has given Pounds 274,000 to the Tories since 1986. Other members of the Midlands council include Mr Gary Allen, chief executive of the IMI metals company, which has given Pounds 215,000 over the past eight years, and Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN engineering group, which has donated Pounds 185,600 over the same period. Another powerful group is in the north-west, where the chairman is Lord Wade, a well-connected cheesemaker and former Tory party joint treasurer. The council is thought to raise about Pounds 300,000 a year. Across the Pennines an active fundraiser is Mr Charles Fenton, chairman of Bradford-based textile maker British Mohair Holdings, and chairman of the West Yorkshire Industrialists' Council. Mr Fenton said he was always on the lookout for successful companies. Mr Fenton said: 'If you hear of people drinking champagne and saying whoopee then it's reasonable to make an approach.' About three years ago Mr Fenton contacted Mr Jeff Whalley, a Yorkshire entrepreneur who is chairman of FKI, a Halifax-based electricals group, which had not previously given to the Tories. Mr Whalley joined the council and FKI has given a total of Pounds 105,000 to the party in the last three years. Mr Whalley said the Tories had made a success of the economy. 'If I thought they were doing an awful job I wouldn't back them.' The councils' secretaries are key people. Like Maj Poncia and Mr Lee they are Conservative Central Office officials. They report to Mr Richard Warner, a former banker who is head of Central Office's treasurer's department, which is responsible for finding donations, and are through him linked to Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros merchant bank and chairman of the party's board of treasurers. Broadly equivalent to the council secretaries are three Conservative officials - in Edinburgh, Windsor and Newmarket - who raise money from industrialists in their regions, where there are are no fundraising councils as in other parts of the country. These three are thought to raise a further Pounds 700,000 a year, making an annual total of about Pounds 4m flowing to Central Office from the regions. Of the seven secretaries - two cover five councils between them - four have army backgrounds. The pattern of recruitment was set by Maj Gen Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith, director of the treasurer's department for 22 years until 1992, on the grounds, as he explained, that military people are 'considered honest and amiable' and therefore get on well with executives. During Sir Brian's tenure the treasurer's department raised Pounds 122m - worth about Pounds 225m in today's money - from individuals and companies. Most senior cabinet ministers have addressed at least one fundraising dinner or lunch in recent years. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, attended such a function last month at Manchester's St James's club as a guest of the north-west council. Mr John Major was the main guest at London's Cafe Royal in 1991 at a function which attracted 250 people. This was organised by the City and industrial liaison council, in effect the industrial council for London and the south-east, whose activities in a normal year are expected to lead to gifts of Pounds 1.5m. Ministers generally play a passive role, however. Few have first-hand knowledge of who gives what. The councils may clash with Tory constituency groups which can feel aggrieved that cash from local industrialists is going to the party's head office rather than helping its regional efforts. One of the party's constituency party agents said councils and constituencies sometimes tried to tap the same source. 'It's a question of who gets there first.' Not every council member sees his - few women are involved - main role as fundraising. Mr Grant Watson, a partner with Bristol surveyors Alder King and until two years ago chairman of the south-west council, said: 'There were some good social occasions. We had a lot of fun.' Mr Peter Foden, chairman of Cheshire-based ERF truck maker and a member of the north-west council for 25 years, said: 'The money doesn't buy favours, just the opposite. Industry has had a rough few years.' Most people in the network say raising money is getting more difficult. Mr Tom Martin, chairman and part-owner of the Hull-based Arco clothing company and a member of the North Yorkshire and Humberside Industrialists Council, has through his company given the Tories more than Pounds 100,000 over 30 years. He said: 'There is a great reluctance to cough up. The Conservatives will have to do something more distinguished if they want to carry people with them.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY GAINS CASH FROM INDUSTRY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- City and Industrial Liaison Council  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HQ: London Pounds 1,500,000 annually Secretary: Maj.

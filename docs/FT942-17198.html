			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Frank G Gates leaps to Pounds 2.1m Frank G Gates, motor dealer, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 886,000 to Pounds 2.1m in 1993. Turnover grew 35 per cent to Pounds 76.5m, mainly due to increased sales of new and used vehicles. Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said the second half turned out to be similar to the first six months. Gross profits, however, rose only 15 per cent due to lower margins on new vehicle sales. Earnings per share advanced from 3.65p to 6.45p, while the dividend is stepped up from 2.25p to 2.75p.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Gardening: Royal Kew goes the American way - Guides will take individuals or parties around London's botanic gardens IN AMERICA, it is customary for botanic gardens to have well-trained guides to conduct those visitors who want to make more than a superficial visit. In Britain, though, this is a rarity; and even so great an establishment as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south-west London, has only one guide. It is no wonder that her engagement book is filled for many months ahead. But, thanks very largely to the enthusiasm of the director, Professor Ghillian Prance, this is about to change. Last June, it was decided to appoint an expert in this kind of work, and Catherine Rosborough was selected. The idea was to train voluntary guides who, while being paid only travelling expenses, would get certain privileges at Kew. In return, they would give a fairly small amount of their time to taking individuals or small parties for tours lasting about an hour. The duration would either be left to the guide's discretion or be tailored to meet the special requirements of the visitors. These voluntary guides do not need to have botanical expertise since no one can have intimate knowledge of more than a small fraction of the plants in a great garden such as this. What is required is a good general knowledge of gardening, an enthusiasm for Kew, an ability to communicate easily, and a pleasant personality. When word got around that volunteers were needed, hundreds responded. Most were women, no doubt because more women than men are free to work part-time albeit for no financial reward. Eighty-five of the applicants were interviewed and 24 - 20 women and four men - were selected. After training, they will start their duties from March 19 and some applications for their services have been received already. To publicise the scheme, mail-shots have been sent to all tour operators who take parties to Kew and also Women's Institutes, horticultural societies and other organisations likely to be interested. An application form is available which gives full particulars and has space to detail any special interests of vistors. March 19 was set as the start date because that is the day the fine new visitors' centre, near the Victoria Gate on Kew Road, is due to open. It will have a large shop and a great deal of information about the garden. The guides will be based there, although that does not mean that all their tours will start from there. They can be engaged to meet a person or a party at any point in the garden of special interest to them. All this makes welcome news, and my own view is that it will not be long before another batch of guides is undergoing training.

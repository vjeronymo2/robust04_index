			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: SELECTING CORRECT KITCHEN TOOLS SIMPLIFIES DEALING WITH CITRUS  FRUITS  </P> <P> Any job is easier when using the right tools. Here are some that are helpful  when working with lemons.  </P> <P> Before using these implements, wash and dry the fruit. The term zest refers  only to the outer yellow part of the lemon peel, not to the more bitter white  portion.  </P> <P> With the exception of the zesting tool, all the implements featured in this  column are included in the Sunkist Lemon-Aid Kit. To purchase a kit, send $3.50  (includes tax and postage) to P.O. Box 4587, Overland Park, Kan. 66204. Allow  four to six weeks for delivery.  </P> <P> Individual tools may also be found in most housewares departments and cookware  stores.  </P> <P> Grater -- Remove the outer colored layer of the lemon peel by making quick  downward strokes on a citrus grater (Step 1), with fine, sharp rasp surfaces.  Measure the grated zest lightly into a spoon, but do not pack. For easy  cleanup, place the grater on a sheet of wax paper before beginning.  </P> <P> Zester -- This handy tool has five small holes with cutting edges on the end of  a blade fastened to a plastic or wooden handle. By pulling the tool down the  surface of the lemon (Step 2), you can cut fine strands of zest. The cutting  action of the zester releases the citrus oil, so it is a good idea to work over  the dish being flavored.  </P> <P> Twister -- Narrow strips or spirals of peel are fast and easy to make with this  tool. Simply pull it down the side of the lemon (Step 3) or cut in a circular  fashion around the fruit. Remember that giving the peel a twist before it is  used releases the fragrant lemon oils.  </P> <P> Faucet -- Also called a lemon spout. Without cutting off the top of the lemon,  twist this handy device (Step 4) into the stem end until the plastic threads  are covered. Open the top and squeeze the fruit to extract juice. Snap the cap  closed for storage.  </P> <P> Juicer -- Lemons yield more juice by bringing them to room temperature. Before  juicing, roll the fruit on a hard surface with the palm of your hand (Step 5)  to break the juice sacs. Cut the lemons in half crosswise and ream out the  juice on a hand or electric juicer.  </P></p>

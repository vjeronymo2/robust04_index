Thus  Guangzhou has now become one of the top three cities of China in  terms of comprehensive economic strength, while topping other  cities in terms of some other economic performance indexes.    Over the 13 years of reform and opening up, Guangzhou has  always kept its economy growing at a two-digit annual growth  rate. Guangzhou's GDP last year is expected to reach 68.2  billion yuan, an increase of more than 21 percent over the  previous year. The tertiary industry sector is expected to  share nearly 50 percent of this GDP, thus ranking Guangzhou  second among other cities in this sense.</p>

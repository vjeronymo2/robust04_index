			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Moss Bros pleases City with jump to Pounds 1.92m Moss Bros Group, the specialist men's wear retailer, outstripped City expectations for the second time this year by trebling pre-tax profits in the six months to July 30. The shares jumped 37p to 375p yesterday after the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 625,000) on turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 25.5m). Analysts had forecast profits of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.3m. Operating profits increased fivefold to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 304,000) as the group maintained gross margins of about 50 per cent. Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said the group would expand organically, adding six new shops to its current total of 100. 'We are not in the business of running off to buy other people's failed brands,' he said. 'Our expansion will be careful. We will not be signing idiotic leases.' Moss Bros claims to have increased its share of the suit market from 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent as competitors have withdrawn from suit sales to concentrate on casual clothes. The group's stores include Savoy Taylors Guild, serving the classic suit market; The Suit Company, serving the mainstream market; and Cecil Gee, the fashion chain. Its target customers are aged between 25 and 64. The group remains cautious but 'confident' about the Christmas period, which dominates its earnings. It also expects the second half to be affected by the cost of opening two new shops in January. Although capital expenditure increased by 43 per cent to Pounds 1.7m, net cash also grew, from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 13.6m. The interim dividend is doubled to 3p (1.5p) to reduce disparity. Earnings per share trebled from 2.5p to 7.6p. COMMENT Moss Bros prides itself on a cautious strategy: waiting for the right shop lease to come along in the right location, keeping cash in the bank and targeting a mature customer, who can give the business a decent margin. Predicting Christmas trading is notoriously difficult, but the group is expected to show a 12 per cent increase in like-for-like sales in the second half. According to the company, this is comfortably outstripping growth in the men's wear market of 4 to 5 per cent this year. Analysts yesterday raised forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits from roughly Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 6m, giving a p/e of 16 on yesterday's closing price. This is on a par with the sector, while Moss Bros deserves a premium. Optimists about consumer spending may see an additional reason to buy the shares.</p>

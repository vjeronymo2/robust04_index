			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] On Thursday night, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  commented on the first preliminary meeting between government  and the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity]  representatives. On this topic, the president said he trusts  these first rapprochements will yield good results in order to,  later, insist on a peace agreement.    [Begin De Leon recording] We have learned that the first  stage of the preliminary meeting, a discreet meeting, was held  today, aimed only and exclusively at establishing the  mechanisms, procedures, and frames of reference for establishing  a formal dialogue.    This means that this preliminary meeting is not meant to  analyze the plan. The plan is being carried out in its first two  stages: The national reconciliation here in Guatemala and the  struggle against poverty, which is the second stage, or a  response to the economic and social needs, which is also being  developed.    The third stage, however -- the dialogue between the  government and the URNG to end the internal armed conflict,  which is more than 30 years old -- is the one that today, in the  first session or meeting, was started through a preliminary  meeting.    I know today's meeting agenda was thoroughly discussed; that  is why we said the meeting was not successful, but just normal,  I would say. The URNG representatives and the representatives  of the government I head talked about and completed the agenda  for today; tomorrow, the meeting continues, and, I can say, with  great hope and faith that the political will of the parties will  be presented and demonstrated at this first meeting and, of  course, in the others too. This could lead us, in the short  term, to the possibility of reaching peace, to later dedicate  ourselves to peace, and not just to end the internal armed  confrontation; this is not just peace as an absence of bullets,  but also to build peace here -- economic, social, and overall  peace with social justice for all Guatemalans. [end recording]    The president added that the armed rebellion in Chiapas  State, Mexico, will not have a negative influence on the peace  talks with the Guatemalan guerrillas.    [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ... favorable in a  way, because I believe that this, pressures -- to use an  adequate and simple term -- the URNG to speed up the peace  process, mainly taking into account the fact that one Guatemalan  has already been captured after participating in those  subversive activities, those illegal actions, outside the law of  Mexico; and therefore, I think this in no way hurts the peace  talks. On the contrary, I think it speeds up the process. It is  another external aspect that contributes to the fulfillment of  that political will by the URNG.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the Mexican Army,  however, has repeatedly accused Guatemalan refugees in Mexico of  starting that rebellion. What is your opinion on this?    [De Leon] We respect the events that take place in other  countries, the treaties, and the sovereignty of other countries,  and therefore, we limit ourselves to commenting on what we know,  what the Mexican Government has stated, and what the media has  reported to us.    Later, we will be able to provide official statements from  the Guatemalan Government, but, for the time being, we only know  what the Mexican Government has stated, and we stick with that  because we respect their statements.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Aql: "In Order To Absorb </F> Unemployment"]    [Text] The Alexandria Businessmen's Association's  experiment of espousing a small industries policy as a means to  absorb unemployment and help develop the Egyptian economy has  proved a great success, now that the problems of funding this  large project have been overcome. Grants by the American AID  [Agency for International Development] organization have also  helped. Such projects have proved to be successful in all parts  of the world when supervised by community institutions such as  businessmen's associations. As we have said before, the  Alexandria Businessmen's Association's project has made it  possible to provide 20,000 jobs.    The association's sense of the dimensions of the  unemployment  problem is leading it to make an effort to carry such a project  to all the governorates of Egypt.    Furthermore, AID has decided to implement five similar  projects in five governorates. The Alexandria Businessmen's  Association has volunteered to make every effort to provide the  necessary training and bring its experience to the governorates  in which the new projects will be implemented. Training has  already begun.    Transferring this expertise is necessary for all the  associations that are going to take charge of these  projects--especially for the leaders and cadres working in such  a project.    Transferring the systems followed in accounts, information  extraction, monitoring by highly developed computer programs,  and training on the record-keeping cycle of all operations, as  well as management systems, incentive systems, legal systems and  compensations for workers, surely will save much time and  effort. It will enable the new projects to achieve positive  results in the shortest possible time. This will make us very  happy in Alexandria because of our sense of having given  something to the country.    Perhaps private, nongovernmental associations will begin to  implement such a project in all governorates of Egypt. We know  that AID has a great desire to establish and fund such important  projects as soon as an organized group of businessmen exists  eager to serve its country and ready to shoulder this  responsibility in one of the governorates.    The Alexandria Businessmen's Association currently manages a  project funded at 39 million pounds by the Social Fund in  cooperation with Bank Misr. The project's goal is to establish  new enterprises for graduates of universities and technical  institutes and schools.    Many young people frequently ask about the terms for  obtaining these loans.    The terms, briefly stated, involve presenting a good study  that explains how the enterprise can succeed and the existence  of a place where it can be implemented.    The association has already begun implementing the project.  Four months ago, some 3,000 young people submitted studies in  which they applied for loans to begin new businesses. About  2,500 applications were rejected due to lack of places for the  young people to set up their desired enterprises. The rest of  the applications are proceeding well. The association, in  cooperation with Bank Misr, is allocating about 1 million pounds  a month in loans to young people who fulfill the terms in many  areas of industry, agriculture, livestock fattening, and  services.    Those responsible for the project at the Alexandria  Businessmen's Association are determining by experience the  problems that small industries confront in development. The  association has a number of observations about these problems.  The most important of them are:    1. We all know that the bulk of the unemployed are  concentrated in old cities and zones of haphazard development.  Because these small industries depend for their marketing on  members of the community, they cannot survive if they are moved  outside the community.    Decisions now being implemented aim at moving all industries  away from the cities in order to improve environmental  conditions. This is being done at a time when alternative  locations have not been prepared near the communities, so that  the industries can expand in them without restrictions. These  decisions prevent any small enterprise from making any change in  the place it uses or rearranging it so that it can expand. Thus,  they aim at combatting expansion, while Egypt's welfare demands  that these enterprises develop and expand.    Also, these decisions provide a golden opportunity for the  bureaucrats charged with overseeing them to control these  industries and thus create an unstable condition for them.    We all know that on New York's Seventh Avenue there are tall  buildings completely filled with small factories that produce  everything imaginable. We see the same story in Hong Kong and  Taiwan. In many countries there are hundreds of large buildings  containing factories of all specialties located inside the  cities and on all streets.    We must also remember that the electric motors that run  these  industries have developed so that they no longer produce any  noise. The laws allow the installation of air conditioners  everywhere. They are run by electric motors whose horsepower  often is much greater than what some handicraft industries use.    Certainly, the unemployment problem is so serious that it  must take priority over the environment problem, especially in  the conditions that the country is currently experiencing.    Implementing such decisions in the old cities not only  hinders the development of small industries, it prevents the  possible establishment of new industries. Studies estimate that  at least 50,000 new enterprises could start every year in these  communities. Currently they cannot be established, and their  [potential] owners become not only a force that is unemployed  but one that is destructive to society.    We hope that all the decisions will be changed so that they  promote the expansion of small industries or the establishment  of new enterprises in the old cities, as long as they do not  emit noise, gases, fumes, or odors that harm the environment.  Other than this, it is not right to place any restrictions.    The pioneering productive families project that the Ministry  of Social Affairs is sponsoring under the leadership of its  minister, Dr. Amal 'Uthman, depends on employing these families  in productive activities inside the residence where they live,  thereby transforming the families into a self-supporting  productive force that can contribute to economic development. It  is not right for decisions to be implemented that go counter to  this national strategy.    2. Encouraging the establishment of light, labor-intensive,  nonpolluting industries is one of the most important ways of  dealing with the unemployment problem in Egypt. We all know that  high wages for workers in the advanced countries are causing  such industries to be closed in those countries and move to  countries that enjoy cheap labor. Egypt can benefit greatly from  putting millions of workers to work in these industries. The  most important of them are the ready-made clothing industry,  handmade carpets, electronics, and assembling industries. Any  ready-made clothing or electronics factory can easily absorb a  thousand workers.    These industries do not lend themselves to establishment in  new communities because the operation of transporting thousands  of workers daily from the old cities where there is an  accumulated work force to the new cities is a very costly  operation that tires the workers and affects their productivity.  Such enterprises must be established in old cities, villages,  and zones of haphazard development, so as to turn unemployed  workers in those areas into a healthy, productive force.  Unfortunately, this principle conflicts with the decisions now  being implemented. Such industries therefore are not spreading  or expanding to absorb thousands of workers because the  operation of transporting workers every day increases the  industry's cost and reduces the workers' productivity.  Furthermore, these industries need to enjoy the same years of  tax exemption set in the new communities. We hope this problem  will be studied seriously. We ask officials to visit the  clothing factory in al-Badrashayn. It employs 3,000 workers, and  all of its production is earmarked for export to the United  States. It is an example of what we are talking about.    3. When it issued the recent unified tax law, the government  paid attention to giving a five-year tax exemption to new  enterprises funded by the Social Fund.    In the People's Assembly committee that held hearings on the  aforementioned law, the Alexandria Businessmen's Association  proposed that the same exemption be applied to the loans that  any registered nonprofit association grants to combat  unemployment, just as is done with the Social Fund. We hope that  this view will be followed in the future.    These are some observations that will help with formulating  the necessary plans to deal with the problem of unemployment.</p>

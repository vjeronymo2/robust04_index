			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Banesto group makes more loss provisions CORPORACION Banesto, the industrial holding controlled by Banesto, the big Spanish retail bank, will make provisions against the losses by subsidiaries for the second consecutive year. Mr Arturo Romani, chief executive of the holding, said he expected Pta18bn (Dollars 190m) to be put aside for 1992 write-offs and bad debts. Last year provisions totalled Pta28.6bn. Corporacion Banesto has been hard hit by the spiralling losses of its mining division Asturiana de Zinc which has posted a six-month shortfall of Pta8.5bn against losses of Pta3.2bn in the corresponding period last year. Losses at Tudor, the holding's battery producer, rose in the first six months of this year to Pta1.8bn against a shortfall of Pta798m in the same period last year. The holding's main money earners have posted lower first-half earnings. Profits at the construction company have fallen to Pta764m from Pta1.6bn and the steel manufacturer Acerinox earned Pta1.1bn against Pta4.1bn in the first half of 1992. A spokesman for Corporacion Banesto said the 1992 provisions would be covered by the Pta35bn earned by the holding through the disposal made midway through July of Sanson, its cement unit.</p>

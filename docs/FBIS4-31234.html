			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia network] </F>   [Excerpts] On Omaha Beach in Normandy, veterans, monarchs,  and heads of state and government from the 19 countries of the  former anti-Hitler coalition, including President Lech Walesa,  paid tribute to the soldiers who fell during the allied landing  50 years ago. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] According to President Lech Walesa, the Polish  contribution to the allied effort also has contemporary  significance.    [Begin Walesa recording] We fought, wherever it was  possible,  for freedom in Europe. The war ended and you forgot about us.  And now we are calling to you again: Gentlemen, this is a very  decisive period. It is a period when we are not threatened, but  we do not want the threat to reach you. It is you who are  threatened. So, look at Poland, a medium-sized country that  really knows what is going on in the world. That is why your  actions should be different. If this does not happen, we will  lose our way at these crossroads [as heard]. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

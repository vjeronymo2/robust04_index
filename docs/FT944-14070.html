			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Choice for domestic gas consumers essential Sir, Michael Heseltine is right (Survey of the UK Gas Market: 'Support for liberalisation gathers pace', October 20). As the president of the board of trade points out, it is indeed high time that the 18m domestic consumers currently served by British Gas were offered a choice of supplier. Recent debate on the effects of competition has focused on potential moves towards differential pricing - both from region to region and between the high and low-volume gas users. The links which are being made between the introduction of competition and tariff rebalancing are, however, misplaced. It is true that re-balancing may well take place in the near future. But adjustments would inevitably happen anyway, regardless of competition. Under the Gas Act 1986, the regulator, Claire Spottiswoode, must ensure that British Gas does not discriminate in its pricing and, indeed, a review of tariffs to ensure that they more closely reflect true costs is sorely needed. What is clear is that, without competition, consumers faced with higher prices would have no choice but to pay them. With competition, they could up sticks and buy elsewhere. There must, of course, be vigorous public scrutiny of proposals to adjust tariffs, to reassure domestic consumers that British Gas is not trying to load the dice as competition looms. Some proposed adjustments may need to be challenged; British Gas may, for instance, have to be pressurised to reduce any inefficiencies rather than pass costs to consumers. As the Gas Consumers Council illustrated, in its evidence to the House of Commons trade and industry committee on October 19, there is an overwhelming consumer argument in favour of dismantling British Gas's monopoly. As long as basic ground rules for competition, particularly on obligation to supply, are established and guaranteed, and costs to market entrants are set fairly, there is no reason why domestic consumers should not enjoy the significant benefits promised by competition. With the Queen's speech in the offing, the initiative lies with the government. It must use its leg-islative clout to promote its competitive convictions. Gas competition is long overdue.

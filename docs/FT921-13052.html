			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Loss of 1,105 mine jobs is confirmed BRITISH COAL yesterday confirmed that it would cut 1,105 jobs at four pits in its Selby group of mines in the Yorkshire area, including its flagship Selby complex, a costly development the size of the Isle of Wight. More than 200 jobs are to go at Whitemoor, one of seven pits in the Selby complex itself. Another 150 will be eliminated at Sharlston, near Wakefield, while 410 and 350 redundancies, respectively, are earmarked at Kellingley and Prince of Wales, both near Pontefract. Confirmation of the cuts came as British Coal announced a further 30 to 40 job losses at Kiveton Colliery in its South Yorkshire group. The announcement fuelled speculation that the company may be attempting to reduce manpower and improve productivity in readiness for privatisation if the Conservatives win the next election. British Coal said the cuts were necessary if the mines were to bring down costs sufficiently to sell to the newly privatised electricity industry at competitive prices after March 1993, when government-backed contracts run out. According to the newsletter Coal UK, the company may also be trying to cut the volume of output. The company still has more coal than it can sell to the generators, the newsletter says, some through productivity improvements. Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said the job losses would not result in output reductions. He said they were aimed at ensuring that the pits were 'physically and financially strong'. There is no sign so far that the four Selby pits affected by the job cuts face closure. Kellingley was picked as one of 14 mines profitable enough for a sell-off, according to NM Rothschild, the government advisers on coal privatisation, in its controversial report leaked last year. The other three mines, that were not chosen by Rothschild, are believed by industry observers to be either losing money or near break-even. Three of the pits in the Selby group - Riccall, Wistow, and Stillingfleet - have frequently broken productivity records, but both Whitemoor and North Selby, the most recent mine to open, have met geological obstacles that have sometimes halted production.</p>

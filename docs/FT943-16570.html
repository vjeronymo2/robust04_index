			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Schmidt sweeps up at Denmark's ISS The battle for power at the world's biggest cleaning company has been settled, writes Hilary Barnes. Waldemar Schmidt, 53, has been tapped to take over from Poul Andreassen as the next chief executive of the Danish-based International Service Systems (ISS). Schmidt, managing director of ISS Europe in London since 1989, has been appointed deputy group managing director and will take over the top job in May 1996. He will have a hard act to follow in Andreassen who joined ISS more than 30 years ago when it was one of many small Danish cleaning companies. Since then he has built it up into the world's largest cleaning group with 120,000 employees in Europe, North America and Brazil, and a 1993 turnover of DKr13.3bn. Schmidt's main contender for the job was Henrik Slipsager, 39, chief executive of ISS's US business. Slipsager announced last Thursday that he plans to quit at the end of the year but will continue as a member of the board of the US business.</p>

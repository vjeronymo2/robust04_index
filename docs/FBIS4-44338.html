			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- The first general congress of the People's  Democracy Party (HADEP) was held at the Ataturk Sports Hall on  Friday [24 June]. HADEP was founded to take the place of the  Democracy Party (DEP) which was closed down by the  Constitutional Court.    So far, no one has come forward as a candidate for  chairmanship of HADEP, although acting chairman Murat Bozlak is  expected to announce his candidacy for the post. DEP Chairman  Hatip Dicle, who is currently in prison, has rejected calls to  run as a candidate for the HADEP chairmanship. "Our friends  outside will be of more help," he said.    Several DEP members, who joined HADEP after DEP's closure,  stated that they wished to continue their political struggle  within the new party. Seventeen of DEP's administrators joined  HADEP before the congress.    They include the party's deputy chairmen Osman Ozcelik,  Bahattin Gunel and Kemal Bilget and the administrators Ismail  Arslan, Seyhmuz Cagro, Nevzat Ozbay, Ahmet Cihan, Harun Cakmak,  Melik Aygul, Muharrem Keklik, Ahmet Karatas, Mehmet Nuri Gundes,  Mehmet Zeynettin Unay, Mahmut Kovan, Aynur Gurbuz, Veysi Aydin  and Ali Beykoylu.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cabra arm issues writ against Chelsea FC A HIGH Court writ has been issued against Chelsea Football Club demanding that it pay Pounds 22.85m to buy its Stamford Bridge ground in west London. Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra Estates, the property company that owns the ground, repeated yesterday that Chelsea would be evicted if it did not complete the purchase. The writ was obtained by SB Property Company, a subsidiary of Cabra. Mr Duggan said he had arranged for it to be served on Friday. This would give Chelsea until January 23 to pay or contest the claim. Cabra said the independent valuation of Pounds 22.85m, in late November, had finalised a contract for Chelsea to buy the ground. In March Cabra had net debts of Pounds 52m. Mr Duggan said yesterday: 'I want to get paid and to take the shortest route so that I do get paid. If they don't pay, we will kick them out.' Mr Duggan added that 'fruitful discussions' had continued with Chelsea. He had had lunch with Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman, on Friday. The parties had exchanged promises 'not to be controversial'. Mr Duggan understood that Mr Bates had gone to Hong Kong as part of his efforts to raise the money. He also believed there had been some talks with a UK bank. Mr Bates was described by his public relations aide as being 'on a working holiday for three weeks'. He had left on Sunday and the Far East was thought to be on the itinerary, as well as a cruise ship. Mr Bates has contended that the net amount to be paid for the Stamford Bridge site could be reduced by such factors as: Pounds 5m from Fulham FC, a potential ground sharer; the value of Chelsea's stake in SB Property; and a settlement of Chelsea's outstanding legal actions against Cabra.</p>

Inacker article: "`The Debate Is One That </F> Should First Be Conducted in Qualitative Terms and Only  Secondarily in Quantitative Terms'"]    [Text] Hamburg -- The new Federal Government white paper,  entitled "The Security of the Federal Republic of Germany and  the Current Position and Future of the Bundeswehr," is to be  published on 5 April. In it, the Federal Government sets out  its security and defense policy, the Bundeswehr's future  mission, as well as the way in which the armed forces are to  perform it. The 1994 white paper thus fulfills an important  task, because the interested citizen has had to wait nine years  for an assessment of German security and defense policy, which  has been prompted by the dramatic changes in world politics.  The very way in which the Bundeswehr and the Western alliance  has reacted to the changes that have occurred until now is  significant -- it is the only way in which the role of armed  forces can be appreciated in a difficult political situation.  The white paper provides no patent recipes for the future; what  it does contain are parameters for a historically necessary  discussion about the tasks and functions of the armed forces of  a united Germany as the strongest power in Central Europe. The  debate is one that should first of all be conducted in  qualitative terms and only secondarily in quantitative terms.    The WELT AM SONNTAG has listed the main points of the white  paper as follows:    1. The introductory chapter "German Unity and the  Bundeswehr" describes the underlying factors and point of  departure for the 1989 European revolution: The collapse of  communism in Europe and of the Iron Curtain, the dissolution of  the Warsaw Pact and ultimately the fall of the Soviet Union.    2. The chapter entitled "The Situation" states the  following:    Germany achieved unity with the approval of all its  neighbors  and the world powers and now has complete sovereignty. It is  now surrounded solely by democratic states, friends, and  partners.    However, the European landscape still represents a  contradictory picture. Advanced integration processes contrast  with centrifugal tendencies and tendencies toward the  fragmentation of state units in the eastern and southeastern  parts of the continent.    Now, it is important to take steps to eliminate new risks,  which are qualitatively of an entirely different kind from the  risk that rightly determined Western security thinking in the  past. The risk of a large-scale war throughout Europe has been  replaced by an entire variety of risk factors that differ  greatly regionally. Overall, there has been an increase in the  number of unstable regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The  readiness to resort to military means is increasing everywhere.    Military conflicts, which could endanger Germany's  existence,  have become improbable as long as Germany, in alliance with  NATO, can maintain its ability to defend itself. In the future  strategic context, military risks will only be a part of a broad  spectrum of security policy considerations. Risk analyses of  future developments must proceed from a concept of security.  They cannot be limited to Europe, but must take into account  the interdependence of regional and global developments. They  must consider social, economic, and ecological trends and their  relation to the security of Germany and its allies.    The prevention of conflicts and the resolution of conflicts  in a broader geographical context with a legitimate mandate  under international law must be in the forefront of concerns  about security. Within the framework of a cause-based policy  for the solution of crises and conflicts, the use of military  means may also be necessary to prevent, limit, or end violence  or war.    3. The chapter "The Concept of German Security and Defense  Policy" states:    Concrete security policy action is based on interests.  German  security policy has to take into account political constant  factors and long-term framework conditions: Germany's  geographical position in the center of Europe, its economic  position as an exporting nation, close links with the world  economy, and, finally, the experiences of German and European  history.    German foreign and security policy is guided by five key  interests:    -- Safeguarding the freedom, security, and well-being of  Germany's citizens and the inviolability of its territory;    -- Integration with the European democracies within the  European Union [EU], because democracy, the rule of law state,  and well-being outside Germany's borders also means security and  freedom for Germany;    -- The enduring alliance with the United States as a world  power, which is based on common values and similar interests,  with the potential of the United States being indispensable for  international stability;    -- The admission of our Eastern neighbors to Western  structures in a manner that is geared toward equality and  partnership;    -- Worldwide respect for international law and human rights  and a worldwide economic order based on free market rules.    4. The chapter "Areas for Action for German Security Policy"  describes the international institutions in which Germany  participates:    Germany is a member of the United Nations; a participant in  the CSCE; and a member of NATO, the EU, and the WEU [Western  European Union]. These institutions should supplement an  efficient security order in Europe and for Europe.    NATO's main task remains contributing to a lasting and just  peaceful order in Europe in conjunction with other institutions.    The January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels sets a decisive  course in that respect. It provide answers on three key points:    -- The ability to exercise collective defense, which is the  cornerstone of European security. Alliance defense remains the  core function. However, it is unlikely that NATO will have to  defend itself. On the other hand, the numerous crises and  limited conflicts in Europe and on the edge of Europe, on the  other side of the alliance's borders, are real. That requires  that NATO should be able to participate in the international  resolution of crises.    -- The reform of NATO and European integration processes are  now closely linked to one another. The WEU will be strengthened  as the European pillar of the alliance. In the future, it will  be able to seek recourse to NATO structures and forces. Thus,  Europe will be in a position to act strategically, and, at the  same time, dual structures will be avoided. That will relieve  some of the burden on the United States and will, at the same  time, create conditions for a lasting U.S. commitment in and for  Europe.    -- NATO has made the stabilization of Central, southeastern,  and East Europe a joint task of the first order. With the  Partnership for Peace initiative, the alliance has made an offer  of greater cooperation in peace missions under UN and CSCE  mandates to our neighbors in the East.    The Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step on  the road to introducing new partners into Western security  institutions. It is no substitute for opening up the alliance.    In a transitional period in particular it is important to  take into account the interests of all. This means that the  alliance must pursue cooperation with Russia just as intensively  as its preparations for the integration of new members.    The Maastricht Treaty of 7 February 1992 sets out  perspectives under international law for European political  union, which is based on and shaped by shared values and  principles. It entails a joint European foreign and security  policy.    The CSCE is being developed into an operational instrument  for the prevention of conflicts and resolution of crises.    By joining the United Nations in 1973, Germany has  recognized  the rights and duties that that entails without reservation.    To meet our increased responsibility, the United Nations  also  requires the support of regional organizations and alliances.  In Europe, NATO and WEU are partners of the United Nations and  the CSCE. The German contribution to safeguarding peace will in  the future be primarily political and economic, not military.  With respect to the deployment of military forces, Germany will  only act in conjunction with allies and partners within the  framework of a UN mission.  <H3>  On the Current Position and Future Development of the  Bundeswehr </H3>   Chapter 5. "The Bundeswehr of the Future"    National and alliance defense in a markedly better security  situation, especially in Central Europe, and the increased  significance of effective and preventative crisis management are  the new points of departure for determining military  capabilities and their qualitative and quantitative form. The  Bundeswehr now has a different spectrum of tasks; it is broader,  more diverse, and more graduated than under the one dimensional  threat of the period of East-West confrontation.    It is of key importance that Germany should possess adequate  forces for national and alliance defense that can be brought up  to strength and will thus be able to provide forces that are  immediately available for alliance crisis management and  international peace and humanitarian missions.    The Bundeswehr's task gives concrete form to these two main  functions. The Bundeswehr:    -- defends Germany and its citizens from political blackmail  and external danger;    -- promotes the military stability and integration of  Europe;    -- serves world peace and international security in line  with  the UN Charter:    -- helps in the case of catastrophes and emergency  situations  and supports humanitarian operations.    The Bundeswehr is and remains a conscript army. Universal  military service is part of the approach to defense that has  developed in Germany over decades. It stands for the readiness  of citizens to assume personal responsibility for the protection  of their state. It guarantees the ability to mobilize by  drawing on reservists.    The structure of the Bundeswehr will be adjusted to suit  changed security policy framework conditions and to fall into  line with the capacities that are required. The armed forces  are divided into three categories:    -- crisis reaction forces that are on alert;    -- the extensive main defense forces, which are subject to  mobilization;    -- the basic military organization of the armed forces,  which  serve the function of the core of the armed forces.    The requirements and possibilities of defense and responding  to crises will in the future lead to a marked graduation of  armed forces readiness that will correspond to the Bundeswehr's  task.    National defense capability will be consistently directed  toward improving Germany's security position. The strategic  situation permits a clear reduction in the armed forces for  national defense.    However, in view of Germany's geostrategic position, making  a  special contribution to the level of forces that can be  mobilized in Central Europe will have a bearing on Germany's  influence in alliance decisionmaking processes. The ability to  mobilize on the part of the main armed forces is a decisive  element in national defense and for Germany's importance in  NATO's central task, collective defense.    The Bundeswehr is by and large adequately equipped for  national defense. What is still lacking is the ability to  participate effectively in international crisis management.    What is necessary is a German contingent that will be part  of  crisis response forces, a contingent that is in a position to  conduct operations together with alliance partners and thus  cover the entire range of possible missions.    The formation of the contingent should be such that Germany  is able to meet its obligations with respect to NATO and the  WEU. It must be in a position to operate within the framework  of NATO and the WEU as well as to cooperate effectively with  partners under the auspices of the United Nations. In addition,  it must be versatile, flexible, durable in order to fulfill the  entire spectrum of tasks in crisis management, UN peace  missions, and humanitarian missions in various deployment  regions.    The adjustments that have to be made to the Bundeswehr are  based on the need to effectively develop the basic ability to  resolve crisis, to implement the principle of universal military  service sensibly, and obtain planning security in view of scarce  resources. This means that the Bundeswehr will continue to  rationalize in a consistent manner.    Intelligence gathering, extensive mobility for the  deployment  and supply of military contingents, sea and air transportation,  general supply and communications capabilities, and effective  air defense are of key importance for future defense planning.    The future size of crisis response forces, the more  pronounced differentiation of the main defense forces,  operational rationalization and the streamlining of structures  will open up options for the future internal structure of the  armed forces, personnel levels, and the stationing of personnel.    Chapter 6. "The Bundeswehr in Transition" describes the  current position of the army, air force, and navy, central  Medical Corps offices, as well as central Bundeswehr offices and  their specific contributions to the main tasks of the Bundeswehr.    Chapter 7. The final chapter describes the role and  self-perception of the "Bundeswehr in the State and Society."    The transformations in security policy also have  psychological and moral implications for military  self-perception. The scope of this self-perception is being  expanded. The active promotion of peace has now been added to  the prevention of war. The soldier remains the defender of  freedom and peace. He must be able to fight and when necessary,  risk his life for the protection of Germany and for others  within the framework of international obligations. That is the  ethical core of military service and remains unchanged.    However, today the focus is no longer on defense against a  direct threat. Today the question is also one of helping people  and peoples in need and danger, reconstructing states that have  been destroyed, and keeping those who disrupt peace in check.    As far as training is concerned, only forces that are ready  for action can satisfy requirements and survive the extreme  burdens imposed on them. These criteria determine the form,  extent, and intensity of training in the armed forces.</p>

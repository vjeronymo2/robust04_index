The notifications were filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages under specified circumstances.

The objective of PLM TRP is to provide the most advanced and affordable US military systems, and the most competitive commercial products in the global marketplace for the automotive, aerospace (platforms and propulsion systems), heavy equipment, and shipbuilding industries through a new generation of laser machine tools and advanced laser manufacturing processes. To accomplish this objective, a consortium of industrial laser users, process developers, system integrators, and technology developers has been established forming a fully integrated team. This will avoid inefficient duplication of effort and expense while performing research in this area, collection, exchange and, where appropriate, dissemination of the research results, to work closely with various governmental and private agencies and perform further acts allowed by the Act that would advance the PLM TRP's objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership in PLM TRP remains open, and TRW intends to file additional written notifications disclosing all changes in membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information regarding participation in the project may be obtained from: Dr. Leonard J.

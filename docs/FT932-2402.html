			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bleak outlook seen for New Zealand's kiwi fruit growers PROSPECTS FOR the New Zealand kiwi fruit industry are bleak and questions need to be asked to establish whether it has any future at all, the Ministry of Agriculture says in its annual report - The Outlook for New Zealand Agriculture. The report notes that in the 1992 season returns from kiwi fruit fell to a record low of NZDollars 3.85 (Pounds 1.40) a tray, and this led to the sole supplier, the Kiwifruit Marketing Board running up a debt of NZDollars 85m because of its inability to sell its total export crop. New Zealand successfully developed kiwi fruit as an international commodity, turning it into an industry with NZDollars 1bn worth of exports in 1991. That fell to about NZDollars 500m last year. The report notes that New Zealand is now competing with soaring production from Italy, now the world's biggest producer, as well as supplies from France and Chile. The report says New Zealand's kiwi fruit production will fall by about 25 per cent this season as restructuring continues and growers remove vines. It says the international outlook is poor, with supplies of the fruit rising and no increase in demand. However the ministry believes that New Zealand will be best be served in its international marketing by the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, rather than by individual marketers. It says abolishing the debt ridden board and returning to multiple marketing will cost the industry even more, adding that one disastrous season is not a good basis for making a change. The report shows that New Zealand's gross agricultural production rose by nearly 8 per cent in the year to March 1993 to about NZDollars 9.7b. Total farm output rose by 8 per cent in 1992-93 and further growth of 4 per cent is expected in the year to June 1994. Commenting on the report, Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, said the achievement in the past year was significant as agriculture had had a difficult year. He thought the outlook was promising in view of the country's increasing competitiveness. The report says prospects for dairy and sheepmeat exports are good, while for venison, wine and well-organised horticultural products they were encouraging. Not so good, however, is the short term outlook for wool, with prices and demand down and the Wool Board still holding 360,000 bales. The ministry says that recovery in world economic growth is needed for there to be any significant upturn in the wool market. It sees better prospects for sheepmeat, with lamb prices in Europe higher. Payments for all grades of lamb will rise by more than 25 per cent a head this season, it estimates. The report warns, however, that sheep numbers in Europe are increasing. It says the outlook is good for all dairy products, except butter, where prices are likely to remain depressed. Export returns from deer products, such as venison and antler velvet, in demand in Asia as a supposed sexual stimulant, continue to rise and prices are expected to remain stable. New Zealand pigmeat production rose 10 per cent, reflecting lower feed costs, the ministry says. Chicken's share of the domestic food market rose from 14.5 to 20 per cent. The country's beef cattle herd rose 1.7 per cent to 4.75m, and is expected to continue growing over the next two years.</p>

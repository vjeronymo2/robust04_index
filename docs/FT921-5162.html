			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Nato fears grow over Nagorno-Karabakh NATO yesterday expressed concern about the fierce fighting over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, as the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said about 35,000 Azerbaijanis were fleeing from Armenian attacks, Reuter reports from Brussels. Nato officials said Mr William Taft, the US ambassador, told his colleagues at a weekly alliance meeting that pressure was building on Azerbaijan to 'pursue a military solution' to the dispute with Armenia over the enclave. In Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, opposition leaders demanded the resignation of President Ayaz Mutalibov for failing to defend the Azerbaijani population of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian fighters. An emergency parliamentary session was called for today following an attack by Armenian militants on Khojaly, the second most populous Azerbaijani stronghold in the mountainous enclave. Azerbaijan says more than 1,000 people were killed in the attack on February 26 and 27. Armenia denies any massacre and says its people in the region have been forced to defend themselves against Azerbaijani aggression. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Azerbaijanis were flooding towards Baku to escape Armenian militia attacks in the city of Agdam just outside the enclave. In London, it was announced that Mr Douglas Hogg, British Foreign Office minister, will visit Azerbaijan and Armenia next week for talks.</p>

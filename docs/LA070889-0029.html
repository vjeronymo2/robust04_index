			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man wanted on charges of defrauding a Virginia bankruptcy court was ordered  held without bond Friday by a federal court magistrate who said there was a  "very serious" risk that he would flee if released.  </P> <P> David DeFusco, 34, and his wife Annette, 27, were arrested Wednesday in their  rented home in Rancho Santa Fe by FBI agents, who searched the house and found  thousands of dollars worth of furs, wine, furniture, jewelry and computer  equipment that the DeFuscos allegedly moved from their home in Virginia in an  attempt conceal the property from bankruptcy officials.  </P> <P> The DeFuscos, who have used several aliases since they moved to California  three months ago, also face mail-fraud charges in Texas in connection with  their direct-mail solicitation business, which purportedly made false promises  of expensive gifts to prospective buyers of time-share resorts. They are under  investigation in the state of Washington for a similar operation, according to  federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> U. S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez said Friday that Annette DeFusco, who wept  throughout the proceeding, also is a flight risk, but set her bond at $150,000  so that she may care for the couple's two children. David DeFusco's father and  brother, who were in the courtroom, said they were willing to post Annette  DeFusco's bail.  </P> <P> A hearing on whether to transfer the couple to Virginia to face charges there  will be held this month.  </P></p>

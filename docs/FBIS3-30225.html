			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak President Michal Kovac spoke today in favor  of preserving the Visegrad Group's role as a practical  consultative forum, without its being institutionalized. He  said that mutual cooperation of Central European countries would  help to speed up the inevitable economic changes and their  incorporation into the well-tried European structures.    Replying to a question about whether in his opinion the  Visegrad Group could exist without the Czech Republic, President  Kovac said that, in the talks he had in Prague, there was no  indication that the Czech Republic was not interested in mutual  cooperation. President Kovac therefore does not think it  appropriate to consider other alternatives to the Visegrad Group.</p>

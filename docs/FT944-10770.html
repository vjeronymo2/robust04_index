			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer At first sight, the 5.5p drop in Marks and Spencer's shares yesterday seemed a churlish reaction to a characteristically robust performance from the UK's leading retailer. After all, M&amp;S brushed off fierce competition to turn in a 15.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, ahead of brokers' best estimates. The interim results did however give rise to slight mystification over the composition of the profits. M&amp;S could have helped dispel this by disclosing more information about how it achieved the 15.7 per cent increase in UK operating profits. It is, for example, disingenuous on its part to claim that it cannot produce meaningful data on 'like for like' sales, as other retailers do. M&amp;S should also have disclosed more about the impact of the group's cost control programme - a central if unquantifiable factor behind the increase in operating margins. The absence of such information raises questions about the quality of the profits, taking the shine off M&amp;S's success in increasing its share of the non-food retail market, and apparently holding its own in food. M&amp;S's ambitious expansion plans for the UK and continental Europe ensure that despite its size, growth prospects remain excellent relative to the retail sector. Yet earnings growth is not expected to outpace the market as a whole. With the shares on a 25 per cent premium, assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 950m for the full year, this is demanding. The record and the group's financial strengths ensure that M&amp;S is in no danger of losing its standing as a core holding within the sector. But there is better value elsewhere.</p>

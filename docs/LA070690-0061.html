			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> It was a bad day all the way around for accused bank robber Alexander Hatfield,  27, of Scripps Ranch Thursday.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Hatfield was the suspect who Thursday  morning robbed the HomeFed Bank branch in the 10000 block of Scripps Ranch  Boulevard.  </P> <P> It was hardly a high-scoring heist. After demanding that a teller hand over  money, the robber fled with $331.  </P> <P> Then, the robber had trouble getting his car out of the bank parking lot,  giving bank employees time to get his license number and relay it to police.  </P> <P> A short time later, Hatfield found himself being pursued by police. The pursuit  ended when he crashed his car into a tractor-trailer at Mercury Street and  Engineer Road in Kearny Mesa, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police arrested Hatfield and found $331 dollars in his pocket, according to  Robinson.  </P> <P> Hatfield was in jail Thursday night, and the FBI said it would bring a  bank-robbery charge against him and would check to see if he is a suspect in  any other bank robberies.  </P></p>

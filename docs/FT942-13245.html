			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Reuters rides high Reuters finds it hard to do much wrong these days. Few large companies can deliver 15 per cent increases in their revenue when world inflation is at such a low ebb. The information and media group was duly rewarded by a 2.5 per cent rise in its share price on a day when the market fell 1 per cent. Investors could, though, be forgiven a sense of vertigo. Assuming 1994 earnings per share of 21p, the shares are now on a price earnings ratio of 25 compared to the market's average of 14. To justify such a rating, Reuters needs to show not just a few years of above-average growth but double-digit growth at least until the end of the decade. Such a performance is possible. Reuters' core financial services markets are booming again. As banks devote more of their energies to trading rather than lending, demand for Reuters' services is rising. Instinet, the group's equity transaction arm, was the star turn in yesterday's first quarter trading report. Though its 89 per cent rise in revenue was buoyed by acquisitions, its market is far from saturated. Reuters is also well-positioned to expand into fast-growing electronic information markets outside financial services. However, maintaining current growth rates beyond the next few years will require not only continued success in defending its lucrative financial markets franchise from competitors but an ability to earn the same sort of fat margins from new activities. It can be done, but it is a tall order. Even if Reuters succeeds, it is difficult to see much upside in its shares.</p>

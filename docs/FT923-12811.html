			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash futures active SHORT sterling continued to see very heavy trading as dealers speculated ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting about the prospect of raised interest rates. The September contract opened two points lower and continued to fall until it reached 89.77, at which stage it was discounting the possibility of a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 10.25 per cent. It steadied to close around 89.80, its lowest since becoming the front-month contract. Turnover of around 47,000 lots by the official close was the highest during the past three days of active business. Dealers said that while sellers were offloading ahead of the prospect of a rate rise there was also significant buying. The bull case was that if the Bundesbank does not lift the Lombard rate but increases the less significant discount rate, short sterling will bounce 20 points to around 90.00. However, if a Lombard rise is announced there will only be a five-point loss. In the cash market, the three-month interbank rate, which tends to be seen as the most significant indicator of future interest rates, also reflected anticipation of an increase in the base rate. It climbed by two points to close around 10 3/16 per cent. Meanwhile, the overnight rate was quoted at 9 7/16 per cent and one week money at 10 per cent. The Bank of England was unable to provide much early assistance to correct yesterday's forecast liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1bn. It gave cover of only Pounds 42m, with dealers said to have been standing back in the hope of longer term money. However, it later provided short-term band 1 and band 2 loans. At noon, the Bank provided a further Pounds 1.021bn of assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.063bn. The shortage was revised to around Pounds 1.2bn. The Bank later revised its liquidity forecast down by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.1bn and gave late assistance of Pounds 70m. The German money market remained tense as speculation continued that the Bundesbank would tighten policy at today's council meeting. A DM5.5bn addition of funds to the market in a tender for securities repurchase funds did little to relax the market. Call money remained at or just below 9.75 per cent.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome back Wellcome's full-year results demonstrate why the market should not get carried away with the threat of tougher government action on drug pricing in the US or elsewhere. A company which can generate annual volume sales growth of 15 per cent surely has little to fear from a Democratic president. The market was a bit uncharitable, then, to send Wellcome's shares lower. July's share sale gave investors every chance to pore over the books, so the results can hardly have come as a surprise. One can only assume that institutions which bought stock at 800p in the summer succumbed to the temptation to take a 25 per cent profit. With operating margins now only fractionally below its 30 per cent target, though, the best of the efficiency gains from Wellcome have now been seen. Retrovir, its much-hyped HIV treatment, now looks unlikely to reach blockbuster status. Hence Wellcome will have to squeeze every ounce of potential from Zovirax, its anti-herpes drug, if the rate of growth is to be maintained. The threat of competition from the likes of SmithKline Beecham - and patents which expire in mid-decade - underline the urgency. That said, the important US patent for Zovirax does not expire until 1997. And Wellcome has drugs in development which may be a match for the competition. Wellcome must also decide how to spend surplus cash accumulating at an annual rate of Pounds 200m. A net cash balance of over Pounds 400m is already something of an embarrassment for a growth stock. There are no plans to expand the research and development programme, so one can only assume Wellcome has its eye on possible acquisitions. The cash would already buy a useful position in the over-the-counter drugs market, for example, even at today's dizzy multiples.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since promulgation of the final regulations for the anti-dumping program, the Agency has determined that the valid range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits in the Simple Model for aromatics, which are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictive than those for conventional gasoline under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model, could be widened without any detrimental impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on either the program or on the environment. Without such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change to the regulations, refiners may be forced to make changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to their refineries by 1995 that are not necessary in 1998 when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance under the Complex Model is mandatory. Thus the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is changing the high end of the valid range for aromatics under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Simple Model from 45 volume percent to 55 volume percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change will ensure that the Simple Model can be used for as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many conventional fuels as possible to show compliance under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anti-dumping program without the need to extend the valid range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environment will not be adversely impacted since it was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's intent to allow extensions of the valid range when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiner's 1990 baseline fuel exceeded the specified valid range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits. The change will not affect RFG compliance, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics are controlled by the reformulated gasoline standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for toxics. Driveability will not be affected since fuels with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics levels as high as 55 volume percent currently exist in-use. Also, consistency in the high end of the valid range limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for aromatics will be maintained throughout Phase I of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Because the relationship between toxic emissions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel aromatics levels is linear in the Simple Model, the change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not result in an inaccurate application of the model to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher aromatics levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Change to Low End of Aromatics Valid Range in the Simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has also determined that the low end of the valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range for aromatics in the Simple Model may not provide refiners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with adequate flexibility under the reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. For the Complex Model, the Agency determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships between aromatics and emissions could not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trusted at levels below 10 volume percent. However, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that a flat-line extrapolation below 10 volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, in which no emission benefits or detriments result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowering aromatics values below 10 volume percent, would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater flexibility without compromising the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model equations in this range. Since promulgation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, the Agency has determined that the Complex Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to low values of aromatics can be appropriately applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Simple Model as well. Therefore, the Agency is changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the low end of the valid range for aromatics under the Simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model from 10 volume percent to 0 volume percent, but will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow any emission benefits in this range. The Agency did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intend to discourage the production of fuels that had very low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of aromatics, and were, thus, qualitatively considered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be cleaner burning. If the low end of the valid range for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics is left at 10 volume percent, fuels with aromatics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values of less than 10 volume percent that would otherwise be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complying reformulated gasolines under the Simple Model will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be certifiable, despite the fact that those same fuels may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifiable under the Complex Model. This change is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be environmentally benign, as few refiners will have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive to reduce aromatics below 10 volume percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline under the Simple Model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Change to High End of Benzene Valid Range in the Simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in Section II.A.3, it was and is the intention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency, to the extent possible, not to establish regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that require the reformulation of conventional gasoline under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anti-dumping program. However, the valid range limits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzene under the Simple Model may in fact force refiners to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulate conventional gasoline. The Agency has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the valid range limits in the Simple Model for benzene,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are more restrictive than those for conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline under the Complex Model, can be widened without any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detrimental impacts. Without such a change to the regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiners may be forced to make changes to their refineries by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 that are not necessary in 1998 when compliance under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model is mandatory. Thus the Agency is changing the high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the valid range for benzene under the Simple Model from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.5 volume percent to 4.9 volume percent. This change ensures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Simple Model can be used for as many conventional fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible to show compliance under the anti-dumping program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the need to extend the valid range. The change will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect RFG compliance, since benzene is controlled by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline standards for fuel benzene content. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> like manner to raising the high end of the valid range for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics, consistency in the valid range limits will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained throughout Phase I of the program. The environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be adversely impacted since it was the Agency's intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow extensions of the valid range when a refiner's 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline fuel exceeded the specified valid range limits. As for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatics, because the relationship between toxic emissions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel benzene levels is linear in the Simple Model, the change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not result in an inaccurate application of the model to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher benzene levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

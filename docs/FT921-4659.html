			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland raises stakes in Steetley bid - Full cash alternative more important than increased share offer REDLAND yesterday delivered what it hopes will be a knock-out blow by increasing its share offer and providing a full cash alternative for Steetley, its rival building materials group. Redland is offering 87 of its shares for every 100 Steetley shares, valuing its target at Pounds 624.7m or 388.9p a share. The cash alternative is worth 365p a share. Previously Redland's offer was on a 85-for-100 basis and had provided only a partial cash alternative. Steetley has advised its shareholders to take no action until the group had convened a board meeting to consider the increased offer. Following yesterday's moves, Redland's share price fell 7p to 447p. Steetley shares rose from 377p to 380p. Redland is also offering 100p for every Steetley 3.15 per cent cumulative preference share. The decision to provide a full cash alternative was regarded as more important than the slight increase in the ordinary share offer which was offset by the subsequent fall in Redland's share price. Redland said that a full cash offer would allow it to buy up to 29.9 per cent of Steetley's shares in the market. Under the previous terms, it could only have bought up to 9.9 per cent. Some of Steetley's institutional shareholders have indicated that they would prefer a full cash offer although it is questionable whether they would have declined Redland's original terms given the weak defence put up by Steetley. Steetley's revelation in its defence document on Thursday, that it had been forced to cut Pounds 40m from the book value of its French business was regarded by independent brokers as a body blow at that stage of a bid. Redland's new offer compares with an asset value estimated by Steetley in its defence document of 375p - or 394p if the value to Redland of its surplus advance corporation tax capacity were to be included. Mr Robert Napier, Redland managing director, said last night: 'We have now seen Steetley's defence and it is weak. Its profits have collapsed; it is financially stretched; plans to merge its UK brick and clay tile operations with Tarmac have collapsed and it has written off nearly half the cost of Gobitta, its largest ever acquisition. 'Our offer provides Steetley shareholders with a 55 per cent capital increase on the price of Steetley shares at the beginning of December when our bid was announced. 'It will also provide a 55 per cent increase in income and participation in a well financed international group which is strong in focused products and will benefit from Pounds 30m of cost savings from a takeover of Steetley by Redland,' said Mr Napier. The offer is due to close at 1pm on Thursday, March 26.</p>

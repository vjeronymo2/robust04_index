			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Pensions switch may have cost taxpayers Pounds 1.3bn The UK life insurance industry may have earned Pounds 400m to Pounds 1.3bn of taxpayers' money since 1988 by selling personal pensions, according to an analysis of government statistics. The figures also show that about 60 per cent of nearly 5m people who have taken out personal pensions since 1988 are making no provision for retirement other than the tax refund paid by the government after they opted out of state pensions. The analysis, by the Financial Times in consultation with actuaries, shows that in the past five years the government has paid about Pounds 10.5bn to people taking out personal pensions, in the form of rebates on national insurance contributions. These are paid to encourage people to opt out of the State Earnings- Related Pension Scheme and into personal pensions. But insurance industry experts estimate that companies selling personal pensions typically take 4 per cent to 13 per cent of an individual's tax rebate in commissions and charges for sales agents and management fees. Mr Frank Field, MP, chairman of the House of Commons social security select committee, said it planned to start an inquiry into the transfer of tax rebates into personal pension plans this April. 'We are going to follow the pounds and see where they ended up,' he said. 'It is as worrying for the individuals as it is for taxpayers.' The figures show that by April 1992 more than 300,000 of the men and women who contracted out of Serps through a personal pension were going to receive lower benefits on retirement than if they had remained contracted in. That is because the rebate system gives far more than a young person needs to buy pension benefits equivalent to Serps, but far less than an older person would need. Department of Social Security and Inland Revenue data show that of the 4.7m people with personal pensions in April 1992, only 40 per cent are saving more towards retirement than the rebate itself. But DSS officials were privately encouraged by recent figures showing an improvement on the 1989-90 tax year. Then, fewer than a third of personal pension holders made extra contributions. The rebate is paid to a personal pension account set up with an insurance company in the individual's name. Low earners pay proportionately more of their rebates to the insurers. Mr David Dow, a partner at Wyatt Financial Services, which analyses life insurers' fees, said: 'On a state contribution of Pounds 700 to Pounds 800 a year, the impact of a Pounds 2-a-month charge is small. But if you only get Pounds 200 per year, then the effect is quite great.' Pensions time bomb: special reports, Page 8</p>

The traditional  methods for preparing alloyed ultra-fine (micron and sub-micron)  powders by reduction of oxalates and decomposition of carbonyls  are both cumbersome and laborious. In a previous work an attempt  was made to prepare ultra-fine iron-nickel powders by  electrolysis in a double layered bath. However, the formation  conditions and the properties of the resulting powders were not  well studied. In the present work a study was made of the  effects of the electrolysis conditions on the rate of formation,  the yield according to current, the chemical and dispersed  composition, the specific surface, and the magnetic properties  of iron-nickel powders as prepared by electrolysis. Analysis of  the resulting data demonstrates that by correct selection of the  electrolysis conditions it is possible to prepare iron-nickel  powders having the required particle size and the desired nickel  content.

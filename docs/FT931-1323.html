			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour moves on social chapter LABOUR has tabled a new amendment to the Maastricht bill, which could leave the government with the choice between having to accept the social chapter or being unable to ratify the treaty. The amendment would prevent the ratification bill coming into force until the House of Commons had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK. This would mean a separate debate after the bill itself had completed its parliamentary passage. In a further threat to the government, it emerged that at a meeting on Tuesday, Tory Euro-sceptics received legal advice which encouraged them to seek judicial review of the attorney-general's opinion about the impact of a separate Labour amendment. Last month, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, surprised MPs by contradicting Foreign Office lawyers' advice that accepting the amendment, which excludes the social chapter from the bill, would wreck the treaty. If the amendment is passed, the Tory rebels are now determined to challenge his view. Labour is confident that its new clause on the social chapter is within Westminster's procedural rules. The decision about whether the Commons should debate it rests with Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker. The new clause is being carefully studied by other opposition parties and by Tory rebels, but it would be a tortuous process to reach the point at which the government had to choose between not going ahead with Maastricht and adopting the social chapter. To get there, Tory Euro-sceptics would have to vote explicitly for the social chapter - which they do not support - in the hope that ministers' vehement opposition to the chapter would mean that the government would prefer not ratifying to adopting it. But if that were the choice, the government would come under severe pressure from many Tory backbenchers to accept the social chapter rather than wreck the treaty, since they believe that more jobs would be lost through a fall in inward investment if the UK did not sign up to Maastricht than would be lost because of the impact of the social chapter. One possibility would be for the Tory rebels to vote for the amendment to the bill without committing themselves on how they would vote in the subsequent debate on the social provisions. In the Commons itself, on the 17th day of detailed discussion of the bill, government hopes of speeding up progress were given a boost when Liberal Democrat MPs helped it to secure a majority of 57 to curtail a debate on the role of the European Court of Justice. Tory Euro-sceptics repeatedly challenged claims by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a foreign office minister, that the court had already adapted to a less centralised role and was taking increasing account of the views of individual national governments.</p>

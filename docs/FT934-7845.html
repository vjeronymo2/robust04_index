			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Next chapter of the railway children: The competition between European groups for high-speed rail contracts If Mr Claude Darmon is right, the world's railways may be entering a new golden age. The head of transport operations at GEC-Alsthom has a vision of sleek high-speed trains running at more than 300 kph (187 mph) between many of the world's largest population centres, cutting journey times and curbing pollution. 'We are looking at one of the biggest ventures of the next century,' he says, comparing the new generation of high-speed railways to the development of international highways and telecommunications. From Europe to Asia, Latin America and the US, the growth of urban populations, national wealth and rail technology lend weight to his view. But if the potential is great, so is the competition. Mr Wolfram Martinsen is Mr Darmon's greatest competitor and rival as chief executive of Siemens Transportation Systems. His group, with Daimler-Benz's subsidiary, AEG, leads the consortium behind the InterCity Express (ICE) train, which is seeking to erode the lead enjoyed in the world market by GEC-Alsthom's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV). It is a classic tale of European rivalry. Mr Martinsen is slightly less sanguine than Mr Darmon in his assessment of the market. 'Within the whole world market for railways, the high-speed market accounts for a maximum of 15 per cent,' he reckons. The clearest example of the high stakes involved in the industry rivalry has come from South Korea. In August, GEC-Alsthom beat off a furious challenge from Siemens-AEG to win sole negotiating rights to build a high-speed link between Seoul and the south-eastern port of Pusan. Final details of the Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.61bn) contract to supply the trains and technology are now being hammered out. Siemens is still protesting at the decision, as is the Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi, which manufactures the Shinkansen, or bullet trains; but their chances of a Korean change of heart appear slim. The battle for the Korean contract, however, is just one round of the fight for dominance between the three principal players in the industry. Already, they are preparing to fight for the next contract. First is a possible project to link Taipei with the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung. Bids are expected to be invited towards the end of 1994. Also on the drawing board are plans for high-speed rail links in Canada, possibly linking Toronto and Quebec via Ottawa and Montreal; in the US, between Washington, New York, and Boston, as well as in Texas (from Houston to Dallas), Chicago, California and the north-west; and between Sydney and Melbourne in Australia. Siemens and AEG have just spent DM17m (Pounds 6.7m) sending a full ICE train to the US, first to undertake a coast-to-coast promotion trip ('Ride the ICE train, the hottest thing on rails' goes the blurb), and now to run for a three-month trial period on the Amtrak lines from Washington to New York. Both sides have taken in US partners: GEC-Alsthom has linked up with Morrison-Knudsen, and Siemens-AEG with General Motors. Even so, Mr Martinsen believes, 'the US market will develop quite slowly'. In Europe, therefore, the potential may be greater. At the moment the economic environment is difficult. The effects of recession and the constraints on government budgets have forced the postponement of several TGV orders. Last month, GEC-Alsthom was forced to announce a cost-cutting plan which includes the loss of 660 jobs from its French workforce of more than 9,000. But the first steps of a significant expansion in European high-speed rail links are under way. The decision by the French government in September to build a new high-speed line between Paris and Strasbourg raises the prospect of the TGV travelling across the border into Germany. It will already do so on the planned Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and Cologne route, for which 27 trains have been ordered. The French authorities have also authorised an extension of the south-eastern line from Lyon to Marseilles and to Montpellier. That would all appear to be to the clear advantage of the TGV. In Germany, however, the ICE consortium has just won the DM2.2bn next-generation contract for an ICE-2, half the size of the original train, but capable of being linked in pairs to provide greater flexibility. ICEs are now running between Hamburg in the north and Berlin in the east to Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart and Zurich in the south and west. In its 1994 summer timetable, the German Bundesbahn plans to extend the ICE to Vienna. While the prospects for demand appear healthy, the competition to supply high-speed rail contracts is likely to remain fierce. This is largely the result of the nature of the industry. The market for such networks is comprised of a relatively small number of large projects which come up only every few years and which last for many years. The South Korean contract, for example, is not expected to be completed until 2002. For GEC-Alsthom and its rivals this time lag makes each contract critical. The experience acquired on one puts the manufacturer in a stronger position for the next. Similarly, the economies of scale obtained by winning several contracts allow cheaper pricing in future bids. German industry is still reeling from its setback in what Mr Martinsen calls 'the Korea shock'. The final decision in favour of the TGV was said to be because the French train had proved itself for more than a decade, whereas the ICE has only been running since 1991. Government support is essential to win such massive prestige contracts, Mr Martinsen says. 'It is a question of lots of money, and long-term co-operation. This is only possible if the political will exists.' Yet he admits that in the US market, for example, the successful contractor will be decided on the basis of 'technology, price and local content. It won't help us much if Chancellor Kohl goes over there'. Two crucial developments lie ahead. The first is the need to develop multi-system, cross-border trains. If the European links are to become reality, the trains must be able to deal with a host of electricity voltages, signalling systems, and safety standards on different national rail systems. They must also become decidedly cheaper. This all adds up to good news for the consumer. But for the producers, it raises the question of whether all can survive. Mr Darmon believes not. 'I doubt very much there is room for three high-speed train manufacturers in Europe,' he says, referring to GEC-Alsthom, Siemens-AEG, and the five-company Trevi consortium, the Italian high-speed train venture led by Breda. 'The investment in R&amp;D and the cost of developing prototypes is too high if you don't win contracts,' he adds. The intensity of competition could encourage collaboration. 'We are open to co-operation with anyone, and why not Siemens?' asks Mr Darmon. Such a view is supported by the French and German governments, which last year appointed representatives to examine possible co-operation. The representatives have a delicate task in accommodating national rivalry. Mr Darmon says co-operation would have to consider the fact that 570 high-speed trains have been manufactured by or ordered from GEC-Alsthom, while the comparable figure for the German consortium is 120. He adds that any partnership between the two groups should be based on cost and efficiency considerations and not national and political splits. Mr Martinsen seems to be more interested in a link-up with the Italian consortium. 'I am convinced we will have two trains in Europe,' he says. 'There is a big enough market at the moment. Whether we can keep that for good is another matter. But that is a question for the railway companies, and the politicians.'</p>

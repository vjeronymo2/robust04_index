			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / 'I voted yes to all the questions - that's what we're supposed to do, isn't it?' ELENA Leskova, a 26-year-old teacher from the Russian town of Tula, south of Moscow, stood in the polling station at school number 45 yesterday and gave a sheepish grin. 'Last week I thought I wouldn't vote. I'm fed up with politics,' she said. 'But today the weather isn't so good and we didn't go to our dacha, so in the end I voted for Yeltsin.' Judging from the scenes at the polling station in this industrial Russian city yesterday it appeared that Ms Leskova was not alone in her indecision. Although the turnout in the region had reached 60 per cent two hours before polls closed - above the level needed nationally to render the first two questions on the referendum valid - there were signs of the apathy and uncertainty that surrounded the referendum, especially outside Moscow. 'Compared to before, the turnout is not very good. But it's better than we expected,' said Ms Nadezhda Zabotina, head of the election committee at the Tulachermet factory, as she sat ticking off the voters on multi-coloured, hand-drawn charts. Like most polling stations the factory was playing music and selling cut-price snacks in an effort to attract the voters. The expectation yesterday was that President Boris Yeltsin would receive a majority in this town, but not a large one. Although he received a warm welcome here on a visit during his presidential campaign two years ago, support among the regional council and local factory directors has evaporated, in part because the town's many arms factories have suffered from cuts in defence spending. Slightly over half the people questioned at polling stations yesterday said they had voted for Mr Yeltsin, some out of enthusiasm, others from habit. 'I voted yes to all the questions - that's what we're supposed to do, isn't it?' said an 81-year-old pensioner, as she shuffled out of the polling station, clutching a pot of milk. Further along the street a group of young soldiers said they too had mostly voted for Mr Yeltsin. Some had not. 'I voted against him because he has betrayed his promises and it's so hard to live on our student grants,' said Sergei, 22, a student at the local engineering institute. Against a background of rumours of attempted vote rigging, every voting paper had been signed in duplicate by the election committees, and the ballot boxes stamped with the old Soviet wax seal. Observers from the region's democratic movements and Russian Communist party were present at most stations. Several US observers were also in attendance. But reflecting the political disputes now bubbling in the regions, the local election committee had refused to recognise them officially. 'We don't want any foreign observers or journalists here. We have enough experience of running elections,' said Mr Andrei Tuyarkin, chairman of the regional election committee. However, the complexities of the vote, which required voters to deal with four separate pieces of paper, left many confused. 'It's a very crude system,' said Mrs Rufina Vitass, 65, who had arrived at a polling station with two other friends to vote for Mr Yeltsin. After receiving their ballot papers, they spread them out on a table and loudly argued over them for almost 10 minutes before agreeing on the 'correct' answers. 'I'm absolutely for Yeltsin. He is our hope for the future.'</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Major to meet Irish PM on future of Ulster talks AN URGENT meeting is to be held between the British and Irish prime ministers in London tomorrow after three days of talks in Dublin on Northern Ireland's political future, and a week of pressure on the Irish punt triggered by sterling's departure from the ERM. The Dublin talks, which were boycotted by the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), appear to have made only limited progress. Differences have emerged between the British and Irish governments over the sensitive issue of finding a date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference. Five hours of talks on Tuesday night between the two government delegations failed to produce a date, which had been tentatively pencilled in for next Monday. The two unionist parties object to any further meetings of the conference, held under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, while the present round-table talks are in progress. There is concern that the DUP might use a new conference meeting as an excuse to abandon the round-table talks. The Irish government is anxious that the agreement should not be undermined by further postponements of the conference, which gives it some, albeit limited, influence in Ulster's affairs. There have been two postponements since July and it has been five months since the last conference meeting. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is apparently seeking an 'immutable' date to be fixed. The complex three-strand round-table talks are scheduled to resume in Belfast next Wednesday. Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy leader of the Official Unionist party, described this week's Dublin round of talks as 'satisfactory'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'There is a lot of work to be done. It is a slow process . . . but I am heartened by the progress that has been made here.' Although Ulster will be high on the prime minister's agenda tomorrow, they will also discuss the ERM crisis.</p>

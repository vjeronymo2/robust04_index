			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government expressed deep concern and regret Saturday over the  virtual failure of negotiations between North Korea and the  International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) over refueling at the  5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon complex.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho urged North Korea to  immediately stop unloading fuel rods and accept the IAEA's  requests.    "We strongly request North Korea, as a member of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, faithfully abide by nuclear safeguards  obligations," he said.    He warned that if North Korea continues with unloading  process as to kill chances of measurements, the situation can  only turn critical.    Chang observed that the immediate discussions at the UN  Security Council after IAEA director-general's report was very  appropriate.    He added that Seoul will continue to exert all diplomatic  efforts in consultations with its allies to stop North Korea  from further unloading of nuclear fuel rods and make it accept  IAEA's requests.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal has not  produced the desired results. So says ANC National Chairperson  Thabo Mbeki. Sisako Nyaka has the story.    [Begin recording] [Nyaka] Mr. Mbeki told journalists in  Johannesburg today that violence could be curbed by improved  intelligence gathering and proper deployment of forces.    [Mbeki] We can't deal with the situation simply by  patrolling  up and down the streets in military vehicles. Something  additional has to be done.    [Nyaka] He also referred to the build-up of weapons in the  area and said that most of them had come from Mozambique. He  told the journalists that there had recently been an increase in  military training in Natal/kwaZulu. Mr. Mbeki warned against  the whipping up of panic and fear by forces opposed to the  election.    [Mbeki] We notice that the same forces that are opposed to  the elections are putting out all sorts of rumors. It's  happened in other parts of this region before, the elections in  Zimbabwe, before the elections in Namibia. We must put out that  in the aftermath of the elections, we will get all sorts of  trouble [sentence as heard]. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH OIL TANKER ACCIDENTS IN COASTAL WATERS  </P> <P> Larry Stammer's article on the plight of the Gulf of Mexico really hit home  with me (front page, June 15). I grew up in Rockport, Texas, 30 miles north of  Corpus Christi and until this past month, I had not seen the gulf coast for 20  years.  </P> <P> When a returned to the gulf, I knew there would be changes along the vast  virgin stretches of sandy beach where my friends and I had cruised. What I  wasn't prepared to see was a coastal garbage dump.  </P> <P> Besides the flotsam and bird carcasses, what I also found incredible was the  people in the area claiming that the pollution was coming from Mexico. Of all  the hundreds of washed up plastics and glass bottles, I never tripped over one  that had Hecho en Mexico written on it. What I did notice were dozens of  offshore drilling projects along the gulf horizon that didn't exist 20 years  ago.  </P> <P> Where does the debris on our beaches come from? The trash cans remain empty  while most of the garbage lay washed up onshore. The offenders are the  companies that are involved in the exploration and transport of oil found in  these offshore drilling projects. Isn't it time that our state and federal  politicians take a tougher stance on the regulatory practices of offshore  drilling as well as stronger enforcement of laws that tolerate no leakage of  oil from these projects?  </P> <P> Thanks to Stammer's article, I am no longer apathetic about the  de-gentrification of our shorelines. I am ready to join the protest. Everyone  agrees that it's time to clean up the crime in our streets. How about cleaning  up the crime in our oceans?  </P> <P> JAY DAYS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

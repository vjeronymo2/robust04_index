According to a U.S. military spokesman, the work was  suspended because of protests by residents of Legua de Pital,  who blocked roads and demanded drains be built to avoid floods  in the rainy season. The residents also warned that if troops  continue their work without changing their construction  techniques, they will organize more demonstrations to stop work  by the Army Engineers.    Meanwhile, a communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in San  Jose noted that U.S. soldiers will be remodeling and repairing  several schools in the area over the next few days. The  soldiers have been in the country since mid-January,  participating in the annual "Caminos de Paz 1994" maneuvers.</p>

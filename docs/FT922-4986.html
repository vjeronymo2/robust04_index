			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Russia to scrap special rouble rate RUSSIA is about to take the first step towards making the rouble internally convertible by abolishing the special exchange rate of 55 roubles to the dollar from July 1. President Boris Yeltsin is reported to be about to sign a document ordering all enterprises to sell 50 per cent of their hard currency proceeds to the central bank at the market exchange rate of 85 roubles to the dollar. At present, enterprises must sell 40 per cent of hard currency proceeds at the special rate of 55 roubles. The unifying of the rouble rates has long been proposed by the International Monetary Fund as a necessary first step in the currency reform. However, it will increase prices for imported goods for enterprises and may still be delayed by heavy lobbying against it. The president's move comes as the Russian reform programme is under attack in parliament and industry, and as the government is being forced to make big concessions to the industrial lobby. It faces hard bargaining with the IMF in Washington next week on the letter of intent detailing its economic programme which it must agree with the Fund before it has access to Dollars 24bn from the IMF and western countries. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, said the July 1 moves must be synchronised with the Dollars 6bn credits, part of the Dollars 24bn package, designed to stabilise the rouble. 'Everything depends on the IMF credits,' said Mr Gaidar. He also announced a 'relaxation and a gradual end to limits on credits to enterprises'. He has promised that Russia will print Rbs140bn this month, and that a new Rbs5,000 banknote will be introduced from July to end the shortage of cash which has meant workers going without pay. Mr Yeltsin yesterday despatched Rbs4bn to the Kuzbass coalfields and Rbs25m to the Krasnoyarsk chemical plant to pay wages and stop threatened strikes. He also sent an unspecified sum to the Tyumen oilfields, where workers have threatened stoppages.</p>

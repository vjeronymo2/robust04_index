			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENG'S 'RE-EDUCATION DRIVE' AIMED AT BOLSTERING HIS VISION OF CHINA  </P> <P> Despite the sweltering August heat, thousands of Chinese poured into the  People's Revolutionary Military Museum for the daily dose of official culture  and history.  </P> <P> They filed past glass cases containing blood-soaked army T-shirts, charred  rifles, Molotov cocktails, broken bits of bricks, smashed loudspeakers, cracked  helmets and crumpled shields. They were led into a makeshift theater where they  were shown the government version of the pro-democracy student protests that  were broken up June 3-4 with much bloodshed.  </P> <P> They were led past wallboard exhibits that describe the "heroics" of the  People's Liberation Army in the crackdown, an action that Western analysts and  independent observers describe as a massacre.  </P> <P> Through it all, the visitors remained silent. Only a few were bold enough to  remark that visiting the museum was not their idea.  </P> <P> The museum's hospitality guide told two visiting Americans on Monday that more  than 1 million people have now seen the two-week-old "Turmoil Exhibit," or, as  it is called officially, the "Exhibit of the Quelling of the  Counterrevolutionary Rebellion." Attendance is mandatory for all Beijing  workers as part of the new leadership's national re-education process, which  the government calls "cultural rectification."  </P> <P> Although different in ideology and scope from Mao Tse-tung's Cultural  Revolution of the 1960s and '70s, the campaign under the leadership of Deng  Xiaoping is aimed chiefly at reinforcing Deng's vision of Chinese society and  the Communist Party of China.  </P> <P> Deng's campaign has targeted everything from literature and journalism to  pornography and pop music, from political ideology to video games, from movie  houses to tea rooms.  </P> <P> Under Deng's direction, the orthodox party hierarchy has used a dual strategy  of censorship and substitution to carry out its campaign. The casualties have  been human as well as material.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Writers, Historians Targeted  </P> <P> In June, when the party leadership started its crackdown on the liberal and  progressive forces of Zhao Ziyang, the ousted party chief, many of Zhao's  supporters in the political hierarchy were purged. But in the last month  several key writers, historians and ideologues in the government's Ministry of  Culture and the Press and Publications Administration -- the powerful  censorship bureau -- have also been fired.  </P> <P> Reliable sources said Monday that the leadership has decided to replace the  minister of culture as well as two vice ministers, including Ying Ruocheng, who  gained world fame as the gentle prison warden in the Academy Award-winning film  "The Last Emperor."  </P> <P> Ying, whose movie character was purged in the Cultural Revolution, was  personally criticized by the party's aging conservatives when the film was  being made because he helped arrange for it to be filmed inside Beijing's  Forbidden City. Nonetheless, he kept his government post as vice minister of  culture.  </P> <P> Ying's pending, real-life purge is seen by several Chinese artists as an  especially bitter example of life imitating art.  </P> <P> Culture Minister Wang Meng, who was removed last week from his post as  secretary of the party's cultural committee because of his liberal ideas, is  soon to be replaced as minister by a hard-liner with a background in  propaganda, the sources said.  </P> <P> On the material side, the campaign has been even more sweeping.  </P> <P> It has been extended to virtually every province, and millions of copies of  books, magazines and video and audio tape cassettes have reportedly been  confiscated or destroyed. Booksellers have been fined or jailed. New museum  exhibits are carefully screened, as are all new films and publications.  </P> <P> In announcing developments in the campaign, the state-run New China News Agency  has said repeatedly that the materials confiscated or destroyed were found to  be "vulgar" or "anti-communist" or to be based on "pornography, feudal  superstition or bourgeois liberalization."  </P> <P> In one province, hundreds of videocassettes deemed pornographic were publicly  crushed by a steamroller. In another, thousands of copies of outlawed magazines  were burned.  </P> <P> The official news agency reported that in the city of Xian, "pornographic  publications . . . suffered a disastrous fate" when 4,000 government agents  raided 900 bookstalls and confiscated tens of thousands of books, magazines and  tapes.  </P> <P> The government has taken to calling such material "cultural opium."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Indoctrination  </P> <P> The hard-liners have not stopped at confiscation and prosecution. They have  devised a vast array of neo-conservative cultural programming for "misguided"  party members and government workers. This program of substitution has been as  intensive as the purge.  </P> <P> Journalists, editors and educators have been subjected to frequent political  indoctrination seminars. Party instructors have lectured dancers, singers and  actors in ballrooms and tea houses. Government censors have inspected  video-game parlors for games with sexual or political overtones and have  replaced many with games considered ideologically respectable.  </P> <P> The most intensive substitution programs have been concentrated in Beijing, the  center of the student unrest.  </P> <P> Tian An Men Square, which was the focal point of the student activity, is  closed to the public, but it was filled this week with hundreds of movie actors  and extras for the filming of a government television special to be aired over  several days leading up to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's  Republic on Oct. 1.  </P> <P> The film, one of several recent government productions, reportedly will  emphasize the need for strict adherence to the pure ideology that was the  backbone of the Chinese Communist revolution.  </P> <P> Another recent government film, "The 100 Colors Uprising," glorifies the  84-year-old Deng Xiaoping as a young revolutionary who led a key battle against  the nationalist forces in the late 1920s. Now in its third week in theaters  throughout the country, the film has been required viewing for government  workers, who are given free tickets.  </P> <P> Whether the campaign is having any effect on a population that has been exposed  to years of reform under Zhao and other progressives is not clear.  </P> <P> A taxi driver who had a copy of a banned book, a paperback detective story  entitled "The Case of China's Biggest Con Man," laughed when he was asked how  he had managed to buy a book that was banned.  </P> <P> "It's easy," he said. "All the booksellers still have them. You just ask for a  'yellow' book, show your identity card to prove you don't work for the police,  and you buy it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Book on Crafty Embezzler  </P> <P> Such "yellow" books are not really pornographic, the cabbie said. His book, he  said, tells of a crafty Chinese citizen who embezzled nearly $20 million  without getting caught. It is plots like this, he said, that account for the  popularity of such books.  </P> <P> "When people read the book, they think this guy is really cool," he said.  </P> <P> But there is another reason for what he and several other Beijing residents  called a resurgence in the popularity of such books, and it bodes ill for the  success of the government's cultural rectification campaign.  </P> <P> "The main reason," the driver said, "is that as soon as the government bans a  book or a magazine, for whatever reason, the first thing people want to do is  run out and buy it. People think there must be some great, mysterious reason  why it has been banned, and they want to get it before it's sold out."  </P></p>

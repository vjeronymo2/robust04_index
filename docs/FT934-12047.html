			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MMC to investigate Alcatel's bid for STC submarine division THE UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the Pounds 600m bid by Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment supplier, for STC Submarine Systems, the UK-based submarine cable subsidiary of Northern Telecom, of Canada. Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, has referred the deal to the MMC following a recommendation by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. Analysts were surprised by the reference, given the international nature of the undersea cable business and Northern Telecom's determination to sell STC. More than 90 per cent of STC's cable systems are exported. The European Commission's competition directorate cleared the takeover last month. Under the Fair Trading Act, the UK government has the power to refer mergers to the MMC if they create or intensify a market share of more than 25 per cent or if they involve assets worth more than Pounds 30m. STC is a principal supplier of long-distance undersea fibre-optic systems to British Telecommunications. BT made no formal objection to the Department of Trade of Industry, although it is known to have had serious reservations about the takeover. The submarine cable division was acquired by Northern Telecom as part of its Pounds 1.9bn takeover of STC in 1990. Although profitable, Northern has been looking to sell it for some time. The company has no submarine business in North America, and it sits uneasily with its core businesses of transmission, switching, radio/microwave and integrated networks. If the Alcatel deal is not agreed, the future of STC looks highly uncertain. It currently has 1,200 employees, mostly in Greenwich, London. Alcatel said yesterday it was 'not surprised' by the reference, given its size. 'We nonetheless regret the delay caused, because we want to create a strong European undersea cable business.' STC estimated that since 1985 it had won about 23 per cent of the Pounds 6.8bn long-distance submarine cable market. AT&amp;T, the US giant, was the market leader with about 37 per cent; Alcatel had gained about 19 per cent; and NEC and Fujitsu of Japan had about 18 per cent between them. BT is concerned about the reduction of competition in the undersea cable market, and the possibility that it could become reliant on AT&amp;T. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings Buying at Everest Foods, noted last week, has continued. The most recent transactions, by Christopher and John Fox Davies, came at 56p, the same as they paid previously. There has been no movement in the share price. The three directors buying at Country Casuals, the women's clothing retailer, were taking the chance afforded them by the fall in the share price after the announcement of interim results which reflected a fall from pre-tax profit to loss. The directors paid 84p; since then, the shares have rallied to over 90p. Back in the spring, Richard Johnston, chief executive of Wyko Group, bought 120,000 shares at 45p. Since then, the company has done well, outperforming the market by 26 per cent over the past three months. Now, chairman Philip White and Roger Edwards, a non-executive director, have sold 400,000 shares each at 61.5p. Even so, their holdings still account for almost 16 per cent of the group.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Directors' share transactions in their own companies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Value  No of Company              Sector     Shares    Pounds  directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Avonside             B&amp;C        50,000    56,000     1 Brit Fittings        Dist       25,000    21,750     1 Dorling Kindersley   Mdia      350,000  1,004500     1 Gerrard &amp; National   OthF       40,000   181,600     1 Portmeirion Potts    HGod      120,500   578,250     1 Psion                EE&amp;E      500,000  1,265000     3 Wyko Group           Dist      800,000   496,000     2 London &amp; Manchester  LifA       69,905  227890.3     1*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglo East Plant     OS&amp;B      150,000   147,000     2 BSG Int              Eng        35,000    19,950     2 Brammer              Dist        4,600    15,640     1 Brightstone Props    Prop       10,000    10,700     1 Country Casuals      RetG       42,500    33,400     3 Danka Bus Systems    EE&amp;E        5,000    15,100     1 Everest Foods        FdMa      215,000   120,400     2 First Choice Hols    L&amp;H        10,000    11,600     1 Grampian Hdgs        Phrm       53,000    50,880     2 HTV                  Mdia       15,000    22,200     1 IMI                  Eng        10,000    30,500     1 Nestor-BNA           Hlth       50,000    23,750     1 Sanderson Bramall    Dist      100,000   164,000     1 Value &amp; Income Tst   InvT      180,000   203,400     1 WPP Group            Mdia       50,000    52,500     1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies must notify the Stock Exchange within five working days of a share transaction by a director.

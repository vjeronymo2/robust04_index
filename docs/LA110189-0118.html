			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINOVICH HAS PASSING MARKS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE WAY THE USC QUARTERBACK IS THROWING, HE IS ON TARGET TO  BREAK MANY OF THE SCHOOL'S RECORDS.  </P> <P> After USC quarterback Todd Marinovich threw four touchdown passes against Ohio  State, his uncle, Craig Fertig, a Trojan quarterback in the 1960s, came up to  him grinning.  </P> <P> "Well, you tied my record," said Fertig, who once threw four touchdown passes  against Cal. "But you didn't break it."  </P> <P> Shot back Marinovich: "I've got time."  </P> <P> Does he ever.  </P> <P> Marinovich broke another of his uncle's marks last Saturday against Stanford  when he completed his 152nd pass of the season. That moved Marinovich past  Fertig into 12th place on the all-time Trojan list. Among others, he has  already surpassed Vince Evans and Jim Hardy.  </P> <P> And Marinovich has played only eight games.  </P> <P> With 3 1/2 seasons left, he seems a good bet, barring injury, to break every  passing mark at the school.  </P> <P> Admittedly, that's hardly like breaking rushing records at USC. For a long  time, the pages in the Trojan playbook devoted to the forward pass came labeled  with one of those signs found on fire extinguishers: To be used in emergency  only.  </P> <P> But Marinovich, following the path blazed by his predecessor, Rodney Peete, is  changing all that.  </P> <P> Quickly.  </P> <P> Only two months ago, he was still No. 2 on the depth chart, behind Pat O'Hara.  A knee injury suffered by O'Hara in a scrimmage 11 days before the season  opener changed that.  </P> <P> But Coach Larry Smith, understandably not yet a believer, kept Marinovich  largely under wraps on opening day against Illinois, limiting him to 27 passes  and nothing long until the final two desperation throws of a losing effort.  </P> <P> And yet, just five games later, Smith turned Marinovich loose in the home of  the defending national champion, allowing him to throw 55 times against Notre  Dame. That number broke the school record by 10. Marinovich also set a school  record that day for completions with 33.  </P> <P> "The remarkable thing to me is that they told me before the Notre Dame game  that they were relying on him to win that game," said Pat Haden, a former star  quarterback for USC and now a broadcaster who worked the Trojan-Irish game.  "They have incredible confidence in him."  </P> <P> So does Haden.  </P> <P> "I think that if he keeps going the way he has, he will be the quarterback that  all other quarterbacks at SC are measured by," Haden said.  </P> <P> Yet, Haden admits that he, too, is surprised at just how fast Marinovich has  come on.  </P> <P> "Everybody had high expectations for him," Haden said. "I knew him as a kid. I  heard about him for a long time. I had never seen him (play) in person until  Notre Dame, but I came away impressed.  </P> <P> "He has remarkable composure. There may be 100 guys walking the streets of Los  Angeles who are tall and can throw the ball as accurately. But what separates  him is the mental toughness and the composure. I don't think it's something you  can learn. It's innate. Nothing seems to faze him."  </P> <P> Was Haden anywhere near as confident halfway through his first season?  </P> <P> "I had great confidence," he said. "But then, I wasn't asked to carry the team.  We had a great defense. I handed off to great backs. And I threw the ball 15  times. Twenty-two times if I was having a great game. He throws that many by  halftime."  </P> <P> Sid Gillman has been watching football for nearly 60 years in various  capacities and he can't remember seeing a quarterback excel so quickly.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised by what he has done, really surprised," Gillman said from his  home in San Diego. "I don't know anyone who has come on the way he has. But  that's what happens if a guy has got some talent. Especially if he is well  coached. And there's no question Larry Smith is a hell of a coach.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen much of (Marinovich), but I've seen enough to know I'm really  impressed. He has a real good, strong arm. And a hell of a lot of poise. He's  going to be something with his ability and size."  </P> <P> Gillman figures that Marinovich's 6-foot-4, 210-pound body makes him an ideal  quarterback for the '90s.  </P> <P> "They are looking for guys who have size now," Gillman said. "A 190-pounder is  not going to make it. Defensive linemen lay on guys like that and they are out  for the year. A quarterback has to lift weights, come out of the weight room  like an offensive lineman."  </P> <P> If Marinovich has a liability, it is his habit of throwing interceptions. He  threw three crucial ones against Notre Dame and then came back last week and  threw two that killed drives against Stanford.  </P> <P> Overall, he has thrown a dozen touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He is  just 148 yards short of being the eighth Trojan to throw for 2,000 yards in a  season. His completion rate, 62.1%, puts him ahead of Bernie Kosar's NCAA  record for a freshman at Miami -- 61.5% -- and ties the USC record, set by Paul  McDonald in 1979 and tied by Peete last season.  </P> <P> Marinovich's development, fostered by his father, Marv, a star lineman at USC,  has been much-chronicled. That the work is paying off doesn't surprise Marv.  </P> <P> "You would figure that a dad would have inflated expectations, but I knew Todd  had those capabilities," Marv said. "To do it at Notre Dame is another thing. I  had to see that.  </P> <P> "But from week to week, he has gone to the next level because of his focus. He  is never satisfied. A lot of guys would figure they have arrived and they don't  have to do anything else."  </P> <P> After a game, it is Marv to whom Todd still turns for advice.  </P> <P> "He wants to know what I think," Marv said. "I think I'm pretty tough on him.  We talk about mechanics and concentration. He'll ask me, 'What did you think  about this play?' It's kind of fun.  </P> <P> "We've done this since he played youth football. Other kids would give it a  rest. We carried it on at the dinner table."  </P> <P> Is Todd playing for his dad?  </P> <P> "The whole thing that he is doing it for somebody else is just not so," the  senior Marinovich said. "You can't make someone work as hard as Todd has worked  for someone else. He is doing it for himself.  </P> <P> "I'm just enjoying watching him play. I would have been pleased with just his  high school accomplishments. All this is unbelievable for a dad."  </P> <P> Two things in particular impress Haden about Marinovich, his ability to handle  the rush and his ability to run.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys, when they get rushed, take their eyes off what's going on  downfield," Haden said. "Todd moves his feet, but keeps his eyes downfield and  avoids the rush. Look at how many passes he completes to the fullback and the  tight end. Those guys are usually not the primary receivers, so the fact that  he's completing passes to those guys tells you he's doing a good job reading  defenses.  </P> <P> "The other thing is, I was shocked how well he ran against Notre Dame. He  showed very good foot speed. I'll bet you he can do the 40 in 4.8."  </P> <P> So how good can Marinovich be?  </P> <P> "The big thing is, he has to keep some perspective about his life and all this  exposure," Haden said. "He seems to have a pretty good head about himself, but  the real challenge is if he can work as hard over the next three years as he  has over the last 10. If he does, he'll be a candidate for All-American and the  Heisman Trophy in a couple of years and he'll be the best quarterback USC ever  had."  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> As promised, Notre Dame has sent a letter from the team apologizing for its  role in the pregame brawl between the two squads 10 days ago. Coach Larry Smith  sent a return letter to Notre Dame from the USC players, supporting "the  philosophy that there is no place for this action in the game of football" and  looking forward to the continuation of the long rivalry.  </P> <P> THE RIVALRY CONTINUES  </P> <P> BRET JOHNSON  </P> <P> Rebounding from a sub-par performance against Oregon State, the El Toro grad  seemingly had things well in hand as he led UCLA to a 21-0 first quarter lead.  But, things went downhill from there with one interception leading to a  Washington score and another in the end zone blunting a Bruin drive. He  completed 18 of 27 passes for 217 yards. One of his completions went for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> SEASON STATISTICS  </P> <P> Eight-game totals  </P> <P> PASSING: 117 of 201, 10TDs, 10 INT  </P> <P> YARDS PASSING: 1,386  </P> <P> RUSHING: 29 for 40 yards, 1TD  </P> <P> </P> <P> TODD MARINOVICH  </P> <P> For the second straight game, the Capistrano Valley High product threw for more  than 300 yards as he completed 22 of 33 passess. He shredded Stanford's defense  for 303 yards, but failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time since  USC's season opener. He also was intercepted twice.  </P> <P> SEASON STATISTICS  </P> <P> Eight-game totals  </P> <P> PASSING: 159 of 256, 12 TDs, 8 INT  </P> <P> YARDS PASSING: 1,852  </P> <P> RUSHING: 43 for 11 yards, 2 TDs  </P></p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Pension age that is not supportable Sir, Bryan Freake (Letters, August 11) accuses the Confederation of British Industry of failing to appreciate the implications of current retirement patterns in its support for an equalised state pension age of 65. But there is little depth to his own vision when he argues for an equalised age of 60 which seeks to enrich pensioners in future by placing an impossible cost burden on the next generation of workers and their employers. It is true that during periods of labour-shedding recently, employers have seen early retirement as one of the more acceptable methods of reducing the workforce. But the CBI's proposal seeks a common pension age that will meet the UK's labour market needs in the second decade of the next century and beyond. Older workers will play an increasingly important role as the proportion of younger people in the labour force falls. Paying pensions as early as 55, as MSF suggests, would encourage an early retirement culture the nation could in no sense afford. In terms of cost and the imperatives of the labour market, an equalised age lower than 65 is unsupportable. It also goes against employees' own wishes to work on later in life, encouraging the very age discrimination that Mr Freake is rightly anxious to avoid.

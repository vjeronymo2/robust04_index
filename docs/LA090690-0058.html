			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE DROUGHT CONSERVATION;  </P> <P> OJAI SCHOOLS LEADING LIST OF WATER WASTERS  </P> <P> Meiners Oaks County Water District has begun fining customers who have not  reduced their water consumption, and the Ojai Unified School District drew the  largest penalty, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The school district was billed $173 for using 943% more water at Meiners Oaks  Elementary School from July 19 to Aug. 19 than it did in the same period last  year, said Ron Singleton, water district general manager. In addition, the  school district was fined $191 on the July bill for overuse although other  customers were not fined at that time. "They were so blatantly overusing, we  couldn't let them get away with it," he said.  </P> <P> The water company billed 349 of its 1,200 customers who have not voluntarily  reduced water consumption by 20% as they were asked to earlier this year, he  said.  </P> <P> "We didn't seem to be getting through to the people," Singleton said. "The  usage increased last month so we decided to implement the charge to make people  more aware they need to get with the program."  </P> <P> The fines for August range from 19 cents to $173, Singleton said. They  represent a 25% increase in the normal billing rate for any water consumption  beyond 80% of the amount used during the same period last year.  </P> <P> Assistant Supt. Leo T. Molitor said the school used more water because the  playground was reseeded and a new sprinkler system was installed to replace  lines cracked during construction of a portable classroom.  </P> <P> "I know we used an awful lot of water, but we are doing everything possible to  reduce our overall consumption by 20%," Molitor said. "We have reduced our  water use in the district by 19% over last year. However, our highest use was  at Meiners Oaks Elementary School."  </P> <P> The water company has received about 20 customer inquiries about the additional  charges, Singleton said, but most callers are also asking what they can do to  reduce their consumption.  </P> <P> The company is buying water this summer from the Casitas Municipal Water  District to supplement the firm's well water from the dwindling Ventura River  basin. Singleton said it is the first time that the company has used Lake  Casitas water in more than a decade, except during a brief stint in 1985 when a  forest fire swept into Ojai.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to be mean or vindictive," Singleton said. "We have to prove  to Casitas that we're cutting back 20%, and we're starting to get into our  heaviest cycle with big demand."  </P> <P> Water consumption all summer drains the wells, Singleton said, and because  lawns and orchards are dry, they need more water in September, he said. The  Casitas water district has asked all water companies that rely on its water to  reduce consumption by 20% but has stopped short of rationing or levying fines.  The district supplies water to 14 other water companies in Ventura and the Ojai  Valley.  </P></p>

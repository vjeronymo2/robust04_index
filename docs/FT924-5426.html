			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / People: Kwik Save picks another Australian Graeme Seabrook, the Australian retailer who has transformed discount chain Kwik Save since he took over in 1988, is stepping down as chief executive next June. As expected, he has secured the top job at Dairy Farm International, the Hong Kong-based food group which is part of the Jardine Matheson empire and which holds 25 per cent of Kwik Save. The UK food discounter is again to be headed by an Australian - to avoid confusion, also called Graeme - who has been running Franklins, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dairy Farm and Australia's biggest force in food discounting, since 1985. 'Graeme Bowler knows how to run a 'no-frills' business,' says Seabrook, 53, who points out that Franklins has been the inspiration for a lot of the changes at Kwik Save. During Bowler's time, turnover has doubled to ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.35bn) and operating profits have trebled to ADollars 90m. 'There are not that many people who really understand discount groceries. While our chairman Sir Timothy Harford did look outside the Dairy Farm group for other candidates, I asked for him and Dairy Farm was prepared to offer him,' explains the current boss. Bowler, (right) 55, who worked for Dairy Farm in Hong Kong for 12 years before returning to Australia to take up the Franklins post, is resigning his executive responsibilities at Dairy Farm when he moves in June. Seabrook, by contrast, who had joined Dairy Farm from Coles Myer where he had been joint managing director, was immediately seconded to Kwik Save, where he says he has doubled both turnover and profits and has taken the company's market share of basic groceries, by volume, to 10 per cent. He says he was promised from the beginning that he would be a candidate for the top job at Dairy Farm at the end of his stint in the UK. He remains at Kwik Save in a non-executive capacity. Seabrook replaces Owen Price, who has been joint managing director since 1990 and on the board since 1986. Price, 66, is yet another Australian retailer, who spent 27 years in that country before joining Dairy Farm in 1974. A spartan approach, Page 26</p>

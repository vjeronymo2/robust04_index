			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] At the final session of an international economic  conference in Switzerland last Sunday, President Mircea Snegur  dedicated a considerable part of his report to the peaceful,  civilized settlement of regional conflicts. He said in any  circumstances Moldova will remain true to civilized compromise  aimed at the formation of an open system of local, regional,  global, and collective security.    In Snegur's opinion the example of resolving the conflict in  East Moldova (the Dniestr [Dniester] River valley) is convincing  proof that in such situations only talks and compromise can  guarantee success. However, the president is convinced that the  effectiveness of the policy of compromise largely depends on the  stage of a conflict.    He said the aggravation of the situation in southern regions  with a predominantly Gagauzi population as well as in the east  was caused by extremely politicized declarations in which  political leaders were not always sincere or consistent.    According to Snegur, the Moldovan leadership did much to  resolve the problems of those regions by peaceful means. A  solution acceptable for both sides was found for Gagauzi  regions, he said. Snegur told the conference that the region  would be given a special legal status based on a high degree of  self-determination and the sharing of powers with the central  government. He announced that the approach was supported by the  Council of Europe, the CSCE and conformed with plans of  switching to a new system of territorial division of Moldova.    IF Note: The draft law agreed upon with the Moldovan  leadership was signed on 27 May by the president and speaker of  parliament of the Gagauzi Republic and submitted to the  president and speaker of parliament of Moldova. On 9 June it  was approved by the Gagauzi parliament and sent to the Moldovan  parliament.    On Monday, the leadership of the self-proclaimed Gagauzi  Republic accused the Moldovan government of distorting the draft  law. The Gagauzi president and speaker of parliament Stepan  Topal and Mikhail Kendigilian issued a statement saying that  contrary to the agreement a Moldovan parliamentary committee  altered the document. They called the move unilateral and  unprecedented and claimed that it could not have been made  without the knowledge and consent of President Mircea Snegur and  speaker of parliament Petre Luchinski.    The statement calls for stopping the parliamentary debate on  the distorted document and demands a meeting with the Moldovan  leadership with the mediation of the CSCE mission. Gagauzi  leaders placed the entire responsibility for the possible  worsening of relations on the Moldovan leadership.</p>

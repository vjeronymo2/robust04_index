			<p>BFN     [Text] Soil contamination with combinations of toxic  substances, such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals, often present  major problems. Low-cost biological reclamation processes are  ruled out in most cases, and all that remains are costly soil  washing or heat treatments or dumping.    Markkleeberg-based Biolipsia GmbH has developed a gentle  two-stage process for this area. In the first stage, the  adsorption agent Metasorb B is added and thoroughly mixed into  the soil material, which is ground down to grain sizes of less  than 20 mm. All the heavy metal ions present -- even chromium --  are securely bound, and after a reaction period ranging from a  few hours to a few days, hardly any bioavailable heavy metal  ions remain in the material. This process is irreversible over  a very wide pH range.  <H5>  Biological Degradation in Biobeds </H5>   In the second stage, the organic contamination can be  eliminated in biobeds. The pretreatment has bound all the heavy  metals to the extent that they have no inhibiting effect on the  enzymic activity of the bacteria that degrade the hydrocarbons.  Other nutrients required for pollutant degradation, such as  alkaline or earth-alkaline ions and phosphoric and nitrogenous  salts, are not bound by the adsorption agent.    The company has performed successful laboratory tests over  the last few weeks, where adding Metasorb in a ratio of 5 to 10  percent by volume of the soil being treated achieved degradation  rates ranging from 35 to 85 percent of the initial  concentrations after a 15-hour mixing period followed by the  degradation test -- with prefermented biomass over 24 hours.  The producer's initial findings indicate that the process is  economically viable, as the cost per tonne is only DM25 to DM80  higher than with purely microbiological processes.    If biobed treatment is prolonged sufficiently, the  hydrocarbon concentrations can be reduced to the extent that the  material can be used for reincorporation. Long-term trials in  Belgium have shown that no discharge of heavy metals into  groundwater-bearing strata need be feared.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Suburbs of Roman settlement unearthed THE INDUSTRIAL suburbs of a small Roman town, possibly Villa Faustini, have been found by archaeologists. The town, straddling the River Waveney at Scole on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, is believed to have thrived for four centuries until the Romans abandoned Britain in the early fifth century and may have had a population of 2,000. Mr Myk Flitcroft, the project leader who yesterday escorted Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, around the dig, said it offered a rare chance to examine a large area of a Roman town and could yield important information. He added that most research had focused on the big cities of Roman Britain, whereas the new find would throw light on the planning and development of a small town. The centre of the town lies beneath Scole, and the dig, on the site of the planned A140 Scole bypass, has found much of its industrial outskirts. Archaeologists have found evidence of tanning, shoe making, iron smelting, a smithy, lead moulding and what they believe was a watermill. They have found two clay-lined water tanks beside a Roman canal, with its shoring timbers intact, cut alongside the Waveney, possibly to supply the town's water. The remains include part of a metalled Roman road and some building foundations, together with metal artefacts including high-quality jewellery and coins dating from 50BC until the end of the Roman period. Two half-finished wooden bowls, preserved in waterlogged peat, are thought to be unique in Britain. They reveal that the maker chiselled out the outside but stored the blocks until he was ready to carve out the inside. The town developed from a staging post on the road between Colchester, the largest civilian city in Roman Britain, to Caistor-by-Norwich, the 'capital' of East Anglia. The 26-week dig began in June and will cover more than 30,000 square metres, about a fifth of the town.</p>
